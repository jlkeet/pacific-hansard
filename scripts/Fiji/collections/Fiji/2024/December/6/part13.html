<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have allowed for the reshuffling of the order for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the four Statements today, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Defence; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Naupoto. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  each  Member  may  speak  for  up  to  10  minutes  with  a  10-minute 
<br/>response by the honourable Minister responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech.  No 
<br/>seconder is required and there will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regularisation of Informal Settlements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for your understanding on 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>the matter, and also to my colleague, honourable Naupoto.   The 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, I rise today to speak on a critical need to regularise informal settlements, a challenge that 
<br/>has profound implications for our nation’s social and economic development, security and human 
<br/>dignity.  Housing is a fundamental human right and as leaders, we are compelled to ensure that every 
<br/>Fijian has access to safe, secure and affordable housing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the urgency of addressing informal settlements is underscored by the scale 
<br/>of the issues.  According to estimates, over 200,000 Fijians, roughly 20 percent of our population, 
<br/>live in informal settlements.  These communities are open, overcrowded, lack access to clean water, 
<br/>reliable sanitation and basic utilities, and are exposed to  high  risk of flooding  and environmental 
<br/>issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this insecure living environment contributes significantly to poverty levels, 
<br/>which remain at 29.9 percent nationally.  With urban poverty, since its rising, informal settlements 
<br/>are  also  linked  to  increased  rates  of  crime,  drug  abuse  and  social  violence.    In  recent  years,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, incidences of domestic violence and abuse against women and children have escalated 
<br/>within these communities fuelled by stress, insecurity and lack of basic requirements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  not  merely  a  housing  issue,  it  is  a  national  development  issue. 
<br/></span><span>Informal settlements presents an opportunity to rethink our housing plans and implement innovative, 
<br/>inclusive  and  sustainable  solutions  that  improve  lives  and  contribute  to  long  term  social  and 
<br/>economic stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey towards regularising informal settlements is long and full of 
<br/>challenges. Initiatives like the 2014 MOU between the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Land Trust Board and the Ministry 
<br/>of Local Government, and again renewed in 2019 with the Ministry of Housing, were intended to 
<br/>facilitate development leases, providing 99-year leases and upgrading the settlements with crucial 
<br/>infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  progress  has  been  a  bit  slow.  I  remember  there  were  38 
<br/>development leases issued to the Ministry at that point in time and I believe it has gone up to 40-plus. 
<br/>Many development leases have not been renewed and that leaves the tenants in legal limbo. Funding 
<br/></span><span>allocation for infrastructure upgrades are not fully utilised and results on the ground do not reflect 
<br/></span><span>the reported progress.  Moreover, rising rental costs in some settlements add to hardship for tenants

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  unresolved  disputes  between  landowners  and  tenants  under  the  </span><span>vakavanua</span><span>  system  which 
<br/>continues and creates more instability.  Sir, in recent weeks and months, we have been meeting the 
<br/>tenants in some of the informal settlements and this is where all these things have come up. That is 
<br/>why I thought that I will raise this in this House for the Minister responsible to look into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  had  mentioned  earlier  on,  that  after  the  consultations  with  the 
<br/>landowning  units,  development  leases  were  issued  after  the  payment  of  fare  premium  for  each 
<br/>development lease to the landowning units. The Government allocated funds to carry out the land 
<br/>subdivision with  basic infrastructure like sewerage, water, electricity, roads, driveways, footpaths 
<br/>and kerbs and channels. The good thing about this partnership was that the Government will spend 
<br/>funding to develop the landowners’ land and because of that, the landowners will benefit more.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the country’s top valuer is sitting next to me and he will understand 
<br/>when lands are subdivided to according to the standard, definitely the landlords will benefit. This 
<br/>was the understanding at that point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had various housing initiatives, like first home buyers grant, town 
<br/>wide  informal  settlement  upgrade  programme,  squatter  settlement  upgrade  programme,  city  wide 
<br/>informal  settlement  upgrade  programme,  sustainable  housing  and  income  generation  programme. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister if he could update us on all of these 
<br/>programmes that I have just mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was also noted, that many </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners tend to earn more if they 
<br/>lease their land for residential purposes rather than giving it out under the traditional v</span><span>akavanua</span><span> way. 
<br/>The  </span><span>vakavanua</span><span>  system  is  really  a  messy  affair,  Sir,  and  tenants  are  usually  at  the  mercy  of  the 
<br/>landowners.  These  are  usually  desperate  and  landless  people  who  have  no  choice  but  to  accept 
<br/>whatever conditions they are given.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to ask the honourable Minister, what is the level of work 
<br/>being  done  in  the  informal  settlements  with  active  developments  in  terms  of  survey  plans, 
<br/>topography, survey approvals, approved schemes, EIA, geo-tech, engineering plans, tender stages 
<br/>and the awaiting of contracts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another concern raised by the tenants is whether they will have to pay for 
<br/>the development, and if so, what percentage of the development cost will they need to pay.  These 
<br/>are some things coming from the tenants, and I think it is high time we should at least give some 
<br/></span><span>hope to these poor Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government’s  failure  to  renew  expired  development  leases  is  a  serious  issue.  I  have 
<br/>already raised in this House a case in Ba where the development lease has not been renewed.  Tenants 
<br/>have paid iTLTB the premium without having any infrastructure development.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>despite assurance by  the honourable Minister for Finance through the tenants  that there will be a 
<br/>solution to this matter, the tenants are still waiting, waiting and waiting and have heard nothing from 
<br/>the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  way  forward  requires  a  comprehensive  approach,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  address  the 
<br/></span><span>informal settlement.  The Government should work closely with the civil society, landowners and 
<br/>the private sector to generate an innovative housing solution, that not only provides shelter but also 
<br/>creates further sustainable communities.   Immediate policy action fast track the renewal of expired 
<br/>development  lease  to  provide  tenants  with  security,  implement  transparent  process  to  allocate  99 
<br/>years of lease and conduct audit to determine the status of the infrastructure project in settlements to 
<br/>ensure timely completion.  In the 2024-2025 Budget, around $10 million was allocated for the  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2609 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>informal settlement upgrade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question is, how much of this allocation had been utilised and what measurable outcomes 
<br/>had been achieved.  In August, the honourable Minister gave a statement that three developments 
<br/>namely  Cuvu,  Ledrusasa  and  Waidamudamu  had  been  completed.    We  would  like  to  know,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker Sir, and the tenants also want to know when the proper 99-year lease will be issued.  This is 
<br/>bigger than politics, it demands a united effort to fulfil our shared responsibility, to provide dignified 
<br/>housing for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to turn a crisis into a programme and ensure 
<br/>that no Fijian is left behind.  We started this week by congratulating you on your appointment, and 
<br/>today as we are on the verge of finishing this session as this is the last sitting of this year.  I take this 
<br/>opportunity to wish you, Sir, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Likewise, I would also like 
<br/>to wish all the honourable Members a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Before I give the floor to the Minister responsible, given the hour, we will 
<br/>proceed to the necessary suspension motion.  For the purposes of complying with Standing Orders 
<br/>with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament 
<br/>to move a suspension motion.
