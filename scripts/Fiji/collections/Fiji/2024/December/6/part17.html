<div><span>The VAT refunds for resale of imports is integrated within the overall total of VAT refunds as the 
<br/>current  system  used  by  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service  does  not  capture  these  transactions 
<br/>separately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Compared to previous years, collections from Import Duty and VAT on Imports in 2023 and 2024 
<br/>(January to October) have been strong reflecting the economic recovery following the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic and changes made to the duty and VAT rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the FY2023-2024 Budget, the previous three-tier VAT rates of 0, 9 and 15 percent was amended 
<br/>to two rates of 0 and 15 percent effective from 1 August 2023.  Government maintained zero-rated 
<br/>VAT on the existing 21 essential items with the addition of listed prescribed medicines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the major changes to the duty rates, Government had reduced fiscal and import excise 
<br/>duties on around 2,000 items to either 0 or 5 percent in FY2020-2021.  In FY2022-2023, the import 
<br/>duty on used passenger cars was increased by 5 percent.  Additionally, import VAT of 9 percent 
<br/></span><span>applicable on electric vehicles was reduced to 0 percent.  In FY2023-2024, import excise duty on 
<br/></span><span>new and used passenger motor vehicles was further increased by 5 percent.   
<br/>In  FY2023-2024,  the  Government  had  also  reduced  the  fiscal  duty  on  various  food  products 
<br/>(canned mackerel, corned mutton, corned beef &amp; beef, prawns and duck) from 32 percent to 15 
<br/>percent.  Fiscal duty on sheep/lamb meat was reduced from 5 percent to 0 percent, while fiscal duty 
<br/></span><span>on canned tomatoes was reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent.  A 3 percent fiscal duty was also

<div><span>In  FY2024-2025,  the  maximum  threshold  for  personal  imports  concession  was  reduced  from 
<br/>$2,000 to $1,000 and with a 15 percent VAT applied.  Prior to June 2020, the threshold was $400 
<br/>and  increased  to  $2,000  during  COVID-19  Budget  to  encourage  imports  for  personal  use  and 
<br/>assistance from families overseas.  A 5 percent increase in excise duty for alcohol and tobacco was 
<br/>also implemented in FY2024-2025.
