<div><span>Compensation for Unharvested Cane 
<br/>(Question No. 263/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform 
<br/>Parliament whether compensation will be provided to cane farmers for the unharvested 
<br/>cane due to the premature closure of the sugar Mills? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will respond to the question raised by honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pillay and thank him for his concern for the sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all understand the challenges in the Sugarcane Industry, especially the 
<br/></span><span>issues faced by the farmers and the sugar industry.  In the 2024 season, cane production dropped to 
<br/></span><span>1.33 million tonnes, largely due to the prolonged drought faced by the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me first explain how the opening and closing of the crushing dates are 
<br/>determined by the Sugar Industry Tribunal.  The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) made submission to 
<br/>the Sugar Industry Tribunal for the opening and closing dates of the mill.  This is done both on the 
<br/>mill’s operational throughput and estimated crop on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon receiving the submission from FSC, the Sugar Industry Tribunal consulted the Sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cane Growers Council to determine the dates of the opening and the closing of the mill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon the agreement by the Sugar Cane Growers Council and the FSC, the 
<br/>opening and closing dates are then determined and announced by the Sugar Industry Tribunal as an 
<br/>order in accordance with the Master Award. In most cases, the dates are in favour of the farmers, to 
<br/>ensure they are fully prepared to commence with cane harvesting and the end of harvesting.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  information  of  this  august  Parliament,  none  of  the  mills  closed 
<br/>prematurely in 2024 harvesting season. But all the three extended the crushing length despite having 
<br/>low cane supply. The Lautoka Mill was ordered to terminate crushing on 7</span><span>th</span><span> of October and it closed 
<br/>on 8</span><span>th</span><span> October.  So, Rarawai Mill was supposed to stop crushing on 15</span><span>th</span><span> October, it closed on 17</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>October.  While  Labasa  may  continue  crushing  until  11</span><span>th</span><span>  November,  instead  of  terminating  the 
<br/>crushing on 6</span><span>th</span><span> November.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the farmers are entirely responsible to secure cane cutters both the 
<br/>sugarcane growers and FSC normally go out of their way to mobilise mechanical harvesters, and 
<br/>cane cutters for those farmers that do not have cutters. FSC and Sugar Cane Growers Council have 
<br/>gone to villages as far as the interior of Namosi and Tailevu Provinces, to name a few, to search for 
<br/>cane  cutters.  Assisted  the  farmers  with  transportation  to  carry  cane  cutters  around  and  make 
<br/>arrangements for lorries to ensure maximum cane is harvested before the cane crushing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only to help Sugar Cane Growers Council and FSC, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of 
<br/>Sugar Industry also gets involved each year to assist farmers in the minimal harvesting. The Ministry 
<br/>spending $320,000 on average annually to pay the engaging of inmates to help in the cane harvesting. 
<br/>About  10  cane  gangs  were  assisted  annually  with  an  average  of  12  to  14  inmates  per  gang.  The 
<br/>inmates are able to harvest over 10,000 tonnes of cane annually.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of the Ministry bares, including the hiring of vehicles, wages and 
<br/>necessary cost for drivers and other utilities while farmers should pay for the harvesting costs. To 
<br/>engage inmates, the Ministry has been signing MOUs with the Fiji Corrections Service each year. 
<br/>We are thankful to both Fiji Corrections Service and Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport who 
<br/>are also involved in the logistics during cane harvesting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years with the support of the Ministry of Sugar, 40 percent of the 
<br/>cane is harvested mechanically, some 100 mechanical harvesters are in use. However, 60 percent of 
<br/>the cane is still manually harvested and the challenge for farmers is securing cane cutters on time, 
<br/>plus a total of 5,402 cane cutters were engaged to manually harvest cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be making all efforts to identify harvesters for hilly terrains. However, 
<br/>there is none identified so far that will suit our hilly terrains and soil structure. But I will not stop 
<br/>searching until I find something for manual harvesting farmers.  Meanwhile, I sincerely thank our 
<br/>proactive farmers that have gone the extra mile and started redesigning the field structure to allow 
<br/>current harvesters for harvest at least up to 15 degrees terrain. This way we can increase mechanically 
<br/></span><span>harvested cane.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, more than enough time was given to farmers to harvest their 
<br/>cane and enough support is provided by the stakeholders. The mill operation could not extend any 
<br/>longer as FSC was bearing very heavy operational costs with start stop of the factories. This is no 
<br/>compensation as such that can be given to farmers for the left-over cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total stand over cane for this year is only 8,000 tonnes. As compared to 
<br/>last year, it was 28,000 tonnes. This was a significant decline in stand over cane.  This is also possible 
<br/></span><span>due to the favourable cane price where farmers made all efforts to harvest their cane. I want to see 
<br/></span><span>the continuation of the same spirit of the farmers, Sugar Cane Growers Council and FSC to take the 
<br/>industry to another level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  on one side the Ministry of Sugar encourages farmers 
<br/>to plant more sugarcane and the assurance in this Parliament given by the honourable Minister, that 
<br/>all cane will be harvested and the early closure has left a lot of farms where the cane is still standing. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2429 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister provide details on the extent of the impact caused by the early closure 
<br/>of the cane mills, on the farmers and on the sugar industry as a whole?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned that there are only 8,000 tonnes 
<br/>of cane standover, as compared to 28,000 last year. We were trying to extend the mill crushing, but 
<br/>FSC’s reasons are that it is very expensive to run sugar mills and therefore with the consultation of 
<br/>the tribunal they had ceased the operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- My supplementary question is in his response, honourable Minister 
<br/>for Sugar stated that there was a significant decline in the tonnes of sugarcane produce this year. 
<br/>Previously, if there was a decline, Government was blamed. This time around he is blaming drought 
<br/>season. Can the honourable Minister explain his failure as to why there was a decline in the sugarcane 
<br/>production?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Maharaj… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Tell them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  …should  read  magazines  and  gazettes.  The  total  decline  of  sugar 
<br/>throughout the world, yes! The decline is purely because of drought.  It is God’s creation. It is not 
<br/>my creation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the honourable Minister, has confirmed that due 
<br/>to drought there was a decline. So, there can be any consideration in giving assistance to the farmers 
<br/>because of the drought, because they are suffered. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yes,  we  have  put  18  different  programmes  for  the 
<br/>farmers and we are asking the farmers to come forward and take advantage of this so that we can 
<br/>increase the production next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am glad, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister said that he 
<br/></span><span>will help the farmers. Will the assistance to the farmers cover the amount of money that they would 
<br/>have got if all those 8,000 tonnes were actually harvested? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think if you look at the trend of the last 16 years 
<br/>of the last Government, there has always been a stand-over. And so, at least we have improved from 
<br/>28,000. I am answering! What was the question by the way? Oh, compensation? Well, 8,000 if you 
<br/>multiply by $100 it comes to $80,000, right? And, of course, I think the farmers have understood that 
<br/>we have tried our best and when the season starts next year, they will be the first ones to get their 
<br/></span><span>cane harvested. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to withdraw from asking Question 
<br/>284/2024.  The reason  being this matter was thoroughly discussed by the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Women, Children and Social Protection yesterday when responding to Question No. 273/2024.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am sorry because I got distracted by one of the honourable Members here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the yellow card is going to come out in a minute. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Outsourcing Passport Services 
<br/>(Question No. 285/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and 
<br/>Fiji Police Force update Parliament on the status of outsourcing passport services for our 
<br/>overseas diaspora in New Zealand and Australia? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to that question. I start by saying 
<br/>that on February 14</span><span>th</span><span> this year, Cabinet had approved the outsourcing overseas passport services to 
<br/>enhance  efficiency  through  a  professional  service  provider.  The  outsourcing  of  immigration 
<br/>administrative services will be implemented through pilot projects in two countries in Australia first, 
<br/>with Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney and another in Fiji, in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this initiative is to enhance our services to our Fijian diaspora 
<br/>communities in selected locations, and Fijians, particularly relatives who want to join their families 
<br/>who are abroad on those work programmes. Therefore, we will be piloting this project in Australia 
<br/>and Fiji. The initiative will eliminate the need to travel all the way to Canberra or to Sydney for our 
<br/>Fijians  in  Australia  undertaking  passport  biometrics  which  will  significantly  reduce  travel  and 
<br/>accommodation  costs.  Passports  can  be  lodged  or  collected  at  enrolment  centres  in  Brisbane, 
<br/>Melbourne,  Sydney  and  Perth,  or  mailed  directly  to  the  applicant’s  home  on  completion  of 
<br/>processing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon successful completion of phase one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, passport administrative services 
<br/>will also be outsourced to the United Kingdom to provide us the service providers in United States, 
<br/>New  Zealand  and  Canada  and  other  regions.  Cabinet  decision  of  Cabinet  Paper  No.  46  of  2024 
<br/>stipulates that any necessary legislative changes for outsourcing, including fee adjustments, will be 
<br/>finalised with the Office of the Solicitor-General and presented to Cabinet for a review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  solicited  and  received  some  responses  from  our  diplomats  abroad  and  also  our  overseas 
<br/></span><span>missions. The Department of Fiji Immigration, Sir, had been advised by the Office of the Solicitor-
<br/>General to seek public consultation on appropriate administrative fees for passport services through 
<br/>written submission and will also conduct a comparative analysis of other countries services costs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public consultations were conducted through notices in  the print media, inviting  feedback 
<br/>from individuals, groups and communities. The notice was also shared on the Fiji High Commission 
<br/>website for responses from Fijian diaspora in Australia.  The local community had four weeks to 
<br/>respond,  while  the  diaspora  had  two  weeks.  The  newly  proposed  administrative  fee  structure  for 
<br/></span><span>Australia and Fiji will be presented at the upcoming Cabinet meeting for a decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me elaborate briefly on the security measures that the Department of 
<br/>Immigration will be adopting through the new initiative. The outsourcing process incorporates robust 
<br/>security protocols to maintain the integrity of passport issuance in all the sites. We had an unfortunate 
<br/>note from the United States warning Fiji of our status in the record of world countries on the issue of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2431 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  subject  of  people  trafficking.  We  are  pretty  low  on  the  scale,  but  if  we  do  not  look  after  our 
<br/>processes well, we could drop to Tier 3.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Biometric  authentication  -  applicants  provide  biometric  data,  fingerprints,  photos,  et 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cetera, to verify their identity to minimising the risk of fraud. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Encryption  and  secured  transmission  -  all  personal  data  is  encrypted  and  securely 
<br/>transmitted to Government systems preventing unauthorised access or alterations.   
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Rigorous vetting processes - third party entities handle administrative tasks only. The 
<br/>department  will  make  the  final  approval,  ensuring  all  applications  meet  legal  and 
<br/>security standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Regular audits and monitoring - continuous monitoring, random audits and compliance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>checks ensure adherence to strict security protocols.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the honourable Members may be wondering how much this new 
<br/>initiative will cost the Government. The outsourcing arrangement is cost neutral for the Government, 
<br/>with all expenses covered by the applicants through a fee structure. Processing fee, applicants pay 
<br/>approximately  AU$144,  plus  10  percent  GST,  covering  the  operational  costs  of  the  third-party 
<br/>provider. No direct  Government  expenditure, since the applicants  bear the costs, the Government 
<br/>incurs no additional expenses ensuring efficient use of resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  outsourcing  model,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  enhances  cost  efficiency  and  service  quality 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Reduce processing times - applications can be processed in an as little as three days 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compared to the previous five days standard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Resource  optimisation  -  administered  tasks  delegated  to  third  party  entity  allowing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>immigration officers to focus on critical decision making and complex cases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Enhance  accessibility  -  the  global  reach  of  the  third  party  provider  ensures  broader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>access, benefitting customers in rural and remote areas. 
<br/>Improve customer experience - automation and centralisation of streamline processes, 
<br/>delivering faster and smoother services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  approach  aligns  with  international  trends  in  modernising 
<br/>immigration  services  through  technology  and  centralised  processing.  The  cost-neutral  framework 
<br/>enables the Government to maintain high service levels without additional financial strain, ensuring 
<br/>long  term  sustainability.  The  outsourcing  model  strengthens  security,  enhances  efficiency  and 
<br/></span><span>delivers cost effective services while maintaining the integrity of immigration process and avoiding 
<br/></span><span>additional costs for Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration for his 
<br/>response. Before I open the floor for supplementary questions, honourable Members, please join me 
<br/>in welcoming in the gallery, the students and teachers of Wainiyavu Primary School in Namosi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bula vinaka!</span><span> You are most welcome to your Parliament and observe its proceedings. Now, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shall we move on to supplementary questions. I recognise the honourable Leader of Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Prime Minister, it is a good initiative, but it comes 
<br/>with a lot of risks as well and you have highlighted about the security aspects. My question to the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, Sir, this is the experience of most countries that are into these online 
<br/>applications, it is the involvement of the agents in the process. We know that biometrics is critical so 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the applicants can go through the thorough scrutiny process but one of the key issues that I have 
<br/>collected from most of the countries using this, is the involvement of agents. So, how is this being 
<br/>considered, given the path that we want to undertake? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process that we have put in place will include 
<br/>scrutinising of the various types and the agents that are going to be employed. We have to be very 
<br/>careful, will be guided by our agents on the ground and also the government and service providers 
<br/>left vetting approvals from them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investigation of Reckless Driving Posted on Social Media 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 286/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and 
<br/>Fiji Police Force inform Parliament whether the Police investigates cases of reckless and 
<br/>dangerous driving posted on social media? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Pio Tikoduadua had seen the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order Paper and realised that there were three questions coming  up and asked to stand aside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by honourable Naupoto.  I will begin 
<br/>by addressing the legal framework that emphasised this matter.  Reckless and dangerous driving is 
<br/>not merely a traffic violation, it is a grave concern and endangers the lives of our road users. The 
<br/>issue is governed under our local traffic laws, especially the Land Transport Authority laws, Crimes 
<br/>Act of 2009 which provide the robust legal framework for addressing such behaviour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there is an increasing recognition of social media to expose illegal 
<br/>activities, including traffic offences globally, we must acknowledge the reality of our context here in 
<br/>Fiji.  Sir, our law enforcement systems are steadfast and committed, they are not as institutionalised 
<br/>or technologically advanced as those larger nations when it comes to social media users in illegal 
<br/>activities exposure.  That, however, is not a reflection of neglect but of unique challenges that we 
<br/>face as a small island developing nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me make one point clear, our law enforcement agencies, including the 
<br/>Fiji  Police  Force  and  Land  Transport  Authority  do  not  turn  a  blind  eye  to  such  matters.    On  the 
<br/>contrary, they remain vigilant and are determined to uphold the rule law. What differentiates us is 
<br/>not our commitment, but rather the merits and the processes through which investigations are carried 
<br/>out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Police Force only investigates reported cases.  Therefore, any case of reckless and 
<br/>dangerous driving posted on social media will only be investigated if it is reported by a member of 
<br/></span><span>the public to the police force. For instance, the use of social media as evidence in reckless driving 
<br/></span><span>cases is a growing area of focus. Videos or images posted online often provide valuable leads and 
<br/>our police do monitor such platforms.  However, investigations in Fiji require a careful and thorough 
<br/>approach to ensure that any evidence used in court meets legal standards of authenticity, reliability 
<br/>and relevance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2433 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For investigations to commence, there needs to be a complainant who should lodge an official 
<br/>complaint and the following needs to be established: the date of the offence, time of the offence, 
<br/>place  of  the  offence,  witness  or  witnesses  and  video  footages.    Once  those  are  established,  an 
<br/>investigation is carried out whereby the alleged suspect is arrested and brought to the police station, 
<br/>charged and summoned to attend court. The court requires evidence and police are obligated to get 
<br/>those and have the responsibility to ensure that a thorough investigation is carried out, and concrete 
<br/>evidence is established for charging and producing anyone in the court of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is true that countries such as the United Kingdom, United States of 
<br/>America, Canada and Australia actively investigate cases on reckless and dangerous driving when 
<br/>evidence is posted on social media, even with their advanced resources, any information technology, 
<br/>personnel  and  technological  infrastructure,  they  continue  to  grapple  the  significant  challenges 
<br/>including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>determining authenticity of whether the footages are genuine and unedited; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>establishing the context of when and where the incident occurred; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>providing or proving the identity of the individuals responsible for the act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these examples highlight that no system is without its difficulties, and this 
<br/>is a shared challenge amongst nations globally.  However, what sets successful enforcement apart is 
<br/>the active collaboration between the authority and the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge all Fijians to work hand in  hand with our law 
<br/>enforcement agencies. If you witness acts of reckless driving, do not just put them on social media, 
<br/>report promptly through the appropriate channels. Together, we can ensure safer roads and hold those 
<br/>who would endanger others accountable for their actions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you honourable Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can note 
<br/>that $34.85 million has been paid by ACCF in all these number of years and majority of them were 
<br/>motor vehicle payout  accidents. A question to  the honourable Prime Minister, there was a  recent 
<br/>video circulated of a young boy driving a car with his hands off the wheel and had a girl sitting on 
<br/>his lap and if anything has been done by the police in this incident - licence suspended?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  part  to  that  honourable  Prime  Minister  is  a  suggestion,  where  we  can  use  the 
<br/>population to work for us in combating road accidents with the latest victim of being a 16-year-old, 
<br/>and  the  suggestion  is  if  a  department  within  LTA  or  the  police  can  be  set  up,  people  who  have 
<br/></span><span>dashcams report illegal driving, dangerous driving directly to LTA and they who do, get incentivised 
<br/></span><span>because they feel that they can be part of something and then these are taken up and the LTA and the 
<br/>police can look into these matters of reckless driving.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we lost a 16-year-old boy 
<br/>on our roads recently, so just the two parts of the question, honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  immediate  past,  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/>responsible  for  Police  has  assured  me  that  the  report  has  been  made  to  the  Police  and  they  are 
<br/>investigating. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to reckless driving, we do not appreciate 
<br/></span><span>drivers driving irresponsibly on our roads, but  there  has been some cases where the police while 
<br/>investigating these matters, they are harassing every single car enthusiast on our roads, especially 
<br/>along Nasese and My Suva Park.  I raised this a lot of times, but can you assure us and the people

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who  are  watching  that  the  police  will  not  harass  every  single  driver  on  the  road  with  respect  to 
<br/>reckless driving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Lal, I rule that question out of order.  It is not an observation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to a subject matter under consideration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>comprehensive answers. However, what we were expecting to hear, the Department needs to make a 
<br/>policy change so that what the honourable Sharma had just mentioned about dashcams and also where 
<br/>we can use live video to victimise or charge the complainant.  Is the department thinking of changing 
<br/>the policy on such matters?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- They wish clarification, honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not quite technically up-to-date as you are 
<br/>with  gadgets  that  people  put  to  their  cars  but  yes.    Whatever  is  brought  to  the  Police,  they  will 
<br/>investigate and use those in the collaboration of evidence and building up of the case before they go 
<br/>to Prosecution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  We are drawing closer to the end of sitting period this afternoon and for 
<br/>the purpose of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
