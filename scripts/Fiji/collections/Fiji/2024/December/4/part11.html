<h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3>
<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order – Honourable Jone Usamate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members,  I have a ruling on the Point  of Order by honourable Jone Usamate 
<br/>yesterday. I will now rule on that Point of Order raised by the honourable Member on Tuesday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>December, 2024.  On the issue of concern, whereby he raised that before the ruling was delivered on 
<br/>the Point of Order by honourable Alvick Maharaj, the honourable Minister for Women, Children and 
<br/>Social Protection was given the floor to speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have taken the time to carefully peruse the Uncorrected  </span><span>Hansard </span><span>Report</span><span> </span><span>of Monday, 2</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/>December, 2024, and I can confirm that I had given the floor to honourable Maharaj for his Point of 
<br/>Order and immediately after that, I gave the floor to the honourable Minister for Women, Children 
<br/>and Social Protection to speak.  I can also confirm that after the honourable Minister for Women, 
<br/>Child and Social Protection had spoken, I proceeded to deliver my ruling on the Point of Order by 
<br/>honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Standing Order 74(3) and (4) are very clear.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause (3) provides, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When a point of order has been stated, the member who raises it resumes his or 
<br/>her seat and no member, except with the Speaker’s permission, may rise until the Speaker 
<br/>has decided the matter.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause (4) provides, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Speaker may rule on a point of order when it is raised without allowing any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussion except from a member permitted by the Speaker.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, it is very clear to me as the Chair that Clause 4 overalls stands over 
<br/>Clause 3 permission, that in fact, the Speaker has the right to permit any Member before he makes a 
<br/>ruling on the Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I want to assure the honourable Jone Usamate and all the honourable 
<br/>Members that there was no breach of procedures nor any deviation from the accepted practices as 
<br/></span><span>clearly outlined in Standing Order 74(3) and (4) - no Member except with the Speaker’s permission 
<br/></span><span>may rise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, I hereby rule that the Point of Order raised by honourable Jone Usamate in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>yesterday’s proceedings is out of order and the matter shall rest there.   
<br/></span></div>
