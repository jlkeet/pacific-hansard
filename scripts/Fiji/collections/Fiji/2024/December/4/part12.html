<div><span>providing greater and easier access to compensation on a no-fault basis for serious injuries and deaths 
<br/>arising out of motor vehicles.  The no-fault basis of compensation also extends to injuries and deaths 
<br/>as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, and accidents occurring on 
<br/>school premises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee during its public hearing on 19</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2024 was informed that since 
<br/>June 2024, the ACCF board decided to transfer all employment and school accident cases back to 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Employment,  Productivity  and  Workplace  Relations  (MEPWR).    This  Report 
<br/>contains five recommendations for consideration by relevant authorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is grateful and commends the ACCF for the forthright discussions held with 
<br/>the Committee during their public submission and we wish them well for the very important work 
<br/>that they do. I thank the members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and 
<br/>the secretariat for compiling this bipartisan Report.

<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and 
<br/>Defence  hereby  submit  to  Parliament  the  Consolidated  Review  Report    of  the  Ministry  of  Civil 
<br/></span><span>Service from 2019 to 2021 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Civil Service’s primary responsibility is to provide guidance for consistent 
<br/>implementation of the central regulations, governing hiring, evaluations, promotion, compensation, 
<br/>training and discipline of public of employees in line with Government’s guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To improve the overall standard of performance in the civil service, the Ministry provides 
<br/>various trainings and career development opportunities that are open to all civil servants, including 
<br/>courses on leadership, governance, project management and human resources.  This reporting period, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, was greatly influenced by the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my gratitude to the Permanent Secretary, Mr. Parmesh Chand and his staff 
<br/>for their very timely assistance in the request for information that we had asked them to provide when 
<br/>we  were  conducting  this  inquiry.    I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Members  of  the  Standing

<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence,  I  submit  this  report  to 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5) I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion,  without notice,  that a debate on the content of the Report is  initiated at  a 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  I  am 
<br/>pleased to present the Standing Committee on Public Accounts Report to Parliament.  This Report 
<br/>provides the results of the Committee’s scrutiny process and the proposed amendments to the Audit 
<br/>Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17 of 2024).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, I wish to thank the previous Speaker for giving the Committee the opportunity to look 
<br/>at the Bill.  We normally look at accounts, dollars and cents and this opportunity opened our eyes 
<br/>and challenged us as well.  We look forward to other opportunities and I wish to mention that the 
<br/>Committee Members are now considering doing legal courses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  objective  of  the  Audit  Bill  2024  is  to  repeal  the  Audit  Act  of  1969  and  provide  for 
<br/>standardised provisions in line with international standards and best practices.  Also, the Bill is in 
<br/>line with the establishments and functions of the Office of the Auditor-General as mandated under 
<br/>Sections 151 and 152 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Audit  Act  1969  also  provides  the  legal  framework  for  the  duties  and  powers  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General and the principal objectives of the Act are to provide for the salaries, duties and 
<br/></span><span>powers of the Auditor-General and the auditing of public accounts and other related purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, historically this exercise to review of Audit Act of 1969 began in 2018 but 
<br/>was not able to be finalised. This review is one of the public Financial Management Reform Policy 
<br/>Action that was recommended under Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment 
<br/>(PEFA).    In  2023,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and 
<br/>Statistics with the Office of the Auditor-General undertook a comprehensive review of the Act and 
<br/>conducted  wide  consultations  with  stakeholders.    The  changes  were  also  needed  in  line  with  the 
<br/>Pacific  Association  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (PASAI)  and  International  Organization  of 
<br/></span><span>Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) audit requirement standards, hence this Audit Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  examined  the  Bill  in  a  tactical  manner  in  which  all  the 
<br/>stakeholders  were  informed  and  given  the  opportunity  to  provide  submissions  on  the  Bill. 
<br/>Advertisements were published more than once in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> and through the Parliament website 
<br/>and </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page with invitation letters. It was sent also to the relevant Government departments 
<br/>and stakeholders to provide submissions. The Committee had conducted consultations around key

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2395 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>locations  in  Fiji  including,  Vanua  Levu  and  Viti  Levu.  Further  to  that  the  Committee  had  also 
<br/>conducted public hearings within the Parliament precinct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formulation of the report was possible through the information gathered 
<br/>from stakeholders’ consultations, including the Committee’s session with the Office of the Auditor 
<br/>General and Solicitor General’s office. The four-week exercise and the information gathered really 
<br/>assisted the Committee in its decision of the necessary amendments that need to be in the Audit Bill. 
<br/>In comparison to other audit entities especially in PASAI and INTOSAI member countries, where 
<br/>our office is a member of, we are happy to say that all the audit requirements will be met, except 
<br/>financial independence and referrals to the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  is  not  ready  or  cannot  be 
<br/>financially independent in a short period of time. However, plans are in place under PEFA which is 
<br/>currently doing an assessment to have this looked into and adjusted within the next three years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, the Committee wishes to thank all the stakeholders who 
<br/>participated and contributed to the consultation process on this Bill in which relevant information 
<br/>was  collected  which  assisted  the  Committee  to  formulate  this  bipartisan  report  and  make  the 
<br/>necessary amendments to the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to also thank the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Public Accounts Standing Committee for their input into the production of this bipartisan report. My 
<br/>Committee  colleagues,  honourable  Sakiusa  Tubuna  the  Deputy  Chairperson,  honourable  Jovesa 
<br/>Vocea,  honourable  Alvick  Maharaj  and  honourable  Naisa  Tuinaceva.  I  also  wish  to  thank  the 
<br/>alternate members of the Committee who took part in the deliberations and consultations namely, 
<br/>honourable Taito Rokomatu and honourable Penioni Ravunawa who stood in as alternate members 
<br/>pursuant to Standing Order 111(5).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank the hardworking Secretariat, the drafters at the Office of the Solicitor 
<br/>General, the Ministry of Finance and staff of the Office of the Auditor-General for the finalisation of 
<br/>the  Bill.  With  those  few  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  this  Report  to  Parliament  with  a 
<br/>proposed amendment to the Audit Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(1)  and  Standing 
<br/></span><span>Order 86, the Standing Committee has now tabled its report accordingly and the Bill is now set for 
<br/></span><span>Consideration by the Committee of the Whole Parliament on a future sitting date.
