<div><span>FIJI TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION BILL  2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on 
<br/></span><span>Monday, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  Fiji  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  Bill  2024  be  debated,  voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and do pass.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to    speak  on  this  Bill  which  is  before 
<br/></span><span>Parliament for debate, voting and passing pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 2</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/></span><span>December, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, may I express my thanks and appreciation to honourable Members from both 
<br/>sides of the House who supported the motion to bring this Bill, being the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Bill  2024  to  the  stage.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  Steering  Committee  which  was  set  up  to 
<br/>undertake the preparatory work pertaining to this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2447 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee comprised the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection as Chair, and members being the honourable Assistant Minister in the 
<br/>Office of the Prime Minister, honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, honourable Assistant 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei Affairs and the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the compilation of the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in drafting the Bill, the Committee had many 
<br/>consultations with  victims and perpetrators of different political  events.   Consultations were held 
<br/>with civil society, faith-based groups, human rights activists, media organisations, political parties 
<br/>and communities in the Northern, Western and Central Divisions. There were also engagements with 
<br/>the youth groups, as well as the diaspora through digital platform. The basic elements of the Bill are 
<br/>drawn  from  the  Commissions  of  Inquiry  Act  1946,  and  the  Committee  also  learned  from  global 
<br/>experiences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  with  deep  appreciation  the  excellent  work  which  the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji Military Forces, under the visionary leadership of the Commander, Major General 
<br/>Ro Jone Kalouniwai, had done and they have done in inculcating the virtues of truth, reconciliation 
<br/>and healing in the institution.  As a result, we are seeing and feeling an atmosphere of togetherness, 
<br/>perseverance and hope, which will contribute immensely to achieving the desired impact and results 
<br/>of lasting peace and harmony for our people and our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, around the world, more than 50 countries at some point, 
<br/>established Truth and Reconciliation Commissions. One of the major purposes of this initiative was 
<br/>to  resolve  historic  injustices  and  abuses  through  public  hearings,  truth  telling  and  reconciliation 
<br/>between victims and perpetrators, as a way of moving beyond the painful past towards a peaceful 
<br/>future.  The  many  lessons  from  those  processes  indicate  the  need  to  be  sensitive  to  the  specific 
<br/>historical,  political  and  cultural  context  rather  than  using  a  model  which  is  deemed  universal  in 
<br/>relevance  and  the  application.    So,  while  we  learn  from  the  many  lessons,  the  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission in Fiji, we have to be relevant to our own cultural and historical context. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the support of the UNDP Consultant, Mr. Reuben Karanja, from the International 
<br/>Centre for Transitional Justice in New York, there were conversations facilitated around the country.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at each of these consultations, there were strong support for the setting up of the 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission, from young and old, from rural and urban areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The central purpose of the Commission will be aimed at the promotion of reconciliation and 
<br/></span><span>forgiveness among the perpetrators and victims of various </span><span>coups</span><span> and political persecutions by the 
<br/></span><span>past Governments through full disclosure of truth in safe and enabling spaces. It is hoped that many 
<br/>who  have  suffered  gross  human  rights  violations,  and  their  families  and  communities  will  find 
<br/>healing and closure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the salient features of the proposed Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill will be known, after 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approval, as the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act of 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In clause 3, the purpose of the Bill states that it is to promote social cohesion through healing 
<br/></span><span>and reconciliation. Secondly, it is to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling regarding the 
<br/></span><span>political upheavals during the </span><span>coup </span><span>periods, and to promote closure and healing for the survivors of 
<br/>those events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part 2 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Fiji Truth Reconciliation Commission, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which will comprise of five members appointed by the President.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>2448 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the functions of the Commission and  clause 7 of the Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provides the powers of the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 9, the Bill outlines the procedures for the Commission and its hearings under the new 
<br/>legislation. The Bill provides for the term of operation for the Commission to carry out its obligations 
<br/>under the new legislation, as well as the process for hearing that the Commission may conduct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the independent and integrity of the Commission is mandated under Clause 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10, and Commissioners have to swear an oath before the President, as set out in Schedule 2.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Code  of  Conduct  is  set  out  in  clause  12,  which  requires  the  Commissioners  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>apolitical and to uphold their term in office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following that, in clause 13 are the conditions of immunity for the Commission which gives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a sense of trust, integrity and authenticity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill requires the Commission to provide support to the survivors of historical events, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well as witnesses protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 17 of the Bill requires the Commission to submit a final report to the President.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also important to note how the Commission is going to be financed, and that is from 
<br/>budgetary  provision  by  Government.  The  Commission  is  auditable  as  stipulated  under  clause  20.  
<br/>With the anticipation of knowing the outcomes of such Commissions, it is also important to manage 
<br/>them responsibly regarding funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  embark  on  this  journey  of  voicing  the  truth  and  working  on 
<br/>reconciliation, we must never forget the statement made by the late President of South Africa, Mr. 
<br/>Nelson Mandela, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In the end, reconciliation is a spiritual process, which requires more than just a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>framework.  It has to happen in the hearts and minds of people.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> or </span><span>vanua</span><span>  tradition, when one tries to reconcile, they must have the genuine 
<br/>yearning for change to forgive and also to forget.  I understand we are humans, and it is very difficult 
<br/>to forget.  This Bill provides a pathway for all to work on reconciliation, as that will allow healing 
<br/></span><span>and growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The vision of this Government is to empower the people of Fiji through unity.  Unity and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>empowerment can only manifest, if there is forgiveness, acceptance and reconciliation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the consultations and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have contributed to this Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate.    I  have  on  the 
<br/></span><span>batting list a total of 16 speakers from all three sides of the House, if there is such a definition of the 
<br/></span><span>House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>third reading of the Bill, which he had just presented on the floor of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2449 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, allow me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to acknowledge Government's commitment to promote 
<br/>national healing through the establishment of the Fiji Truth and Recognition Commission, which Bill 
<br/>No.19 seeks to establish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no denying the fact that Fiji needs this process to address the many challenges we 
<br/>had faced politically and socially as a nation in the past 37 odd years or may be even beyond that, 
<br/>and which have hindered our progress,  as a nation, and  continues to  haunt  the many individuals, 
<br/>families and communities who were negatively affected by the impacts of our badly tainted history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering the importance of this process to Fiji as a nation, what I would advocate is that 
<br/>this  exercise  must  be  approached  with  a  genuine  desire  to  uncover  truths.  The  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister has stated the words of Nelson Mandela, and I hope that our words will be consistent with 
<br/>the actions that we take.  Genuine desire to uncover truths and promote reconciliation and forgiveness 
<br/>amongst perpetrators and victims, who had suffered gross human rights violations at the height of 
<br/>our political upheavals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it my sincere desire, therefore, that Government will provide the leadership 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is necessary to see this truth and reconciliation process right to the end.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recall the words of the honourable Prime Minister when this Bill was debated in September 
<br/>2023, I thought that to me, it was a call - a call not only to try and find out not only what happened 
<br/>before 1987 and what happened before 2000, what happened before 2006, but why did it happen? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand the timings. I know that the Bill has already laid the timeline, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is 18 months, according to Part 3, Clause 14(3) which states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “The Commission must operate for 18 months after the preparatory period.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the provision for the extension as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us not be driven by political timelines only. Let us put this issue to rest and this is the 
<br/>opportunity for us to do it right, do it well, bring healing into the nation and, therefore, the processes 
<br/>that we take, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very, very critical.  We are all for reconciliation, but it is the process 
<br/>that takes us into that end stage, as alluded to in the Bill.  That is very, very critical for all of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the debate in here, we had a long chat with the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  and  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/></span><span>Enterprises and Communications, asking me about why we did not support the Bill back then.  My 
<br/>response to the honourable Deputy Minister was this, “This is not an ordinary Bill, this is a special 
<br/>Bill. Given our history, the sufferings that we went through, we really need to tread carefully.”  And 
<br/>particularly, Sir, the involvement of every stakeholder and most importantly, political parties in this 
<br/>process, because if we at the history of our problems in Fiji, politics is the root cause.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have written an article but, unfortunately, the title was not taken by the media - “The Politics 
<br/>of a Revolution”, but I will come later to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   In a revolution, politics is always 
<br/></span><span>the objective, military is the means. We need to get to the root cause of this and politics is the root 
<br/></span><span>cause.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had elections, we have had constitutions, but despite the result of elections, we still 
<br/>have  problems,  and  the  root  cause  of  those  problems  are  political,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  And  that  is 
<br/>something that is very important.  This is the time to address this, once and for all.  Let us do it right.   
<br/>Let us be genuine, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>2450 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, again, the process.  I have spoken about the timelines, I urge Government, “Let us make 
<br/>full  use  of  the  parliamentary  process  because  that  is  very,  very  important”.    When  honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu was a loyal Opposition, he always talks about the difference between consultations in the 
<br/>Executive and consultations in the legislative framework. That is exactly what we insist on this Bill, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must be involved.  This Parliament - the voice of the people must be involved.  And we 
<br/>need to be part of the process because of the involvement of politics in the past.  I have quoted Clause 
<br/>5(2), which will establish the five Commissioners.  We do not know whether we will be represented 
<br/>in that Commission or not.  And that is why we need to be more careful, involve in the development 
<br/>of this Bill before we come to the actual process itself, because in the end, we will all be answerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of 51, again, I urge Government, put aside the political timeline.  
<br/>Let us get this through the normal process of legislative work in this House.  If this can be referred 
<br/>to the Committee, well and good, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Whether it is early next year or mid next year, if 
<br/>this can be referred to the Committee, because we need this House to be involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me talk on a few critical observations about the Bill.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 
<br/>the Office of the Opposition requested the Steering Committee, together with the technical team from 
<br/>the  Fiji  Law  Reform  Commission,  to  present  to  us  the  Draft  Bill.    We  thanked  the  Steering 
<br/>Committee,  the  honourable  Tubuna  and  probably  honourable  Vocea  as  well,  who  are  part  of  the 
<br/>Steering Committee that came with the Law Reform Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have talked about the process.  Before I touch on the other minor issues in the Bill, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I did make a submission to the honourable Chairperson, dated 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024, 
<br/>based on the discussions that we had and what was presented to us about the draft. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is one worry that I have in the current Bill, as compared to the initial 
<br/>Draft that was presented to us on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September.  And that, Sir, is in Clause 7 of this Bill, as opposed 
<br/>to what was in the initial Draft.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go to Clause 7, the Commission has the following powers.  This is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>powers of the Commission, and I quote from the Bill: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1)  (a)  To examine under oath any witness; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to consider any written or oral evidence in hearings regardless of whether such 
<br/>evidence would be admissible in a civil or criminal proceeding; 
<br/>to  consider  whether  to  exclude  the  presence  of  a  member  of  the  public, 
<br/>including the media from any proceedings or meetings of the Commissioners; 
<br/>to exclude any person, if necessary, to ensure the due conduct of the hearings 
<br/>or to preserve order; and 
<br/>to engage consultants with specific expertise in an area related to the functions 
<br/>of the Commission; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)   A person who intentionally misleads or gives false information to the Commission is 
<br/></span><span>deemed  to  have  committed  contempt  of  court  and  may,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Commission, be referred to the Magistrates’ Court.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first thing that I noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the omission of what was in paragraph (a) of 
<br/>the Draft.  This is what has been omitted from this current Bill, that I have just read.  This is what 
<br/></span><span>was in the draft.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2451 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission has the following Powers: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to issue summons to witnesses in the form prescribed in Schedule 1; and 
<br/>to call for the production of books, plans and documents and to examine the witnesses and 
<br/>parties concerned on oath.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the way in which it was rearranged, the other omission was in clause 7(2) of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initial draft that states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…failure to respond to a summons issued by the Commission or failure to truly 
<br/>or faithfully answer questions of the Commission after responding to a summons, or 
<br/>intentionally  providing  misleading  or  false  information  to  the  Commission  shall  be 
<br/>deemed equivalent to a contempt of court and may, at the discretion of the Commission, 
<br/>be referred to the higher court.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will come back to that, but also the other omission related to this is, is in 
<br/>Schedule. In the initial draft, there were four Parts to the Schedule, but in this Bill, there are only two 
<br/>Parts in the Schedule. Schedule 1 of the initial draft was summons (the form) to be issued by the 
<br/>Commission if and when needed for a person to appear before the Commission to answer to any 
<br/>allegations  or  have  the  opportunity  to  defend  himself  or  herself,  and  in  brackets  (still  under 
<br/>consideration). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  I  want  to  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  this,  this  is  why  I  am  requesting  this  august 
<br/>Parliament, please, get this through the Committee, because there have been changes in the initial 
<br/>draft that has caught us by surprise, and omitted from the current Bill that we are debating before 
<br/>Parliament. So, my question is, when was this change made? Who did it?  Under whose authority? 
<br/>Why?  Because  the  powers  to  summon  is  so  important  in  the  convening  of  this  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, otherwise, there is no teeth in this Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I want to ask is, again, when was this change made?  Was the Consultant aware of this? 
<br/>Was it made by the Steering Committee? Who made the changes and why? This is a very critical part 
<br/>of  this  Bill.  When  we  talk  about  integrity,  when  we  talk  about  transparency,  genuineness  in  our 
<br/>approach, this has been taken away, and then it is coming through Standing Order 51. The credibility 
<br/>of this Bill is questionable now, because of the path that you have decided to take.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very, very critical. I know for a fact that now, we have former soldiers 
<br/>released and civilians involved in the upheavals. I want to go into it, but will they participate?  I had 
<br/>a  good  discussion  with  the  RFMF  Team,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    “You  are  doing  a  great  job  with  the 
<br/>reconciliation”, but I honestly asked them.  “The challenge for you will be, when it comes to the truth 
<br/>- the truth telling part of the reconciliation process, because as I have stated, in revolutions, military 
<br/>is the means, politics is the objective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had raised this issue when I was the Defending Officer for the CRW soldiers during the 
<br/>Court Martial way back in 2004.  I asked the Panel of Judges, “Please, release the soldiers. Let us 
<br/>find the politicians who were behind these soldiers because of the objectives of revolutions.”  Then 
<br/>we  must  do  this  truth  and  reconciliation  well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  we  need  to  identify  the 
<br/>politicians.  They must come to the truth telling. We must identify the businesspeople who supported 
<br/>the </span><span>coup</span><span> perpetrators or </span><span>coup</span><span> instigators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chiefs  were  involved,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  religious  leaders  were  involved,  so  without  the 
<br/>summoning power, we are weakening this process and it is already questionable. We are for a Truth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>2452 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Reconciliation, but let us get it right, let us do it well. There is nothing to hide, it is about Fiji, it 
<br/>is not about politics. It is about Fiji in the years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not go into other details because other speakers from this side will 
<br/>probably highlight on some of the components of the Bill, but I am pleading to Government, we need 
<br/>the reconciliation process, but let us do it right. This Parliament must be involved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the events of 2006, there was a committee.  Probably that would be a 
<br/>better approach, so that  we involve everyone.  Not  all political  parties are in  this Parliament, but 
<br/>politics plays a critical role and even the political parties that are in this Parliament are not involved.  
<br/>So, if you can answer those questions for me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is something that I look forward 
<br/>to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I just conclude by saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as I have alluded to, the Bill in its current 
<br/>state and, of course, with the resources allocated to it, to some degree, lacks the power and the legal 
<br/>authority to carry out its functions effectively and efficiently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I have talked about the Bill, the process and the  end state. Linking the objective of 
<br/>the exercise to the final outcome of the process is critical in this whole initiative and without which, 
<br/>this whole exercise will be done with futile ambitions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Given the time, I would like to give opportunity for honourable Naivalurua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to also participate for his intervention before we adjourn for dinner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, a bill of historic proportion for our nation 
<br/>and  this  generation  is  presented  before  this  august  Parliament  for  debate.  This  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024, contains immense gravity and opportunity. While we cannot 
<br/>rewrite our history, we can reconcile, heal and learn from the past. This Bill provides the framework 
<br/>for action, establishing the Commission to achieve the reconciliation, healing and learning essential 
<br/>to our future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for taking the initiative to lead our 
<br/>nation on a journey of truth and reconciliation. I acknowledge the boldness required to call for this. 
<br/>In doing so, the honourable Prime Minister has provided a clear call to what now defines our future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge and thank the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/></span><span>for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  for  shouldering  the  responsibility  of  listening, 
<br/></span><span>engaging and shaping the National Reconciliation Framework for that has become the current Bill 
<br/>before us today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have read the document and considered the Commission’s purpose and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intent, there are essential aspects to consider and debate before this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission will be led by five Commissioners, appointed to undertake 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the critical work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scope of this Bill is a serious task and a heavy burden. Added that the 
<br/>heavy burden and responsibility is a short time frame for this Commission to undertake its task. These 
<br/>two issues alone will place high demands on the leadership capacity of the Commissioners with their 
<br/>presence needed across multiple hearings and sittings.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2453 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this serious undertaking must be completed on time. While I respect the 
<br/>time constraints, I am also aware of what is being encouraged to come out of the shadows, so that 
<br/>our national healing can begin.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I foresee that future considerations may need to be 
<br/>given to the honourable Minister responsible to return to this Parliament seeking further provisions 
<br/>if need be.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I state this because this is the work of the heart, our nations heart. Finding 
<br/>the heartbeat and providing permission for the public to have a voice and be heard, this is sacred 
<br/>work and a sacred privilege.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  note  that  Clause  8  speaks  to  the  Government's  cooperation  with  the 
<br/>Commission.  While  I  do  not  underestimate  the  goodwill  this  process  will  generate  among  our 
<br/>communities, the clause states the following, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…The  Government  and  its  agencies  of  the  State  must  cooperate  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission to assist with its functions under this Act.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  urge  this  Parliament  and  the  honourable  Government  Ministers  responsible  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>departments and agencies to prioritise the departments cooperation for the nation’s work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 of the Bill states the purpose of establishing the Commission, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I quote: “…To promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The benefits of social cohesion cannot be understated. Importantly, social cohesion builds on 
<br/>human dignity, a critical resource to nation building. Time does not allow me to go into any length 
<br/>of the benefits that flow from a people who are knitted together with social cohesion, other than to 
<br/>commend the honourable Minister for bringing such depth to the clear and simple purpose of this 
<br/>Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces for his 
<br/>bold step and firm courage to initiate the truth and reconciliation process among our Armed Forces. 
<br/>I was invited to participate in this process and in doing so, I witnessed first-hand the impact of this 
<br/>social cohesion and its effect on human dignity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, this Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill provides the gifts of truth 
<br/>and forgiveness, as well as the grace of reconciliation, which are essential for justice and mercy to 
<br/>achieve their true end, our restoration, our cohesion and our future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every nation carries its history both commendable and regrettable. In this 
<br/>Bill, I see the steps and the opportunity of a reset of our national consciousness to become defined 
<br/>by what we can achieve together and pave the way for our future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I and my Bloc support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, our next speaker would be the Assistant Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Women, Children and Social Protection, but that will await our recess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  at  this  point  in  time,  we  will  suspend  the  proceedings  for  dinner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will resume proceedings in 45 minutes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 7.16 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON S.  KIRAN.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable  Prime Minister, Deputy  Prime Ministers, 
<br/>Opposition Leader, Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Members of this august Parliament and people of 
<br/>our beloved Nation. I rise in support of the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me first clarify LOPs regarding the draft, yes from submissions, the draft had amendments 
<br/>based  on  submissions  and  finalised.  Regarding  your  concern  on  provision  for  summoning  of 
<br/>witnesses. The power to summon means following through and prosecuting, that has been allowed 
<br/>for in Clause 9 on Procedure. The Commission must regulate its own procedures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>you  very  well  know  that  the  High  Court  sets  its  own  procedures,  this  provision  allows  the 
<br/>Commission  to  make  provisions  for  summons,  its  processes  and  procedures  and  they  can  claim 
<br/>awareness around that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  say  I  am  very  grateful  to  the  honourable  Prime Minister  and  the 
<br/>Cabinet  for  placing  trust  in  us,  the  Committee  that  was  established  to  undertake  the  work  of 
<br/>consultation  and  developing  the  legal  framework  for  the  establishment  of  the  Fiji  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission. A process that gave us an insight on where we are as a nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look like a happy nation, but when we created safe spaces to engage, we realised how 
<br/>deeply  divided  and wounded our people  are and it was obvious there is  a need for restoration of 
<br/>fractured relationships by overcoming grief, pain and anger.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We consulted victims and those who took part in the different political events, in groups as 
<br/>well as individuals. The first </span><span>coup</span><span> took place 37 years ago and last </span><span>coup</span><span> 18 years ago, but pain shared 
<br/>with  us  was  fresh.  Both  victims  and  perpetrators  shared  they  have  never  felt  heard  and  carry  the 
<br/>burdens of their trauma, guilt and pain with them. Many have lived in fear. Many were worried about 
<br/>reprisal and victimisation if they spoke. The Commission will now enable them to share their stories 
<br/>with its provisions of victim protection as well as options for in camera proceedings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone we spoke with agreed that there is a need for a space to be created for healing. Some 
<br/>asked for truth, many asked for healing whether they were elders or youth who have seen their elders 
<br/>suffer from their burdens and sharing of painful narratives of the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the conversation, we started with trauma awareness and recovery sessions with Fr. 
<br/>Ioane Sigarara, a psychologist with speciality in Post-Traumatic Stress disorder. Youth, women, faith 
<br/></span><span>leaders,  community  leaders  when  they  became  aware  of  the  symptoms  of  post-traumatic  stress 
<br/></span><span>disorder during these workshops, shared their realisation on how deeply impacted their families and 
<br/>communities have been. Hurt people, hurt people, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We rate one of the highest in the world on violence against women and children chart. Our 
<br/>tolerance  for  intolerable  has  increased  because  we  have  justified  crimes  committed  during  each 
<br/>political upheaval, whether it was 1987, 2000 or 2006, no coup can be justified. Emotions used in 
<br/>these political events have tried to divide our people on ethnic lines and dehumanise each other.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly, many political leaders have thrived on narratives of division, fear and hate for their 
<br/></span><span>own political expediency. But past has happened, we cannot deny our past, we can only learn from 
<br/>it, heal from it and create a new Fiji based on healing and better understanding of each other’s fears, 
<br/>dreams  and  hopes.  This  process  needs  courage  and  political  will,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Our  Prime 
<br/>Minister and our Coalition Government has the political will, and hearing from our consultations 
<br/>indicate that for the first time, the whole nation is ready to embrace this process. It will not be easy 
<br/>but is necessary.  I would also like to quote South African leader Nelson Mandela, well known and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2455 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>loved around the world for his commitment to peace and reconciliation, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “Reconciliation  does  not  mean  forgetting  or  trying  to  bury  the  pain  of  conflict  but 
<br/>working together to correct the legacy of past injustice.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission once established, will be mandated to serve as a guide for 
<br/>all  Fijians  in  identifying  and  moving  towards  overcoming  the  causes  and  consequences  of  the 
<br/>political violence, social divisions and economic inequalities that have divided us since 1987.  The 
<br/>Commission,  through  its  non-judicial  character,  and  non-retributive  approach  will  facilitate  truth 
<br/>telling through public hearings, conduct truth sitting through research, data gathering and analysis, 
<br/>and promote healing and reconciliation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission will set its processes for statement taking and will create awareness on its 
<br/>work.  The Commission will identify and recommend institutional reforms, particularly within the 
<br/>State institutions that it determines as responsible for committing, enabling or failing to uphold the 
<br/>State’s obligation to fulfil, respect and protect human rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission Chair will be sourced from global human rights community 
<br/>to ensure trust and transparency in the process.  Nelson Mandela when released from prison after 27 
<br/>years of incarceration chose not to use his suffering and pain to take revenge on perpetrators.  He 
<br/>chose to forgive and be a true leader for his nation and a beacon of peace to the whole world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are hoping these leadership qualities will shine in every sphere of Fiji as we embark on 
<br/>this journey.  We have seen the Commander of RFMF, Major General Jone Kalouniwai take a major 
<br/>step within Fiji’s Military Forces to work towards healing the falls that was divided for past 24 years.  
<br/>Almost all segments of our society had been wounded in one event or the other, but resentment and 
<br/>hate will not take us far.  If I may quote Mandela again:” Resentment is like drinking poison and then 
<br/>hoping it will kill your enemies.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forgiveness can contribute to creating a foundation for dialogue.  It can help release bitterness 
<br/>and anger and facilitate the re-humanisation of being other.  This is key to the reconciliation process, 
<br/>which  cannot  happen  without  eradicating  the  dehumanisation  factor  that  has  resulted  in  the 
<br/>stereotyping that we see.  We cannot be selfish and use our personal hursts and agendas from keeping 
<br/>the country going forward.  Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission provides the opportunity for 
<br/>the whole of Fiji to create a future of hope, healing and truly the way the world should be.  I must 
<br/>say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that for once, every group conversations we had, whether it was with faith 
<br/></span><span>leaders, youth, women and all the political leaders whom we met, everyone said, yes, this is needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope from here onwards, we will go and I ask Fiji to support the work of the Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission so we can truly have a Fiji, the way the world should be.  With that, I 
<br/>support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission  Bill  before  the  House.  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission,  is  the  truth  really 
<br/>forthcoming  to  effect  the  real  reconciliation?    By  establishing  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/></span><span>Commission in its current form, we are opening the doorway to retraumatise our victims.  We are 
<br/></span><span>forcibly reopening the wounds that really has not healed, but has slowly been forgotten about, just to 
<br/>please some in the name of tick in the box.  The victims will have to relive those ugly and dreadful 
<br/>days.  We will be breaking down and re-victimising the victims again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a victim of one of the  </span><span>coups</span><span>.  I lost a family member because of a 
<br/>subsequent event of a </span><span>coup</span><span>.  Does this Government think that I would like to relive the trauma without

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>knowing the truth?  I will only reconcile if the truth comes out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Commissioners  should  have  the  authority  to  summon  individuals, 
<br/>institutions or Government bodies to provide testimony, documents and other evidence relevant to 
<br/>the enquiry. This power is missing from the Bill. Not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was deliberately 
<br/>taken out, God knows why.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  does  the  Government  honestly  think  that  the  perpetrators  will  willingly 
<br/>come forward and tell the truth? Will they willingly divulge the names of the people and institutions 
<br/>that were behind them during the events in question? Do you think these perpetrators acted alone 
<br/>during those events? No! I do not think so, they will have to be summoned and this power is not 
<br/>given to the Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is not there, I hope you can read! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission does not have the power to initiate investigations, including 
<br/>the ability to independently gather evidence, interview witnesses and review relevant archives. Why 
<br/>set up this Commission and not give them the teeth to bite? The Bill states that His Excellency the 
<br/>President will appoint the Commissioners. The question is, on whose recommendation? What will 
<br/>be  the  composition  of  the  Commission?  What  provisions  are  there  to  have  some  sort  of  gender 
<br/>balance  in  the  Commission?  None  of  these  are  addressed  in  the  Bill.  It  is  wide  open  and  can  be 
<br/>interpreted in whichever way one deems fits so.  The Bill states that the Commission may hold in-
<br/>camera proceedings as necessary. Why should it be? All proceedings should be made public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission should be empowered to be able to publish comprehensive 
<br/>reports, detailing their findings and recommendations and the outcomes of their investigation. These 
<br/>reports should be widely disseminated to the public, Government and relevant international bodies 
<br/>rather than just reporting to it to His Excellency the President.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, powers should be given to the Commission to propose institutional, legal 
<br/>and  policy  reforms  to  prevent  the  reoccurrence  of  human  rights  violations.  These  might  include 
<br/>recommending change in laws, education systems or other mechanisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this case the Truth and Reconciliation Commission can easily be seen as 
<br/></span><span>an institution that favours reconciliation over justice, allowing powerful elites to avoid prosecution 
<br/></span><span>for their crimes. I am sure most of us sitting know who they are and whom we are trying to protect. 
<br/>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s focus is mainly on individual acts. It is not investigating 
<br/>or addressing the system that causes or favours such acts to happen. It is not addressing the structural 
<br/>system or the institutional setup that causes such acts to happen and thus resulting in the terrible acts 
<br/>of human rights violations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Commission  lacks  authority  to  challenge  the  broader  socio  and 
<br/>economic  systems  that  may  lie  behind  the  gross  violations  of  human  rights  during  the  events.    I 
<br/></span><span>believe failure to do so will fail to have any real and meaningful effect of change in the long run.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, is this Government willing to act on the recommendations of the Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission? Does it have the political will to do so and will the recommendations 
<br/>of the Commission be ignored or downplayed.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2457 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Government has the political will to do so then I challenge them to 
<br/>give  powers  to  the  Commission  and  make  their  report  public  whilst  a  copy  is  presented  to  His 
<br/>Excellency the President.  I believe that for both discretions the answer from the other side would be 
<br/>“no”.  They are not willing to go that way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current setup and the operational demarcation of the Commission will 
<br/>not  allow  this  to  happen  as  they  bounded  not  to  make  their  report  public  but  to  present  it  to  His 
<br/>Excellency the President.  If this is not going to happen, then why is this Commission being setup?  
<br/>Is it just a tick in the box we were promised and we have done it?  Is it that simple?  That is what it 
<br/>looks like.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission,  if  composed  well  and 
<br/>empowered properly can become a very powerful tool for healing and rebuilding trust within our 
<br/>people. I do not see this coming in the current setup.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  truth  is  not  forthcoming  then  I  honestly  do  not  see  any  real 
<br/>reconciliation happening.  This is a sad state.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, one only knows the pain of a wound 
<br/>if they have had their finger cut.  If you had not suffered that cut, you do not know the pain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suffered during the </span><span>coup</span><span>, can anyone stand up and say, I also suffered directly?  No.  So, 
<br/>you can only know the pain if you have cut your finger.  By having this Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission setup in such a way, we are letting our people down.  Their silence is deafening.  I know 
<br/>people are watching with interest and I leave it at that.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill 
<br/>before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament. 
<br/>On the outset, the Bill before the House is in fact a heart issue.  I thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for the wisdom in the formulation of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my great privilege to support the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
<br/>Bill (Bill No. 19/2024) tonight.  I wish to focus on clause 6(f) of the Bill which articulates the critical 
<br/>function  of  the  Commission  with  regards  to  facilitating  trauma  support,  faith-based  or  pastoral 
<br/>support,  and  counselling  for  survivors.    One  of  the  unsung  roles  that  made  the  foundation  of 
<br/>democracy resilient is to confront its darkest days.   In a bid to understand, reconcile and hear from 
<br/>them in this respect, the establishment of Fiji’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission is not only 
<br/></span><span>timely but pivotal for Fiji's healing, growth, and progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Important  to  note  is  the  role  illumination  of  truth  plays,  but  of  far  more  paramount 
<br/>significance is what we do with this truth thereafter.  Clause 6(f) of the Bill carves the pathway for 
<br/>our forward journey towards healing, growth and justice with unequal precision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In establishing a trauma support, will indicate our understanding that bearing witness to harsh 
<br/>realities  can  unearth  deep-seated  emotional  wounds.  These  wounds,  if  left  unaddressed,  can 
<br/>perpetuate  a  cycle  of  hostility  and  unrest,  threatening  the  cohesive  fabric  of  our  Fiji.  The 
<br/></span><span>Commission's  commitment  to  facilitate  trauma  support  is,  therefore,  a  strong  testament  to  our 
<br/></span><span>collective will for preserving peace, unity and wellbeing of our beloved nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, faith-based and pastoral support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will play a pivotal role and 
<br/>a vital one in solace seeking process for many survivors.  The power of spiritual and pastoral healing 
<br/>cannot be undermined or overlooked, for it produces a huge strength, resilience and hope in people 
<br/>encountering immense despair and distress.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2458 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By acknowledging this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and building into our mechanism, we respect and 
<br/>honour the individual healing journeys of our citizens, thereby nurturing an inclusive, tolerant and 
<br/>compassionate society that is equipped to rise above its tribulation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  the  Bill  underscores  the  importance  of  professional  counselling  for  survivors. 
<br/>Counselling offers a safe haven for victims to express and understand their emotions, rethink their 
<br/>past experiences and constructively define their future.  Through counselling, Mr. Speaker, we equip 
<br/>our survivors with tools to reclaim their families, rebuild their lives and contribute positively to the 
<br/>society – an invaluable investment for our nation’s future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building upon my previous affirmation of the Truth and Reconciliation Bill, I would like to 
<br/>approach this from a Christian perspective using the wisdom and teaching of the scriptures from the 
<br/>Bible.  Christ’s message in the </span><span>Holy Bible</span><span> is one of absolute love, absolute forgiveness and absolute 
<br/>reconciliation which aligns closely with the ideals of this Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also adopts a Christ-like godly compassion for the victims and survivors emulating 
<br/>God’s heart for the oppressed and broken-hearted. In Psalms 34:18, we learn and I quote, “The Lord 
<br/>is close to the broken-hearted and save those that are crushed in spirit”.  This Commission seeks to 
<br/>extend the same hand of comfort, to restore the dignity and respect that was taken away from them.  
<br/>The focus of the Commission  of future prevention also  echoes Christian teaching,  emphasising a 
<br/>transformative change in behaviour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the </span><span>Holy Bible</span><span> reminds us in Proverbs 28:13, “Whoever conceals their sins does 
<br/>not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy”.  Similar to this verse, the 
<br/>Commission  provides  a  platform  for  individual  and  institution  to  confess  their  wrongdoings  and 
<br/>renounce  violence  and  oppression  and  begin  the  process  of  healing  and  forgiveness;  in  doing  so 
<br/>restoring social harmony and justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the initial endorsement of the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Bill 
<br/>(Bill No. 19/2024) is an attainable epitome of our collective moral, social responsibilities towards 
<br/>those  who  have  suffered  wrong.    By  supporting  this  Bill,  we  are  making  a  commitment  to  truth, 
<br/>justice and healing, we solidify our stand for human rights, we safeguard the progress made since our 
<br/>independence  and  we  ascertain  that  the  Fiji  of  the  future  is  a  united,  harmonious  and  prosperous 
<br/>nation with all yearn for.  As we debate this Bill this evening, let us remember that in facilitating 
<br/>trauma support, faith-based support and counselling for survivors, we are truly nurturing the heart 
<br/>and soul of our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I rise in this Chambers today to give my contribution 
<br/>on the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill  2024.  I am not a lawyer, Sir, but with little 
<br/>know that I have, you can only make a regulation if the authority is given in the Act itself.  I am a 
<br/>Pharmacist, I can be corrected on this.  If the law gives you authority, then you can make regulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under procedure, there is no authority given to the Commission to do anything that they can 
<br/>summon a witness.  If that was the case, Mr. Speaker, all these Commissions can go and regulate 
<br/>themselves tomorrow, and they can start summoning witnesses.  However, the law does not allow 
<br/></span><span>that.  In Clause 9, it only talks about the procedure.  That is all I have to say about removing the 
<br/></span><span>summoning power of the Commission from the Act itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are other lawyers on the other side, they might contribute but, please, you 
<br/>are lawyers.  I might be a bush lawyer but you are professional lawyers so be wary about what you 
<br/>are saying in this august Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2459 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Bill that we are talking about, I admit that one of my iTaukei friends, Mr. 
<br/>Matai Korosaya from BSP, once told me when we brought in Bill No. 17 said, “Let us see, we have 
<br/>a very different kind of thinking. If you ask us, we can give you anything.  You people came from 
<br/>India, we gave you land to build your house, we gave you land to do farming and everything. As a 
<br/>friend, if you ask me tomorrow for my house, I will even allow you to come and stay with me. This 
<br/>is the mentality he said of us being </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>. But the moment you try and tell us instead of getting 
<br/>anything from us, you will be getting a kick from us.”  These are the words of my friend who actually 
<br/>said that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During Bill No. 17, there was ignorance and arrogance.  Today, I see that same arrogance and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ignorance coming in from the Government side.  On one side, we have... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Please, listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  ….the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  standing  and 
<br/>suggesting that if we want to reconcile everyone, let us get some reconciliation between the Members 
<br/>of Parliament within this Chambers. That is all what we are actually asking at this point in time, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  But that same ignorance and arrogance coming from the other side is not letting that happen.  
<br/>The  moment  we  actually  make  the  decision,  we  will  go  with  it,  whether  the  consequence  mean 
<br/>anything, but we will ensure that we have actually passed it.  We bring it under Standing Order 51, 
<br/>we will pass it under Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are talking about truth and reconciliation, we will be speaking bitter 
<br/>today  because  it  is  all  about  truth  and  reconciliation.    We  cannot  pass  this  Bill  without  actually 
<br/>speaking the truth in this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the truths, Mr. Speaker, is a blatant lie in this Parliament that consultation was done 
<br/>throughout Fiji.  I can name two such places where the Steering Committee failed to hold public 
<br/>consultation which were places of interest during 2000 </span><span>coup.</span><span>  Mr. Speaker, that was in Dreketi and 
<br/>Muaniweni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Listen, please!  It is my time to speak - please listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We just said that we have done national consultations and then got this Bill. And now we are 
<br/>saying all of a sudden that the Commission will do it on our behalf. If you people have not done it, 
<br/>send it to the Committee so that the Committee can go to these places and talk to these victims. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I very well stated on Monday that we should not rush through this Bill. The Bill 
<br/>will open a lot of wounds that have either healed or is in a process of healing or are hidden for ages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have heard the lies in this august Parliament when we were informed, as I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had suggested earlier, that consultation was done all throughout the nation. That was a blatant lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  on  that  same  note,  once  segment  of  group  of  our  society  had  been  totally 
<br/>neglected or rather ignored in this particular Bill, and they are females - our mothers, sisters, daughter, 
<br/>granddaughters and daughter in laws.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will read out the definition of survivors.  The Bill states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “survivors” includes any person, whether in Fiji or abroad –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Who,  individually  or  together  with  one  or  more  persons,  suffered  harm  in  the  form  of 
<br/>physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, pecuniary loss, or a substantial impairment 
<br/>of human rights.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no mention of sexual assault. Ladies were raped. Females were raped. And under the 
<br/>definition, we are not even incorporating sexual harassment. We can go on trying to explain this and 
<br/>that but sexual assault is not part of the definition, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, during the turmoil that happened during the </span><span>coups</span><span> in Fiji, it was not just a man 
<br/>killing  another  man,  or  the  action  of  a  man  brought  drastic  consequence  to  Fiji.  What  we  have 
<br/>forgotten is how our ladies were raped in places like Muaniweni and Dreketi. Ladies had to run all 
<br/>the way from Muaniweni to Girmit Centre to save their dignity. Why did the Steering Committee led 
<br/>by honourable Kiran, not go to these areas to conduct public consultation so that people can have 
<br/>their  say  in  this  particular  Bill?  It  is  a  total  ignorance,  Mr.  Speaker.  The  very  families  that  had 
<br/>sleepless nights because they were worried about their security that a perpetrator may walk anytime 
<br/>and rape the family member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  these  are  hard  realities  that  we  need  to  look  into.  There  were  lot  of  domino 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>effects actually happening during and post-</span><span>coup</span><span> as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for months, many of these  families had to  hide a  female member in  a  farm, 
<br/>cassava patch, in the forest as soon as it is 6.00 p.m. These people were never compensated.  Because 
<br/>of victimisation and humiliation, they did not even report these matters to the Police and this is a 
<br/>well-known …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Tuisawau? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Standing  62(4)(d)  on  prohibited  references,  and  I  quote:  
<br/>“words that are likely to promote or provoke feelings of ill-will  or hostility between communities or 
<br/>ethnic groups within Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are discussing the Bill and the provisions of the Bill and we should stick 
<br/>around those areas.  The pros and cons of the Bill or why we are rushing it through, if you want, 
<br/>rather than going  into the details  of acts  which may have happened but  which, at  the moment,  is 
<br/>contravening Standing Order 62(4)(d).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us discuss the framework of this.  Those kind of matters can be raised during the process 
<br/>where we share those experiences and how we can deal with it and ensure that through that process, 
<br/>we understand what happened and how we deal with it through the provisions of the Bill.  I am not 
<br/></span><span>saying those things are light or did not happen, but what I am saying is, this may not be the right 
<br/></span><span>forum for expressing those.  The forum in which we can express those are where we can deal with it 
<br/>in a more professional and more appropriate forum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  have  taken  on  board  your  Point  of  Order.    It  does  evoke  emotional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reactions, nevertheless, I will allow the speaker to continue as he was on this issue.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2461 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in these two areas where the consultation did not take place, a perpetrator 
<br/>would actually walk in a house, grabs a lady’ hand and rapes her in the bedroom, while the males in 
<br/>the family are sitting in the living room with a cane knife at their neck.  These are the group of people 
<br/>whom we have missed during public consultation to have their input in this particular Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it went to an extent that the perpetrators actually come into the house and if 
<br/>they do not find the ladies, if they are actually hiding somewhere else, males would be beaten the 
<br/>whole night.  The whole night, males were beaten so that they can tell where the females are hiding.  
<br/>That was the extent to which these people in those two areas suffered, and the Chairperson of the 
<br/>Committee did not even think that it is important to have public consultation in those areas.  What a 
<br/>shame!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It does not take much time to ask for forgiveness from others, but it is a shame that she did 
<br/>not find those particular places important for public consultation.  Mr. Speaker, why were these two 
<br/>areas and these victims excluded from public consultation?  That is one of my biggest questions.  It 
<br/>is ridiculous and unacceptable that being a female Member who as the Chairperson … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Kiran. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 62(1),  What is being indicated is that 
<br/>we did not speak to the victims of those places, but we did.  So what he is saying is not accurate.  We 
<br/>have  a  list  of  victims  who  have  spoken  from  those  areas,  without  necessarily  having  public 
<br/>consultations in those areas. What honourable Maharaj is saying about the victims, we know victims, 
<br/>I have worked with those victims, and we have consulted them.  They were the first lot of people we 
<br/>have consulted, and it is improper to say that it was not done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Kiran  has  pointed  out  Standing  Order  62(1),  which  says  when  speaking,  a 
<br/>member  must  not  impute  improper  motives  to  any  other  member.  Is  that  what  you  are  saying, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Kiran? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Correct,  and  specifically  referring  to  issues  that  have  been  raised  by 
<br/>honourable Maharaj,  these particular complaints have been heard by the Committee at their hearings 
<br/>in  various  places.  If  that  is  correct,  then  she  has  a  point  under  Standing  Order  62(1),  honourable 
<br/>Maharaj.  So, keep away from any other specific reference to those issues that you have raised in 
<br/>respect to that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may proceed, honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the Point of Order, I would just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like to….

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not speak on a Point of Order, you proceed where you have been.  You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue without any more reference to what I have just ruled on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I received several calls from the members of public stating that they were not consulted and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is exactly what I am saying, Mr. Speaker.  We do not have any report from the Committee… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hearsay, hearsay!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  …with  a  list  and  everything,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  whatever 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information is at hand, that is what I am speaking on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  what  I  have  actually  gathered,  I  had  asked  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister if he was actually aware, that a public consultation did not take place in those two  areas 
<br/>and do we need to continue with the current process to pass this Bill under Standing Order 51or  we 
<br/>can still send this Bill to the Committee stage for them to carry out a public consultation and then 
<br/>from there on, we can bring it back with a bipartisan Report from all the Committee Members and  
<br/>have it debated in Parliament. It is a very important question to the honourable Prime Minister, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. Now, it is clear that public consultations did not take place in those two areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Maharaj,  the  process  we  have,  the  procedures  have  been 
<br/>followed under Standing Order 51, so we have passed that stage. What are you trying to do now is 
<br/>plead with the honourable Prime Minister to retract and go back and have further consultation with 
<br/>reference to the Standing Committee?  Is that what you are saying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. All I am asking and all I am requesting is 
<br/>that  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  reconsider  if  this  particular  Bill  can  be  referred  to  a 
<br/>Parliamentary Committee which consists of both, Government and Opposition Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us protect and respect our ladies in Fiji. The Bill is not designed to protect 
<br/>that  Government  has  jumped  the  gun.  The  Military  is  already  in  the  process  of  reconciliation.  
<br/>Perpetrators are already out of prison and living a normal life. Honourable Prime Minister has already 
<br/>publicly apologised to the nation. Then what is the rush, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to bring this Bill if the 
<br/>process sis already taking place? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of reconciliation is already taking place.  What we are saying 
<br/></span><span>is, let us have that bipartisan approach in this Parliament and let us incorporate all of these things in 
<br/>the Bill itself before it is passed in this august House. </span><span>Vinaka!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today in support of the Fiji Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation  Commission  Bill  2024.  I  also  join  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  in  commending 
<br/>honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Steering  Committee  for  her  patience  and  tireless 
<br/>efforts in advancing this critical work.  Her dedication, alongside the contributions of the members 
<br/>of  the  Committee,  especially  the  Assistant  Ministers  and  other  stakeholders  reflect  the  united 
<br/></span><span>commitment for a Bill that is more than ever crucial, as it embodies the values of truth, accountability 
<br/></span><span>and reconciliation.  It  seeks to  confront  the pain  and trauma of our history, particularly  the socio-
<br/>political crisis of the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For far too long, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many Fijians have carried the heavy burden of unresolved 
<br/></span><span>grievances  and  unspoken  truths  living  them  unrested.  And  the  establishment  of  this  Truth  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024

<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2463 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reconciliation Commission offers a pathway for healing and for closure, ensuring that this painful 
<br/>chapters are not forgotten, but serve as a lesson for a brighter and a united Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission  proposed  by  this  Bill  will  create  an  open,  safe  and 
<br/>supportive space for truth telling and healing. It is dedicated to honour the voices of survivors and 
<br/>provide  justice  through  transparency  and  accountability.  Compose  of  the  5  members,  the 
<br/>Commission will operate with diverse expertise, integrity, independence and impartiality. And these 
<br/>qualities  are  essential  to  fostering  trust  among  all  stakeholders  and  ensuring  the  Commission’s 
<br/>findings and the Commission’s recommendations are credible and impactful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the multi-faceted functions of the Commission, which is strongly supported 
<br/>to one, provide the truth, sharing platforms for survivors to share and hear their experiences. It is not 
<br/>about blame, but about giving voices to those who have been silenced and most importantly, listen. 
<br/>By uncovering the root causes and systematic issues underlying political upheavals, the Commission 
<br/>will address the injustices that have shaped our history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only does this Commission intend to provide a platform and uncover root causes of the 
<br/>political upheavals we have faced, it embarks to facilitate trauma support services for our survivors, 
<br/>drawing  on  the  experiences  of  our  faiths  and  counsellors  and  this  injustices  cannot  be  repeated. 
<br/>Legislation  reforms  must  be  carried  out  to  strengthen  our  institutions,  protect  human  rights  and 
<br/>uphold  democracy.  As  this  side  of  the  august  Parliament  have  always  advocated  for,  upholding 
<br/>democracy and fight against injustices that have prevailed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the powers entrusted to the Commission ensures that it can fulfil its mandate 
<br/>effectively  by  hearing,  mentioned  in  Section  15  of  the  Bill,  that  emphasises  inclusivity  and 
<br/>fundamental principles in its operations. This is crucial for ensuring that all individuals regardless of 
<br/>their background or abilities, can participate fully in the Commission’s processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A further mandate support for individuals with disabilities through provisions such as sign 
<br/>language  interpretation,  the  selection  of  disability  access  venues  for  hearing,  and  assistance  with 
<br/>physical  access  to  these  premises.  Through  recognising  the  sensitive  nature  of  its  work,  the 
<br/>Commission  will  adopt  survivor  centred  approaches,  prioritising  dignity  and  well-being.  And 
<br/>through robust measures, will be in place to safeguard the identities of the survivors and witnesses 
<br/>especially in cases where fear of reprisal exists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  heart  of  this  Bill,  lies  its  commitment  to  supporting  survivors. 
<br/></span><span>Survivors  will  receive  psychological,  medical  and  legal  support,  ensuring  that  their  needs  are 
<br/></span><span>addressed holistically. It also recognises the courage it takes to come forward and the Commission 
<br/>will implement robust mechanisms to protect witnesses from harm or intimidation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  independence  of  the  Commission  is  a  cornerstone  of  this  Bill.  Free  from  political 
<br/>interferences,  free  from  been  influenced  by  any  agencies  for  its  operations  will  be  credible  and 
<br/>impartial.  Furthermore,  regular  audits  and  particular  recordkeeping  will  ensure  transparency  and 
<br/>maintain public trust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission's  final  report  will  present  findings,  will  present 
<br/></span><span>recommendations and actionable measures tailored to a Government's capacity to ensuring a realistic 
<br/>and sustainable implementation. So, the question is why is it that this Bill is so crucial?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is essential for Fiji's future. Confronting our past is not about 
<br/>revisiting old wounds, but about acknowledging the pain, the sufferings and learning from it, to never 
<br/>happen again. It is also crucial to address issues that have been shelved for over 30 years, as doing

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so will pave the way for healing and progress, ensuring that we build a more inclusive and resilient 
<br/>society moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the late Nelson Mandela wisely said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…true reconciliation does not consist in merely forgetting the past, but in facing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up to it and coming to terms with it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Bill  provides  a  framework  for  us  to  face  our  history  with  honesty  and 
<br/>integrity, allowing us to heal as a nation and we are fortunate to draw on the experiences of other 
<br/>nations, such as South Africa and the Solomon Islands in designing our Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  South  African  Commission,  born  out  of  the  fight  against  apartheid,  demonstrated  the 
<br/>transformative power of truth telling and reconciliation in rebuilding a divided nation. Similarly, the 
<br/>Solomon Islands processes emphasised the importance of tailoring reconciliation efforts to cultural 
<br/>and social contexts. We also have the guidance of international experts like Mr. Ruben Carranza, 
<br/>whose work with the International Centre for Transitional Justice has helped nations navigate this 
<br/>complex process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill presents an opportunity for Fiji, to stand united, to listen, to heal 
<br/>and to avoid repeating the horrors of our past. And I urge all members of this august Parliament to 
<br/>support this motion wholehearted. To the people of Fiji, I encourage you to participate in the public 
<br/>consultations. Share your views, your stories, and your hopes for our nation's future. This is your 
<br/>chance to shape a legacy of peace, justice and unity for generations to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  is  not  just  a  mechanism  for  addressing  past 
<br/>injustices. It is a beacon of hope for the future. It reminds us that our strength as a nation lies in our 
<br/>ability to acknowledge our mistakes, learn from them, and grow together. This Bill is our opportunity 
<br/>to honour the resilience of those who have suffered, to rebuild trust within our communities and to 
<br/>create  a  society  where  every  Fijian,  regardless  of  race,  culture  or  background,  feels  valued  and 
<br/>empowered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the leader of the party for SODELPA, I speak as well on our behalf to 
<br/>urge that we all commit our hearts to this reconciliation, so that we heal as a nation and move forward. 
<br/>We  cannot  afford  to  do  lip  service  as  leaders  because  it  will  make  us  hypocrites  and  we  will  be 
<br/></span><span>remembered by our people as having failed them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we look  at  the amount of damage that has been caused by all our 
<br/>political upheavals, over the years,  all I can say is, what a loss. It is now time to reshape our thoughts 
<br/>and hearts and place our people above our personal interest, above our tribal interest, above racial 
<br/>interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a nation, we are stronger together and weaker divided. Lastly, by way of 
<br/>this Truth and Reconciliation Bill, we, as leaders, must all vouch that we put an end to the usurping 
<br/></span><span>of powers via illegal means.  Never again must Fiji go through the dark days of a </span><span>coup</span><span> and we must 
<br/></span><span>denounce </span><span>coups, </span><span>not only to protect our future generation and our economy, but also the word of God 
<br/>provides  crosses  to  us  that  whatever  we  do  as  leaders,  will  be  felt  by  our  people,  our  family  for 
<br/>generations to come.

<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2465 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, together we can ensure that Fiji’s future is defined not by its division, but 
<br/>by its commitment to justice, to peace and reconciliation. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span> and may God bless 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think when I stood up before you for the first time, 
<br/>Sir, I did mention that this is a hot house where there will be many occasion for many arguments to 
<br/>come, that would be very sensitive et cetera and it is very visible today, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill that is before the Parliament, I think what needed to be spelt out, 
<br/>was spelt out quite clearly and succinctly by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and you could 
<br/>see how passionate he was when he spoke about it, enough for him to become emotional. What he 
<br/>portrayed today is  what  the general  populous portrays. This  is  a very  emotional topic, this is  not 
<br/>something that can be washed over, this is not something that can be rushed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  an  important  document,  and  I  want  to  congratulate  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education, because I think he said many things that are extremely good and they hit the nail on the 
<br/>head. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate, a couple of days ago, when this Bill was brought before 
<br/>us, again hit the nail straight on the head when he stood up straight, and the first thing that he said 
<br/>was: “without truth, you cannot have reconciliation.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you and I both know, and some of the other lawyers in this Chambers, 
<br/>one of the most important parts of the law and justice is when someone takes a witness box and the 
<br/>first thing they say is: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are not just words that should ring through in this document, in various 
<br/>forms it can. I want to just reiterate also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the original document, the draft 
<br/>document  that  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  spoke  about  came  to  us,  it  was  quite 
<br/>heartening  to  see,  and  I  want  to  spell  this  out  to  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Women, 
<br/>Children and Poverty Alleviation, it was quite heartening to see the actual stipulation of the powers 
<br/>of  the  Commission  and  it  contained  that  particular  provision  that  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition referred to regarding the issuing of summons to witness in a form prescribed and to call 
<br/>for  a  further  production  of  plans,  books  and  documents  and  to  examine  witnesses  and  parties 
<br/>concerned, on oath.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all heard it, the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and 
<br/>Poverty Alleviation responded to it by saying: “it is covered under Section 9 of the Bill.” Which says, 
<br/></span><span>subject to this section the Commission must regulate its own procedure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you and I both know there is a difference between procedure and power. 
<br/>We might fight it about all day, but there is a difference between procedure and power. The authority 
<br/>to summon someone, to call someone to give witness, you must get that authority from somewhere 
<br/>and that particular initial draft gave the authority to the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission to 
<br/>allow them to summon people and that is the very reason why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see that is 
<br/>divided into Sections 7 and 9.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One is to do with the powers of the Commission, and the other is to do with the procedure of 
<br/></span><span>the Commission. We cannot muddy the waters, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Even in Court, the authority for a 
<br/>witness to come, you have to issue a subpoena for them to come. It is not an easy thing to do, with 
<br/>this current document the Commission will not be able to summon anyone to come and give witness. 
<br/>They are going to be at the mercy of the decision of the person who wants to, whether they want to 
<br/>or not, you are not going to be able to.

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And,  one  of  the  most  important  things  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  the  ability  of  the 
<br/>Commission to actually probe forensically, look at something or ask for evidence that may be with 
<br/>the Police or the DPP or any other institution, where is the authority to do that? You cannot say that 
<br/>it is going to be covered under procedure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, without the truth we will never ever have any reconciliation. There 
<br/>are  many  people  in  this  country,  including  those  of  us  sitting  in  this  Parliament  that  are  quite 
<br/>emotional about how this actually works.  I do not think this side of Parliament and especially the 16 
<br/>of  us  are  saying,  that  this  should  not  happen,  but  what  we  are  saying  is,  that  it  should  be  done 
<br/>thoroughly and properly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many countries around the world that have done this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have 
<br/>gone through this. Some have been successful, very few have been successful, but most have not 
<br/>been successful. Purely because they have not been able to address everything. We are not going to 
<br/>be able to cover every corner, but at the very least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the experience of all those 
<br/>countries  having  done  that  and  our  own  experiences,  our  own  way  of  doing  things  and  how  we 
<br/>reconcile, we must do this thoroughly. In its current form, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular Bill is not 
<br/>thorough.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are questions that remain, will the Government adopt that Act upon the reports when 
<br/>the recommendations come out? Who is actually going to be the Commissioner?  Does it say that 
<br/>they have to be apolitical? How much flexibility is there? Will the Commission be an independent 
<br/>institution full of integrity? We already have problems, I see honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics going like this. Sir, 
<br/>give us a chance, you just need to hear us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Independent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, I know! I am reiterating what is in there. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>this entire Parliament is actually on the same page, they are on the same page, we are not saying do 
<br/>not  do  this!  We  are  on  the  same  page,  but  what  we  are  saying  is,  please  ensure  that  it  is  done 
<br/>thoroughly. The fact that it was brought under Standing Order 51, it got through, but we are still 
<br/>saying and we are asking for the Prime Minister to revisit it and say, please take it back so that we 
<br/>can get the consultations done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission  within  the  actual  Bill  says  that  it  has  these  particular 
<br/></span><span>powers to examine under oath any witness. How are you going to bring those witnesses?  Clause 7(1) 
<br/></span><span>states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(b)  to consider any written or oral evidence in hearings ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to consider whether to exclude the presence of a member of the public, including the media 
<br/>from any proceedings ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to exclude any person, if necessary, to ensure the due conduct of the hearings …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  engage  consultants  with  specific  expertise  in  an  area  related  to  the  functions  of  the 
<br/>Commission….”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the powers that it has. What other powers should it have and does it align itself to the fact 
<br/>that  the  functions  of  the  Commission  are  to  facilitate  enabling  spaces  and  engage  all  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders  in  the  reconciliation  process?  They  have  not  even  engaged  with  all  the  relevant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2467 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders in bringing this Bill to Parliament, to examine the nature of antecedents, root causes and 
<br/>accountability, there is a whole host of stuff that is actually in there, but the very power, the very 
<br/>authority that allows them to summon anyone and everyone is gone. It is not a small matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Yet, until now, even the Chairperson has not given a reason as to why.  That question was 
<br/>asked by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. Why did you take that provision out? Why is it 
<br/>that the Commission will not be able to step into the Police Force, ODPP or anywhere with those 
<br/>information to be able to extract it?  Without that power, this Commission is toothless and powerless. 
<br/>How can that be? How are we going to do justice to every victim of anything that has happened post-
<br/>1987? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are all on the same page. We just make sure that we have to come to the 
<br/>right agreement with respect to how it is done. I keep hearing from the other side, trust the process.  
<br/>You have not even gotten the process right to bring this Bill. You have heard the stories already from 
<br/>the previous speakers. We cannot do justice to those people that are aggrieved, and I can tell you this 
<br/>much. Sir, if I may relay a story. In my days when I was practising, Sir, there was a particular client 
<br/>who was still in prison for murder.  He was a very intelligent man and he said to me one day, “Boso, 
<br/>one minute of incarceration is a lifetime of pain.” If you equate what he said to one minute of violence 
<br/>inflicted on anyone is a lifetime of pain, whether it is mental violence or physical violence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Alvick Maharaj raised an issue that, where is the specificity with respect to sexual 
<br/>crimes that have been committed? You can get out of it. Where is it? So I am just saying that it needs 
<br/>to be thorough so that anyone who is sitting on the Commission is able to do his or her job properly 
<br/>without fear, without favour or without any prejudice.  That person needs to be able to understand 
<br/>that I am empowered to go and get the evidence regarding this to seek. What are we seeking? We are 
<br/>seeking the truth, Mr. Speaker, so that we may reconcile because remember we are not going to do 
<br/>this over and over again.  This  is  a one-time thing. We must learn  from the  other Reconciliation 
<br/>Commissions that have actually happened around the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some have been brutally violent, yet even their Reconciliation Commissions have not been 
<br/>able  to  do  this.  How  are  we  going  to  do  this?  Are  we  going  to  inculcate  the  findings  into  our 
<br/>educational system? Are we going to teach our children that this is what happens to X, Y, and Z and 
<br/>it should never happen again? How are we going to do it? We cannot treat this lightly. With all the 
<br/>passion in the world, Sir, this side of Parliament is asking for a fair whack at the cherry.  I urge the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister along with all of us that are saying, “we must revisit how we actually do 
<br/>this.”  We have not completed the particular process.  It is not about not bringing this to the House, 
<br/></span><span>it is about getting it right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission is there to actually address a hugely long period of violence 
<br/>in the past.  Some of the atrocious activities that have gone on, if it was a normal one, that would 
<br/>mean that that person or persons would be incarcerated for life.  But under the guise of a </span><span>coup</span><span> or a 
<br/>takeover, or whatever it is, a lot has gone on and we are looking to try and bury all of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that we realise the failures of the Commissions around the 
<br/>world come in many different forms.  As I said earlier, incorporating these things into our education 
<br/></span><span>system,  some of them were not  implemented in  these particular places.   We must ensure that we 
<br/></span><span>integrate what we actually learn into our broader framework of our society.  Where is that?  Where 
<br/>is the thoroughness that we actually all have the ability to do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are so many intelligent people in this House who know this.  This is not about politics.  
<br/>This is about playing with people’s minds.  We cannot play with people’s minds. Whether it is one 
<br/>victim or a thousand victims, we cannot mistreat or illtreat them because they have been damaged.

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The passion with which honourable Maharaj has actually spoken regarding some of the victims who 
<br/>have spoken, you can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when he does raise it, up comes someone to say, “Point 
<br/>of Order.”  If it is raising issue here, what will it do when we have this Commission sitting in place?  
<br/>People will not come out of fear.  We must remove the fear from here.  In effect, if you look at this, 
<br/>these things are done by looking at what you want to achieve at the end.  What do we want to achieve?  
<br/>There are things in here which actually spells it out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  the  purpose  behind  this  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 simply states and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1) The  purpose  of  the  Commission  is  to  promote  social  cohesion  through  healing  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reconciliation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)  The purpose of this Act is to facilitate open and free engagement in truth-telling regarding 
<br/>the political upheavals during the coup periods and to promote closure and healing for 
<br/>the survivors of these events.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The first line does not even speak about truth.  It ought to and it should say that the purpose 
<br/>of the Commission is to promote a truth-telling exercise and then to promote social cohesion through 
<br/>healing and reconciliation.  Where is the truth?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, without the truth, we are not going 
<br/>to have reconciliation.  We cannot treat that is just a normal document, like one of those Bills that 
<br/>come  to  our  House,  we  fight  about  it,  it  is  passed  and  is  forgotten  about.      We  cannot.    This  is 
<br/>historically one of the most important documents that has ever come through this House, and I am 
<br/>talking about from the day this House became what it is, because of our history.  It is so important 
<br/>for our children and our grandchildren to learn from our history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all want to heal. We all say grand things in this House about what needs 
<br/>to be done, what we want to do, but we do not succeed.  This is the one opportunity we have to be 
<br/>on  the  same  side  and  to  be  honest  and  truthful  with  our  populous,  because  that  is  what  our  duty 
<br/>demands us to do as Members of Parliament.  This is a very emotional subject, it is something that is 
<br/>going to raise the temperature even more, I know there are other speakers after me.  We want this 
<br/>done also, but we want it done properly.  In its current form, we do not agree with it because it is 
<br/>powerless, it does not do what it is supposed to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think learning about what has happened in many other jurisdictions is a lesson to all this. 
<br/>Will this document properly address all our human rights abuses? Will the perpetrators be brought to 
<br/></span><span>justice? Will there be a recompense? Having a Truth and Reconciliation Commission must be for the 
<br/></span><span>right reasons.  Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will never be an end and the need for truth and 
<br/>reconciliation is a must for us to grow as a nation and for us to be really truthful about who we are, 
<br/>what we are and what we stand for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- The good old book states in 1 Thessalonians 5:18 and I quote: “In 
<br/>everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I thank God for my life and the rare opportunity that confronts me today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, though my contribution to this motion may appear irrelevant to many in this 
<br/></span><span>august House, nevertheless, this is the ultimatum and mission given to me for my family and my 
<br/>people, if I should have an opportunity in this House to remember the devastating impact of the “little 
<br/>war” in terms of the identity crisis that they have suffered for generations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I count this as that rare opportunity to briefly outline this tragic event which 
<br/>I believe should also be covered by the work of the Commission under clause 3(1) of the Fiji Truth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>

<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2469 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Reconciliation Bill.  While we are still focussing on the modern political upheaval, let me take 
<br/>you back to the biggest and devastating upheaval in Fiji’s history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is with some measure of regret that this august House, not to mention the 
<br/>whole  of  the  country  ignorantly  forgotten  or  purposely  downplayed  the  impact  of  one  of  Fiji’s 
<br/>terrible,  historical  and    bloody  political  exploits  that  left  hundreds  of  hill  people  of  the  Sigatoka 
<br/>Valley homeless, seeking refuge in other districts or islands and thousands of people shot dead and 
<br/>hanged by the then Colonial Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 148 years today in 1876 barely two years into Fiji’s Cession to Great Britain 
<br/>in 1874, the “little war” broke out after the failure of negotiations between the natives and the native 
<br/>constabulary forces to appease the natives from blaming the Colonial Government of sabotage and 
<br/>criminal intimidation that the great measles pandemic swept through the nation in 1875, killing a 
<br/>quarter of the population, roughly 40,000 people was purposely brought by the new settlers to wipe 
<br/>away the natives in order to possess their land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  result,  the  natives  of  the  Sigatoka  Valley  in  Navosa  took  up  the 
<br/>traditional arms of clubs and spears against the whole provinces of Fiji including the neighbouring 
<br/>Nadroga and Namosi, who assembled at Nasaucoko in early 1876. About 2,000 in total, assisted by 
<br/>the modern weaponry of the new government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was a David-Goliath struggle between sheer brute force against a well-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>armed auxiliary native force backed by the Colonial Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government was pushed to its limit for several months. After some time, 
<br/>the government prevailed in killing people in caves namely the Tawaleka, Nahehevia taking them as 
<br/>prisoners and hanged or shot them dead. The natives were finally conquered with the leaders Jolame 
<br/>Mudu  of  Naqalimari  and  Nabisiki  of  Noikoro  who  were  brought  down  to  Sigatoka  for  the  final 
<br/>judgement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  after the emancipation,  the natives returned home, they were not  be bu.  
<br/>They were not to build forts and never to return to full normalcy and now some are still in their exiled 
<br/>home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir</span><span>,</span><span> instead of requesting compensation from the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission for the lives of men, women and children who died at the duration of the “little war”, 
<br/></span><span>we plead with the honourable Prime Minister to continue the good work of helping and building the 
<br/></span><span>inland town at Navatumali in Keiyasi, not only improving the infrastructure by building their lost 
<br/>identity taken away from them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir</span><span>,</span><span> since the moving of the Navosa Provincial Office from Natuatuacoko to 
<br/>Lawaqa in Sigatoka in 1944, the people of Navosa want a province for themselves. Demographically 
<br/>it cannot be joined and subjugated to a chiefly leadership that is not identical to the ethos and identity 
<br/>of their cultural environment. Navosa has 12 </span><span>tikina</span><span> and Nadroga has 10. The two provinces are not 
<br/>equal partners or players, one of them automatically becomes a footstool and subjugation in the name 
<br/></span><span>of the game.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Natuatuacoko  office  moved  to  Sigatoka  in  1944,  it  was  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>temporary move to improve communication.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it did not appear that it will last this long - 80 years. To quote from the </span><span>Bible</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the popular song, "Truly they are sitting down and wept when they remembered Zion" this present

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>arrangement has strongly impacted the identity crisis of the province.                          
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more than 20 </span><span>tabua</span><span> have been presented to various provincial leadership, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>head of the then Native Land Trust Board, including two to three Prime Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir</span><span>,</span><span> on 27</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1999, a large delegation of Navosa people representing the 
<br/>12 </span><span>tikina</span><span> converged in Suva to formally request the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Fijian Affairs, the late Adi Kuini Vuikaba Speed, Tui Noikoro and her Permanent Secretary, Ratu 
<br/>Meli Bainimarama about the separation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the apex, the optimum level, the 
<br/>level that should have been the climax of everything that for generation the people of Navosa had 
<br/>aspired to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the promise made to them, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Be  rest  assured  that  Navosa  will  now  become  Fiji’s  15</span><span>th</span><span>  province”,  Ratu  Meli 
<br/>Bainimarama told the large delegation.  “That is it, I will now work on the other aspects 
<br/>as required before the declaration of Navosa as a province.” (</span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> 28, 1999) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  untimely  death  of  Adi  Kuini  Speed  had  put  the  Navosa 
<br/>movement in disarray and threw the work of decades into confusion in terms of healing the identity 
<br/>crisis which has been stalking the province for generations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I sincerely hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the separation of the two provinces would be a matter 
<br/>of urgency by the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>I support the motion 
<br/>before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, esteemed Members of this Parliament, fellow Fijians 
<br/>who are watching this live Parliament tonight, I rise today with a heavy heart not to reject the idea of 
<br/>reconciliation  but  to  urge  caution  towards  the  establishment  of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission as proposed by the Coalition Government.  While reconciliation is a noble aspiration, 
<br/>we must ask ourselves at what cost.  Who will bear the burden of this process?  And will it truly heal 
<br/>our people or deepen the very wounds we are trying to close. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members, let us not forget the silent cries of our people, every 
<br/>victim of past atrocities carries scars, both visible and invisible. For them, a Truth Commission is not 
<br/>just an exercise in dialogue. It is a reopening of the pain they have fought to overcome. It is a forced 
<br/></span><span>return to a chapter they have desperately tried to close. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, do we as leaders have the right to demand this of them?  Reconciliation 
<br/>must  be  built  on  compassion,  not  compulsion.  Asking  victims  to  relive  their  anguish,  risks  re-
<br/>traumatising them and plunging our nation further into emotional turmoil. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not be fooled by grand promises of reconciliation. This Commission, 
<br/>while presented as a path to healing, carries the dark potential to re-open wounds that have barely 
<br/>begun to heal.  Imagine the mother who has lost her son in the chaos of past injustices, or the young 
<br/></span><span>girl whose life was forever altered by the acts of cruelty. For them, this is not just about re-visiting 
<br/></span><span>history, it is about being forced to relive the anguish they have fought to overcome. Who will stand 
<br/>by these victims when this process tears apart the fragile peace, they have managed to build within 
<br/>themselves?  Is it truly just to subject them to this tantamount under the guise of reconciliation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our nation’s resources are not infinite. In this time of economic struggle, 
<br/>when families barely afford necessities due to high cost of living, is it justifiable to divert millions of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2471 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dollars  towards  this  Commission?    Every  dollar  spent  on  this  initiative,  is  a  dollar  not  spent  on 
<br/>building schools, improving hospitals, getting water to Tamavua, fixing our potholes that are on the 
<br/>streets, or alleviating poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, are we, as representatives of the people, prepared to stand before them, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explain why their struggles must wait while we chase uncertain goals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  grave  risk  that  this  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission may become a potential platform for political manipulation. The Government, with all 
<br/>its power and influence could use this Commission to promote its own agenda and selectively target 
<br/>individuals or groups potentially deepening the divisions within our society. What about justice Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir?  The Commission by its very nature, cannot prosecute those who committed atrocities. 
<br/>Will we allow perpetrators to walk free? Their heinous crimes forgiven in the name of reconciliation?  
<br/>How will the victims feel seeing their oppressors absolved without consequences? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reconciliation  without  justice,  is  an  empty  promise.  One  that  risks  alienating  those  who 
<br/>suffered the most.  Let us be realistic about participation, many of those affected by the events we 
<br/>seek to address, may choose not to engage out of fear, trauma or distrust. Their absence will leave 
<br/>gaps  in  the  narrative,  unheard  voices  and  untold  stories  that  undermine  the  very  purpose  of 
<br/>reconciliation. Can we truly call it a Truth Commission if it is incomplete? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members, this path is fraught with danger.  It risks harming the 
<br/>very people we aim to help. It risks exhausting resources that could uplift lives. It risks dividing us 
<br/>further, at  a time when unity is paramount and above all, it risks betraying  the trust  of the Fijian 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  honourable  Members,  reconciliation  is  not  achieved  through 
<br/>Commission. It is achieved through honesty, fairness and genuine commitment to justice. We must 
<br/>invest  in  strengthening  our  communities,  addressing  root  causes  of  division  and  providing  real 
<br/>support for the victims. We must not open old wounds without the tools to heal them and let us tread 
<br/>carefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the road ahead is treacherous and the stakes are too high for us to fail. 
<br/>I do not support this Bill before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to briefly address a matter of profound importance 
<br/>to our nation. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill. While the pursuit of the Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation are indeed, a noble objective, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is imperative that these goals are 
<br/></span><span>approached with honesty, fairness and respect for the rights of all citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill in its current form pertains to undermine the very foundation of our 
<br/>democracy, contradicts the principles of the 2013 Fijian Constitution and deepen existing divisions 
<br/>within our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not a simple Bill, here we are discussing the events of the last 37 
<br/>years. This Bill comes at a time when Fijians face unprecedented hardships, and let us not ignored 
<br/>the reality on the ground, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Fiji as a nation is in crisis, and the TRC is nothing more 
<br/></span><span>than a convenient diversion... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  ...rather  than  a  serious  attempt  at  truth  seeking,  reconciliation  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>healing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TRC should not be imposed, just because you have numbers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  points  to  international  examples  of  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commissions, but their understanding of this is shallow and weak. They should go 
<br/>and  research  more  and  see  what  was  the  approach  taken,  and  not  just  come  here  and  talk  about 
<br/>Mandela and all those. This Bill is not about reconciliation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a political tool… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- ... and not a path to unity. It is about the political agendas, the current 
<br/>Chair has acted with self-proclaimed powers over all our people making statements about healing 
<br/>and issuing apologies without any authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no formal or informal discussion between the Government and 
<br/>Opposition.    I  have  checked  with  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  whether  there  was  any 
<br/>invitation from the honourable Prime Minister on this subject matter, and he told me there was none. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  no  invitation  from  the  Government  to  join  in  Cabinet's  Sub-
<br/>Committee or any Committee on the TRC to put together the draft terms of reference for submission 
<br/>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us be clear, only a consensus Commission will work, not an imposed 
<br/>one. We should have engaged in a sincere process of dialogue given our special circumstances as a 
<br/>multi-racial, multi-religious country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TRC Bill are set to cover the period from 
<br/>1987 to the present, and we have just heard from honourable Alipate Tuicolo, going back 248 years. 
<br/>It all will come, and we need to be prepared for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it raises the question, why not include from 1977? When the NFP 
<br/>was denied to form the Government? That was a coup without gun, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Expecting this 
<br/>scope to include this… There you go! This is the kind of people we have in this Parliament, and here 
<br/>we  are  talking  about  truth  and  reconciliation.  Expanding  the  scope  to  include  this  period  would 
<br/>provide a more comprehensive understanding of our political history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, forming a three-person commission with one member from the Government, one 
<br/>from the Opposition and one independent Chair would ensure a balance and a fair process. We would 
<br/></span><span>have  supported  such  a  structure,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  take  back  to  all  of  you  in  1996,  the 
<br/></span><span>Honourable Prime Minister worked very closely with the then leader of Opposition on the review of 
<br/>the  Fiji  Constitution  Commission.  There  was  a  consensus.  I  want  to  ask  the  Honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister that he was able to do that in 1996. Why can’t he do it now? And I know in his response he 
<br/>will consider all what we are saying, because as I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not a simple 
<br/>document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must ask why is this Bill being pushed through so quickly? What is the 
<br/>urgency? Who truly stands to benefit from the people? The people of Fiji deserve transparency and 
<br/></span><span>genuine efforts towards reconciliation, not a hasty decision that will steer up uncertainty. Let us take 
<br/></span><span>the time to address the real issue facing our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reconciliation  is  not  a  magic  bullet.  It  requires  courage,  honesty  and  a 
<br/>commitment to justice. We cannot achieve truth when the process is political and agenda driven. The 
<br/>reason  why  I  am  saying  this,  because  the  Opposition  was  not  consulted  on  this  very  important 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2473 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>document. Let us not forget we are also elected Members here! We have the same right like you! We 
<br/>all are equal here!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  We  need  proper  engagement  with  all  Fijians  as  equal  citizens,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker. Sir. And as a starting point, let us commit to a genuine process of reconciliation. One that 
<br/>respects our Constitution, addresses the needs of all Fijians and builds a future based on equality, 
<br/>unity and shared purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to press the reset button on this process. Let us have 
<br/>a parliamentary process. We can discuss here. We can refer this to the Select Committee, and from 
<br/>both sides we have Members in it, and I know we all will support it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call for a 
<br/>genuine  reconciliation.  Truth  and  reconciliation  are  not  important  to  be  reduced  to  the  political 
<br/>convenience of the Coalition Government and its chosen few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you, and I do not support this Bill in its present form and ask that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>common sense prevail this evening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the  Bill  that  is  before  the 
<br/>Parliament and that is Bill No. 19 of 2024.  I think the purpose of the Bill, as it reads in clause 3, the 
<br/>purpose of the Commission is to promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation. The 
<br/>purpose  of  the  Act  is  to  facilitate  open  and  free  engagement  in  truth  telling  regarding  political 
<br/>upheavals during coup periods to promote closer and healing for survivors of these events. It is very 
<br/>important. It is very painful to open up wounds, but we need to open up those wounds if they are 
<br/>infected because it will remove the pain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard from the submission from my fellow colleagues, from the G16-bloc on their 
<br/>various perceptions of the various coups that have happened in Fiji. Some have talked about the 1987 
<br/>coup, some have focussed on the 2000 coup, and some have treated those events in isolation. I have 
<br/>not seen or also talked about in its entirety the other coups that also happened in 2006 where many 
<br/>too were also victims.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most are civil servants, most are even sitting on that side of the Parliament, even lost their 
<br/>jobs, given to some political decisions that happened during that period. They are also victims. They 
<br/>will also want to go through the Commission and want to get some answers from those whom they 
<br/></span><span>think owe it to them, an explanation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the pathway, the process that we need to trust, honourable Bala has gone into lengths 
<br/>saying that this is a political tool, it is not a reconciliation tool. At the same time the honourable Bala 
<br/>is asking for a Committee to be set up by Parliament though a bipartisan approach that will include 
<br/>politicians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular Bill is proposing that the Commission will be apolitical. Will leave it as it is, 
<br/>to  be  apolitical,  so  they  can  independently  assess  and  analyse  political  events  and  those  who  are 
<br/></span><span>victims of those events or the perpetrators can tell their stories freely to the Commissioners who will 
<br/></span><span>be  apolitical.  So,  I  do  not  know  what  the  honourable  Bala  wants.  Whether  he  says  that  this  is  a 
<br/>political  tool,  and  at  the  same  time,  he  wants  politicians  to  participate  and  form  a  Committee,  to 
<br/>review this particular Bill. He needs to confirm on what he wants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time the honourable Bala had gone right back to1996, on a bipartisan approach 
<br/>where  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  then,  the  late  Jay  Ram  Reddy,  with  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>2474 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister, had worked  on a bipartisan approach and the talks that led up to the review of the 1990 
<br/>Constitution  that  led  to  the  review  of  the  1997  Constitution  that  was  enacted  through  an  Act  of 
<br/>Parliament. It came through Parliament, not like the Constitution that the honourable Bala is talking 
<br/>about, that was decreed into being and it was an enabling Constitution, just like the 1990 Constitution.  
<br/>We are hoping that after this Truth and Reconciliation Commission, once we bury all that, we will 
<br/>also be able to review and come to freedom where the people of Fiji will be given that choice to 
<br/>select and give their views as to what type of Constitution they want to govern them. These are some 
<br/>of the stepping stones that will reach full political emancipation or freedom, and that should be the 
<br/>aim. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know what honourable Ketan Lal was saying when he said that victims should not 
<br/>be compelled, while the Bill clearly states that the survivors will be protected and that is in Clause 
<br/>16 - Survivor support and witness protection. He is saying that victims should not be compelled but 
<br/>the victims will come in and share their story to the Commissioners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, honourable Koya has been saying that there is no provision in this Bill that 
<br/>summons witnesses. I do not know whether they know what they are talking about.  One is saying 
<br/>that no victim should be compelled, while the other is saying that the victim is compelled. They are 
<br/>contradicting each other. This confusion is coming out from the G16 Bloc contributions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Again, let me take a point that was raised by honourable Koya in 
<br/>regards  to  the  powers  of  the  Commission  that  was  read  out  by  honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  that  was 
<br/>clause  9.    So,  I  urge  honourable  Koya  to  read  clause  6(j)  which  talks  about  the  functions  of  the 
<br/>Commission, which are to do all things to the fulfilment of the objective of the Commission. That 
<br/>needs to be read together with the powers of the Commission in clause 7 and that will come down to 
<br/>the procedures that the Commission will then make to regulate its own procedures in summoning 
<br/>witnesses. That should be read together. It is a pathway that allows this Commission to see that all 
<br/>things that lead to the fulfilment of the objective of the Commission is done by the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that the honourable Leader of Opposition raised was the truthful confession. 
<br/>I think there is provision in this particular Bill that talks about if you give false information or if you 
<br/>give a false confession, you will be dealt with by the law where the Commission can refer you to the 
<br/></span><span>courts. So that is also taken care of, and you should not worry about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr, Speaker, Sir, the purpose and the objective of this Bill is to bring unity, and this 
<br/>is what our nation badly wants at the moment. We need to reopen those wounds, despite them being 
<br/>painful and at the same time, we find solutions, we find healing amongst ourselves and given all the 
<br/>provisions that are given within the Bill, whether Commissioners are also allowed to invite traditional 
<br/>leaders  and  also  religious  leaders  that  will  further  advise  the  Commission  in  coming  up  with  a 
<br/>decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  note,  a  point  that  was  raised  by  honourable  Sachida,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Commissioners making a report.  In clause 17(3) and (4), it specifies that the copy of the final report 
<br/>must be presented to the State to allow the implementation of the recommendations and the State 
<br/>must take responsible measures within its available resources to  implement  the recommendations 
<br/>provided  in  the  final  report.  So,  it  allows  for  lessons  that  will  be  learnt  from  the  findings  of  the 
<br/>Commission, and also the recommendation that will allow the State to put in measures and policies 
<br/>to educate us and also our future generations that we do not return to those dark days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2475 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another provision that was highlighted by the honourable colleague and friend, honourable 
<br/>Maharaj.  There is no provision in this particular Bill that talks about women and sexual offences.  If 
<br/>you go to clause 15(10), it says that the Commission may implement special procedures to address 
<br/>the needs of particular survivors such as children and those who have suffered sexual abuse, as well 
<br/>as working with child perpetrators of abuse or violence.  So that is also in the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also provision in the Bill where those survivors, all those victims, through hearings, 
<br/>will be able to also bring out their case and they are also protected, and at the same time, will be 
<br/>supported from whatever trauma they face, including those who suffered through sexual offences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, some of them also raised the point of the Commission that it will be apolitical, and 
<br/>they will be guided by the Code of Conduct that is there in the Bill.  It  will guide how they will 
<br/>conduct themselves as Commissioners so that they are independent and they will be guided by how 
<br/>they should act with all fairness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the things, Mr. Speaker, from what my colleague from the other Bloc – G-
<br/>16  have  shared  but,  again,  this  particular  Bill,  especially  in  clause16(3),  talks  about  witness 
<br/>protection.  It removes fear, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It allows the perpetrator to come voluntarily, knowing 
<br/>that this particular law, whatever he or she will come and confess, cannot and will quote from clause  
<br/>16(3): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“No evidence taken under this Act is admissible against any person in any Civil 
<br/>or Criminal proceeding, except in the case for a person charged with intentionally giving 
<br/>false  evidence  before  the  Commission  or  intentionally  misinterpreting  evidence  in  a 
<br/>manner intended to mislead the Commission or other participants.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the perpetrator in here, whoever is a witness, is also protected and this protection will 
<br/>allow them to remove that fear and come out freely, give their story freely, whatever part they played, 
<br/>that the victim may want to know, to find out the truth, so that particular wound that is there for long 
<br/>can be healed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are a few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that other colleagues of mine have shared and I have 
<br/>given  my  views  on  it.    Also,  on  this  truth  and  reconciliation,  it  proposes  accountability  can  hold 
<br/>institutions and groups and individuals of their actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition,  the Truth  and Reconciliation  Commission also  proposes that healing can help 
<br/></span><span>people move on with their lives by providing a space to share their stories and experiences.  Many 
<br/></span><span>people are awaiting this particular Commission because for years, stories have haunted them and they 
<br/>also want to move away from their past, given what they had faced individually, or as a society, and 
<br/>they want to be released, so that they can release whatever is holding them back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It provides a platform of story sharing and also it puts our history records straight.  Also, in 
<br/>nation building when we move towards a Fiji where we are truly free after reconciliation and we 
<br/>work together towards a constitution that we all agree on, these are some of the values and some of 
<br/>the events that we will look back and say,  “Oh, we have come this far and we, as a nation, will be 
<br/></span><span>strong because we are not tied to our past, we are now forward looking and we want to be united as 
<br/></span><span>one as all Fijians.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  are  few  things,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  identified  and  also  share  here  through  my 
<br/>contribution to the debate, and I urge all honourable Members of this House, from Government side, 
<br/></span><span>from the G-16 side and from our side - the G9 Bloc, for all of us to support this Bill, if we want to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div>
<div><span>2476 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move this country forward.  We have gone past Standing Order 51, we are in the substantive matter 
<br/>and we cannot go back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although the honourable Leader of the Opposition took a jab at me when he stated that when 
<br/>I was an Opposition Member, I used to argue that in the Standing Order 51, the consultation by the 
<br/>Executive is totally different from the legislative consultation.  But, again, I said on the other day that 
<br/>given the urgency of the Bill, given the inadequate policy that was there in the Aquaculture Bill, that 
<br/>needs that urgency that is why Standing Order 51 was relevant at that particular time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, for this one, I can say that Standing Orders 51 is quite relevant too because it is 
<br/>long overdue for us. I am a political victim, not only as a politician but as a politician who was also 
<br/>going through being victimised not only in here, but also during the time I was in prison.  But to 
<br/>come back and have survived, we know that we have that faith that one day when I will walk out of 
<br/>that prison cell.  That was what Mr. Nelson Mandela said - when I walk out of the door that lead to 
<br/>my freedom, I knew I had to leave all my bitterness behind. If I still have that bitterness, I would be 
<br/>still locked behind bars of prejudice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  both the oppressor and the oppressed need to be liberated and that is what 
<br/>I hope for, that one day Fiji will be liberated. I see this as a tool not only now but it is also prophetic, 
<br/>and many evangelists prophesied that there will be a Truth and Reconciliation document for Fiji, and 
<br/>I think this is a godly time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise to  contribute to  the Fiji  Truth  and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission Bill 2024.  While I understand, Sir, the intentions behind this Bill, I believe it will only 
<br/>serve to reopen old scars and many of our people have worked hard to heal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the leadership of the former Prime Minister, we achieved something truly remarkable. 
<br/>We were finally welcomed and called Fijians, where anyone born in Fiji is a Fijian. This identity 
<br/>made us all feel at home, fostering a sense of unity and belonging that transcended ethnic and cultural 
<br/>divides.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a significant step towards building a cohesive and harmonious society.  Over more than 
<br/>a century, the descendants of the Girmityas have an integral part of Fijian society. We have built our 
<br/>lives here, contributed to the nation's development and forged strong bonds with our fellow Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, since the real question is, who also want reconciliation but do not like is the 
<br/>TRC really for? Mr. Speaker, Sir, as my colleagues have already said, we also want reconciliation 
<br/>but we just do not want reconciliation for the sake of reconciliation.  We want a genuine reconciled, 
<br/>sincere, and our humble request to the honourable Prime Minister is that the Commission not to be a 
<br/>toothless tiger.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, generational acceptance is not something that can be legislated or imposed, it is earned 
<br/>through shared experiences, mutual respect and understanding.  The Fiji Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission  Bill,  while  being  intentional,  risks  undermining  this  hard-earned  acceptance  by 
<br/>dragging painful memories and divisions that many have already come to terms with. I stand before 
<br/></span><span>you as a fourth generation Girmitya but the truth is, I am a proud Kai Ra from the province of Ra.  
<br/></span><span>The people of Ra are proud and happy people, yet I ask what is this Bill really for?  Who is this Bill 
<br/>really for?  These questions resonate deeply with me and many others who share similar sentiments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill by the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister aims to address past political upheavals and human rights violations.  Whilst some see it as 
<br/></span><span>a way to heal and prevent future conflict, others worry that it might reopen old scars.

<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2477 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister himself has already asked for forgiveness, not once, but many 
<br/>times and we have all forgiven him.  Yet, we seem to be going down the same path, again, where all 
<br/>those special ceremonies are forgotten.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have made significant progress in fostering unity and reconciliation in Fiji.  The inclusive 
<br/>identity of being Fijian has brought us closer together, allowing us to move forward as one nation.  
<br/>Re-opening  old  wounds  through  this  Bill  could  potentially  undo  this  process,  reigniting  old 
<br/>grievances and divisions that we have worked so hard to overcome. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  my  fellow  Members  of  Parliament  to  consider  the  potential 
<br/>consequences of this Bill.  Let us not jeopardize the unity and harmony we have achieved.  Instead, 
<br/>let us continue to build on the foundation of acceptance and inclusivity that has brought us this far.  
<br/>Let us honour the spirit of unity and acceptance in our beloved nation.  We need to stop using the 
<br/>pains of the past as means to be honest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what they are trying to prove from this Bill.  Yes, I am 
<br/>sure the Deputy Prime Minister will try to belittle me saying I did not read the Bill or something, to 
<br/>divert from the fact that this Bill is really just his political football. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a united nation of amazing people who want to live a happy and 
<br/>prosperous life, but this Bill seems to be trying to take the attention away from the true problems the 
<br/>people of Fiji are facing everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I oppose the Truth and Reconciliation Bill 2024 and urge my colleagues to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do the same. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Members of this august House; today,  we stand on the precipice of history,  at crossroads between 
<br/>the  burdens of our past to the promise of a brighter future.  This motion – the establishment of the 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is not simply an administrative measure but an act of nation 
<br/>building.    It  is  a  call  to  confront  our  past  with  courage,  humility  and  unyielding  commitment  to 
<br/>justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, no nation is without its shadows and Fiji is no exception.  From the arrival of 
<br/>the Girmityas in 1879 to the political upheavals of 1987, 2000 and 2006, we have been shaped by 
<br/></span><span>moments of profound struggle and division.  These events etched into the memory of our people have 
<br/></span><span>tested  the  very  fabric  of  our  society.    They  have  exposed  our  vulnerabilities,  but  they  have  also 
<br/>strengthened our resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Mr. Speaker, resilience alone is not enough.  True healing requires that we confront the 
<br/>uncomfortable truth of our history.  It requires that we say, without hesitation or equivocation, what 
<br/>happened during those dark chapters was wrong – 1987 was wrong.  Our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>had confessed to them – 2000 was wrong, 2006 was wrong and if you are to charter a new course, 
<br/>we must begin with three recognition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  represents  a  momentous 
<br/>opportunity, a chance to live the value of our history and give voice to those who have long been 
<br/>silenced.    It  will  provide  a  sacred  space  for  truth-telling,  a  forum  where  the  stories  of  victims, 
<br/>survivors and perpetrators can be told, recorded and honoured.  Through this process, we do not aim 
<br/>to open old wounds, but to cleanse them, to allow them to heal in the light of truth. We, Fijians must 
<br/>come  together  in  a  spiritual  conversation,  to  speak  and  hear  the  truth,  heal  our  differences  and

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reconcile as a nation and as a people. The recently concluded National Security and Defence Review 
<br/>has laid bare a stark reality. There is a profound trust deficit within our nation, Fijians distrust their 
<br/>governments, the governments of the past, their institutions and too often even their neighbours. This 
<br/>lack of trust is a threat, not just to our stability, but to the very ideals upon which this nation was 
<br/>founded.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in this context, it is heartening to acknowledge the proactive steps taken by the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji Military Forces towards reconciliation under the leadership of Major-General Ro 
<br/>Jone Kalouniwai.  The RFMF has embarked on an internal process of reflection, reconciliation and 
<br/>restoration.  Recognising its role in the past political upheavals and striving to rebuild trust with the 
<br/>Fijian populace. This initiative serves as a testament to RFMF’s dedication to transformation and 
<br/>offers a beacon of hope for national unity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to succeed, it must serve as more 
<br/>than a historical exercise. It must become a bridge, a means of restoring trust and building faith in 
<br/>the idea that Fiji can and will rise above its divisions. This is not just about uncovering the past. It is 
<br/>about shaping the future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, history is watching us today. History will judge this House today.  The eyes of 
<br/>the Fijian people are upon us, and so too are the eyes of our future generation. They will look back 
<br/>at this moment and ask us whether we had the courage to face the truth, whether we had the vision 
<br/>to seek reconciliation and restoration and whether we had the wisdom to build a nation rooted in 
<br/>justice, equality and in unity. Let us give them something to be proud of, let us ensure that they inherit 
<br/>a nation where diversity is celebrated, whether the bounds of trust are unbreakable and  where the 
<br/>ideals of democracy and humanity shine brighter than before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Commission will not solve all of Fiji's history but it is a beginning. It is a 
<br/>chance to  turn the page  not  by forgetting  the past  but  by learning  from  it.  It  is  an opportunity to 
<br/>declare with conviction that Fiji's best days lies ahead, not in spite of our history, but because we 
<br/>have chosen to confront it and grow for it. I urge every Member of this House to rise to this occasion. 
<br/>Let  us  seize  this  moment  with  gravity  and  hope,  the  hope  that  it  demands.  Let  us  establish  this 
<br/>Commission as a beacon of our commitment to truth, reconciliation and a united Fiji. Mr. Speaker, I 
<br/>support this motion that is before the House.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We now have two more speakers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address 
<br/></span><span>this  important  this  notion,  motion,  Bill  that  is  before  the  House  .  I  think  that  is  one  of  the  most 
<br/>important things that we have ever discussed in this Chambers as the honourable Faiyaz Koya has 
<br/>said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have sat here today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and listened to the various viewpoints that have 
<br/>been  expressed,  one  thing  that  gives  me  a  bit  of  comfort,  despite  the  differences  in  what  we  are 
<br/>saying, as I sit and listen to the different views, I sense a shared desire amongst all of us that are 
<br/>sitting in Parliament today discussing this. I sense that shared desire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the same vision of what we want; a better Fiji and we all know the things that have 
<br/>impacted on our country that is holding us back from achieving what we aspire to, which is that better 
<br/>Fiji. These are the sentiments that have come to me as have I sat here, gone in, come back inside, 
<br/>gone out, come back and the thing that comes to my mind is this novel that we read about when we 
<br/>were in secondary school, the novel of </span><span>Cry, the Beloved Country</span><span>. As I sat, I sense of crying for the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2479 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country  that  we  want  in  this  country  and  we  know  that  truth  and  reconciliation  are  part  of  the 
<br/>processes to get there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we look at the purpose of the Bill that we have, clause 3 is very clear. It talks about the 
<br/>importance  of  promoting  social  cohesion  through  healing  and  reconciliation.  Social  cohesion  is 
<br/>fundamentally  important  for  a  country  like  Fiji,  we  have  people  of  different  beliefs,  of  different 
<br/>ethnicities come together to be a country. We need that social cohesion, that cement that binds us 
<br/>together so that we can fully become what we can be as a country, and that maybe one day we can 
<br/>aspire to be the way the world should be as it was said years ago.    Later on, events have happened 
<br/>in our past that showed that maybe we were not the way the world should be. There were things that 
<br/>covered over. But then I think to my mind is something that is important for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, there have been various ways that we have tried to build this social cohesion. We have 
<br/>talked about the issue of the common name; common name so that everyone in this country have a 
<br/>sense of common identity in the country. I am glad now that the terminology of Fijian is something 
<br/>that has bind us together. These are the kinds of things that have a social cohesion; when we can 
<br/>identify together with a place, the common name that has come through gives us a common sense of 
<br/>identity and a focus away from ethnicity, which has been our big stumbling block over the years, to 
<br/>take us away from that view on just ethnicity. Look at other things related with class, the rich and 
<br/>those are not so well off, as more of a stronger focussed on the things that have held us back in the 
<br/>past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over and  above this, we have talked about  in  the Constitution, the development  of  socio-
<br/>economic rights, free education to lift people up. These are the things that bind us together. Social 
<br/>cohesion has come through this way, upward mobility, shelter, housing, good quality of life and for 
<br/>us, we talked about equal lease distribution, making all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> feel equally important, equally valid 
<br/>so that what we stood for, when the lease money comes you are equally valid, that gives you that 
<br/>sense of togetherness or social cohesion.  When you talk about social cohesion, one of the things that 
<br/>is important to get self-cohesion is action; things that you do so that you make the elements of society 
<br/>cohere together, they become one. That is something that we have been doing over the past few years, 
<br/>not perfectly, but it is something that was moving there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am trying to say here, Mr. Speaker, that healing also comes through action.  Healing 
<br/>through  action,  healing  and  reconciliation  come  from  shared  values  and,  I  believe  also  by  class 
<br/>equality; equality of all people within the country is something that we need to do.  Of course, the 
<br/>words that come to mind and all of us believe in this; all of us on this side, all of us on that side, we 
<br/></span><span>believe in this. Love your fellow man as you love yourself. There is no one that can say that they do 
<br/></span><span>not believe in that and that is what I have sensed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also truth, truth precedes reconciliation. When you have truth 
<br/>preceding a reconciliation, the output is trust.  When people understand the situation as it should be. 
<br/>The question for us is, can that truth be done by invitation only or sometimes do you have to compel 
<br/>the truth in order to get the reconciliation?  Maybe in some cases, and we believe, this is what we are 
<br/>talking about, sometimes that truth, you need a sense of compulsion to make it happen.  There are a 
<br/>lot of things happened in this country where people have not spoken the truth.  There are things in 
<br/></span><span>this country, we know some things happened, but the things that happened behind that, we do not 
<br/></span><span>know - 1987, 2000, 1977, all of these other things, we do not what happened behind it.  The figures 
<br/>that we can see, but we do not see the shadowy figures in the back, the ones who are pulling the 
<br/>strings.  That is part of the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You see the pons, but you do not see those who 
<br/>are pulling the strings, and that is a fundamental important part of getting to the truth.  So, without 
<br/>truth, how can we reconcile?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2480 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This question needs to be asked and known, who were the instigators?  Why do they go scot-
<br/>free?  Some people end up in prison but the real instigators, they go scot-free and we say for the rest 
<br/>of us, let us reconcile, even though these people are scot-free.  This is a very important part of talking 
<br/>about the truth.  Truth telling is critical and this is our point that truth-telling may require compulsion.  
<br/>We do not believe, the Bill as it is now has that element of compulsion that is strong.  To make that 
<br/>compulsion enviable, you cannot violate that sense of compulsion that makes sure that people will 
<br/>tell the truth where it needs to be told.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a major concern that we have from this side.  When you have that compulsion to tell 
<br/>the truth, then the trust will grow.  Trust is knowing who did what and why?   Who was behind it?  
<br/>Who are the shadowy figures that we have not seen?  Alot of time we limit our discussion to the 
<br/>pons, to the people whom we see, but not the shadowy figures in the background on what they did.  
<br/>Who were the movers and shakers?  If you want to reconcile, those movers and shakers must come 
<br/>clean because they hide behind veneers, curtains and rooms, and they hide in the darken alleys, in 
<br/>the little cupboards, you need a light to be shone so we can see.  That is all part of the truth that needs 
<br/>to come out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When this truth is apparent, the trust is built up, then the reconciliation can move forward.  
<br/>That is an important aspect.  People want truth.  This needs to be done in an environment where we 
<br/>deal with it transparently.  Those who started these things, they must come clean.  There must be 
<br/>systems and mechanisms and powers in this Bill that make sure that they are coming clean actually 
<br/>happens.  That is fundamental, and that is, I think, where the difference is.  We all want the same 
<br/>thing but we believe on this side that is lacking.  People want truth on things that have hurt them 
<br/>badly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Listening to the debate that we have here, we have seen the amount of hurt that has happened 
<br/>over  the  years  in  various  areas,  in  1987,  all  of  these  other  things;  Navosa  history,  </span><span>colo</span><span>  wars, 
<br/>indigenous slavery.  A lot of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> do not know about indigenous slavery.  They did not know what 
<br/></span><span>buli</span><span> used to do, take this person, give him to the estates.  All those kinds of things you do not know 
<br/>about, enforced labour in colonial times by the </span><span>buli</span><span>, </span><span>girmitiya, Navosavakadua</span><span>, whole villagers being 
<br/>taken from Ra, based in Kadavu, et cetera.  These were all part of our history.  A lot of people do not 
<br/>know about these things.  However, when that truth comes out, then we understand things, why they 
<br/>happened and that helps us to reconcile with what has happened to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Melanesian history, all of this in the sense of victimhood, in all of this, truth helps to get 
<br/>people through.   What truth?  This truth, the forces that drove what happened, whether it was colonial 
<br/></span><span>interest, power struggles, ethnonationalism, local elites who used the message of ethnonationalism 
<br/></span><span>to serve their own interests.   They talk ethno-nationalistic issues to serve their own purposes.  That 
<br/>is part of the truth.  All these needs to come out. All these needs to be illuminated.  People use that 
<br/>to serve their own message to get power, look after their own interests.  Religious fundamentalism 
<br/>was very powerful in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the things that need to be addressed, very touchy things, but we need to 
<br/>shine light on it, illuminate it and talk about it. So, who were the instigators? The spiders, that is part 
<br/>of the truth. I know that it is a very touchy subject, but we need to cauterize it and that truth will free 
<br/></span><span>us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, reconciliation unlike repentance is a symmetrical relationship. Repentance 
<br/>is different, I did something, I repent. Reconciliation means that both parties are in a symmetrical 
<br/>relationship, they need to be able to share truth. So that both parties can see each other’s side and 
<br/>then they can reconcile. If the truth is not given on both sides then how can they reconcile?  It is 
<br/>symmetrical relationship.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2481 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Catharsis happens when both parties come together and that is what we want. We want that 
<br/>better  country,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  I  have  been  reading  over  these  past  two  days  about  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation  Commission.    One  thing  I  have  realised,  one  of  the  quotes  that  I  have,  “these 
<br/>mechanisms, they are not created to take mankind to heaven but to save humanity from hell.” I have 
<br/>read that somewhere and I just wrote it down. I cannot remember where I saw it, but in one of the 
<br/>readings that I had.  That is what it is.  It cannot elevate you to that particular level but save you from 
<br/>going down to the depths of where you do not want to go.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another thing that is very important in all of these is impartiality and the perception that a 
<br/>person is impartial, that a system is impartial and those that are working the system are impartial. 
<br/>These are the things that build trust. If people feel that things are partial in the system or the players 
<br/>are partial, that is the thing that takes away trust. So, all Commissioners, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was 
<br/>thinking  about  this,  are  appointed  by  the  President.  There  is  no  control  over  by  us  on  who  those 
<br/>people are and there is no oversight, but the President is voted in by the Government of the day. So 
<br/>there could be in some minds see that as an undue influence of the Government on who the President 
<br/>appoints. It is very important that when we put the Commissioners together, everyone sees them as 
<br/>entirely impartial. This is one of the issues we think needs to be dealt with by us and looking at this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Representation of major parties has been suggested, it could build trust. Honourable Bulitavu 
<br/>has suggested maybe we should not put the politics into it but that is something that we need to weigh 
<br/>out. How do we make sure that the key players are not only impartial but seen as impartial?  They 
<br/>are perceived as impartial by all parties. That is fundamentally important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the Bill, the functions of the Bill focussed largely on the victims.  
<br/>That is okay, that is a good thing, but there is very little on the perpetrators. Hardly anything on the 
<br/>perpetrators except maybe clause 6(d) which talks about creating a platform for social accountability 
<br/>which  is  good  through  constructive  interchange  between  survivors.  But  that  is  just  creating  the 
<br/>platform,  and  clause  6(i),  which  talks  about  creating  a  platform  that  promotes  a  culture  of  truth, 
<br/>reconciliation and healing. But in both of these parts of clause 6, you do not find anything that holds 
<br/>perpetrators to account.  That, I think is an important element that is missing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noticed that in the Bill it says, the powers of the Commission can examine under oath but 
<br/>this issue that we are talking about, about the powers to summon. The honourable Sashi Kiran has 
<br/>said that the power to summon is now in clause 9 but in clause 9 it states in a procedure. If it is up to 
<br/>the  Commission,  a  procedure  is  up  to  Commission  whether  they  have  this  procedure  or  that 
<br/>procedure. If it is critical, the Commission must have the power to summons, this must be a policy, 
<br/></span><span>that must be inviable, that you cannot violate.  The only way that you can do that is by writing it in 
<br/></span><span>to the mother legislation itself, rather than leaving it to regulations or schedules which a Minister can 
<br/>change at his whim.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The things that are fundamentally important, they should be inviable, they must be written 
<br/>into  the  law  itself,  not  placed  in  a  procedure,  not  in  a  schedule,  not  a  regulation,  they  must  be 
<br/>embedded in the law itself. If it is critical, it should be protected so that it cannot be removed, it 
<br/>should be inviable, and that is one of the concerns that we have as you have heard from the various 
<br/>expressions that were made from this side of the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We do not want our Truth 
<br/></span><span>and Reconciliation Commission to be like a “cleanex” Commission, just a lot of emotional release 
<br/></span><span>but is easy going on perpetrators. That must not happen! We do not want this to be just an exercise 
<br/>for Government to legitimise itself by what it does, by putting everybody through the process of the 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without completing the process of truth telling, you can just kick the can down the road, but 
<br/>eventually  you  would  have  to  deal  with  it.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  there  is  an  ugly,  unresolved

<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>injustice and that is what have Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as you have listened to the comments, and there 
<br/>are many unresolved issues in this country.  We know! There are many of them before we became a 
<br/>country, before we became a colony.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of things that are embedded in our psyche, in the history of our parents, our 
<br/>tribes and our families, that are embedded there that are unresolved. And these are the kinds of things 
<br/>that pull at the fabric of society. And there is an opportunity to hold it out well and layout in the sun 
<br/>and deal with it in public through a trust commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, few other things that I want talk about, while the key purpose of the Bill is 
<br/>to facilitate open and free engagements, the Bill itself has failed to define what truth telling is. This 
<br/>as I have said before, is fundamentally important to this whole exercise. Part One, Section 32 appears 
<br/>to confine the purpose and work of the Commission to the </span><span>coup</span><span> periods.  This seems to eliminate 
<br/>those  in  in  other  things  beyond  the  coup  periods  and  some  of  those  things  have  already  been 
<br/>expressed in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I go with it at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker Sir, this is my concern, and I think we all 
<br/>agree. We all agree to the need for truth and reconciliation. Everybody in this country knows that we 
<br/>need truth in order to get to reconciliation. We agree that truth is necessary for reconciliation. We 
<br/>can  all  also  agree  that  the  right  process  brings  the  right  output  and  the  right  outcome.  And  my 
<br/>contention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill, as it is right now, is not strong enough in ensuring that the truth 
<br/>will come out. When the truth comes out entirely, those shadowy places that are in the dark shadows, 
<br/>when they come out and we can see that people can feel that the truth is known and that will help 
<br/>reconciliation. As I said, it has to be a symmetrical relationship between the parties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone has got a lot of hurt in them, that needs to be addressed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, the 
<br/>way forward that I see that this Bill needs to be improved. What we have here needs to be improved. 
<br/>The truth and reconciliation are needed. We need to be able to work on this together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  have  taken  this  to  consultation  as  part  of  the  executive.  We  need  the  legislature,  the 
<br/>people’s Parliament, which includes us on this side, to be part of that process. We have not been part 
<br/>of that process. We have not been part of that process of scrutiny. You have done as the Executive, 
<br/>Assistant Ministers have done that, but we need the legislature to do this and one of the most critical 
<br/>things in our history, so we need to be on this together. We need to join it together, all of us! We 
<br/>need to allow the full scrutiny of the people represented by the Members of Parliament on this Bill, 
<br/>not just the executive! Allow the in-depth scrutiny by the rest of the people, not just the executive. 
<br/></span><span>That is a fundamental of law 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I appeal to the honourable Prime Minister, please Sir, do not ride on the tyranny of the 
<br/>majority. Allow us all to participate, to review this Bill again, to improve it because we do not want 
<br/>to get this truth and reconciliation wrong. We have to make sure that it serves a purpose. We do not 
<br/>want to pass a Bill today and later on find that we had flaws on it, that we could have corrected if we 
<br/>had worked on improving this in partnership together in this Parliament.  Thank you very much, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by saying, that no one, in his 
<br/></span><span>or her right frame of mind will ever oppose or refuse to cooperate in a process that in my view and 
<br/>in the views of so many people in this country, is going to be a watershed moment in our independent 
<br/>history. Before I go on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me thank all the honourable Members who have spoken, 
<br/>and with their wisdom and experience including honourable Minister for Education, as the leader of 
<br/>the SODELPA Party have supported this Truth and Reconciliation Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I want to thank honourable Bulitavu, for unravelling the legal buffoonery that came from 
<br/>the other side, Mr. Speaker Sir, about elements of the various clauses in the Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Bill. Unfortunately, the honourable Leader of the Opposition got caught into that buffoonery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  to  say  this  to  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  that  as 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, it is all our duty to lead by example and desist playing what I 
<br/>call “gutter politics” by opposing this Bill, which in fact lays out the basis for putting a permanent 
<br/>closure to the darkest chapter of history of our independent nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I heard from the other side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of them who oppose the Bill said they know 
<br/>what is best for the nation. They said they support truth and reconciliation. No legislation ever passed 
<br/>in Parliament is going to be perfect, is going to have every nitty-gritty detail, every opinion covered 
<br/>in that law. That is why laws change, as time evolves, and as the need arises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  in  this  case,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  important  thing  is  this,  that  our  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister had the guts, had the courage in 1996 to work across the aisle, when he was in power. He 
<br/>had the Government on his side, but he worked on the other side and offered reconciliation, offered 
<br/>his hands of friendship and worked with the then Leader of the Opposition, Justice Jai Ram Reddy 
<br/>and delivered one of the world acclaimed 1997 Constitution. That was an act of reconciliation! That 
<br/>was an act of genuineness! And here again today, this honourable Prime Minister is again offering 
<br/>us and has set out to do what he tried to do and what he achieved in 1997 as part of this Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know in 2017, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we moved a motion for truth and reconciliation, same 
<br/>language was used that I heard from honourable Members today, that it will incite ill-will, hostility. 
<br/>This is what we heard, but nothing of value in life is ever easy. And if it is, indeed, invaluable to the 
<br/>social, political and economic advancement of our nation, the task becomes even harder. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, we discovered on 13</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 when a motion for Parliament to approve the 
<br/>establishment  of  a  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  moved  and  enable  articulated  by  the 
<br/>honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, a role that was given 
<br/>to  her  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  was  approved  despite  the  strong  resistance  from  the 
<br/>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the future back beacons. I know just a month ago the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition was reported in the media to be fully supportive of the Truth and Reconciliation Bill 
<br/></span><span>and the processes outlined in the then proposed legislation. As the honourable Minister for Defence 
<br/></span><span>said,  “we  thank  the  Commander  of  the  RFMF  for  leading  the  way  for  reconciliation  within  the 
<br/>Military” and honourable Naivalurua talked about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, truth and reconciliation or reconciliation and truth telling is not for the faint 
<br/>hearted, but it is the best way forward for a genuinely united and harmonious nation. It is a vital cog 
<br/>in  the  ongoing  task  of  the  Coalition  Government  to  reset  the  moral  compass  of  our  nation.  The 
<br/>Commission is a prerequisite to genuine healing, which is so crucial to our effort to make Fiji what 
<br/>we all want, the land of hope and opportunity. And again, I want to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/></span><span>this process  is not  going to  incite ill-will or hostility, nor impinge on rights  and freedoms of our 
<br/></span><span>people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot imagine and I cannot understand, when honourable Members from the other side are 
<br/>talking about ill-will and hostility being created as part of a truth and reconciliation process. You 
<br/>look at all the functions of the Commission, the process, cooperation, procedure everything that is in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div>
<div><span>2484 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, lays down the process, which is going to bring people together, which is 
<br/>not going to create ill-will and hostility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you know they talk about politics, yet they were all politicising 
<br/>and  politicking  when  opposing  the  Bill.  Prejudging  the  work  of  the  Commission.    Honourable 
<br/>Usamate, if  I heard him correctly, he said  “Oh,  His  Excellency the President is  appointed by the 
<br/>Parliament  and  by  the  Government”  and  by  extension,  he  was  implying  that  His  Excellency  the 
<br/>President is going to be impartial in appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. What 
<br/>an insult, Mr. Speaker. Sir!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, he might have breached the Standing Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by saying something 
<br/>like that and the Bill is very clear that this is going to be an Independent Commission, independent 
<br/>of the state, independent of political parties. How can that be politicised? The Government is bringing 
<br/>this Bill to Parliament, and as I said, we are not saying that every law that comes in this Parliament 
<br/>is going to be perfect!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But this Government, this Prime Minister has had the courage and the vision to bring it in this 
<br/>Parliament,  and  they  are  saying  “oh  we  want  to  support  this,  but  no,  we do  not  like  some  of  the 
<br/>provisions” that is a political throw away on all of those on the other side who are opposing this Bill 
<br/>hide behind, because they know that the people of this country want reconciliation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>they want it! They there already reconciling and yet they are the representatives of the people. This 
<br/>is an opportunity for them in this Parliament, if they do not like a certain elements of the law, I would 
<br/>have thought that they would support this Bill, that this is a step in the right direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  not  going  to  solve  every  little  problem  that,  Honourable,  Usamate,  was  talking 
<br/>whether it is education, health, infrastructure, social cohesion, merging interests, you know, he was 
<br/>almost like reading a first-year sociology assignment. We all know that! But the important thing, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in this reconciliation process, is leadership. We can disagree with little provisions here 
<br/>or there, but what is required in this, is leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leadership  is  about  averting  disaster  not  creating  conditions  in  which  it  thrives.  This  is  a 
<br/>quote  from  late  Justice  Jai  Ram  Reddy’s  speech  28  years  ago  and  he  further  said,  “creating  an 
<br/>environment conducive to unity can be a slow process.” There is no overnight solution. With genuine 
<br/>goodwill,  united  as  a  mighty  collective  force  and  a  willingness  to  sacrifice  personal  gains  in  the 
<br/>national interest, we can succeed. And this is precisely what the Honourable Prime Minister and this 
<br/>Government is trying to do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this Truth and Reconciliation Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I say a little bit more on one of the provisions, let me just respond. I 
<br/>think it is important to respond to some of the comments that were made by honourable Members 
<br/>from the other side, because people are listening to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it really pains me to hear Honourable Maharaj putting out the lies and the 
<br/>venom, and playing the same gutter politics that I think was being played by his former leaders, and 
<br/>in particular his former General-Secretary of now a dead party, I guess. But what is the need for those 
<br/>kind of lies and venom when we are talking about reconciliation? What is the need, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Sachida  Nand  was  talking  about  the  fact  that  the  report  will  only  go  to  the 
<br/>President. I mean, that shows a total lack of understanding. The Bill says that the recommendations 
<br/>of the Commission will go to the State. They have not actually read the Bill, and they are trying put 
<br/>that out as a shortcoming of the Bill and opposing it. And that is why I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2485 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are using this legal buffoonery, you know this misinterpretation and telling the people out there that 
<br/>this Bill is going to create ill-will hostility, bring pain and open up new wounds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how this effort, through the Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Bill, will do that! I am surprised that honourable Praveen Bala and honourable Alvick Maharaj, not 
<br/>just  today,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  a  leader,  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Women, 
<br/>Children and Poverty Alleviation, a woman leader of national  stature, someone who has done so 
<br/>much work in the NGO sector. This constant barrage of attacks on her, just because she is gaining 
<br/>the popularity of the people out there and they are worried about politics!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are saying do not play politics, but they were playing politics, because they want to pull 
<br/>her down.  Yet, she has done so much work in the last so many years, and particularly in the last two 
<br/>years in Parliament, and I take my hat off for her.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think from all the provisions in the Bill, and particularly section 6, 7, 8 
<br/>and 9, and particularly when you look at section 6, the functions of the Commission. It lays down 
<br/>very clearly what the Commission sets out to do.  It is just needs leadership and this Parliament and 
<br/>us as Members of Parliament, have a real one lifetime opportunity in this country, in this Parliament, 
<br/>to  bury the dark days  of the past.  We have this  opportunity.  I urge the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, to change his mind now! Because today in his speech, he has failed as a national leader! 
<br/>He had the opportunity to bring his group, but I know he has his own challenges in those group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, you will go down in 
<br/>history, and all those who will not support this Bill today will go down in history as betraying the 
<br/>people of this country and missing the one-time opportunity in this Parliament. One time opportunity 
<br/>in this Parliament to create history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  you  have  the  opportunity  now!    This  is  your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moment! Support this Bill, or else you will go down in history as a weak leader, weak in… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …standing on the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …weak in standing on the truth, weak in getting your group 
<br/>in a direction, and you will go down in history as living with the legacy of the past leaders that you 
<br/>were part of. I urge you, honourable Members on the other side, please support this Bill! This Bill is 
<br/>the right Bill, it is timely, it is appropriate, and this is going to create history!  If you want to be part 
<br/></span><span>of history, support the Bill, otherwise you are not part of this history that we are going to create, and 
<br/></span><span>this honourable Prime Minister is going to create for this country. I support this Bill very strongly, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call upon the honourable Prime Minister to speak in reply, if  I 
<br/>may offer some clarification. In my trade, it is called non-binding unsolicited views on certain issues 
<br/>that were raised by the Members. It may help one fully to understand the Bill before you. On the 
<br/>interpretation to be accorded to Section 9, and the powers of the Commission through the subpoena 
<br/>witnesses, I am very much drawn to the views of honourable Bulitavu in how Section 9 should be 
<br/></span><span>understood and interpreted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of consultations and the Committee’s not visiting certain areas and hear victims, 
<br/>the Committee’s consultations in my understanding was not for hearing of victims, although they did 
<br/>hear some of them in the process. Consultations was for the purpose of building the legal frame for 
<br/>the complaints and even confessions to be heard. And that is where we are now, under Clause 15, 
<br/>that provides a mechanism for hearing from those victims.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said these are purely for clarifications over doubts that may exist, again, its non-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>binding and unsolicited. I now invite the honourable Prime Minister to speak in light of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their contributions. It has been very enlightening, and I mentioned the other day, that I had tried to 
<br/>move this motion in the Business Committee when I was Leader of the Opposition, but the very same 
<br/>reasons coming up today, that it would open up old wounds, also came up at the Business Committee 
<br/>at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of Opposition and the honourable Usamate were both at that Business 
<br/>Committee Meeting, as well as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. What happened then, was I 
<br/>had tried to introduce this as an opposition motion, to avoid the pit falls of 1987, 2000 and 2006. So 
<br/>that we move forward with our eyes open knowing why Rabuka did what he did, why George Speight 
<br/>did what he did, and so on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But that was not accepted, and two weeks later, you know, when I came back and said well 
<br/>those are the eyes of March. On 15</span><span>th</span><span> March, this year was the sad shooting in Christchurch. They had 
<br/>not gotten to the bottom of the differences that existed in their country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all those that have contributed, and I thank you for your clarification, 
<br/>and I would just like to say that my contributions, I shared at the Committee under the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation had many consultations. I did not 
<br/>say, that they went all over the country, everywhere and consulted with everyone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They said  they had many consultations with  victims and perpetrators of  different  political 
<br/>events. Consultations were held with civil societies, faith-based groups, human rights activists, media 
<br/>organisations, political parties, communities in the North, West and Central divisions. They did not 
<br/>say that they went everywhere, honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The functioning of the Commission is very clear in the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir. From day one, 
<br/>I had stayed clear of the preparatory work for the Bill, because so many people are always pointing 
<br/>at me. They probably thought that I would hijack the Committee, but I congratulate them for finishing 
<br/>their  work  and  coming  to  the  Parliament  with  the  draft  Bill.  The  Commission  will  operate 
<br/>independently and will be reporting to His Excellency, the President by nature and virtue of their 
<br/>appointment as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill itself says it applies to the State, the State is obliged to act. I have highlighted the 
<br/></span><span>part here on that section which says that the report is submitted and the State has to act. So, it is not 
<br/>a  toothless  Commission,  the  State  must  state  the  recommendations  for  the  State  implementation 
<br/>Section  17.  The  State  must  take  reasonable  measures  within  its  available  resources  to  implement 
<br/>recommendations provided in the final report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not a toothless Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I once again thank everyone who has 
<br/>contributed.  Government will continue to do all within its power to act with the existing law to allow 
<br/>people to come and present themselves before the Commission without in any way being subjected 
<br/></span><span>to fear, intimidation or violence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Life will go on normally, and people will be able to present their views freely. We have to 
<br/>expect  the  media  as  well  as  those  who  act  as  keyboard  warriors  through  the  social  media  to  act 
<br/>responsibly  as  well.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  assurances  of  our  most  highest  consideration,  I 
<br/>recommend this Bill to the House and respectfully request that the question be now put.
