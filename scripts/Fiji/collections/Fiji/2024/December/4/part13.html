<div><span>COP29 Meeting at Baku, Azerbaijan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to deliver a 
<br/>statement on Fiji delegation’s engagement at COP29 which concluded on 24</span><span>th</span><span> November in Baku, 
<br/>Azerbaijan. The Government has recognised climate change  as the greatest security threat  of our 
<br/>times  and  one  that  we  cannot  address  alone.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  acknowledges  the 
<br/>importance of engaging in multilateral processes such as the climate change Conference of the Parties 
<br/>(COP), to ensure our voices are heard and the challenges we face are recognised and addressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I provide an update on COP29 outcomes, I would like to extend my 
<br/>sincere and deep gratitude to all civil servants and officials involved in preparation for COP29 and 
<br/>their direct engagement in the negotiations held in Baku. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to take this opportunity also to thank the honourable Prime Minister for giving me the 
<br/>opportunity  to  lead the  Fiji  Delegation this year, and for his  advocacy and leadership both  at  the 
<br/>regional level, and at the international level.  I would also like to acknowledge our chief negotiator, 
<br/>PS Shivendra Michael,  Ambassador Amena Yauvoli, and other senior people within the team for 
<br/>providing  timely  and  expert  advice  across  the  agenda  items  and  throughout  what  was  very 
<br/>contentious and difficult negotiation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were very well prepared this year.  Led by the Ministry of Environment 
<br/>and  Climate  Change  with  support  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  we  organised  technical  working 
<br/>group meetings, prepared well-consulted policy briefs, prepared a communications strategy and held 
<br/>pre-departure delegation briefings for both  Ministers and government  officials.   In the interest  of 
<br/>transparency and accountability, we announced the Fiji Government delegation, disclosed how much 
<br/>government funds were being utilised and funding sources for delegates, and held press conferences 
<br/>to answer any questions from the media and public, unlike of what we saw in previous years 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  always  our  intention  that  this  process  be  people-centred  and  contact  sensitive, 
<br/>transparent and accountable.  This year, Fiji took a 57-member delegation to COP.  Ninety percent 
<br/>(90  percent)  of  the  delegates  were  fully  funded  by  external  partners  and  through  funding 
<br/></span><span>arrangements  in  place  annually  to  support  the  Small  Island  state  participation  in  these  critical 
<br/></span><span>meetings.  The total cost of the COP29 engagement to Government was only FJ$239,000 contrary to 
<br/>some of the misinformation or disinformation with figures such as $6 million, et cetera, put out by 
<br/>people outside of this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  we  ensured  that  our  delegation  was  interagency  and  multi-stakeholder, 
<br/>engaging  various  ministries,  indigenous  people  reps,  youth,  academia  and  even  Members  of  the 
<br/>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the few countries at COP which had in our delegation the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Leader of the Opposition and two other members. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition for his participation and for his contribution and support to the 
<br/>delegation in Baku. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to say Mr. Speaker, Sir, that government had made a strategic decision at 
<br/>this  COP  to  send  a  larger  ministerial  delegation,  due  to  the  high  political  nature  of  this  year’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>negotiations  and  the  decisions  which  allowed  us to  engage  fully  when  key  unsolved  negotiations 
<br/>issues were taken to the ministerial levels for decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  year Fiji  identified 14 priority thematic engagement  areas including 
<br/>climate  finance,  loss  and  damage,  oceans,  mitigation,  adaptation,  indigenous  people  and  local 
<br/>communities  and  gender,  to  name  a  few  among  others.    There  were  over  90  agenda  items  under 
<br/>discussion and our negotiators worked in teams to cover all relevant items. Each thematic area was 
<br/>assigned a ministerial lead, thematic lead, core lead, and support officials.  I must say that it is a 
<br/>testament to the dedication and commitment of the Fiji Government delegation that we were able to 
<br/>not  only  cover  each  priority  thematic  area,  but  also  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  influence  outcomes  at  key 
<br/>junctures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing the climate crisis is not just crucial for our environment, it is 
<br/>crucial  for  protecting  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  Fijian  people,  and  protecting  the  stability  and 
<br/>growth of our economy. To be able to respond effectively to the scale of the challenge that we face 
<br/>as small island state, we need to face and access predictable and adequate climate financing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, COP29 in Baku was dubbed “the finance COP”, because all parties were 
<br/>mandated to agree to a new target for the amount of climate financing that parties would commit to 
<br/>deploy annual to support developing country.  This new target was required to replace the current 
<br/>target to deploy US$100 billion per year as climate finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new target referred to as the New Collecting Quantified Goal (NCQG) has been under 
<br/>negotiation for over two years and was required to be agreed at COP29.  And given this slow progress 
<br/>to date, to  reduce global emissions and support resilience-building, developing countries urgently 
<br/>require financing to implement both their mitigation commitments and adaptation plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  COP29,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  negotiation  teams  worked  diligently  to  secure  the  best 
<br/>possible  outcome  across  the  negotiation  streams.    In  many  cases  both  ministers  and  negotiators 
<br/>started their day early in the morning, at 6am sometimes, and often finishing in the early hours of the 
<br/>next morning sometimes as far as 3.00 a.m. or 4.00 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  face  many  challenges  given  the  state  of  current  geopolitics,  and  in  the  final  days  of 
<br/>COP29, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) were left 
<br/>with  no  choice  but  to  walk  out  of  the  negotiation  room  as  our  priorities  had  not  been  properly 
<br/>accounted  for  within  the  financial  decision  text  that  was  before  us.    Although  the  situation  was 
<br/></span><span>politically and technically challenging, these actions serve to increase the ambition and ensured that 
<br/></span><span>there was no risk that the parties would adopt decisions that represented a step backwards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji,  Barbados  and  Samoa,  as  well  as  high-level  representatives  from  least  developed 
<br/>countries and the European Union, the US and others including Australia, constituted a small group 
<br/>of  15  individuals  that  in  a  closed  room  setting  negotiated  to  salvage  the  COP29  finance  deal. 
<br/>Together, SIDS and LDCs represented the majority of developing countries, and we used our weight 
<br/>as  SIDS  and  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States  (AOSIS),  as  a  joint  block  to  push  for  progress  and 
<br/>ambition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  final  outcome  falls  short  of  our  expectations,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  represents  a 
<br/>significant improvement from the original version. In fact, it does not cross our redlines.  The final 
<br/>COP29 decision on the new quantified collective goals fall for climate financing from all public and 
<br/>private sources to reach US$1.3 trillion per year by 2035.  Within that goal, is the commitment to 
<br/>ensure that developed countries take the lead on providing US$300 billion per year by 2035.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>2398 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While this goal represents a tripling of the financing floor, developed countries are currently 
<br/>committed and it sits within the broader the US$1.3 trillion-goal.  I know the deal has been criticised 
<br/>for  seeking  to  achieve  the  $300  billion through a  wide  variety  of  sources  and  for  the  decision  to 
<br/>include contributions from developing countries to multi-lateral development banks within the scope 
<br/>of the sources contributing to this target.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  as  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  would  know,  the  discussion  on  the 
<br/>contributor base took a lot of time, particularly in the first week, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  While this is a 
<br/>pronounced challenge for some of the larger and wealthier high emitting developing countries, it is 
<br/>less  of  an  issue  in  our  context  and  circumstances.  And  we  can  take  some  comfort  with  the 
<br/>understanding  that  an  increase  has  been  committed  alongside  elements  of  the  decision  which 
<br/>recognise the need to address many of the access issues we face. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision includes commitments to support nationally led approaches and simplify access 
<br/>to international climate funds.  While the decision fall short of the direct commitment to scale our 
<br/>financing  for  loss  and  damage,  it  does  recognise  loss  and  damage  issues  and  includes  specific 
<br/>mention of the need to develop new and specific solutions for SIDS and LDCs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the AOSIS’s position which includes us, the Pacific Small Island 
<br/>Developing States, we initially went into the negotiating room with a US$39 billion finance floor 
<br/>that, obviously, was not acceptable, but we see the US$300 billion as a floor and we feel that a large 
<br/>chunk of that should be available for small island developing states.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  significant  event,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  operationalisation  of  the  Loss  and 
<br/>Damage fund. In fact, the World Bank is going to be the financial intermediary, and we hope that all 
<br/>the mechanisms and processes, the board for the fund for responding to Loss and Damage has also 
<br/>been appointed. We are hoping that by at least 2026, Small Island Developing States would be able 
<br/>to access some of those funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this new finance goal will replace the previous US$100 billion per year target, 
<br/>and despite some of the gaps in the cohesiveness of the decision, Government will work to ensure 
<br/>that the new targets and commitments are seen through in our engagement with development partners 
<br/>and international climate funds. We have no choice but to hold parties to account, and to ensure this 
<br/>deal will translate into the new and additional financing we need urgently to increase and scale up 
<br/>our response to climate change here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other important outcomes Mr. Speaker, Sir, achieved this year, include progress to further 
<br/></span><span>agree on guidance and rules for carbon market mechanisms. The honourable Prime Minister talked 
<br/>about this the other day, and the agreement on new guidelines for transparent climate reporting. The 
<br/>extension of the enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender (LWPG) and climate change and a 
<br/>decision  confirming  the  institutional  arrangements  between  the  Fund  for  responding  to  loss  and 
<br/>damage and the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one other issue that we advocated very strongly and pushed for was the 
<br/>funding  allocation  for  the  new  Pacific  Resilience  Fund  (PRF),  which  the  Economic  Ministers, 
<br/></span><span>including  Australia  and  New  Zealand  agreed  for  Tonga  to  host  the  Secretariat.  That  fund  we  are 
<br/></span><span>targeting US$250 million by the end of this year. And I know Australia and New Zealand have both 
<br/>committed significant funding towards the Pacific Resilience Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are hoping that by 2026 that fund will also be operational and that a lot of those funding 
<br/>that would be available for Pacific Island countries. In fact, the decision to set up the PRF was a 
<br/>decision of the Pacific Islands. It was approved by the Finance Ministers this year. We are going to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have  a  special  Finance  Ministers  meeting  in  March  to  ensure  that  all  the  legal,  financial  and 
<br/>institutional mechanisms are put in place and that the fund would be ready and available for Pacific 
<br/>Island countries by 2026. The other advantage of that fund, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be that a lot of 
<br/>those could be localised at the community level, to build community resilience for the Pacific Islands 
<br/>in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that I was actually feeling very good, and I must say that I was 
<br/>proud of the leadership our delegation across the COP29 Negotiations. Fiji was appointed as the G77 
<br/>and China coordinator for adaptation, where they were entrusted to coordinate a group of 134 member 
<br/>States. Our officials continued to coordinate Pacific priorities in relation to loss and damage proactive 
<br/>engagement in the board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  our  PS  for  Environment  and  Climate  Change  was  selected  as  co-chair  of  the 
<br/>Oceans and Climate Change Dialogue alongside Brazil and Belgium. And again, this was negotiated 
<br/>by us through our respective grouping in bilateral meetings. And Fiji worked with the large friends 
<br/>of  the  Ocean  Constituency  to  agree  on  the  landscape  and  the  language  of  the  Annual  Ocean 
<br/>Statement,  which  was  delivered  on  behalf  of  93  parties  in  the  closing  plenary  by  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary for Environment and Climate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Beyond the negotiations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ministerial high-level delegation, along with 
<br/>relevant officials, engaged in various side events and in bilateral meetings and stakeholder meetings.  
<br/>The Ministers were there, explored a range of new and emerging potential partners to support our 
<br/>efforts  and  the  delegation,  through  these  engagements  and  the  media,  amplified  Fiji's  needs, 
<br/>challenges, achievements in ways that will continue to unlock benefits beyond the scope of COP29. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ultimately, we have to understand that this is multilateral process and there 
<br/>are always going to be difficult challenges, compromises and trade-offs to navigate. But I must say 
<br/>that again Fiji played a very important role. Fiji was seen as a leader amongst the AOSIS group and 
<br/>our negotiators lived up to those expectations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to always remember who we do this for.  And we must continue to 
<br/>work with the volition and willingness to overcome the challenges put in place by those that resist 
<br/>the science and its implications. Our future depends on it, our children and grandchildren depend on 
<br/>us as leaders to ensure that there is a sustainable future forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr.   Speaker, Sir,  I want  to  thank  all those who were part  of the delegation, 
<br/></span><span>including those who were funded by other agencies, but had the Fiji badge and were part of the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>delegation and supported the Fiji delegation in all our negotiations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  acknowledge  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister  and Minister for Finance for his leadership and thank him for his Ministerial Statement. As 
<br/>he alluded to in his Statement, I was part of the delegation, but now I am giving my response as the 
<br/></span><span>Leader of the Opposition again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did caution the independent members who attended from the Opposition. 
<br/>We  are  here  as  delegation,  national  delegation,  let  us  look  at  national  priorities  that  respect  the 
<br/>leadership, but at the same time make the most of the opportunity to learn from COP. Because just 
<br/>by attending one COP it does not mean you understand COP. Know the intricacies, complexities and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>2400 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the diversities in COP and let alone the politics of COP. I will come back to that later, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all understand the importance of Fiji’s participation to COP29 or COP conferences for 
<br/>that matter. They are global gatherings where 190 plus nations come together to address the urgent 
<br/>crisis of climate change as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I do not have to go 
<br/>back into it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We went into COP29 with high expectations - a finance COP. But let us not beat around the 
<br/>bushes as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not been able to achieve, and our expectations were not 
<br/>met. And that is something probably beyond to our control, but more to the developed countries.  But 
<br/>of course, the fight  does not  stop,  and we need to  continue. And not  only  fighting, but  of course 
<br/>diplomacy as well, and that needs to start even after now for next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The promises from way back in 2009, the new collective quantify goal, we still fall short, and 
<br/>we made our demands.  Again, this is very important because of Article 2 of the Paris Agreement of 
<br/>the 1.5, particularly for the Small Island Development States. Because now in COP they are trying 
<br/>to dilute the voices of the United Nations particularly the special circumstances of SIDS and there is 
<br/>a lot of effort now in trying to quieten that voice. And for us it is very important because 1.5 is to 
<br/>stay alive as the late Foreign Affairs Minister of Marshall Island, Tony de Brum usually mentioned 
<br/>in previous COPs, Mr Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the financing is very important, but we are not there yet. And particularly for us, the link 
<br/>to the other articles whether it is on loss and damage, whether it is on adaptation and mitigation, as 
<br/>alluded to by the Finance Minister, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The delegation. Do we really need to send a big delegation? I leave that to Government to 
<br/>answer, but I know that Government has learned their lessons from what they used to say in the past. 
<br/>We know that this is the biggest existential threat that faces Fiji and the Pacific Island countries. And 
<br/>we  need  our  voice  in  COP.  But  I  leave  that  question  to  Government  to  answer  it,  because 
<br/>unfortunately a Cabinet Member questioned the delegation in a … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …very irresponsible. As raised in the Point of Order on Monday, 
<br/>but I will ask the honourable Prime Minister to sort that out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is very unbecoming 
<br/></span><span>of a Cabinet Minister to raise such question on the delegation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  on  29</span><span>th </span><span>  October,  an  article  by  Maureen 
<br/>Penjueli stated that, or asked this question, is Fiji losing its global standing? Probably that is what 
<br/>provoked Government to send a big delegation. At the same time, I know that we are investing in 
<br/>our young talents as well, but sort that out Government, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will sum up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just allow me probably a minute.  We need to prepare now 
<br/></span><span>for the next COP.  I stated last year when we came back from COP, that Fiji’s delegation needed 
<br/>better organisation for greater impact.  I know that the preparations have been good, but there are 
<br/>still a lot that we can do now.  We do it now! Not wait for the next COP. Not wait for the next few 
<br/>months. The first thing that Government needs to do now is call for a debrief.  A hot wash or an after-
<br/>action review, whatever you want to call it, let us do a debrief now!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  debrief  must  also  bring  in  the  technical  people,  the 
<br/>negotiators, Ministers, and of course, diplomacy as well, because now the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister  learned  his  lesson.    I  raise  the  issue  about  diplomacy,  because  when  we  are  stuck,  our 
<br/>technical people are telling us, “Oh, the developed countries are telling us this”, but we have friends 
<br/>in the developed countries.  That is where diplomacy plays a very critical role. Going back to the 
<br/>delegation, this is something that we need to consider. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, thank you for allowing me to say this.  I would suggest to your good office, in the 
<br/>parliamentary workshops that we are doing. let us a workshop on multilateralism and regionalism 
<br/>because according to the foreign policy statement that was released lately by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, that is a force multiplier to our foreign policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every member of the delegation and especially Ministers, you can just go and read the piece 
<br/>of paper that is given to you by the technical team, but you do not understand COP.  You do not 
<br/>understand the politics of COP.  That is why we need to have some sessions on multilateralism and 
<br/>regionalism. He is talking about AOSIS, Pacific SIDS, G77, that is regionalism into multilateralism, 
<br/>and how we use diplomacy to get our issues across.  There is a lot to discuss, I look forward to the 
<br/>debrief, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I will ask the honourable Prime Minister to sort out the 
<br/>issue between the honourable Minister for Sugar and the rest of the delegation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I now invite the Leader of the Group of Nine bloc or his designate for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I want to thank the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, Professor Biman Prasad for the Ministerial Statement.  I also want to acknowledge 
<br/>this leadership at COP29. I also want to say my big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to the entire Fiji contingent that 
<br/>participated in the many events, the talks, the discussions and the negotiations during COP29.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, it is great that our nation has a seat at the table, obviously for the 
<br/>support, and I agree that it is vital for us to ensure that the voices of Fijians and the small island 
<br/>nations are heard on this global 
<br/>stage.  However, while participation at COP is undoubtedly important, it is equally essential that we 
<br/>ground our climate change response in a strategy that empowers us as a nation and people, and not 
<br/>just passive recipients of external solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must not only be part of discussions but must also focus on building our 
<br/></span><span>own agency and resilience. We must invest in our capacity to respond to climate change in ways that 
<br/></span><span>are both practical and culturally appropriate for Fiji. Our knowledge, our indigenous knowledge and 
<br/>traditions, and our local solutions should not just complement international efforts, they should be 
<br/>the foundation of our strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me highlight a critical point –our indigenous knowledge.  In our villages across Fiji, we 
<br/>have seen that local community-driven solutions are often effective.  Taking for example, the </span><span>nana</span><span>
<br/>traditional practices in Rewa, using mangrove plants to prevent riverbank erosion.  This is a solution 
<br/>grounded in centuries of local knowledge and is proving not only to be cost effective, but sustainable. 
<br/></span><span>However,  we  often  see  these  local  solutions  sidelined  or  overshadowed  by  foreign-designed 
<br/></span><span>interventions.  The  seawalls,  while  important,  can  be  expensive  and  impractical  for  many  of  our 
<br/>communities. They are not the only answer, nor should they be the only solution to every problem 
<br/>we  face.  Instead,  we  need  to  invest  in  scaling  up  awareness  and  application  of  our  indigenous 
<br/>practices.

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>nana</span><span> system in Rewa is one example, but there are many other such practices throughout 
<br/>Fiji that could be adapted and replicated in other vulnerable areas. What we need is a national strategy 
<br/>that blends the best of both worlds: global knowledge and local wisdom.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The solutions that come from foreign experts are valuable, but they must be combined with 
<br/>the creativity and resilience that comes from our own people. By recognising and investing in our 
<br/>own knowledge systems, we do not only strengthen our response to climate change, but also position 
<br/>ourselves as leaders in the global conversation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is crucial to tell the world about our vulnerabilities: our rising seas 
<br/>levels,  our  disappearing  shorelines  and  the  impacts  on  our  way  of  life,  it  is  equally  important  to 
<br/>celebrate our agency. We must change the narrative. Instead of focussing solely on what we lack, let 
<br/>us shine a light on the incredible ways in which our communities are really adapting, innovating and 
<br/>finding solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not a story of helplessness; it is a story of resilience, of ingenuity and of hope. At 
<br/>COP29 and beyond, Fiji should be proud to showcase both our needs and our strengths. Yes, we need 
<br/>support from the international community, but we must also be clear, that we are not begging for 
<br/>help. We are asking for partnerships based on mutual respect, recognising that we too have much to 
<br/>contribute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, while international platforms like COP29 are vital for raising awareness and 
<br/>forging global alliances, let us not forget that the effective climate change solutions come from the 
<br/>ground up – from the communities who live the reality of climate change every day.  Let us invest in 
<br/>these local solutions, build on our traditional knowledge and move forward with the confidence that 
<br/>we the people of Fiji, have the agency to chart our own course in the fight against climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the immense work and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his great leadership at COP29.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I want to thank the honourable Tuinaceva for his response on behalf of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the G9 Bloc.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members,  I think it is an appropriate time to suspend our proceedings for our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, firstly I would like to apologise  for the late start of 
<br/>this session.  The Secretary-General and I have been meeting with the President of the Australian 
<br/>Senate, the honourable Sue Lines and her Australian delegation for the purpose of strengthening our 
<br/>link, our relationship with the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Walesi Technical and Financial Investigation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji who 
<br/>may be listening to this broadcast through Walesi or livestreaming or on radio today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to present to this esteemed Parliament the findings of the Walesi 
<br/>Pte Limited. It consists of two parts - Part 1 is the Technical Assessment of Fiji's Digital Television 
<br/>Transmission  Setup  and  Part  2  is  the  Special  Audit  on  Walesi's  Financial  Management  and 
<br/>Governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  someone  in  this  Parliament  in  the  last  few  days  brought  the  words 
<br/>“inaptitude” and “incompetence” on the People’s Coalition Party.  All I can say, Sir, through this 
<br/>report, right back at you to the other side of the Parliament.  From the outset, Mr. Speaker Sir, these 
<br/>findings reveal a troubling legacy left by the previous government, one marked by mismanagement, 
<br/>lack of transparency and a reckless disregard for public resources.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I stand here today with absolute clarity, recalling the relentless boasts of the 
<br/>previous government about the so-called Digital Television Initiative. They hailed it as one of their 
<br/>proudest legacies but let me be unequivocal.  Walesi, under their leadership, was no legacy. It is a 
<br/>travesty.  A  colossal  failure  wrapped  in  incompetence,  mismanagement  and  empty  promises.  The 
<br/>governance - reckless.  The planning - non-existent. The execution – a national shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Walesi  was  not  a  triumph.  It  was  a  stain.  A  glaring  example  of  arrogance  and  neglect,  a 
<br/>testament to how low leadership can sink when blinded by vanity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a disgrace, 
<br/>and the people of this nation deserve better than the hollow wreckage they have left behind.  Under 
<br/>the guise of modernisation, they pursued an agenda of control. The now-repealed Media Industry 
<br/>Development  Act  is  a  testament  to  this.    A  law  that  stifled  media  freedom  under  the  pretence  of 
<br/></span><span>development. Today, as we examine the results of these investigations, it is evident that Walesi was 
<br/></span><span>yet another instrument in their flawed agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I share to this august House and the people of Fiji the findings of 
<br/>Walesi  Audit,  I  would  like  to  make  one  important  point.    Digital  Telestrial  Television  (DTT)  is 
<br/>undeniably a vital asset for a developing nation like Fiji, offering access to information education 
<br/>and  public  services,  including  broadcasting  of  our  parliamentary  sessions.    But,  Mr.  Speaker,  if 
<br/>implemented  properly  and  managed  well,  it  represents  progress  and  opportunity  for  Fijians.  
<br/>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the service has value, its implementation under that side of the 
<br/></span><span>House was plagued by poor management and governance, lack of accountability and oversight.  I 
<br/></span><span>will share part one of the findings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the technical assessment was conducted with the assistance of the International 
<br/>Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  and  engagement  of  an  international  expert  in  digital  terrestrial 
<br/>television, who has uncovered systemic flaws in the design and implementation of Walesi’s digital 
<br/>television network: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Non-compliance with regulatory standards 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Walesi failed to obtain the necessary operating and spectrum licenses for its operations, 
<br/>so you can argue it was operating illegally.  This not only exposed our nation to risks 
<br/>of interference from critical services like civil aviation, but this reflects poor oversight 
<br/>and negligence in complying with basic international telecommunication obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Limited accessibility 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While Walesi provided free set-up boxes to low-income households, encryption policies 
<br/>forced families earning over $30,000 annually to purchase proprietary services which 
<br/>are  supposedly  “Free-to-Air”  services.    This  undermined  the  principle  of  universal 
<br/>accessibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Suboptimal Network Design 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the network was implemented using a Multi-Frequency Network (MFN), 
<br/>a model which has significantly higher operational costs compared to the most efficient 
<br/>Single-Frequency  Network  (SFN)  which  is  recognised  globally  for  providing  better 
<br/>coverage  and cost-efficiency,  especially  in countries like ours.  This  basic failure of 
<br/>planning reflects lack of foresight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Poor Technology Choices 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite  the  global  standards  in  2016  pointing  to  the  transition  to  more  modern 
<br/>technology  the H.265/HEVC codec, the network instead utilised H.264 codec.  This 
<br/>decision Mr. Speaker, meant that over 200,000 set-top boxes distributed at significant 
<br/>public cost, were outdated from the beginning and the question was not “if” but “when” 
<br/>these would need to be replaced, making this an absolute waste of public funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>No Sustainable Operating Model 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  review  highlighted  the  absence  of  a  sustainable  framework  for 
<br/>Walesi’s operations.  There was no structured revenue model, no strategic pricing for 
<br/>broadcastings  utilising  the  network,  and  no  long-term  plan  for  infrastructure 
<br/>maintenance.  This  was  a  fundamental  failure  to  think  beyond  the  immediate.  
<br/>Incompetence and inaptitude. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The special audit or the financial audit into Walesi’s operations paint even a bleaker 
<br/>picture.  One of fiscal irresponsibility, poor governance and outright waste: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Mismanagement of Public Funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  2015  to  December  2022,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  side  of  the  House  disbursed  a 
<br/>staggering $123.6 million to Walesi. Despite this massive investment, the company has 
<br/>remained  heavily  reliant  on  Government  funding,  due  to  its  inability  to  generate 
<br/>sufficient  revenue.    Mr.  Speaker,  10  payments  totalling  $9.3  million,  could  not  be 
<br/>substantiated,  as  relevant  documentation  was  missing.    This  lack  of  records  made  it 
<br/>impossible  to  confirm  whether  these  payments  complied  with  the  funds  intended 
<br/>purpose or legal requirements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit was also unable to identify the actual cost of the project against the budget. 
<br/></span><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no budget and so the detailing of cost was not really 
<br/>transparent. However, as reported by the report, an analysis based on the purchase of 
<br/>inventories  and  additions  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  between  2015  and  2022 
<br/>indicates that project costs exceeded $70 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Procurement Violations and Governance</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2405 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Procurement regulations were routinely ignored. In fact, Sir, there was never a tender 
<br/>on  anything  in  Walesi.  High-value  contracts,  including  a  $3.6  million  project 
<br/>management contract were awarded without tendering. In fact, the tenders were waived.  
<br/>The Project Manager for the DTTV Project, who got paid $3.6 million for the duration, 
<br/>revealed some very interesting facts, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review by the audit revealed the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The scope of work was very broad; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The deliverables and timeline were not detailed; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The contract did not have a closure and cost limit 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Additionally,  progress  reports  were  never  submitted  to  the  Board  in  a  consistent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>There was no evidence to indicate the projects were properly monitored, as there was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no documentation provided during the audit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>There was no closure or status report provided when the consultant exited.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>There was no evidence also to confirm that there was a proper handover performed by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Project Manager on the termination of the contract. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the facts, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on top of this $2.2 million of red-flow batteries, 
<br/>purchased  for backup or discarded due to  improper storage  – a shocking  wastage of 
<br/>taxpayers’ money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poor project management was highlighted very heavily, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the report 
<br/>and other things that I mentioned exemplify these issues. On top of that, Walesi did not 
<br/>even have a contract register of authorised vendors from 2015 to 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  beyond  that,  Walesi  was  operating  without  after  strategic  plan  for 
<br/>years. Basic policies, including risk management and procurement frameworks were 
<br/>either absence or incomplete. These lapses allowed inefficiencies and irregularities to 
<br/>flourish unabated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on top of that, as we have seen through that side of the House with so 
<br/>many  delays  in  financial  reporting.  This  is  what  the  re-audit  report  said  -  timely 
<br/>financial reporting and publishing of audited financial statements by public entities are 
<br/>indicators of good financial management that demonstrate transparency, accountability 
<br/></span><span>lay use of public resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financials for Walesi were totally delayed, which is again a sad 
<br/>indictment on this whole affair.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Ambiguity in the Legal Framework</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audit revealed significant gaps in the legal framework governing 
<br/>Walesi</span><span>.</span><span> The 100 percent government-owned company was not even covered under the 
<br/>Public  Enterprises  Act,</span><span> </span><span>further  weakening  oversight  mechanisms  and  accounting 
<br/>structures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these findings obviously suggest a high level of mismanagement and 
<br/>waste, and in addition potential breaches of the law. As such this Government will not 
<br/>stand by idly. I wish to assure this august House that the findings of the technical report, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>2406 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as  well  as  the  Special  Audit  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission 
<br/>Against Corruption today for further investigation and action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, any  evidence of abuse, misrepresentation  or fraudulent activity will be 
<br/>pursued to the fullest extent of the law.  The findings of these investigations are a sad 
<br/>indictment on the previous regime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Shame  on  them!  They  demand  immediate  action  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>safeguard public resources and restore trust in our institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Walesi does have a role in terms of communication in Fiji, however, be assured 
<br/>that  this  Coalition  Government  will  not  repeat  the  mistakes  of  the  past.  We  are  committed  to 
<br/>implementing reforms that ensure Walesi serves the interest of all Fijians. In fact, we had already 
<br/>started work on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)  Overhauling Governance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  leadership  of  its  new  board  they  are  developing  a 
<br/>comprehensive  strategic  plan  to  guide  its  operations.  This  plan  will  include  robust 
<br/>policies  for  procurement,  risk  management,  and  compliance  with  Fiji’s  laws  and 
<br/>regulations.  All  future  requirements  will  adhere  strictly  to  transparent  tendering 
<br/>processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)  Enhancing Accessibility 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Encryption policies will be reviewed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that all Fijians have 
<br/>true  free-to-air  access  without  the  need  for  proprietary  devices.  Technical  upgrades 
<br/>based on the ITU recommendations will also be prioritised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)  Strengthening Accountability 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  spectrum  licenses  and  frequency  registrations  will  be  expedited  to 
<br/>bring  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  in  line  with  licensing  practices  and  protect  critical  services  from 
<br/>interference.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  frameworks  will  be  established  to  ensure 
<br/>efficiency and transparency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)  Creating a Sustainable Model 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a transparent fee structure will be introduced in due course, together 
<br/></span><span>with the review of the Telecommunications Act.  This will create a revenue stream that 
<br/>supports Walesi’s</span><span> </span><span>operations while keeping services affordable for Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon reflection it is  clear that there has been a significant level of 
<br/>abuse in the operations of Walesi. In my estimate, based on the figures and number that 
<br/>I  have  presented,  $80  million  or  at  least  68  percent  of  the  spending  to  2022  can  be 
<br/>considered as wastage and abuse by the previous government. Just imagine this, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we could have used this money for hospitals, roads, bridges that could 
<br/></span><span>have been constructed from this fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Walesi  investigation  reminds  me  again  of  Nabukalou  Creek  - 
<br/>beautiful at high tide, but when the water recedes it reveals the filth underneath. Like the Fijian say, 
<br/></span><span>bulubulu boro vulavula</span><span>, the surface seems pristine, but beneath it lay shameful, wastage and abuse. 
<br/>In two words, </span><span>sa duka</span><span>.

<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Public  funds  vanished  into  thin  air,  a  disgraceful 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>squandering of resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. The findings of these investigations expose the failures of 
<br/>the past in stark detail, and we will fix them! They also represent an opportunity to correct mistakes 
<br/>and rebuild trust in our public institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under this Coalition Government, we will ensure that Walesi transitions from a symbol of 
<br/>mismanagement  and  abuse  to  a  model  of  innovation  and  public  service.  Our  commitment  to  the 
<br/>people of Fiji is this –we will serve them with integrity, transparency and honesty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  first  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on Walesi and also for all his hot air that has come up with respect to Walesi.  
<br/>Hot air and inflammatory words about being ineptitude and travesty, empty promise …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Continue honourable Koya.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  uses  really  inflammatory  words  like  ineptitude,  mismanagement,  travesty,  poor 
<br/>management, et cetera.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister in his speech pointed out that there 
<br/>are  issues  that  he  has  found  and  those  issues  that  he  will  be  referring  to  the  Fiji  Independent 
<br/>Commission Against Corruption (FICAC).  Once you say that, you ought to be mum on that particular 
<br/>topic,  because  it  immediately  is  something  that  is  gone  into  investigation.    To  come  here  and 
<br/>grandstand and talk about all of these things is not good. It does not bode well.  Honourable Minister, 
<br/>I thought you were better than that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Send it for investigation.  We all look forward to the findings, but please, yesterday in this 
<br/>House, there was a matter that was brought up regarding the boxing.  We were told to stay mum 
<br/>about it because it is a matter under investigation.  It is the same thing, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Koya, can I remind you the difference is, in this case it has not 
<br/></span><span>been referred to.  It is in the process of being referred to, whereas in the case of the boxing, the matter 
<br/>is already in the hands of the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I agree with you, but in light of the fact that he 
<br/>is raising it and about to report it, why come here and grandstand on it? Report the matter and then 
<br/>come back after the investigation is complete.  That would be the honourable thing to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We are not privy to the report, so answering it is quite impossible.  Let 
<br/>me just remind him about what Walesi has done. Walesi has provided free-to-air digital television 
<br/>services to all Fijians.  It has offered a change from analogue TV to now digital TV.  As of March 
<br/>2023, Walesi had reached 90 percent of the Fijian population. We had provided free digital services 
<br/>to 200,000 households; that did not exist!  You tell me about the waste!  Absolute garbage coming 
<br/>from the other side.

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to do all of these, there is a cost attached to it.  Of course, the estimate of 
<br/>the project was $200 million. The Government of Fiji provided $100 million, and the remaining came 
<br/>through a combination of private sector investment and donor contributions.  If he has issues, like he 
<br/>says he has, and he wants to refer it to FICAC, please do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I hope that interjections are also dealt with in the same manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular project was a major investment by the Government of Fiji.  I am glad to say 
<br/>that there is going to be continuity, because there are lot of households that are actually dependent 
<br/>on Walesi.  When he talks about mismanagement, what he needs to do is also realise that, before 
<br/>Walesi came, the only way to watch television in Fiji was through analogue television. That is the 
<br/>system that uses radio waves to transmit images, sound, et cetera. This is a digital platform which we 
<br/>can actually grow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Walesi is a significant and a huge improvement over the previous analogue television, and it 
<br/>provides sharper images, more television stations and clearer sound and most of all, this allows the 
<br/>rural and outer island areas more access to television, more access to the digital platform. So, all in 
<br/>all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he forgets to mention all the good parts of Walesi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said earlier, Sir, we are not privy to the report at the moment. If we were privy to 
<br/>the report, we would be able to dissect it but I’m not going to, because he is going to report the matter 
<br/>to FICAC. And we should be honourable people and leave that alone to the institutions, the incredible 
<br/>institutions that we have, to deal with that in the manner that they should.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  upon  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Group  of  9  Bloc  or  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designate for his response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to reply to the statement by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already spoken in this House about asking for clarifications from the 
<br/>Minister  responsible  in  terms  the  allegations  of  wasting  taxpayers’  money,  in  terms  of  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>
<br/>involvement. But I am thankful of the findings of the report. He has clearly articulated in the findings, 
<br/>that while he presented this morning, and we as a group of G9, we acknowledge the report and thank 
<br/></span><span>him for that. I know he has been given the biggest run around by the media and the journalists to 
<br/></span><span>deliver  the  report  in  this  august  House.  We  thank  him  and  we  are  looking  forward  towards  the 
<br/>progress of the report and investigations. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting 2025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this august House, 
<br/>members of the media, ladies, and gentlemen; today, I rise to highlight Fiji’s immense privilege and 
<br/>responsibility in hosting the 3rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting or known as RAMM in 2025. 
<br/>This decision, endorsed by Cabinet and fully supported by the Coalition Government demonstrates

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2409 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our unwavering commitment to fostering regional unity and advancing shared progress within the 
<br/>Pacific aviation sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Regional Aviation Ministers  Meeting is  a cornerstone event,  uniting 
<br/>Pacific nations to collaboratively address challenges, identify opportunities, and shape the future of 
<br/>our aviation landscape. This platform is not only a reflection of our interconnectedness as a region, 
<br/>but also vital mechanism for fostering practical solutions to the shared issues that we face.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Coalition Government, we recognise that aviation is the life blood of connectivity for 
<br/>Pacific Island nations. It is fundamental to our economies, our communities and our aspirations for 
<br/>growth  and  development.  Hosting  this  meeting  reaffirms  Fiji’s  leadership  in  steering  meaningful 
<br/>conversations and initiatives in the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, RAMM 2025 is not merely a gathering of aviation leaders, it is a strategic 
<br/>opportunity  to  address  critical  priorities  for  Pacific,  aligned  with  the  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>overarching goals for sustainable development, economic resilience, and regional collaboration. The 
<br/>main objectives of the meeting are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening  Regional  Cooperation  -  Building  stronger  partnerships  among  Pacific 
<br/>nations  to  address  aviation-related  challenges  including  infrastructure  gaps,  regulatory 
<br/>alignment, and safety standards. This collaboration ensures that no nation is left behind in 
<br/>our collective journey toward progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Enhancing  Air  Connectivity:  Improving  air  links  across  the  Pacific  to  facilitate  trade, 
<br/>tourism  and  investment.    Enhanced  connectivity  will  create  pathways  for  economic 
<br/>opportunities and directly benefits the livelihoods of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Advancing  Sustainable  Aviation  Practices:  Charting  a  path  toward  greener  aviation  by 
<br/>exploring frameworks to reduce carbon emissions, invest in sustainable technologies and 
<br/>mitigate environmental impacts – actions aligned with Fiji’s climate leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Capacity  Building:  Strengthening  the  technical  expertise  and  operational  capabilities  of 
<br/>aviation sectors across the region through shared learning and technical assistance, ensuring 
<br/>long-term resilience and adaptability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Ensuring  Safety  and  Security:  Working  collaboratively  to  uphold  international  aviation 
<br/>safety and security standards, ensuring passenger confidence and maintaining the integrity 
<br/>of our air transport systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is focussed not just on hosting an event but on 
<br/></span><span>driving actionable and impactful outcomes for the Pacific region.  The anticipated outcomes for the 
<br/></span><span>Pacific region.  The anticipated outcomes of RAMM 2025 include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Actionable Policy Frameworks: Agreement on practical strategies and frameworks that 
<br/>member  states  can  adopt  to  strengthen  their  aviation  sectors,  promoting  regional 
<br/>harmony and efficiency. 
<br/>Increased  Funding  and  Investment:  Identifying  opportunities  for  investment  in 
<br/>infrastructure  and  technology,  enabling  advancements  that  will  enhance  aviation 
<br/>services across the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Streamlined  Regional  Policies:  Aligning  aviation  policies  to  promote  seamless 
<br/></span><span>operations, reduce barriers to travel and support more efficient movement of people and 
<br/>goods across borders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Expanded  Partnerships:  Fostering  collaboration  between  governments,  private  sector 
<br/>stakeholders, and international organisations to build a resilient and dynamic aviation

<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Accountability and Implementation: Establishing mechanisms to monitor the progress 
<br/>of agreements reached, ensuring that commitments translate into measurable benefits 
<br/>for all Pacific nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recent  Pacific  Tourism  Organisation  (SPTO)  Pacific  Ministers 
<br/>Meeting  held  in  Suva  last  month,  emphasised  tourism’s  transformative  role  in  driving  economic 
<br/>growth and regional cooperation.  Central to this vision is aviation, the lifeline connecting our island 
<br/>nations and enabling the seamless movement of people, goods and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism  and  aviation  are  intrinsically  linked  with  improved  air  connectivity  directly 
<br/>enhancing access to Pacific destinations.  This not only supports the growth of the tourism sector, 
<br/>but also fosters economic opportunities across industries such as hospitality, agriculture and retail.  
<br/>For Fiji and our neighbours, these linkages are critical for creating jobs, stimulating investment and 
<br/>uplifting livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the newly endorsed Strategic Plan for SPTO, connectivity is one of the Strategic Focus 
<br/>Areas  highlighting  the  importance  of  harmonised  efforts  to  enhance  air  connectivity,  strengthen 
<br/>infrastructure and streamline regional aviation policies.  Together, these initiatives ensure that Pacific 
<br/>nations remain competitive, resilient and united in their pursuit of sustainable development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  hosting  RAMM  2025,  Fiji  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  fostering  these  synergies  and 
<br/>driving meaningful progress.  The Coalition Government remains steadfast in its vision of aviation 
<br/>and tourism as cornerstones for regional integration, economic prosperity and shared growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government views RAMM 2025 as more than an event, it is 
<br/>a platform to reinforce our collective commitment to the prosperity of the Pacific. By hosting this 
<br/>meeting, Fiji is leading by example, demonstrating our dedication to a vision of regional connectivity, 
<br/>sustainability and shared growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government’s  ongoing  investments  in  the  aviation  sector,  including 
<br/>infrastructure  development  and  capacity  building,  underscore  our  readiness  to  host  such  a 
<br/>transformative event.  Moreover, our focus on outcomes ensures that RAMM 2025 will have a lasting 
<br/>impact not just for Fiji but for the entire Pacific community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Fiji’s hosting of the 3</span><span>rd</span><span> Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting in 2025 
<br/>is a testament to our regional leadership and our commitment to advancing aviation as a driver of 
<br/></span><span>development.  Guided  by  the  Coalition  Government’s  vision  of  progress,  sustainability  and 
<br/></span><span>inclusivity, we are determined to make RAMM 2025 a turning point for regional aviation.  Let us 
<br/>embrace this opportunity to collaborate, innovate and create a stronger and more connected Pacific.  
<br/>Together, through partnership and shared purpose, we will soar to new heights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for this response.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all let me congratulate the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>in getting the approval to host this RAMM 2025 meeting because it comes at a very opportune time 
<br/></span><span>and it is sorely needed, especially in light of the fact there were many discussions were held – it had 
<br/>that happened at the  International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) meeting which the honourable 
<br/>Minister and I both attended and there are issues that the Pacific needs to deal with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want  to  reflect  on something that was said  by the erstwhile Secretary-
<br/>General  to  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum,  Mr.  Henry  Puna.    He  had  said,  and  I  quote,  “there  will  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2411 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fatigue in the discussion of some issues” and it is a very important topic.  There will be fatigue with 
<br/>respect  to  civil  aviation  issues that have been discussed, but  it is time that  we need to  move in  a 
<br/>direction, because we all know Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is great for tourism that we are actually hosting 
<br/>these  events  but  from  a  regional  perspective,  it  is  very  important  that  we  lead  the  way  in  these 
<br/>discussions, because we are a major part of the region’s airline network. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  civil  aviation,  especially  in  this  region,  we  have  to  explore  new  and 
<br/>innovative ideas.  We have to solidify our region, because as I said at the ICAO meeting on the last 
<br/>occasion that the honourable Minister and I both attended, I saw the solidification that exist within 
<br/>Africa and the support that they received out of the European Union.  We need to also start to engage 
<br/>with the assistance of our development partners, Australia and New Zealand because they lie on the 
<br/>same region to see what can be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What lies at the hub of this and probably the most important thing, something that we really 
<br/>need to tap into, and it is good for our economies also, is the topic that was discussed in Dubai which 
<br/>was sustainable aviation fuel.  It is something that is hugely important to us, especially in light of 
<br/>what has been attended to in recent weeks regarding COP29.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am really quite sorry that our honourable Minister was not able to attend, because that would 
<br/>have  been  fantastic  opportunity  to  raise  all  those  issues  that  he  did  quite  well  in  Dubai.  Our 
<br/>development aspirations and commitments also need to be a huge part of these discussions.  As I 
<br/>have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, especially because of climate change issues and it should be at the head 
<br/>of our discussions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the support that is received by Africa with respect to sustainable aviation 
<br/>fuels because it is an industry comes from Europe, but the Pacific had zero support. So, it is time that 
<br/>we got together, some of our Pacific Island neighbours were not even able to attend the conference 
<br/>due to financial constraints.  Fiji leads the way in this, we are hosting these things. I am sure we can 
<br/>lead and show the way for the Pacific and speak on behalf of the Pacific, and my discussions with 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand at that particular time, were that they would be readily and willing and 
<br/>able to assist in any way, shape or form that they can.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, I hope and wish you well in the discussions that are going to be held at 
<br/>RAMM and from a Pacific perspective and from the words of Mr. Henry Puna, the former Secretary-
<br/>General, let the discussions make sure that they are not, fatigue is not embedded in those discussions, 
<br/>because they can be ongoing and long, but moving forward there is a lot of movement in terms of 
<br/></span><span>innovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The little portion that I spoke about is actually quite a big portion about sustainable aviation 
<br/>fuels, it could mean new industries to us. It could mean what the honourable Minister for Trade has 
<br/>spoken  about  with  respect  to  diversification,  it  could  mean  a  hell  of  a  lot  if  we  start  producing 
<br/>sustainable aviation fuels to make sure that we have a bigger and better economy that we can deal 
<br/>with whilst we are doing our part with respect to climate change and living in a sustainable economic 
<br/>environment. I wish you well honourable Minister for the Conference, and I wish you well in all the 
<br/>preparations and I wish Fiji a successful RAMM in 2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for 
<br/>his Statement this morning.  I mentioned yesterday the fact that we are now hosting another meeting 
<br/>here in Fiji, again showcasing its ability to host and manage these meetings very well. Our facilities 
<br/>and the way we run these meetings, it also shows the leadership role that we play in these sorts of 
<br/>meetings and discussions.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I read with interest the connection between aviation and tourism – very true. Regionally, yes, 
<br/>and  for  a  small  and  a  group  of  island  state  like  Fiji,  distant,  it  is  very  true,  aviation  and  tourism 
<br/>connects very well. Also, planes provide a faster turnaround for the tourists who do not come here 
<br/>and stay for long. When that is available to the outer islands, I think there is an old airport in Biaugunu 
<br/>airstrip, you had a look at that also.  That localises this connection of aviation and tourism, and there 
<br/>are some of the airstrips that are on our outer islands, perhaps needs to be worked on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hear the development in Savusavu for ATR, I think this augurs very well.  I am not sure 
<br/>about the one in Taveuni, I think it is coming, and I thank the Ministry for its leadership in this area. 
<br/>I certainly echo the sentiments of honourable Koya, we wish you well in the meeting which Fiji is 
<br/>also the best in this area of looking after aviation, which is so vital for tourism in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress and Achievements of the Formal Employment Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  begin  by  congratulating  you,  Sir,  for  your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>election as the Speaker of this august Parliament, and I look forward to working with you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to update this august Parliament on the progress and achievements of 
<br/>the  Formal  Employment  Services  (FES)  which  is  the  local  arm  of  employment  at  the  National 
<br/>Employment Centre under the Employment Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Formal Employment Services, Mr. Speaker Sir, has undergone significant transformation 
<br/>over the past two years and the services provided by the FES team have not only evolved, but have 
<br/>been reshaped to meet the growing needs of our workforce and the demands of the rapidly changing 
<br/>labour market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since its inception, the National Employment Centre has evolved from a 
<br/>small-scale operation that was initially focussed on local registration to a more comprehensive and 
<br/>proactive service designed to enhance job opportunities, community engagement and employment 
<br/>empowerment locally. The landscape of Formal Employment Services has changed significantly with 
<br/>greater emphasis on accessibility to our local job markets, outreach and personalised services. Our 
<br/>approach  today  is  more  holistic,  focusing  not  only  on  matching  individuals  to  jobs,  but  also  on 
<br/>providing training, skills development and support mechanisms to ensure sustained employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year with the suspension of the registration of foreign employment due 
<br/>to the huge number of pending applications, we turned our focus on registration for local employment 
<br/></span><span>opportunities  demonstrating  an  unprecedented  boost  in  engagement  with  both  jobseekers  and 
<br/></span><span>employers.  This  is  largely  due  to  the  extensive  community  awareness  campaigns  and  employer 
<br/>engagement initiatives that have been undertaken to reach out to villages and even the outer islands. 
<br/>This initiative was essential to bridge the gap between the potential employees and employers, and 
<br/>the results are evident and beyond our expectations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our ongoing efforts, we have focussed on registering jobseekers 
<br/>from rural and remote areas, providing them with access to local opportunities, that they would not 
<br/>have  had  otherwise.  This  initiative  has  been  enhanced  through  various  outreach  programmes, 
<br/></span><span>including local registration drives in key locations such as Levuka, Ovalau in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Nasinu 
<br/></span><span>where we connected with local communities directly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Employment Centre Act mandates the conduct of Life Skills 
<br/>training and Employment Skills training, both of which are crucial in preparing our workforce for 
<br/>local employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2413 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Life  Skills  training  is  designed  to  equip  individuals  with  soft  skills 
<br/>necessary for success in any workplace including communication, teamwork and time management. 
<br/>It  also  helps  foster  personal  growth,  building  confidence  and  resilience  in  our  local  jobseekers.  
<br/>Employment Skills training focuses on the practical, technical skills required to thrive in specific 
<br/>industries.  These  trainings  have  become  essential  in  building  a  workforce  that  is  adaptable  and 
<br/>capable of contributing effectively to our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, early this year we strengthened our arrangements through a Memorandum 
<br/>of  Understanding  with  the  Australian  Pacific  Training  Coalition  (APTC)  for  the  delivery  of 
<br/>employment  skills  training,  ensuring  that  the  programmes  offered  are  aligned  with  the  current 
<br/>industry trends that meet the needs of all employers across the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  programmes  provided  by  APTC  are  designed  to  equip  jobseekers  with  the  technical 
<br/>expertise  needed  for  employment  in  sectors  with  high  demand  such  as  construction,  engineering, 
<br/>hospitality and community services, which includes caregiving. These training programmes ensure 
<br/>that our workforce is not only job ready, but capable of thriving in the rapidly evolving job market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this training programme which covers up to Certificate III and Certificate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>IV is provided by APTC, are free of charge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, both trainings are vital in today's rapidly changing job market. They provide 
<br/>individuals with necessary tools and competencies to not only secure jobs but to succeed in them. 
<br/>The  need  for  these  training  programmes  is  clearer  now  more  than  ever.  As  they  ensure  that  our 
<br/>workforce remains competitive both locally and internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  also  partnering  with  other  training  institutions  to  provide  skills 
<br/>training.  Sir, as highlighted earlier the team conducted awareness and local registration drives in 
<br/>Ovalau before providing life skills training to the job seekers there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with the Ministry's commitment to support the needs of our local 
<br/>jobseekers, the NEC team has also been organising job fairs across the country. This platform not 
<br/>only provides an opportunity to jobseekers to connect with potential employers, but also an avenue, 
<br/>to showcase the skills and capabilities of our workforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Western Division job fair held in Nadi earlier this year was a resounding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>success.  A total of 612 jobs were secured within the two-day event for the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, similarly, the Suva job fair at the end of October, also provided a total of 
<br/>1,289 job openings with 605 jobs offered on the spot and the remainder sourced through continued 
<br/>engagement with employers. This success reflects the tireless work being done by the team to connect 
<br/>jobseekers with the opportunities available in both our formal and informal sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Suva job fair also provided the opportunity  for my Ministry to promote the Coalition 
<br/>Government’s  commitment  to  collaborate  through  public  and  private  partnerships  for  effective 
<br/>utilisation of resources and also reaching out to the widest sector of our community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints 
<br/></span><span>for their commitment and support towards the initiative and for providing a free venue for the job 
<br/>fair.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  church  has  also  offered  to  host  similar  events  at  any  of  their  centres 
<br/>nationwide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week the team hosted the Northern job fair which was held in Labasa 
<br/>and  attracted  a  huge  crowd  at  the  Labasa  Civic  Centre.  This  event  was  also  a  success,  with  40

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>organisations offering 194 vacancies for people in the North. Such events empower communities and 
<br/>provide platforms for both employers and job seekers to connect  and bridge the gap in accessing 
<br/>employment opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we are engaged in this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have other services on the spot, for 
<br/>example,  the  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund  (FNPF),  Fiji  Revenue  &amp;  Customs  Service  (FRCS) 
<br/>representatives  to  provide  the  TIN  numbers  and  also  our  expertise  in  terms  of  refining  their 
<br/>curriculum vitae.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the support from the Fiji Police Force Jazz 
<br/>Band who were conducting community awareness in the North and came to support my Ministry, 
<br/>providing entertainment and awareness to our citizens last Thursday at the Labasa Civic Centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the 5</span><span>th</span><span> to 7</span><span>th</span><span> November 2024, that is from tomorrow until Saturday. 
<br/>We are also partnering with the Ministry of Youth and Sports to host a fair for the youth in the Central 
<br/>Division  at  the  National  Stadium  where  they  will  have  their  sporting  events  and  other  activities 
<br/>together with the job fair. The youths will be able to access employers who will be present there and 
<br/>then see who matches what. Hopefully, a number of jobs will be secured there as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also organising a job fair in Ba, mostly likely by the end of January 
<br/>or early February, where we will get the jobseekers right from up to Tavua and Rakiraki together to 
<br/>meet with employers and secure jobs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going to provide a bus to those who 
<br/>are going to travel from Rakiraki and Tavua to Ba.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through these efforts of the local arm of the National Employment Centre, 
<br/>the Ministry has  made great  strides in  resetting  the employment landscape. Our work is  not  only 
<br/>about  filling  job  vacancies,  but  also  about  building  a  sustainable  local  workforce,  empowering 
<br/>individuals and ensuring that no one is left behind in the quest for employment opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward, we will continue to refine our approach, strengthen 
<br/>our collaboration and partnerships with all the stakeholders to expand our reach to all the corners of 
<br/>the country. The road ahead is one of continued transformation and I am most happy with the progress 
<br/>we have made and the positive impacts we are having on the lives of our fellow ordinary Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It brings great satisfaction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, seeing the smiles and acknowledgement from 
<br/>our very own people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, approximately 2,500 plus jobs that have been secured so far 
<br/></span><span>means 2,500 plus families have actually been sustained and benefitting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the jobs 
<br/></span><span>are available out there. It is about connecting the jobseekers with the potential employers. And as we 
<br/>continue  to  do  this,  we  are  going  to  assist  with  poverty  alleviation,  we  are  going  to  assist  with 
<br/>eradication of social problems, we are going to engage our youths beneficially, gainfully as well as 
<br/>meaningfully towards contributing to our nation building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative will continue, and I am sure there will be more jobs secured 
<br/>in future. I also wish to very briefly respond to honourable Usamate. He is a very old friend of mine. 
<br/>The contribution yesterday regarding the TVET training programmes that we need to emphasise on. 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that TVET training was available at our school level, from Year 9 and 
<br/></span><span>Year 10 onwards. Those centres were attached to the secondary schools in those days, and they were 
<br/>very successfully done. After that they could attend Fiji National University and continue with the 
<br/>Level 3 and Level 4 and then enter the job market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> We also saw the opening of the technical colleges in 2014, I believe, 2015, 2016, and then 
<br/>closure of technical colleges in 2019. When the technical colleges were open, all the TVET centres 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2415 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were closed, and then later on, the technical colleges were also closed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, we lost 
<br/>our TVET trainings completely there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate and I worked together at the National Productivity and Training Centre 
<br/>at FNU, and we also fought very hard resisting the annexure of the NTPC into FNU, but we  both 
<br/>failed.  I was removed from my position and honourable Usamate came into Parliament, and then he 
<br/>forgot to continue the fight, unfortunately. I do not blame him at all, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Unfortunately, 
<br/>there was a single boss those days and no one else had any say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  So, we are now coming back, we are reopening the  technical colleges,  
<br/>and we are reopening  the TVET centres, thanks to  the Ministry of Education and the  honourable 
<br/>Minister. The training is now ongoing.  Thank you very much for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I would now invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>five minute response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the Ministerial Statement by 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations.  While  I 
<br/>acknowledge  the  progress  and  achievements  of  the  Formal  Employment  Service  (FES)  and  the 
<br/>National  Employment Centre (NEC), it is  crucial  to  remember that this initiative was established 
<br/>under the Bainimarama Government in 2009, which the former Minister Usamate was a part of. The 
<br/>NEC was a fast forward-thinking response to the pressing issues of unemployment, aiming to provide 
<br/>skills training, human resource development and job placement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note, that during the last election campaign there were 
<br/>voices within the current Government that were critical of NEC and its initiatives. It is somewhat 
<br/>ironic  that  now  in  power,  they  have  to  come  to  realise  the  value  of  NEC  and  are  expanding  its 
<br/>services.  This shift instantly raises questions about the constituency and sincerity in their policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Formal Employment Service has indeed played a vital role in helping 
<br/>individuals, especially school leavers, the unemployment and those re-entering the workforce to find 
<br/>formal  employment.  However,  the  current  Government  must  ensure  that  the  expansion  of  these 
<br/></span><span>services is not just a political manoeuvre, but a genuine effort to improve the employment landscape 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  also  address  a  critical  issue  facing  our  nation  today.  The  mass 
<br/>exodus of trained professionals leaving Fiji for opportunities abroad. This brain drain is depleting 
<br/>our  skilled  workforce  and  creating  gaps  in  essential  sectors.    The  NEC  must  be  empowered  and 
<br/>reduced to providing targeted services that can quickly upskill our citizens to fill these gaps. It is not 
<br/>enough to simply place people in jobs, we must ensure that they are adequately trained and prepared 
<br/>to meet the demands of the modern workforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  NEC  has  other  services  such  as  the  Foreign 
<br/>Employment Services and the Fiji Volunteer Service which have provided additional facilities, there 
<br/>is still much work to be done. The Government must address the underlying issues that contribute to 
<br/>unemployment  and  to  ensure  that  NEC  is  adequately  funded  and  supported  to  fulfil  its  mandate 
<br/>effectively.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, sir, while I commend the NEC’s effort and progress made by 
<br/>FES, I urge the Government to remain transparent and consistent in its policies. The well-being of 
<br/>its  citizens  and  the  reduction  of  unemployment  should  be  the  family  focus,  free  from  political 
<br/>agendas. We must work together to ensure that the NEC can continue to support our workforce and 
<br/>address the challenges posed by the loss of skilled professionals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Nand. I will now call upon the Leader of the G9 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bloc or his designate for his response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond briefly to the Ministerial statement 
<br/>presented by the Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations, honourable Agni 
<br/>Deo Singh.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for updating this august Parliament on 
<br/>the progress and achievements of the formal employment service of the National Employment Centre 
<br/>under the Ministry for Employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the formal employment service is one of the three main 
<br/>services offered by the National Employment Centre, namely, the Foreign Employment Service, the 
<br/>National  Employment  Service  and  the  Fiji  Volunteer  Service.  With  the  NEC  facilitation  role,  I 
<br/>commend  the  Minister  and  his  team  for  the  work  that  they  do  in  assisting  the  youths  and  fellow 
<br/>Fijians to secure jobs both locally and in the foreign markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, youths who are engaged in formal employment locally, will develop good 
<br/>work attitudes and stand a better chance of securing employment in the foreign markets. My political 
<br/>career  has  always  focussed  on  assisting  our  youths  in  securing  jobs  both  locally  and  in  foreign 
<br/>markets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, when youths need jobs, I stay up late at night, preparing resumes for our 
<br/>youths and liaise with local companies and organisations in securing jobs for these youths. With that 
<br/>being said, I take this opportunity to commend all the companies that provide job opportunities for 
<br/>our youths, hence, a special mention to the following companies and organisations who continue to 
<br/>assist  me  in  absorbing  these  youths  in  the  workforce:  Fiji  Sports  Council,  New  World  IGA  Fiji, 
<br/>Ashabhai Company Limited and Punjas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Minister,  I  must  thank  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Employment and the Ministry for Youth and Sports for organising mini job fairs, where they are 
<br/></span><span>committed  in  connecting  people,  especially  our  youths  with  a  wide  range  of  opportunities  across 
<br/>different industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, both  of the Ministries will be 
<br/>holding a two-day youth fair in the Central Division from the 5</span><span>th</span><span> to the 6</span><span>th</span><span> of December, 2024 at the 
<br/>HFC Stadium.  The Ministry of Employment needs the support of all the Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament and stakeholders in addressing the issue of unemployment in our nation. I thank you for 
<br/>this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this point, we will suspend the proceedings for 
<br/>lunch and we will hear the last two Ministerial Statements from the Minister for Justice at our first 
<br/>session this afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament is adjourned with proceedings to resume at 2.30 p.m.

<div><span>Job Evaluation Exercise - Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  </span><span>Ni  sa  bula  vinaka  saka  na  Turaga  na  Sivika</span><span>.    I  join  my  fellow 
<br/>colleagues,  those  who  have  spoken  before  me  and  after  me  to  congratulate  your  appointment  as 
<br/>Speaker of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers, 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen, k</span><span>emuni na wekaqu turaga mataqali, o ira na luvei keimami, ni kalougata tiko, 
<br/></span><span>I also welcome those joining us on livestream from across the globe; I will be speaking in light of 
<br/>the Fiji  Corrections  Service Job  Evaluation  Exercise and its  Implementation.  I  rise to  update this 
<br/>august House of the approved Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) of the Fiji Correctional Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary goal of the JEE is to enable the Fiji Corrections Service (FCS) 
<br/>to  attract,  retain,  develop  talent,  skills  and  capacity  within  its  organisation  while  remaining 
<br/>competitive in the labour market.  This initiative also ensures the alignment of FCS’s role with its 
<br/>organisational structure, functions and pay scales, promoting the principle of equal pay for work of 
<br/>equal value.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, please allow me to provide a brief background 
<br/>on  the  JEE.  The  Fiji  Corrections  Service  adhered  to  the  standard  tendering  process,  including 
<br/>advertising for a consultancy to undertake a JEE.  Following a thorough selection process, Maxumise 
<br/>was engaged as the consultancy agency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations and interviews were conducted with FCS officers as part of the exercise.  The 
<br/>JEE was concluded and a report dated 9</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, provided comprehensive recommendations, 
<br/>including, if I may list them first:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review and evaluation of roles, responsibilities and skills; 
<br/>Assignment  of  appropriate  salary  bands  and  remuneration  based  on  competency 
<br/>assessments;  
<br/>Establishment of base salaries for future recruits guided by the JEE; 
<br/>Adoption of role descriptions as position descriptions for incumbents; 
<br/>Training to address identified skill gaps; and  
<br/>Enhance contract management practices reflect the incumbent roles and vacant positions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The JEE was approved in the Cabinet sitting of June 2024.  Cabinet also approved in principle 
<br/>that it would be effective from 1st August, 2024, unfortunately, it was not to be backdated and that 
<br/>the final implementation and roll out would be subject to finalisation from the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/>However,  the  implementation  of  the  approved  JEE  for  Corrections  Officers  has  generated  mixed 
<br/>reactions.  These  mixed  reactions  have  been  the  result  of  the  lack  of  information  exacerbated  by 
<br/>rampant spread of misinformation and disinformation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my intention that by addressing the issue in this august House that we 
<br/>will be enlightened, particularly for our Members across the floor who have failed to  address the 
<br/>plight of officers over their many years in government.  There are several phases in implementing 
<br/>the new policy.  The proposed salary structure is informed by the JEE and FCS Remuneration Policy, 
<br/>reflecting  post-COVID-19  market  conditions.    Implementation  follows  a  phased  approach.    The 
<br/></span><span>phases considered are:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Full implementation of the new salary bands, effective August 2024, pending the outcome 
<br/>of the Individual Competency Assessments. 
<br/>Adjustments  will  include  mandatory  allowance  increases  and  a  review  of  other 
<br/>remuneration policies. 
<br/>Stages of Implementation to align with the recommended median. 
<br/>Realignment of the organisational structure. 
<br/>Update and implementation of HR policies. 
<br/>Identification of personnel and inclusion of 81 new posts over the next three financial years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in essence, there has been a need to constantly re-adjust to correctly re-align 
<br/>the pay structure to the experience, qualification and the demands of the role.  To this end, a number 
<br/>of HR-related activities have been undertaken to strategically align the manpower structure to the 
<br/>accepted level and supported by its structural framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  principle,  this  would  mean  that  the  implementation  of  the  JEE  recommendations  is  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>achieve the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Realignment and redesign of salary band to reflect the JEE recommendations; 
<br/>Increases that is aligned to the position and not the rank; 
<br/>Realignment  of  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  structure  to  address  current  operational 
<br/>needs; 
<br/>Review the introduction of enhanced remuneration policies and the resulting increased 
<br/>budgetary allocation for personnel emoluments; and 
<br/>Additional  manpower  and  posts  identified  to  strengthen  the  role  of  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eighty-one is really a record for the history of FCS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  organisation  chart  has  been  developed  to  reflect  the  current  new 
<br/>positions.  Correct remuneration packages that are consistent with the role expectations as opposed 
<br/>to  the  traditional  ranking  remuneration  expectation  is  a  major  shift  following  the  approved 
<br/>Corrections Reforms and the JEE.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In implementing the policy, the framework that has been developed is clearly defined with 
<br/>clear expectations. This is something that was not done in the previous administration, in fact, I will 
<br/>proudly say the last JEE or something to that effect reflected for the Fiji Corrections Service was not 
<br/>done for the last 40 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual manpower level can now tally with the Person to Post, what is 
<br/>normally called P2P framework that reflects the approve number of manpower resources. Each post 
<br/>should have a corresponding Job Description to clearly demarcate positions and avoid overlapping 
<br/>of responsibilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the progress made, FCS has faced some challenges, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assigning personnel to the correct salary bands based on JEE evaluations. 
<br/>Implementing the new salary structure across FCS.   
<br/>Lack of detailed job descriptions to guide the HR processes. 
<br/>Adjusting staff placement to align with the updated organisational structure.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transitioning to a performance-based rank structure tied to posts, as recommended by 
<br/>the JEE.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  address  these  challenges,  there  has  been  continued  dialogue  to  identify  and  secure 
<br/>sufficient  budget  allocations  to  support  salary  increments,  as  well  as  providing  targeted  training 
<br/>programmes for FCS officers.  Additionally, the establishment of a monitoring framework to oversee 
<br/>the progress and effectiveness of the JEE recommendations is crucial.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  implementation  has  proven  to  be  fruitful  and  a  challenging  exercise  that  requires 
<br/>meticulous analysis to put the correct pay structure into its correct position. The sum of plus $12.5 
<br/>million was recommended and approved in the 2024-2025 Budget to cater for the 879 staff on the 
<br/>ground, inclusive of the 81 new positions for 2024-2025.  This is the start, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is 
<br/>still must left to implement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  clear  that  the  intention  to  implement  with  one  year  roll  out  period  with  the  requisite 
<br/>changes  though  commendable,  will  require  a  strengthened  comprehensive  HR  system  and 
<br/>mechanisms to fully implement it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is anticipated that once the JEE outcome is fully implemented, a detailed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report will be provided to Cabinet and subsequently the recommendations to this august House.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the JEE has made the traditional rank structure redundant. 
<br/>The  rank  is  no  longer  an  attribute  of  the  individual  officer  but  is  attached  to  the  post  they  hold.  
<br/>Officers wear the rank and receive the pay associated with the post to which they are assigned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the honourable Minister for Justice’s 
<br/>Statement regarding the Fiji Corrections Service JEE and its implementation. While the Opposition 
<br/>supports  genuine  reforms  aimed  at  improving  our  Corrections  system,  I  must  express  my  grave 
<br/>concerns about the lack of depth and accountability in the Government’s approach to this issue. To 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister,  you  had  24  months  to  do  this,  yet  you  are  still  blaming  the  previous 
<br/>government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, justice is a principle I hold dearly, and it is a value that should not only 
<br/>guide our treatment of inmates but also extend to the hardworking Corrections officers who are the 
<br/>backbone of this institution. These men and women are entrusted with the critical task of maintaining 
<br/>order  and  supporting  rehabilitation,  often  under  extremely  challenging  circumstances.  Yet,  the 
<br/>Minister’s Statement fails to adequately address how this JEE will directly improve their lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corrections officers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are often overworked, underpaid and left to operate in 
<br/>under-resourced facilities. They endure dangerous conditions daily, placing their own well-being at 
<br/>risk to serve the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Is it just, Mr. Speaker, to burden these officers with these challenges while 
<br/>offering  them  little  in  return?  How  will  this  exercise  address  their  safety  concerns,  enhance  their 
<br/>working conditions, and provide fair compensation that reflects their invaluable contributions?

<div><span>2421 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice also demands fairness in professional development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this  Coalition Government’s term, Corrections officers have faced 
<br/>stagnation in their careers. Promotions are few and far between, and there is little incentive for these 
<br/>officers to remain committed to their roles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Minister  must  explain  how  this  exercise  will  open  pathways  for 
<br/>professional  growth,  provide  opportunities  for  advanced  training,  and  ensure  that  officers  are 
<br/>rewarded based on merit and performance. Anything less would be an injustice to their dedication 
<br/>and sacrifice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call on the honourable Minister to expand this exercise to 
<br/>include robust training on human rights,  ethics,  and privacy protection. These  are non-negotiable 
<br/>aspects of a modern justice system. Officers must be equipped to handle inmates in a manner that 
<br/>respects  their  dignity  and  prepares  them  for  reintegration  into  society.  Too  often,  we  have  heard 
<br/>troubling reports of mistreatment and privacy violations within our correctional facilities. Without 
<br/>proper training, these incidents will continue, undermining the core principles of rehabilitation and 
<br/>fairness that our justice system should embody. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  justice  must  also  be  evident  in  how  we  approach  rehabilitation.  This 
<br/>evaluation exercise cannot focus solely on administrative restructuring or job titles. It must include a 
<br/>comprehensive plan to improve rehabilitation programmes, invest in vocational training, and expand 
<br/>educational opportunities for inmates. A truly just system is one that believes in second chances and 
<br/>equips offenders to reintegrate successfully into our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  critical  concern,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  mental  health  and  well-being  of  our 
<br/>Corrections officers. The Minister has failed to mention any measures to address the psychological 
<br/>toll of working in such a high-stress environment. Justice for our officers means providing them with 
<br/>access to counselling services, mental health support, and mechanisms to reduce burnout. A JEE that 
<br/>ignores these realities is incomplete and unjust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  must  question  the  sincerity  of  the  honourable  Minister  and  this 
<br/>Government.    Time  and  time  again,  we  have  seen  big  announcements  with  little  follow-through. 
<br/>Where  is  the  detailed  plan?    Where  is  the  funding  allocation  to  support  these  reforms?    Most 
<br/>importantly, where is the accountability? The people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, including our Correction 
<br/>officers and inmates deserve more than empty promises and superficial changes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition G-16 will continue to stand for true justice – justice for our 
<br/>Corrections officers, justice for inmates and justice for the people of Fiji. This requires a holistic, 
<br/>well-resourced  and  principled  approach  to  reform,  not  political  rhetoric.    I  urge  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister to rise above platitudes and deliver real, meaningful change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  invite  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Group  of  Nine  Bloc  or  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designate for his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister for Justice on the JEE for the Fiji Corrections Service, but before I do that, 
<br/>allow  me  to  join  my  other  colleagues  in  conveying  my  sincere  congratulations  to  you  on  your 
<br/>appointment as our Speaker. We wish you the best on your term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for someone that has served in the organisation, together with my colleague, 
<br/>the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, we worked very hard to see this done. At first, I must

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thank the Coalition Government for keeping to their word and meeting the needs of the organisation 
<br/>under the JEE.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, not  many people understand the work this  organisation  does.  It  is  really a very tough 
<br/>mission. Apart from their primary function to look after those who are incarcerated under their care, 
<br/>turn them around and make sure they do not come back, they also play a significant role in national 
<br/>reconciliation. The ability to teach, train and turn them around in understanding as offenders and the 
<br/>ability of the organisation to help in the reconciliation of the offender and the victim. This is a tough 
<br/>call, Mr. Speaker, but I thank the organisation as they continue to do this under the Yellow Ribbon 
<br/>Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  part  that  they  are  also  doing  in  addition  to  their  primary  function  is  on  nation 
<br/>building.  They play an absolutely critical  role, and  I will call on the  Government  of the day that 
<br/>special consideration be given as you explore and try and understand and review the work that this 
<br/>organisation does, consideration be made on their role as a nation builder as an organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this organisation’s primary function is really to turn people around, those who have gone 
<br/>off track they go back on track. Mums and dads return to the community, join the community and 
<br/>their  families.  That  is  a  difficult  call.  But  my  point,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  really,  I  am  trying  to 
<br/>emphasise a simple fact for this organisation that they must be fairly remunerated and not only for 
<br/>them, their families, their conditions and above all the Force Protection issues that protects them in 
<br/>carrying out their work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, there also must be a balance in looking after those who are under their care, 
<br/>the inmates.  They should be treated humanely, and they must comply with international norms of 
<br/>any organisation like the Corrections Service.  Sir, I thank the Government of the day, the Coalition 
<br/>Government for sticking to their commitment and I urge that in the next budget session, consideration 
<br/>be given to this organisation in light of the work they do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, Members of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I rise to update this august House on the work done by the Office 
<br/>of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) for 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  begin  my  address  with  warm  congratulations  to  Nancy 
<br/></span><span>Tikoisuva on her acting appointment as the Acting Director from 11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024.  Well done Ms. 
<br/>Tikoisuva!  With your strong leadership, we have already started seeing changes and growth at the 
<br/>ODPP.    The  belief  in  your  leadership  coupled  with  a  competent  skilled  team  is  evident  in  the 
<br/>provision of the necessary financial resources by the Ministry of Finace for the new Financial Year 
<br/>2024 to 2025.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and  Minister  for  Finance  and  the  Ministerial  staff  for  having  approved  the  establishment  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Nasinu office.  Nasinu Municipality in the 2017 Census had a population of 92,043.  Its land area is 
<br/></span><span>the largest of any municipal area in Fiji, and more than twice that of the Capital City of Suva.  The 
<br/>current projections for Nasinu population is approximately 120,000 persons at an estimated growth 
<br/>rate of 2 percent per annum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current refurbishment of the Nasinu office will allow for two prosecutors to be stationed 
<br/>in Nasinu and attend to the four Magistrates Courts in Nasinu.  Nasinu also has the largest volume of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2423 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cases in the country.  It is anticipated that with additional financial resources in the next budget cycle, 
<br/>the ODPP will be better equipped to address the large volume of cases that is handled at the Nasinu 
<br/>Courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget has steadily increased from 2022 with a budget of 
<br/>$6.3 million to this $8.6 million this year.  With the staffing of 52 prosecutors (31 female and 21 
<br/>male), 35  established administrative staff (25 females and 6 males)  and  12 unestablished support 
<br/>staff.  The ODPP has a ratio of 60 percent female and 40 percent male.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you might just note, in terms of lawyers in the legal profession, there is a 
<br/>huge difference of more women than men.  Prior to this current ratio, female staff was much higher, 
<br/>it  has  only  been  through  a  diversity  inclusion  approach  that  has  allowed  for  more  male  staff 
<br/>recruitment, an approach that was shunned for reason best known to the previous administrators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the professional structure of ODPP is part of the strategic focus of the Office 
<br/>this year.  This professional restructure has led to the intensive JEE.  This JEE has provided the ODPP 
<br/>with formation and baseline data to make informed financial decisions with respect to the prosecutors 
<br/>pay,  providing  motivation  to  the  prosecutors,  providing  opportunities  for  prosecutors  to  access 
<br/>training and enhancement of knowledge, skills and competency of prosecutors.  It is important for 
<br/>the information of this august House that there has been no JEE at ODPP in the recent history.  There 
<br/>was a JEE for civil servants in 2017 that provided some information,  but none as detailed and as 
<br/>comprehensive as that which has recently been completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the DPP is also focussed on the provision of intensive, targeted 
<br/>and specialised training on cybercrime, cyber enabled crime, and in January 2024, a digital forensic 
<br/>investigation training to prepare and equip our prosecutors on the evolving nature of the crime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact  the  need  for  training  in  this  area  is  more  urgent  now  than  ever  before,  given  the 
<br/>increasing  cyber-related  crimes  that have been reported. For us here in  Fiji, the recent  M-PAiSA 
<br/>scam  and the eBay shop online recruitment  scam is  a classic example of the prevalence of cyber 
<br/>enabled crime. The M-PAiSA scam alone is estimated to be worth $614,435.89. Presently, there are 
<br/>650 cases under investigation at the Criminal Investigations Department of the Fiji Police Force.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  need  for  continued  learning  by  prosecutors  in  specialised  areas  of 
<br/>interest is growing. The need for collaboration with development partners who can provide technical 
<br/>and targeted training is crucial. These trainings have boosted the prosecutors’ knowledge in special 
<br/></span><span>areas.  Apart  from  the  cyber  and  digital  evidence  training,  trainings  in  forensic  evidence,  assets 
<br/></span><span>recovery, money laundering, virtual assets and mutual legal assistance have now been explored more 
<br/>than ever before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the DPP has embarked on a Volunteer Legal Internship Programme (VLIP). 
<br/>This deliberate move is part of its succession planning and strategic direction. With the phasing out 
<br/>of the paralegal programmes and rolling out of the VLIP, that will now allow law graduates who 
<br/>have been admitted to the bar to obtain work experience and be ready for Legal Officer positions as 
<br/>and when it grows.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Volunteer Legal Officer (VLO) also provides invaluable support to the prosecutors with 
<br/>their trial preparations and logistical support.  This new initiative of the legal internship programme 
<br/>essentially translates to moving files, better preparation and better research as the VLOs are able to 
<br/>do the necessary research for the prosecutors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The streamlining of some of the processes has allowed for the efficiencies in the assessment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>2424 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the evidence or in the withdrawal of cases where complainants or accused persons have passed 
<br/>away or moved away overseas. Some of these cases have been dragging in our Courts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part of the streamlining of the processes has also led to the Office of the DPP actively working 
<br/>with police prosecutors, initiating a process that will allow files to be assessed more quickly under 
<br/>the supervision of legal officers and senior supervisors.  The Office of the DPP has also utilised the 
<br/>legal vacation period to  visit all prosecution offices in  court divisions to  discuss cases and issues 
<br/>arising out of their cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also  note the cases of delayed response time, although now with more 
<br/>capable  and  competent  team,  the  response  time  has  improved  and  it  is  anticipated  that  with  the 
<br/>continued strategic recruitment, the delays will be minimal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the delay in disposal of cases, it may also be attributed to trial dates setting which 
<br/>is highly depended on available court dates and sittings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are fully aware of this 
<br/>issue.  In some instances, witnesses not being available or accused persons are on bench warrant. It 
<br/>could be a combination of many factors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 46 Courts in Fiji and each day, the prosecutors are expected to conduct trials. Trials 
<br/>also affect the prosecutors’ other desk work such as providing legal advice or analysis of the evidence 
<br/>to respond to representations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  strategic  planning  has  resulted  in  new  purpose  instead  of  vision.  As  a 
<br/>Constitutional office, the ODPP has a specific mandate of always upholding the rule of law through 
<br/>efficient and effective prosecution service and values of independence, courage and fairness, with 
<br/>the four strategic priorities and an implementation plan from 2025 to 2030.  The Office of the DPP 
<br/>prosecutors only now appreciate and understand their calling and profession better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  trying  to  secure  a  conviction,  a  practice  common  under  the  former  suspended  DPP, 
<br/>prosecutors now prosecute a case dispassionately and fairly, even if the outcome is against them. All 
<br/>officers now benefit from international, local and specialised training where they have never received 
<br/>it before as only a select few had been attending for many years under the past Administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prior to 2023, there was no succession planning and no strategic direction.  The change in 
<br/>leadership and the implementation of the new purpose and strategic direction of the ODPP is the 
<br/>epitome  of  strategic  planning,  and  in  turn  clearly  translates  to  improved  service  delivery  to  our 
<br/></span><span>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Public Prosecutions is not for the faint hearted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and my 
<br/>learned colleagues in this Parliament - the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection and </span><span>turaga mataqali</span><span> on the other 
<br/>side, honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu can attest to this.  And I say it again, to be an officer of the 
<br/>DPP is not for the faint hearted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Legal Officer carriage annually is averaging 40 to 60 files per officer, depending on seniority.  
<br/></span><span>The Senior Legal Officers around 60 to 80 files and Principal Legal Officers, obviously, more.  Some 
<br/></span><span>Officers carriage of cases files have been reduced through mitigating measures, such as withdrawal 
<br/>of files where the accused or complainant has passed away, disposal through conducting trials back-
<br/>to-back with the court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 3,000-plus case files daily, as each day, fresh charges are laid in courts all over Fiji.  
<br/>A large part of the prosecutors’ load is mitigated by Police Prosecutions who conduct summary cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2425 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  staggering  statistics,  it  is  critical  that  we  all  be  reminded  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appreciate that the court load for criminal cases is also the load of the ODPP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  the  load  of  some  officers  may  seem  smaller  compared  to  Police  Prosecution,  it  is 
<br/>because the Office of the DPP appear in all levels of the Court.  Police Prosecutors only appear in 
<br/>Magistrates Court, so their volume is higher in terms of criminal files. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The load of the officers in ODPP includes criminal summary offences, appeals to the High 
<br/>Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and the Serious Fraud Division also has the load of 
<br/>doing Civil Forfeiture before the Civil Courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative of the ODPP would not be possible without the support of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development partners such as the Council of Europe, UNODC, AFP, and many others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The independence of ODPP, the demands of the job, the competing priorities and striking 
<br/>work-life harmony is an ongoing issue.  Fair and effective prosecution is essential for the maintenance 
<br/>of law and order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every case should be decided on individual merits, however, the  decision-making process 
<br/>should apply in all cases.  Every prosecutor has the duty to ensure that the right person is prosecuted 
<br/>for the right offence, and that the court is given all the relevant evidence in each case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  of  the  prosecutors  must  always  act  in  the  interest  of  justice,  not 
<br/>principally  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  a  conviction.    Prosecutors  must  be  fair,  independent  and 
<br/>objective.   They must not be influenced by racial, gender, religious or political views or beliefs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the completion of the JEE, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased training and the greater access 
<br/>to  training  opportunities,  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  ODPP  will  continue  to  uphold  the  ethics  of 
<br/>prosecutors which have been defined and articulated in the Prosecution Code 2003, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is important to observe that in a just society, the conviction of the guilty is in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>public interest, as is the acquittal of the innocent.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise, again, to respond to the Ministerial Statement on 
<br/></span><span>the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. While the Government has chosen to highlight the 
<br/>achievements and plans of this institution, we must take this opportunity to emphasize a fundamental 
<br/>truth - the independence of the ODPP is not just a guiding principle, it is an unshakable cornerstone 
<br/>of democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the independence of the ODPP is not something to be negotiated or debated, 
<br/>it is non-negotiable.  There is no ‘may’ in this, there is  only a must. The ODPP must stand as an 
<br/>institution that operates free from political interference or external pressures, and I acknowledge the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister also emphasised that, I am happy to hear that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, any attempt to blur the lines, overstep boundaries or politicise its functions 
<br/>would  be  an  unforgivable  betrayal  of  the  public  trust.  This  Office  cannot  be  and  must  not  be 
<br/>weaponised. Integrity, honourable Minister for Justice, cannot be compromised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is troubling that in recent times, the integrity of our institutions seem to 
<br/>be  under  strain.    The  ODPP,  like  all  other  pillars  of  our  judicial  system,  cannot  afford  even  the 
<br/>perception of compromise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  world  is  watching  us.    Our  people,  our  investors,  our  financial 
<br/>institutions and our development partners are all carefully observing how we conduct ourselves and 
<br/>how  we  uphold  the  rule  of  law.  Any  deviation  from  the  highest  standards  of  independence  and 
<br/>transparency  will  tarnish  our  reputation  and  erode  public  confidence  in  our  judicial  system.  The 
<br/>stakes are high, honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister points out to the ambitious plans of the ODPP, 
<br/>let  me  remind  this  Government  that  no  ambition  is  greater  than  the  preservation  of  judicial 
<br/>impartiality.  The evolving nature of crime, while a valid concern, Mr. Speaker, must not be used as 
<br/>an excuse for any action that could compromise the independence of this critical institution.  Even 
<br/>that hint of selective prosecution, political influence, or even the slightest hint of impropriety, will 
<br/>have far reaching consequences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  cannot  allow  a  single  institution  within  our  judicial  system  to  be 
<br/>compromised, not for political expediency, not  for convenience, and certainly not for personal or 
<br/>party gain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  government  is  truly  committed  to  justice,  it  must  prioritise  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>protection of institutional independence and integrity above all else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the honourable Minister has outlined the work of the 
<br/>ODPP, let it be very clear - the Opposition will not tolerate any weakening of our judicial systems or 
<br/>institutions. We will remain vigilant and ensure that the integrity, independence and impartiality of 
<br/>the ODPP and every other institution in our justice system remain intact, as per the 2013 Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the outset Mr. Speaker, Sir, and at the end I wish the honourable Minister well in ensuring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that all that he has spoken of will be adhered to by his Ministry and the ODPP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Director of Prosecutions 
<br/></span><span>is motivated by the principle that it is the interest of justice that the guilty be brought to justice and 
<br/></span><span>the innocents are not wrongly convicted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Constitution also requires Parliament to provide adequate funding to the 
<br/>ODPP, and I wish to thank the honourable Minister for Justice for the update this afternoon. This has 
<br/>been long overdue.  Sir, I have been in that office in the  past five years, and I have seen a lot of 
<br/>changes in the DPP under leadership of the current Acting DPP, Ms. Tikoisuva, who is a prosecutor 
<br/>at heart, a strong lady.  I wish to thank Ms. Tikoisuva and the staff at the ODPP for the work that 
<br/>have been carried out in the past years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  work  of  the  ODPP  continues  to  grow  and  demand  the  skills  and 
<br/>commitment  of  legal,  technical  and  corporate  professionals.  I  wish  to  thank  the  Government  for 
<br/>continuing to make steady and careful progress towards building an organisation that is both, modern 
<br/>and professional, and which formally promotes and upholds the rule of law.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2427 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I strongly believe that training and development programmes are essential in sustaining the 
<br/>delivery of a high-quality prosecution service, and I am glad that the honourable Minister for Justice 
<br/>had alluded to that this afternoon.  This is  also,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, an advantage of having a local 
<br/>Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  (DPP),  as  they  will  better  understand  our  jurisdiction  rather  than 
<br/>bringing in an expatriate who is not really aware of what is going on in our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad that an office of the DPP is now opening at Nasinu which is long overdue as it is a 
<br/>densely populated area.  This should have been done years ago, but I thank the Government that it 
<br/>has now opened a branch at Nasinu Town, and I am grateful for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also an issue of work overload by the prosecutors in the past. I am 
<br/>glad that there are now 42 Prosecutors in  the ODPP and I believe that they will hire prosecutors, 
<br/>increase it to 50 or even 60 or 70, because the work of a prosecutor is not easy.  You know the work 
<br/>of a prosecutor.  Two Prosecutors manning Nasinu Office alone is not enough, prosecuting or making 
<br/>three or four trials in a day is too much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe under the leadership of the honourable Minister for Justice, a lot 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of changes will be done in the ODPP.  With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
