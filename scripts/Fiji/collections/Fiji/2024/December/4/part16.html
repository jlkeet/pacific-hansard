<h3>BSP FIJI BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>BSP FIJI BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>BSP Fiji Bill 2024 (Bill No. 22/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill  must  not  be  referred  to  a  Standing  Committee  or  other  Committee  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill  must  be debated and voted upon by Parliament  on Thursday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 
<br/>2024, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is fairly straightforward Bill.  This 
<br/>is in relation to the BSP bank which is currently domiciled in Fiji as a branch of the Bank of South 
<br/>Pacific which is the parent company.  What the bank wishes to do is to change from a branch to a 
<br/>full subsidiary governed under the Companies Act of Fiji and under any other governance supervision 
<br/>arrangements that we have within our mechanism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cabinet following the request from BSP, the Ministry of Finance took 
<br/>a Cabinet Paper and the Cabinet gave the concurrence and asked for further consultation with BSP 
<br/>management.    Further  to  that,  a  stakeholder  consultation,  with  BSP  management  which  actually 
<br/>called for written submission on the proposed restructure and the proposed BSP Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, direct invitations were also given, there were face-to-face consultation that 
<br/>was held with the stakeholders and all of them were represented during the set time for consultation 
<br/>which was on 8</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024, held at the BSP Conference Room at their Fiji branch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the urgency of the Bill, if I can, because I know that would be perhaps one 
<br/>of the points that my colleagues on the other side might raise, but because the request was made by 
<br/>BSP, by a parent company and the senior management who visited Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two methods of converting or moving away from a branch to a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subsidiary: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transfer by agreement (which involves other processes, so the best way to do that and 
<br/>the preferred option is); and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>by legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are precedents in Australia, New Zealand and in Fiji we also have that precedent.  For 
<br/></span><span>example, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Decree 1991 and ANZ Transfer Regulations 
<br/></span><span>1991, Colonial Fiji Life Act 1991, Australia New Zealand Banking Group Bank of Hawaii Act 2001 
<br/>and, of course, the Bank of South Pacific Act 2011, so this is not a new thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other reason why we rushed this Bill into this session is because the new financial year 
<br/>for BSP will start on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January and if we did not do it in this session, then they would have difficulty 
<br/>moving towards a fully-fledged subsidiary governed by the Companies Act 2015 of Fiji.  That is the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have moved this motion under Standing Order 51, and I urge honourable 
<br/>Members to support this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for the debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I will give over to the Whip.  I think the honourable Whip wanted to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is referring to you, honourable Koya.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, obviously, this has been brought under Standing Order 51, 
<br/>but I think it has a valid reason, it needs to be done and this is not like something new. We will have 
<br/>time to munch over it and then come up with something, if there is something within the substantive 
<br/>Bill, but in order to get it done, especially in light of the fact that it needs to be done before January, 
<br/>we do not have any problem and issue with this coming under Standing Order 51.  So, all in all, we 
<br/>support the current motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Bloc-9 Group, we support the motion, 
<br/>given the urgency, given the bankâ€™s financial year starts in January, and that is quite urgent given this 
<br/>is  the  only  sitting  of  Parliament  that  these  changes  can  be  done.  That  meets  the  requirement  for 
<br/>Standing Order 51 to go through the shortcut provisions of the Standing Orders so that the Bill passes 
<br/>without delay under Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to thank the two honourable 
<br/>Members from the Opposition for supporting the motion.  I do not have anything further to add at 
<br/>this stage, but during the debate tomorrow, I will talk about the Bill a little bit more.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
