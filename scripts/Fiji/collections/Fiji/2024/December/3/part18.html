<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the

<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill  2024.  On  25</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  2023,  Cabinet  approved  the  review  of  the  fisheries  legislation  through 
<br/>Cabinet Decision No. 171 of 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Bill 2024 is the continued work from Bill No. 9 of 2016, 
<br/>tabled in Parliament on 9</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2016 for its first reading under Standing Order 84(2). It was 
<br/>then tabled for second reading on 26</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2016 and referred to the Standing Committee on Natural 
<br/>Resources for deliberation and consultation. The Bill lapsed when Parliament prorogued in 2018 and 
<br/>was not returned to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tabling of the Aquaculture Bill 2024 is based on the need to account for 
<br/>new and emerging issues that the current fisheries laws are inadequate to address. Also, there is a 
<br/>need to  develop  a fit  to  purpose legislation to  support growth  in  the  fisheries sector,  ensure  food 
<br/>security  and  livelihoods,  protect  biodiversity  and  resource  sustainability  that  benefits  current  and 
<br/>future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  aquaculture  was  introduced  to  Fiji  in  1940  with  the  culturing  and 
<br/>introduction  of  freshwater  species.  Recently,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  launched  its  5-Year 
<br/>Aquaculture Development Plan that looks at transforming the industry. This Aquaculture Bill seeks 
<br/>to bring about the legal framework.  Since its drafting, the Aquaculture Bill has been consulted with 
<br/>all  aquaculture  and  fishery  stakeholders,  and  the  general  public,  including  relevant  Government 
<br/>agencies and CSOs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Bill 2024 provides a structured framework for sustainable 
<br/>aquaculture,  ensuring  resource  conservation,  managing  aquaculture  zones,  regulating  trade  in 
<br/>aquaculture products and imposing licensing requirements. The aim of the Bill is to enhance food 
<br/>security,  economic  growth  and  employment  in  accordance  with  national  and  international 
<br/>environmental obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now open the floor for debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will have the right of reply from the mover.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this Bill is a very important one, as has been 
<br/>expressed by the honourable Minister.  It was raised in 2016 and then it lapsed. There has been a 
<br/>considerable amount of time from 2016 till to-date, I think about eight years, and I think the Bill has 
<br/>been refined in that particular point in time. But this is a completely new Bill; a complete Bill on its 
<br/>own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister said that they have had consultations, she actually said the Bill was 
<br/>consulted, I do not know what that actually means. There had been consultations by the technical 
<br/>staff in the Ministry with stakeholders all around the country. That is good.  That is the role of the 
<br/>Ministry before it brings the Bill to the House to make sure that the consultations take place, consult 
<br/>the stakeholders to make sure that when they put the Bill together, everything is coherent, everything 
<br/>is congruent, everything meets the intent for which the Bill was supposed to.  But then, when you 
<br/>have a completely new Bill, to then rush it to Standing Order 51, without giving the opportunities of 
<br/>the representatives of the people in this House to do that, why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  This  has  not  gone  to  the  Committees!    What  Committee  is  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister talking about?  Is he, once again, trying to mislead this House? Is 
<br/>he, once again, trying to mislead the people of this country? He needs to be able to check before he 
<br/>makes such a statement.

<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2361 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet is not the Legislature; it is an arm of the Executive. This is the Legislature; this is the 
<br/>People’s House! The Committees that are established by this House, they represent the voters of this 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you as members of the Executive, you are subject to 
<br/>the dictates of this House and it is important that when a substantive Bill of this nature is brought to 
<br/>be passed in Parliament, that the representatives of the people as seen in the Committees of this House 
<br/>should have the opportunity to make their own consultations, to make sure that any Bill passed is, as 
<br/>the Minister has said, fit and proper.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  agree  with  the  importance  of  this  Bill  and  everything  that  is  being  said  here  about 
<br/>aquaculture.    We  know  it  is  very  important,  and  we  need  to  be  able  to  do  it.  These  aquaculture 
<br/>activities, programmes and strategies are being done, as we speak today, but I do not see what the 
<br/>urgency is to rush it immediately through Standing Order 51. Is there a fire behind this that we are 
<br/>trying to escape from? No such thing!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree that this should be debated upon this 
<br/>week, just to pass this Bill. It is a substantive Bill, it needs to go through the full process to ensure 
<br/>scrutiny, to make sure that we, the representatives of the voters of this country, the democratic House 
<br/>of this country, have the opportunity to screen it to our satisfaction, make the changes and bring it 
<br/>back to the House. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is there any other intervention on the Bill?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my simple question is,  what is the urgency? I 
<br/>will refer to a particular Bill before us that we are meant to debate.  That is the Fiji World Heritage 
<br/>Bill. This is another Bill that this Government tried to push through Standing Order 51 and have it 
<br/>debated in a single sitting. We sent this particular Bill to Committees and just see the number of 
<br/>changes almost on every page.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we informed the former Attorney-General that the Bill could not be presented in that 
<br/>manner, he was adamant to bring it under Standing Order 51. If the Bill is given to Committees, how 
<br/>many changes will be brought to the Bill itself?  What is the urgency to have it debated in two days? 
<br/>It is a substantive Bill. There is no urgency to do it under one single sitting. We need to send this 
<br/>particular Bill to Committees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know what is happening in the Office of the Attorney-General - there are no legal drafters, 
<br/></span><span>no senior legal drafters.  For the Audit Bill, we had to change the table of contents. It is a shame on 
<br/></span><span>the Office of the Attorney-General.  We do not have the drafters.  We are trying to push this Bill, we 
<br/>have the Fiji World Heritage Bill, we already have changed on the first page.  Why are we doing 
<br/>this?    A  common  example,  send  this  Bill  to  Committees  so  that  it  can  scrutinise,  make  specific 
<br/>changes, bring it back to Parliament and then debate it.  We have pushed the experienced and senior 
<br/>legal drafters out of the workforce, and this is the result we get, the Fiji World Heritage Bill.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I request the Government to send it to Committees so that it can be scrutinised.

<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2362 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  floor.  This  is  a 
<br/>contribution from Bloc Nine.  If you look at Standing Order 51, it does not have any requirement on 
<br/>urgency.  This has been raised in two previous terms of Parliament, but the Standing Order allows 
<br/>and permits that the mover of the motion, whoever is moving the Bill to expedite the Bill through the 
<br/>shortcut provision, not following Standing Order 84(2).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was unfortunate when this Bill came up in 2016, it was listed for first reading and second 
<br/>reading and did not make it up to third reading given that it lapsed.  That showed the lack of political 
<br/>will maybe at that particular time, but again, as the honourable Minister has rightly said that there 
<br/>are growing issues now in the aquaculture sector that needs this Bill and the urgency of this Bill to 
<br/>go through Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just take you through some statistics.  Back in 2016, there were a total 
<br/>of 53 Bills introduced in the House; 15 Bills were Consequential Bills through budget, there were 
<br/>only two Bills out of the 53 that was referred to the Committee. So, 16 went through a single sitting 
<br/>of Parliament.  During that time, Standing Order 51 was overused (not abused) but it was used.  It 
<br/>shows  the  prerogative,  and  discretion  remains  with  the  Government.    If  policies  needs  to  be 
<br/>implemented, a certain framework that has been part of the Minister's justification for tabling these 
<br/>Bills through Standing Order 51 that needs implementation, then Standing Order 51 is the procedure 
<br/>that is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  take  you  to  another  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2022,  there  were  49  Bills  that  were 
<br/>introduced and tabled in Parliament, 11 were Consequential Bills, only one went through the scrutiny 
<br/>of Committees, 11 went through a single sitting of Parliament, like the ones this week, that is, tabled 
<br/>today and debated on Thursday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me come to 2023 to give a comparison.  In 2023, there were 29 Bills tabled in Parliament, 
<br/>12 were Consequential Bills, four went through a single sitting of Parliament like what we doing now 
<br/>and one went to Committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2024, there were 19 Bills, this will be the 20th Bill and nine were Consequential Bills, 
<br/>three are going through a single sitting of Parliament, that will be the Bills to amend the Presidential 
<br/>Act  2024  and  the  Fiji  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Bill  2024  that  was  tabled  yesterday  and  the 
<br/>Aquaculture Bill 2024 that is being tabled now.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there are five that were referred to Committees in 2024, two have been tabled back 
<br/>in  Parliament,  that  is,  Anti-Doping  Bill  2024  and  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Bill  2024 
<br/>which are now being enacted into Acts.  Three will be debated on Thursday, that will be the Child 
<br/>Justice Bill 2024, Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 and Heritage Bill 2023, and then they will be 
<br/>enacted after that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you see the statistics, comparing to previous terms of Parliament, I think now, it will be fair 
<br/>to say that Standing Order 51 should be the right procedure that the Aquaculture Bill should come 
<br/>through and be given tonight and tomorrow to study the Bill till Thursday.    There is ample time to 
<br/>go through Standing Order 51.  Mr. Speaker, I can see the urgency and we should all support this 
<br/></span><span>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  understand  that  the  Bill  went  through  second 
<br/>reading in 2016, but who were in the Committee?  The Members here, probably were not there, even 
<br/>I was not in Parliament at that time and there may be more Members sitting here who were not in 
<br/>Parliament at that time.  This is a substantial Bill, I heard honourable Bulitavu, he is in Opposition 
<br/>but we know he should be given a Ministerial post so that he can speak openly from the other side.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2363 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is occupying a seat on this side, but he should be sitting on the other side.  I remember what the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Tourism used to say, “please give him a ticket”, so I understand that.  Two 
<br/>points that I would like to make here is, first, this is the Government that kept on saying, “we will 
<br/>not use Standing Order 51”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We will only use it sparingly for minor changes.  This is not a minor 
<br/>change, this is a substantial Bill.  Sir, just to point out mistakes.  I just glanced through the pages, 
<br/>page  10,  it  says  here  and  I  quote:  “The  Minister,  Permanent  Secretary,  Director  or  any  Fisheries 
<br/>Officer must to the “extend” possible, it should be extent - simple error.  That is why the Bill should 
<br/>be  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee,  it  will  make  the  Government  look  good,  it  will  help  the 
<br/>magistrates, judges and the lawyers to do their work, if that is what we want.  It cannot be just rushed 
<br/>through for the sake of it.  I will ask the honourable Prime Minister to intervene because he made the 
<br/>right decision when it came to the Heritage Bill.  That is why the Heritage Bill has been scrutinised 
<br/>by the Committee and we can see that the Bill is in a form that can be agreed to in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Bulitavu for putting 
<br/>out very clearly the statistics but that should give them some food for thought, reflect on their own 
<br/>past and see what was happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  just  come  back  to  the  subject  matter  and  the  points  that  honourable  Maharaj, 
<br/>honourable  Kumar  and  honourable  Usamate  made.    The  Standing  Order  is  very  clear.    The 
<br/>requirement  is  up  to  the  Government,  up  to  the  Executive  to  use  Standing  Order  51  whenever  it 
<br/>deems necessary …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Elections promise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and we are doing it.  Honourable Kumar is always very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>irritating, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- His a gentleman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When the debate happens, what they are doing now is actually 
<br/>talking about the Bill.  As you said, Mr. Speaker, the other day, we are talking about whether the Bill 
<br/>should be debated under Standing Order 51 or not.  They are going and saying, “this subject matter, 
<br/>this error”; they will have an opportunity on Thursday to move an amendment, to propose a change, 
<br/>that is part of the Parliamentary process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ten minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can do that in 10 minutes, you can do that in five minutes, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you have two or three days to read through this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As honourable Bulitavu said very clearly with statistics, this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is open and transparent.

<div><span>2364 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This Bill was there in 2016, it went through Committees, and 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I sat in the Opposition for eight years and the rate at which they were using  Standing 
<br/>Order 51 to run legislation ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ... and sometimes corrupt legislation and they were doing this 
<br/>using Standing Order 51. There might be a typing error somewhere that she pointed out, but the fact 
<br/>is that the Government has the right under Standing Order 51 to bring a Bill to Parliament.  We are 
<br/>not doing this, we are not doing this willy-nilly, we are doing this because the Minister who is the 
<br/>person who gets the advice from the relevant Ministry that this Bill is now urgent, it needs to be 
<br/>passed now and therefore the circumstances leading to this Bill coming into this Parliament under 
<br/>Standing Order 51 makes sense.  As they admit, this Bill was supposed to be done in 2016, 2017 and 
<br/>they did not do it.  We have been in Government for less than two years and we are bringing this Bill 
<br/>and making sure that it gets through, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those remarks, this is the right thing to do, and I support the honourable Minister and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>her motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Kumar had requested the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak, if he so wishes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I pushed this Bill back to Cabinet.  I wanted them 
<br/>to assure me that consultation had been done. That came back to our Legislation Committee after 
<br/>further consultation, and I am satisfied that it can come forward at this time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Sir,  the  debate  this  evening  seems  to  hinge  on  Standing 
<br/>Order 51, it is not really.  I thank the honourable Minister in bringing this legislation through. We 
<br/>have gone through consultation within the Ministry of Fisheries as this was a stumbling block to the 
<br/>development of aquaculture in Fiji.  It had created a lot of discussions under the various Ministries 
<br/>that deal with aquaculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you understand, Sir, aquaculture is the development of fisheries within the inshore and on 
<br/>land.  There were issues that interact with other Ministries and other agencies, and that was the main 
<br/>cause of the delay in bringing it to Parliament. Now, it is coming under Standing Order 51, if it is 
<br/>correct and right that being a substantive Bill and it is in order, then it is alright.  But if it is not in 
<br/>order, then I would ask the intervention that it be relooked at so that it is, in totality, fit to be passed 
<br/>as a Bill and it will cover the regulations with the various development of aquaculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill is necessary, this Bill is urgent and it is needed but whatever is required to make it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work and be able support the aquaculture industry in Fiji, that should be done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  That  concludes  the  debate  on  this  item.  I  now  call  on  the  Minister  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fisheries to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all honourable Members who had 
<br/>contributed  to  the  debate  on  the  motion  before  Parliament.  I  also  thank  the  former  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Koroilavesau, for all your insights and your wisdom.

<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2365 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, like I had mentioned earlier, the Aquaculture Bill of 2024 is the continued work 
<br/>from  Bill  No.  9  of  2016  that  was  tabled  in  Parliament  for  first  reading,  second  reading  and  was 
<br/>referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. The urgency of this Bill is to seek the 
<br/>prevention of disease outbreak, the prevention of the importation of exotic species into Fiji and the 
<br/>need to account for new and emerging issues that the current fisheries laws are inadequate to address.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  trust  my  staff  at  the  Ministry,  and  I  thank  them  for  doing  the  necessary 
<br/>groundwork of bringing this Bill back into Parliament. I thank them for the consultations and the 
<br/>work that they have done till today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in that regard, I commend the Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
