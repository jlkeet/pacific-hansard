<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Legal Aid Commission 2018-2023 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and 
<br/>Defence  hereby  submits  to  Parliament  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Legal  Aid 
<br/>Commission 2018-2023 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Legal Aid Commission is a statutory body established under the Legal Aid Act 1996 and 
<br/>the Legal Aid Amendment Decree 2009.  The primary purpose of the Commission is to assist eligible 
<br/>individuals who may not be able to afford the services of a private law practitioner, to be able to still 
<br/>gain access to quality legal services and ultimately access to justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Commission  provides  free  legal  services  to  members  of  the  public  by  giving  advice, 
<br/>providing legal representation in court, and providing services in all areas of family and criminal law.  
<br/>Assistance is also provided in civil law matters but is restricted to certain areas of practice. Some of 
<br/>the services require fulfilment of eligibility criteria, which is often waived if there are extenuating 
<br/>circumstances, especially for vulnerable clients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  captures  the  trends  in  the  various  activities  reported  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reporting period. This Report contains six recommendations for consideration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just for information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had called for an oral public submission 
<br/>from  the  Legal  Aid  Commission  on  5th  November,  2024.  During  this  consultation,  there  was  a 
<br/>technical fault with the audio on the broadcast system within Parliament, which did not allow the 
<br/>hearing to be aired publicly, as a requirement under the Standing Orders.  However, the members of 
<br/>the media attended the meeting in person.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Commission for the completion and submission of its 2018-2023 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, they are up to date with their Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secretariat for the work towards the completion of this bipartisan Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Orders 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.

<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Office of the Attorney-General 2006-2023 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
<br/>Defence hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Office of the Attorney-
<br/>General’s Annual Reports from 2006 to 2023.  This is a period of 17 years and upfront, I would like 
<br/>to thank the Office of the Attorney-General for providing these Reports from 2006 to 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the Committee did was, we grouped the Reports into three lots for 
<br/>ease  of  scrutiny.  So,  we  had  three  separate  Reports  that  can  be  read  separately  or  the  three  read 
<br/>together.  The first one is from 2006 to 2013, this is the period when there was no Parliament.  The 
<br/>second lot is from 2014 to 2022 and the third is the 2022 to 2023 Annual Reports, to be fair, and that 
<br/>is when the new Government was in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The structure of the Reports were all the same, that it was quite easy for the Committee to 
<br/>look at the Reports and look at the trends of activities of the Office of the Attorney-General.  We 
<br/>thank the Office of the Attorney-General for keeping that data that they used from way back in 2006 
<br/>right up to 2023.  As an example, it stood out as one of the issues - that when it comes to litigation, 
<br/>the  biggest  number  of  litigation  that  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  does  is  on  accidents  of 
<br/>government vehicles, and it is the same right throughout the period.  So, when you read the Reports, 
<br/>it shows those trends, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence  for  the  work  and  the 
<br/>Secretariat on the work done to compile these three Reports to cover the period from 2006 to 2023.  
<br/>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit these three Reports 
<br/>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Reports handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future 
<br/>sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I am happy to second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Suva City Council 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Social  Affairs  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Suva  City  Council  2016  to  2018  Annual 
<br/>Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mandated under Standing Order 109(2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2314 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee reviewed the Annual Reports and identified important issues which were then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>brought to the attention of the Suva City Council for their necessary actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from its primary function of collecting rates and providing services to ratepayers, the 
<br/>Suva  City  Council  now  faces  many  other  challenges.  This  include  the  drug  situation,  the  city’s 
<br/>security situation and dealing with street dwellers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is of the view that given the current situation, the Municipal Council must 
<br/>review its functions and operational procedures as a matter of urgency to address the serious social 
<br/>issues within the Municipality. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/>will need to provide guidance and oversight to the Suva City Council for its operations’ compliance, 
<br/>operational efficiency and effectiveness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to sincerely thank the Chairman and Special Administrator for the Suva City 
<br/>Council  and  his  team,  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  her 
<br/>Officials, for their valuable contributions to this review process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I would like to thank the Members of the Stading Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs - honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Iowane 
<br/>Naivalurua and honourable Viam Pillay, for their valuable input and support.  I would also like to 
<br/>thank honourable Joseph Nand and honourable Alipate Tuicolo for the assistance they had rendered 
<br/>on several occasions as Alternate Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report to Parliament and request that all Members of this august Parliament take note of the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(5),  I  hereby 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think this will be an opportune time to take our tea 
<br/>break and enjoy the carol singing.  Parliament will resume in half an hour. Thank you, honourable 
<br/>Members.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.13 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance 2023 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence 
<br/>hereby submits to Parliament the Review Report on the Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance 2023 Annual 
<br/>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF), under the Insurance Act 1998 and the Insurance Regulations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1998is responsible for the regulation and supervision of the insurance industry in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RBF aims to achieve the underlying objective of safeguarding policyholders’ interest by 
<br/>overseeing  the  soundness  and  stability  of  the  insurance  industry.  The  RBF  executes  this  role  by 
<br/>issuing licences to market participants and supervision policies to govern the conduct of insurance 
<br/>business in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a requirement under the Act that all insurance companies and intermediaries conducting 
<br/>insurance  business  in  Fiji  to  be  licensed  by  RBF.  Supplemented  by  the  requirements  of  the 
<br/>Regulations,  the  RBF  has  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  people  seeking  to  undertake  insurance 
<br/>business are fit and proper, and in compliance with regulatory requirements at all times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee would like to report that the insurance sector, during the reporting period, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fared well and contributed positively to the Fijian economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, contains two recommendations for consideration, one is to the 
<br/>Ministry of Public Works, Transport  and Meteorological  Services.  I hope that when this is  made 
<br/>available by Parliament, they will look into it quickly. This has to do with parametric insurance, and 
<br/>I hope that the Ministry can take up an action on it very quickly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee had called for an oral public submission from the RBF on 13</span><span>th</span><span> November, 
<br/>2024. Again, this session was not aired live due to technical issues. I raised this point twice about the 
<br/>technical problems that we have here in Parliament because there is a requirement under Standing 
<br/>Orders  that  we  conduct  public  hearings.  But  in  this  instance,  it  was  later  aired  on  the  Walesi 
<br/>Parliament Television Channel, but it was not live when we were having the meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  thank  and  commend  the  RBF  for  being  up  to  date  with  their  Insurance  Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secretariat, for compiling this bipartisan Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:

<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on the Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I table my Report, let me 
<br/>join the House in also congratulating you on your appointment as the honourable Speaker of this 
<br/>august House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 1990, Fiji became a party to the Convention concerning the 
<br/>protection of the World Cultural and National Heritage, which was adopted by the United Nations 
<br/>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference in 1972 (World 
<br/>Heritage Convention).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, as a State party to the World Heritage Convention, is required under the World Heritage 
<br/>Convention to adopt legislative and administrative provisions to give effect to the World Heritage 
<br/>Convention. Therefore, the Heritage Bill 2023 provides for the domestic application of the World 
<br/>Heritage Convention in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Heritage Bill 2023 (Bill No. 25 of 2023) was introduced to recognise and manage places 
<br/>in Fiji with potential and actual world heritage values. The Bill aims to align Fiji's domestic laws 
<br/>with the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, ensuring the protection of Fiji's unique natural and 
<br/>cultural heritage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while there are existing national laws that cover the designation and protection 
<br/>of cultural and natural heritage sites, monuments and places, there is no law that specifically covers 
<br/>for sites that are recognised internationally, pursuant to the 1972 World Heritage Convention, which 
<br/>Fiji is a party to. Simply put, there are no protection mechanisms for sites (as per current Bill) that 
<br/>are declared as:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Potential World Heritage sites (National Level;  
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Tentative World Heritage sites (International Level); and  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>World Heritage sites (International Level).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  same,  there  are  gaps  in  our  current  laws  that  resulted  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proposition of the following attributes which have been reflected in the current Bill: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Sustainable  management  or  potential  places,  sites  and  monuments  that  meet  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>requirements of outstanding universal values of UNESCO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Establishment of a trust fund for each nationally and internationally designated sites, places 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and monuments, to ensure that it can sustainably manage itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Establishment of management organisations on site to spearhead the operations of the site. 
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Establishment  of  a  Fiji  Heritage  Council  at  national  level  to  ensure  coordination  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designation of sites that meet international criteria. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Establishment  of  a  Fiji  Register  that  will  ensure  sites  designated  are  systematically 
<br/>organised for reference purposes and other measures necessary for the administration of the 
<br/>nominated sites.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee conducted public consultations in various 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2317 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities and invited the public to provide submissions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of those who participated in the public consultations supported and 
<br/>commended the introduction of the Bill.  However, mixed feelings were expressed by landowners 
<br/>where their land are within the buffer zones.  There was support due to the potential for increased 
<br/>tourism and preservation of cultural heritage, but concerns were raised about restrictions on land use 
<br/>and development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee deliberated at length on concerns raised by submittees and is confident that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all issues raised have now been addressed through the amendments made to the initial Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Members  of  the  current  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights  - honourable  Iliesa Vanawalu,  honourable Lenora 
<br/>Qereqeretabua, honourable Jone Usamate and honourable Mosese Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  previous  Members  of  the  Committee,  namely,  honourable 
<br/>Faiyaz Koya, honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu, honourable Viliame Naupoto and honourable Taito 
<br/>Matasawalevu, including honourable Sashi Kiran, who are Alternate Members on certain occasions.  
<br/>A big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the drafters who have made amendments to the Bill that 
<br/>is tabled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Heritage Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolutions of Parliament on Friday, 
<br/>15</span><span>th </span><span>September, 2023 and Friday 15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024, and the Communication from the Chair on 24</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>November, 2023, the Standing  Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly and the Bill will 
<br/>be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on the Child Justice Bill 2024  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I stand as the Chairman 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights.  The Committee has entrusted me to 
<br/>table this Report on behalf of the honourable Members of the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by giving a brief background of the Bill.  The Child 
<br/>Justice Bill 2024 aims to establish a comprehensive specialised criminal justice system for children 
<br/>and for related matters.  At the commencement of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the Committee made 
<br/>preliminary deliberations on the Clauses of the Bill and noted that the Child Justice Bill 2024 seeks 
<br/>to repeal the provision of the Juveniles Act 1973, that deals with children in conflict with the law, 
<br/>formally known as juveniles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides a more comprehensive framework for the special treatment 
<br/></span><span>of children at all stages of the child justice process, from the point of their initial contact with the 
<br/></span><span>Police through to trial, rehabilitation and reintegration into the community and into their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst the key changes to the Bill, are the new provisions which specifies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill replaces the term “juvenile” with “child in conflict with the law”, as the stigma 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2318 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attached to the term “juvenile” is detrimental to the rehabilitation of an offender who is a 
<br/>child. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill introduces new objectives and guiding principles that require a balanced approach, 
<br/>ensuring that the children in conflict with the law are held accountable for their actions, as 
<br/>well as supporting their rehabilitation and re-integration into society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill also raises the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 years to 14 years, 
<br/>and clarifies that special juvenile justice procedures apply to all children under the age of 
<br/>18 at the time the offence was committed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill provides a detailed statement of the role of the Ministry of Women, Children and 
<br/>Social  Protection’s  Department  of  Children  and  new  specialised  Child  Justice  Officers 
<br/>(formerly  known  as  Probation  Officers)  in  developing  rehabilitation  and  re-integration 
<br/>services for children, in partnership with other Government agencies, NGOs, faith-based 
<br/>organisations and traditional and community leaders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill provides new provisions on police conduct towards children, incorporating the Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Police Force Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for children in contact with the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The new provisions on diversion in the Bill, allowing the police or prosecutor to deal with 
<br/>non-serious offences committed by children through cautions, a diversion plan, or referral 
<br/>to  a  restorative  justice  process,  commonly  known  as  community  conference,  without 
<br/>sending the child to court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>New sections on bail for children in the Bill, in line with the Bail Act, but with special 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considerations for children to reduce the use of remand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>New option for Child Justice Officers to step in earlier and start assisting children at the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>arrest stage, not just when they get to court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)</span><span> </span><span>The Juvenile Court has been renamed the Child Justice Court, and more detailed guidance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is provided on child-friendly court procedures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)</span><span> </span><span>New section requiring Child Justice Officers to prepare social inquiry reports about the 
<br/>child’s background and circumstances, a more detailed guidance on the contents of those 
<br/>reports and deadlines for submitting them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part  of  the  review,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  the  Committee  conducted  public  consultations  in 
<br/>various  communities  and  invitation  to  the  public  to  provide  written  submissions.  Majority  of  the 
<br/>public that had participated in the public submissions supported and commended the introduction of 
<br/>the Bill. However, there were some suggestions on how to make further improvements.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to    the  resolutions  of  Parliament  on 
<br/>Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 and Communications from the Chair on 5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024, the Standing

<div><span>Review Report – Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by giving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a brief background of the  Child Care and Protection Bill 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill replaces the child protection sections of the Juveniles Act (Cap 56).  
<br/>It outlines what the country will do to promote the wellbeing of children and to protect them from all 
<br/>forms  of  violence,  abuse,  neglect  and  exploitation.    The  Juveniles  Act  provision  on  children  in 
<br/>conflict with the law has been incorporated into a separate Child Justice Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  aim  of  the  Child  Care  and  Protection  Bill  2024  is  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive 
<br/>framework  for  child  welfare  services,  and  to  better  guide  the  work  of  the  Ministry  of  Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection in preventing and responding to child abuse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 introduces significant reforms to 
<br/>strengthening  child  welfare  and  protection.  It  establishes  a  new  guiding  framework  for  child 
<br/>protection,  emphasising  the  responsibility  of  parents  and  families  for  the  children's  care  and 
<br/>wellbeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill creates a new Department of Children under the Ministry of Women, Children and 
<br/>Poverty Alleviation, with a clear mandate to provide social welfare services in collaboration with 
<br/>various  stakeholders.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  focus  shifts  from  merely  responding  to  abuse  to 
<br/>preventing it through early intervention. It streamlines the process for reporting and responding to 
<br/>child  protection  cases,  integrating  existing  procedures  into  a  clearer  system  now  overseen  by  the 
<br/>Director for Children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill also defines specific actions to safeguard children, either through 
<br/>family agreements or court orders.  Responsibility for child protection orders shifts to the Family 
<br/>Division of the Magistrate's Court, with more child-friendly procedures.  It also introduces new forms 
<br/>of  alternative  care  (kinship,  foster  and  residential  care)  with  a  priority  on  family-based  care  and 
<br/>includes new offences to address emerging issues, like online exploitation and child grooming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  review,  the  Committee  conducted  public  consultations  in 
<br/>various communities and invited the public to provide written submissions. The Committee received 
<br/>support  and  recommendation  on  the  introduction  of  the  Bill  from  most  of  the  public  that  had 
<br/></span><span>participated in  the public consultations. However, like most activities that  impact  the lives of the 
<br/></span><span>people of  a country, they will also  be other suggestions that are based on the premise of making 
<br/>improvements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  addresses  gaps  in  outdated  laws,  like  the  Juveniles  Act,  and 
<br/>establishes  a  comprehensive  responsive  child  protection  system  focussed  on  prevention,  early 
<br/>intervention and family preservation. Moreover, it emphasises a community-based approach

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>involving families, government agencies, NGOs and traditional leaders in safeguarding children. Key 
<br/>provisions  include  clearer  mechanisms  for  reporting  and  responding  to  abuse,  promoting  family-
<br/>based care and strengthening the role of the Department of Children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the conclusion of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee acknowledges that a few 
<br/>concerns were raised by submitters, highlighting issues such as the need for better parenting support, 
<br/>stronger laws on child sexual abuse and improved digital safety for children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee extensively deliberated on these concerns and concluded that by balancing 
<br/>legal reforms with cultural sensitivity and community involvement, the Bill represents a positive shift 
<br/>in Fiji's approach to child welfare. It aims to create a society in which every child is safe, valued and 
<br/>able to thrive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee believes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Bill is sufficient as it stands, with only 
<br/>minor  amendments  needed.  Additionally,  the  Committee  recommends  a  few  measures  for  the 
<br/>effective  implementation  of  the  proposed  law,  which  have  been  put  forth  for  Parliament's 
<br/>consideration, which are detailed in this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Justice 
<br/>Law and Human Rights for their deliberations and input.  The Committee, through this bipartisan 
<br/>Report and consensus, commends the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 and its amendments to 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
