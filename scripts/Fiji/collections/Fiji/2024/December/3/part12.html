<br/>Parliament Sitting will be for two

<br/>in the Business Committee where 
<br/>Government also brought up the

<br/></span><span>not  only  the  Government,  but 
<br/>also the Opposition side in terms 
<br/>of  the  Government’s  legislative 
<br/>programme  and  the  Bills  which

<div><span>2025 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2307 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sitting Calendar, Sir, will enable all six Standing Committees to continue working on 
<br/>Annual Reports that are pending with the Committees and any Bills that may be brought before this 
<br/>House. This is also the suggested Sitting Calendar which needs the cooperation of all honourable 
<br/>Members, as far as those two matters are concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committees are crucial channels for Parliament to communicate with the public,  and their 
<br/>service is crucial for accountability and scrutiny tools. It is critical to give them time in order for 
<br/>them to complete their tasks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is a new Government and we are working to improve our services to the people of 
<br/>the  nation.  This  will  also  enable  us  to  carry  out  our  plans,  policies  and  programmes,  while  the 
<br/>Standing Committees must continue to carry out and fulfil their role, as stipulated in the Standing 
<br/>Orders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I request all honourable Members to support the Sitting Calendar before the House as it will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enable Parliament to continue its legislative representative and oversight duties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I should add that 2025 is a very important year, as far as Government is concerned, in terms 
<br/>of its legislative programme.  Cabinet has approved the setting up of a Cabinet Sub-Committee on 
<br/>legislation which will facilitate Government’s legislative programme, and this Parliament C alendar 
<br/>will assist in enabling and facilitating that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  light  of  those  important  points,  Sir,  I  commend  this  resolution  to  Parliament  and  ask 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members to support the proposed Sitting Calendar for 2025.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now open the floor for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for presenting the 
<br/>Sitting Calendar. There are two issues that I would like to raise, the first one is, the month of July. 
<br/>We are assigned only one week for the Budget debate. We all know that Budget is a national event. 
<br/>It has a huge impact on businesses, people and, of course, on other agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During that period, it is very important that Members are given enough time to debate the 
<br/>Budget documents. We noticed in the last Sitting, that is, just last July, our speaking time was reduced 
<br/>and that is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, simply because it is a national event. It is an important 
<br/>event. Why was the speaking time reduced? Now, even the Budget debate is reduced by one week. 
<br/>Previously, we were given two weeks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Budget Debate is one week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Previously, go and check!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I would like to raise is on productivity. As Members of Parliament, we 
<br/>expect  everyone  else  to  be  very  productive,  including  civil  servants.    They  must  deliver.  Are  we 
<br/>delivering?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at the time that the Parliament will not sit.  Almost three months, we will not be sitting, 
<br/>and I do not understand why Parliament should be opening on 24</span><span>th</span><span> February and not earlier than that. 
<br/>Last year, we were given the reason that some renovation work was going on in Parliament, therefore, 
<br/>we could not open Parliament on time but now, everything is in order.  Why can we not open the 
<br/>Parliament earlier? We have to set the example for the rest of the country, and I do not understand 
<br/>why we are opening Parliament so late. So, those are my two points. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2025 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2308 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Tuisawau, do you wish to respond? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the calendar as well, I have 
<br/>just checked very quickly and I see that we are going to be prorogued for nearly two months. I, as a 
<br/>Member of two Committees, including Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
<br/>Affairs and Defence, knowing how much work we have, I know, Sir, that in the past, we have been 
<br/>allowed  to  sit  during  prorogation.    I  have  just  checked  very  quickly,  so  I  am  just  asking  all  the 
<br/>Chairpersons to, please, write to your good office and your good self, Sir, to ask for permission to sit 
<br/>during prorogation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Kumar has pointed out, there is a lot of work to do. There are Bills and Annual 
<br/>Reports and Committee Reports that we need to table as quickly as possible.  So, just begging your 
<br/>indulgence and just reminding the honourable Chairpersons of all the Standing Committees to do the 
<br/>right thing and write to Mr. Speaker’s Office, as has been accepted in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was part of the Business Committee that had agreed 
<br/>to this Sitting Calendar, so I will not talk about the calendar </span><span>per se</span><span>, since I was a party to that decision.  
<br/>But, let me say that one of the things that we have seen ever since this Government came into being, 
<br/>there has been a decline in the number of days that we have in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have witnessed the ineptitude of Government.  They would set a calendar and all of a 
<br/>sudden,  they  do  not  know  in  advance  the  dates  on  which  they  are  supposed  to  have  important 
<br/>gatherings,  such  as  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly,  the  COP,  et  cetera.    Because  of  this 
<br/>ineptitude and incompetence on their part, the inability on themselves and their staff to make sure 
<br/>that they know when major events are taking place around the world that they need to attend, they 
<br/>have not taken that into account.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, I understand that they have learned, two years in a row, sitting days have been taken 
<br/>out.    We  have  endorsed  this  Calendar  and  it  is  very  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  there  is  no 
<br/>further  change.    If  there  is  any  further  change  to  this  Sitting  Calendar,  it  will  demonstrate  the 
<br/>incompetence and the ineptitude of those who are in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to recall the comments by the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Speaker as well.  Itis not two months, it is going to be three months.  We were 
<br/>allowed to actually sit next week, but because of the retreat, we will not be able to sit as well.  So, it 
<br/>is November, December and whole of February.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  looking  at  March,  we  are  going  to  sit  for  two  weeks.  When  there  is  no  Committee 
<br/>meeting, what are we actually going to discuss in Parliament, because it is the Committee reports that 
<br/>are basically debated?  All I am actually requesting Government is to reconsider the Calendar, and if 
<br/>we can actually have Parliament prorogued for one month and, at least, Standing Committees to be 
<br/>given time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, we have more than 200 financial 
<br/>reports to be audited, because we have, at least, three years or four years of whole of Government 
<br/></span><span>reports to be scrutinised and it takes time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Because of all the delays. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Oh come on man!  Talk some sense.  We are talking about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>calendar, and you are talking nonsense here.  You are not part of the Committee so, please, do not 
<br/>comment.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2025 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  that  in  mind,  I  will  request  if  Parliament  can  be  prorogued  for  one  month  and 
<br/>Committees to be allowed to sit from January so that we can complete our work.  As the Standing 
<br/>Orders say that although we can actually come to the Speaker, but it is not part of the Standing Order.  
<br/>Standing Orders say that when Parliament is prorogued, all the Committee work comes to a halt.  
<br/>Considering that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my request is if the prorogation period can be reduced from three 
<br/>months to one month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Perhaps,  if  it  will  help  in  our  arriving  at  a  solution,  as  requested  by 
<br/>honourable  Qereqeretabua,  we  are  all  in  this  together,  including  this  Chair.    For  my  part,  I  will 
<br/>certainly entertain and request for sittings after prorogation if it is allowed under our Standing Orders.  
<br/>If there are precedents, we will consider that as well.  So, that will probably help ease the burden 
<br/>which has been referred to by honourable Qereqeretabua and honourable Maharaj.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  quickly  respond  to  some  of  the 
<br/>comments made by the other side on the Calendar, as honourable Usamate has quite rightly said, this 
<br/>has  been  agreed  by  the  Business  Committee.  But  on  what  honourable  Kumar  said,  I  find  that 
<br/>hypocrisy from her never ends. We never had two weeks of Budget debate during your eight years 
<br/>in government and you people were sitting there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can tell  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the timetable that we have agreed to  in  the Business 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee makes a lot of sense. One week of Budget debate is fine and I can tell…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stated that there were no two weeks of sitting… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- One moment, honourable Maharaj. Let me makes this very clear. When 
<br/>you  raise  a  point  of  order,  it  specifically  refers  to  a  Standing  Order?  So,  before  I  allow  you  to 
<br/>continue, you cite me or you quote me the Standing Order you are referring to. before I will let you 
<br/>proceed. Now, which Standing Order are you referring to?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Standing Order 70, relevance, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>just stated that there were no two weeks of sitting for the Budget. He was a part of Parliament and 
<br/>during the 2014 National Budget and 2015 National Budget, we were actually sitting for two weeks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No, you said for the last eight years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A.MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to correct that in this Parliament, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there were two Budget Sittings that were for two weeks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Thank you, honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>2310 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.–  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know  honourable  Maharaj  is  trying  to 
<br/>justify this based on one or two sittings, but the fact is, in the last Parliament, we had one week’s 
<br/>Budget Debate.  After the 2015 Budget, we had one week, and I can assure them that the next Budget 
<br/>will be a good budget. One week debate will be good enough for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this Calendar, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we have agreed in the Business Committee, 
<br/>it makes sense, and it will provide enough time. A lot of the work that is being done is done in the 
<br/>Committees and I want to thank you for making that suggestion that you will look at whether it is 
<br/>allowable. If that is allowable, we will support that the Committees can meet before we sit in March. 
<br/>In fact, it was the Government side that suggested an additional week in March, so we have a two-
<br/>week sitting in March, where we are going to look at a lot of the Bills that we are going to debate as 
<br/>well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-Honourable  Members,  I  think  enough  has  been  said  on  the  issue  of  the 
<br/>Calendar which  had been agreed to by the Business Committee of which all of the Members are 
<br/>represented  through  your  various  delegates.  So,  I  now  call  on  the  Leader  of  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you alluded to, it has been approved by 
<br/>the Business Committee, so the Business Committee is represented by Government,  the G-16 Bloc 
<br/>and G-9 Bloc.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generally, it was a very cordial discussion, compared to what happened today.  There was 
<br/>understanding  by  all  Members,  and  we  have  also  taken  into  account,  even  though  honourable 
<br/>Usamate mentioned two words, “incompetence” and “ineptitude”, in terms of our management of 
<br/>the calendar, but let me stress that one or two of the changes which happened was in the national 
<br/>interest. So, you really cannot equate incompetence or ineptitude to national interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National  interest  is  something  that  we  really  need  to  consider,  especially  if  it  involves 
<br/>meetings related to the Heads of Governments, of key powers in the world and with the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, which is very strategic for our country.  We have also taken into account the UNGA, 
<br/>COP, the CHOGRM, et cetera, and after consultation with all Ministries, and I thank the Members 
<br/>of the Business Committee for endorsing the Calendar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-We will now proceed to vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER- Thank you, we will now move on to the next item.  
<br/></span></div>
