<div><span>Reply  to  Written  Question  No.  282/2024  tabled  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and 
<br/>Medical Services (Ref. Page 2359)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES 
<br/>(Hon. Dr. Ratu A.R. Lalabalavu) 
<br/></span><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/>Reply to Question No. 282/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Postpartum Depression is a significant mood disorder affecting one in seven women following 
<br/>childbirth. The postpartum phase has been defined broadly as within 12 months after childbirth, 
<br/>but the World Health Organisation (WHO) specifies that postpartum period to be within six weeks 
<br/>after childbirth. According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical 
<br/>Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), onset of postpartum major depression can occur prior to or after 
<br/>childbirth. The DSM-5 specifier “with peripartum onset” is used when onset of major depression 
<br/></span><span>occurs either during pregnancy or in the four weeks following delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Postpartum depression can range from a mild depression which is usually self limiting, to a 
<br/>severe syndrome which when untreated can lead to serious consequences to the mother and her 
<br/>baby. Unfortunately, local data on postpartum depression is limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Globally, the prevalence is estimated to be about 14 percent, however the country’s economy 
<br/>status is a factor in its prevalence, where rates are higher in developing countries compared to 
<br/>developed countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Primary risk factors show previous depression prior to or during pregnancy to be the largest 
<br/>effect and mainly associated with postpartum depression while secondary risk factors such as 
<br/>stressful life events (intimate partner violence is  one of them) and poor financial and social 
<br/>support during the post pregnancy period are contributors to postpartum depression.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Women who are most likely to develop postpartum depression are those in lower economic status, 
<br/>minimum education, unmarried and in the young and older spectrum of age. Given the limited data 
<br/>in  Fiji,  the  statistics  from  other  country  and  clinical  settings  reveal  the  aforementioned  socio-
<br/></span><span>economic issues as main contributors to postpartum depression in most country settings.
