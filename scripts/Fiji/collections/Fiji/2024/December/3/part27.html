<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Women after childbirth exhibiting symptoms whilst admitted in the post-natal wards are referred 
<br/>to mental health specialists for further assessment and care together with counselling support and 
<br/>services  within  the  respective  medical  divisions.  Counselling  services  provided  by  the  NGO 
<br/>Empower Pacific assist those who are referred through the current referral processes for women 
<br/>dealing with postpartum depression.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  that  postpartum  depression  can  develop  at  anytime  within  the  twelve  months  after 
<br/>childbirth, Maternal Child Health (MCH) services for mothers and babies at the Primary Care 
<br/>level provide the access to mothers for further health assessment. The Ministry is also currently 
<br/>reviewing  its  MCH  Policy  and  SOPs  where  mental  health  screening  component  by  trained 
<br/>health practitioners will be included for postpartum women with an appropriate referral and 
<br/>care pathway established for those requiring further care.
