<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament adopts the Sitting Calendar for the year 2025.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  all 
<br/>honourable Members are aware, under Standing Order 22(1), the Business Committee is required to  
<br/>recommend to Parliament a schedule of sitting times for each session of Parliament or each 12-month 
<br/>sitting  period  of  Parliament,  whichever  comes  first.  Furthermore,  Clause  2  stipulates  that  the 
<br/>suggested agenda must be submitted to Parliament by the third sitting day of the session, at the latest.  
<br/>In light of that, Sir, the Business Committee met and began deliberating over a suggested 2025 Sitting 
<br/>Calendar which is in front of you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the appropriate dates, I can certify that the 2025 Sitting Calendar which has been 
<br/>distributed to our honourable Members this morning, was accepted and authorised by the Business 
<br/>Committee.  While the Business Committee had accepted and approved the Sitting Calendar, it also 
<br/>agreed that in the event that some of the sittings needed to be readjusted immediately, that would be 
<br/>brought before Parliament for further consideration.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main reason for this is to 
<br/>allow for some flexibility in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following sitting times are listed in the approved Sitting Calendar for the benefit of all 
<br/>our honourable Members and the broader public. As most honourable Members may be aware, this 
<br/>has been the accepted practice in the last two terms of Parliament, of course, including the former 
<br/>Government.
