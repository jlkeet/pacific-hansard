<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT -  
<br/>ACCIDENT COMPENSATION COMMISSION FIJI 2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Accident 
<br/>Compensation Commission Fiji 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports, which was tabled 
<br/>on 3rd October 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 
<br/>(ACCF)  was  established  by  the  Fijian  Government  through  the  introduction  of  the  Accident 
<br/></span><span>Compensation Act 2017, to pay no fault compensation to Fijians as of 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2018, who suffer 
<br/></span><span>personal injury or death as a result of the accidents in Fiji from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ACCF has been providing compensation for injuries and deaths as a result of accidents, 
<br/>in the course of employment, as well in school premises during school hours.  The Act provides for 
<br/>the  scheme  which  the  victims  of  accidents  can  be  compensated  without  having  to  prove  fault  or 
<br/>negligence subject to meeting the Act’s requirements.  Coverage of the no fault scheme is broader 
<br/>than the previous law, as it extends beyond third parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, upon being referred with the ACCF 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports, 
<br/>received submission  from  ACCF to gather information  on its  operational  dynamics as part of the 
<br/>Committee’s scrutiny process.  When the Committee scrutinised the Reports, it identified pertinent 
<br/>issues of concern such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were not included, making it difficult 
<br/>to thoroughly assess the performance of ACCF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  the ACCF did  not  report on the mandatory SDGs.  Thirdly, expenses exceeded 
<br/>revenue  for  both  2020  and  2021.    Lastly,  engaging  of  Veritas  Pte  Ltd  to  produce  and  process 
<br/>applications for schools and employment accidents duplicated the role of the Ministry of Labour, 
<br/></span><span>resulting in resource wastage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Review  Report  articulated  six  findings  with  recommendations.    The 
<br/>Committee  noted  that  there  are  some  good  initiatives  being  undertaken  relating  to  no  fault 
<br/>compensation and public awareness.  However, Committee has identified several key areas to further 
<br/>improve its performance, in particular, duplication of roles or processing of applications for schools 
<br/>and employment accidents that require an urgent review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, is now open for the debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a list of speakers, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S. Nand; 
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya;

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2367 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations; and  
<br/>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, there a few statistics that I would like to start off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) has paid over $42 million since its inception 
<br/>- $29.2 million is for motor vehicle accidents, $12.5 million is for employment related accidents and 
<br/>close to $1 million is for school premises.  My concern here is school premises.  Are our schools safe 
<br/>for our students?  A payment of $1 million as compensation for school accidents is high.  I believe 
<br/>there should be nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is evident from the Annual Report that ACCF is not performing to its optimum level.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it continues to be inadequately funded and in 2020 and 2021, the expenses were more 
<br/>than the revenue it received.  Insufficient budgetary allocation impacts its ability to provide a service 
<br/>to the community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limited public awareness, there is lack of general awareness amongst the public on ACCF’s 
<br/>service and its compensation processes. Many Fijians, especially in the rural areas, are unaware of 
<br/></span><span>their eligibility for compensation or how to file claims.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, lack of communication affects the strategies and the outreach programme. 
<br/>Their </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page, which is supposed to a very modern tool, was last updated in September 2024.  
<br/>For an organisation as such, it should frequently update their </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outsourcing of processing to Veritas Pte Ltd is a concern. This organisation, Sir, is set up 
<br/>to look at processing compensation, however, processing should be done in-house, it should not be 
<br/>outsourced.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is delays in compensation payouts and in some instances, victims had to wait over 18 
<br/>months  to  receive  compensation.  This  is  outrageous.    Why  is  there  such  a  delay  in  getting  this 
<br/>compensation out to the people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the concerns is that we are paying a lot in terms of compensation but the number of 
<br/>road accidents in Fiji is ever increasing. What are we doing about it? Are our roads so unsafe that we 
<br/>get people injured or killed now and then? This should be a concern and should be jointly addressed 
<br/>by all parties concerned, not only ACCF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of an organisation, the concept is that if you can measure it, you can manage it.  In 
<br/>ACCF’s  case,  there  is  a  clear  absence  of  performance  matrix.    So,  are  we  measuring  their 
<br/>performance? If we are not measuring it, how are we managing their performance?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On timelines of claim processing, what is the average time taken to process compensation 
<br/>claims? These are not evident in their Reports.  What are the satisfaction rates of its customers? Were 
<br/>they serviced within the timeframe? How satisfied were they with their performance? It is not there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the claims resolution rate, how effectively were the claims resolved? It is not there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  do  not  have  any  information  where  there  were  any  fraudulent  claims  lodged.  All  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information is missing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On financial efficiency, at what ratio were they able to pay the compensation? Without these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>types of performance in matrix, we will have very little insight on how the institution is doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2368 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ACCF’s Annual Reports, for instance, could provide stakeholders with an overview of 
<br/>the Commission’s operational efficiency and its ability to respond to public needs.  It could, but it 
<br/>did  not.  These  measurable  data  was  missing,  and  it  becomes  impossible  to  hold  the  Commission 
<br/>accountable for delays in claim processing, its inefficiencies or under performance in any aspect of 
<br/>their work because we are unable to measure it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Absence of these data also makes it difficult to identify areas for improvement. Therefore, 
<br/>the composition of the Annual Reports must be enhanced to include all these relevant information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lack of Key Performance Indicators in ACCF’s Annual Reports is a significant shortfall that 
<br/>limits it ability to measure and demonstrate performance. Without this, they will never be able to 
<br/>improve their performance or improve their service delivery or identify their shortfalls. Without clear 
<br/>measurable indicators, it becomes very difficult to assess the Commission’s operational efficiency or 
<br/>make them accountable or responsible to the needs of the accident victims. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Annual Report falls short of stating what the real operational aspects of the Commission 
<br/>was, and this is a concern. The Commission is entrusted with a very important responsibility and 
<br/></span><span>their work should demonstrate how they are managing this responsibility and how they are providing 
<br/></span><span>these  services  to  our  consumers.    I  hope  all  these  areas  that  have  been  identified  is  taken  into 
<br/>consideration  and  we  hope  to  see  the  Annual  Reports,  and  not  only  the  Annual  Reports,  the 
<br/>performance uplifted and our citizens provided with a better and efficient services and compensation 
<br/>paid to our people on time.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  Madam Deputy Speaker, I could not agree more with honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sachida Nand on the concerns that he has raised and we also had similar concerns and that is why 
<br/>we had reviewed the whole thing and let me present to you my response, likewise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the 2019-2021 Annual Report for the ACCF.  
<br/>The role of the ACCF was expanded to cover for employment and school accident compensations, 
<br/>effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2019.  Prior to that, it was a ‘fault-based arrangement’ whereby employers 
<br/>themselves  had  to  get  insurance  against  any  accident  or  fatality,  which  should  then  be  claimed 
<br/>through that process.  And that could be challenged by the insurance company or the employer and 
<br/>it would take quite long  for the victim to  finally get  justice.  Once it become the ‘no  fault-based 
<br/>arrangement’, thereby the ACCF can proceed, as long as the evidence is there, that yes it was based 
<br/>on  the  accident  or  was  workplace-related  or  the  fatality  was  workplace-related  or  the  death  was 
<br/></span><span>related to work, it would be paid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, my Ministry was used as the enforcement arm of the ACCF and 
<br/>also assisted ACCF with the investigations of employment accidents, occupational diseases, cases, 
<br/>as well as process payment of the two-third weekly wages of injured workers while they were on 
<br/>leave.  So, Madam Deputy Speaker, most of this work was done by the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  on  31</span><span>st</span><span>  March,  2024,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Justice,  in 
<br/>consultation with the Honourable Prime Minister, appointed an interim ACCF Board, chaired by the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for Employment.  The composition of the Board had Permanent Secretaries and 
<br/>representatives from within the responsible Ministries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Board was tasked to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>conduct an independent review of the ACCF in consultation with the major stakeholders; 
<br/></span><span>and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to assist in the assessment of the current and pending applications for payment of accident 
<br/>compensation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the interim ACCF Board had its first meeting on 19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and made the following decisions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>non-renewal of the contract of the CEO of the ACCF; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>non-renewal of the agreement between ACCF and Veritas Pte Ltd., which was outsourced 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to process or do the administration, part of the compensations; and 
<br/>transfer of employment and school accident compensation cases from Veritas Pte Ltd to 
<br/>the Ministry of Employment from 1</span><span>st</span><span> June, 2024; 
<br/>the Permanent Secretary for Employment to manage the processing of pending accident 
<br/>compensation cases; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>ACCF Accountant to act as the officer in charge and administrator of the operations of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ACCF in the interim.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in June 2024, the Ministry inherited some 1,101 cases ACCF. The 
<br/></span><span>Ministry has settled 421 cases comprising of 372 employment cases and 49 school accidents. The 
<br/></span><span>pending cases to date are 680, comprising of 648 employment cases and 32 school accidents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  total  cases  paid  out  to  date  is  204,  that  is  177  employment 
<br/>accidents and 27 school accident cases. And the total amount that has been paid out is $2.77 million, 
<br/>which is 46 percent of the total annual budget allocation of $6 million in the 2024-2025 Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, you should note that out of the 421,204 cases where actually paid 
<br/>and the rest depending on the reports from the doctors, would have been assessed as those that do not 
<br/>deserve payment. The Ministry also inherited, Madam Deputy Speaker, on 21</span><span>st</span><span> June, 2024, from a 
<br/>ACCF, a total of 12,000 accident cases from the period 2019 to 2024. These cases are currently being 
<br/>sorted and also being prioritised for processing. Madam Deputy Speaker, ACCF from 2019 to 2021, 
<br/>that is three years, settled 253 employment and school accident cases. That is in the Annual Report, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Ministry settled 242 cases in four months, the ACCF from 2019 to 2021, that is 36 
<br/>months, paid out $3.5 million compared to the $3.3 million paid by the Ministry in a span of four 
<br/>months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Veritas Ltd was engaged as a claims agent for ACCF from 2019 
<br/>and charging an annual fee of $900,000 per year to carry out administrative work. A total of $4.5 
<br/>million was paid out to Veritas Ltd by ACCF from 2019 to 2023. So, and the savings also will include 
<br/>the salary and benefits that was paid to the CEO and mind you, it was a handsome sum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of financial implications, my Ministry has restructured the 
<br/>Worker's Compensation Unit and 16 staff are currently engaged to process employment and school 
<br/>accident  cases  effectively.  The  Ministry  is  processing  cases  expeditiously,  efficiently  and  cost 
<br/>effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are saving over $1.3 million annually, by now, processing all 
<br/>these claims through our Ministry and taking over the whole.  Madam Deputy Speaker, a Cabinet 
<br/>Paper will soon be presented to the Cabinet whereby we will propose that we have a tripartite board 
<br/></span><span>that is going to oversee the work of the ACCF, and the Ministry will continue to work out the process 
<br/></span><span>and expedite all the pending cases. There is a big backlog, Madam Deputy Speaker, we really want

<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2370 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to expedite all those, so that those victims who have been denied all these long are actually paid what 
<br/>is justifiably due to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will be as brief as possible, just to correct 
<br/>something Madam Deputy Speaker, I think my friend honourable Sachida Nand was referring to the 
<br/>current status of the ACCF, that is 2024. This particular Report is relative to 2019, 2020 and 2021, I 
<br/>do not think any part of his speech he was actually referring to this particular Report. So, there are 
<br/>issues that he raised that is referenced to the ACCF of today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I think the current Report before us, and I want to thank the Standing 
<br/>Committee for the Report.  The current  Report before us is  fairly innocuous  and there are several 
<br/>recommendations, administrative things that needs to be done. Nothing unto word has actually come 
<br/>out of that particular Report with respect to ACCF.  I want to just correct some issues that has been 
<br/>raised by the honourable Minister just now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, let me just point out Madam Deputy Speaker, the Commission can delegate its 
<br/>powers to its officers, employees, agents or consultants but it does not have the power to transfer the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  responsible  for  ACCF  which  is  the  Ministry  of  Justice.  That  requires  some  legislative 
<br/></span><span>change,  so  the  current  processing  by  the  Ministry  of  Employment  could  be  considered  unlawful, 
<br/>something that the Ministry, Attorney-General’s Chambers and Ministry of Justice would have to 
<br/>look at. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  understand  what  he  is  talking  about  in  terms  of  a  Cabinet  paper  coming  through  and 
<br/>processing applications, so until that Cabinet paper comes through the processing of any applications, 
<br/>without Cabinet approval would make for some fairly questionable things that the Auditor-General 
<br/>may find in this Bill. This would be a matter of some serious housekeeping that would need to be 
<br/>done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As he pointed out rightfully, there is a Cabinet paper proposing the transfer to the Ministry of 
<br/>Employment and Land Transport Authority (LTA) whether there is independence on all of these, I 
<br/>am not sure and from what I am informed of, and I am aware of Madam Deputy Speaker, is saying 
<br/>that  most  of  the  work  the  Ministry  is  doing,  three  quarters  of  the  work  for  ACCF,  is  absolutely 
<br/>incorrect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously there was no processing under the No Fault Scheme and that would be a case of 
<br/></span><span>misleading Parliament, and for a fact, he has raised the issue of it being an enforcement arm of the 
<br/></span><span>ACCF. There is no enforcement provision under the Accident Compensation Act, so how can you be 
<br/>an enforcement arm? So, these are the things that are important when we come here and stand and 
<br/>raise issues, we must make sure that we say it correctly.  If his Ministry is still settling cases from 
<br/>2018 when I was there, what has actually been happening for all this time, nobody knows. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ACCF was actually established in some 2019, and the Act was passed in 2017, and the 
<br/>scheme actually came into effect in January 2018. The workers are quite happy with the scheme and 
<br/>those that are recipients are quite happy with the scheme. Of course, yes, there are some teething 
<br/>problems but now we are starting to face some problems in 2014.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But as I have said, this particular Report is relative to the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. It is a 
<br/>fairly innocuous Report. I think some of the things that are pointed out are administrative matters 
<br/>that needs to be looked at and can be fixed. I think the duplication of roles, et cetera, the review of 
<br/></span><span>processes relating to  specificity of locations and  comparison  of compensations for similar losses, 
<br/></span><span>very administrative in its nature, Madam Deputy Speaker, and, of course, including SDGs in its every  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2371 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.    That  is  a  line  that  I  think  is  used  in  most  of  the  reports  that  we  actually  see  before  the 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I thank the Standing Committee for the Report and the recommendations that have 
<br/>been put in there. If the issues that have been spoken about, especially by the honourable Minister 
<br/>exist, they ought to have and they should have been, and they would have been picked up by the 
<br/>Standing Committee that has put the Report before us. It has not, as I said, it is a very innocuous 
<br/>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, and I commend the Standing Committee for coming up with these 
<br/>particular findings and the issues that need to be resolved. But just as a matter of correction, all of 
<br/>those things that I pointed out are factually correct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, confirming with honourable Koya, it 
<br/>falls under the Ministry of Justice. Just before I dwell on that, let me just enlighten Parliament that a 
<br/>sum of $2.2 million was allocated to ACCF in this year’s budget to fund motor vehicle claims and 
<br/>other operational costs. From 2017-2018 to 2024-2025 financial years, Government has brought a 
<br/></span><span>total  grant  of  $16.7  million  to  ACCF  to  carry  out  its  operations.  In  the  2024-2025  financial  year 
<br/></span><span>ACCF has four staff to handle the Motor Vehicle Accidental Claims and other operational cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues raised by the honourable Sanjay is the issue of delay, is also the issue of 
<br/>less  staff.  One  of  the  problems  I  found  out  last  year  is  that  the  only  office  that  processes  the 
<br/>application is only in Valelevu.  No, that does not make sense. There has been some discussion from 
<br/>last year, Cabinet has been informed, paper in terms of the reform has been held back, it has gone 
<br/>through the Cabinet Sub-Committee on legislation. What is going on now in the next two or three 
<br/>months they will socialise these issues, the reforms, the way forward with the respective ministries 
<br/>before they come back to Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  members  of  the  Interim  Committees,  the  Chairman  is  the  Permanent  Secretary  for 
<br/>Ministry of Employment is Mr. Maritino Nemani, why he is the Chairman because the Ministry deals 
<br/>with  those  line  of  work.  The  other  member  is  the  CEO  of  LTA  because  they  deal  with  vehicle 
<br/>accidents. The Deputy Chairman is George Tavo from the Ministry of Transport. Ms. Vitilia Chand, 
<br/>Principal Officer in the Office of the Prime Minister and Dr. Darcy. Their skill sets empowers the 
<br/>Interim Committee to work. The Interim Committee their term will expire in March of next year. We 
<br/>hope that before March, Parliament will see a Bill on how this should move forward. I endorse the 
<br/></span><span>complaints and the other issues that has been raised regarding the expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues that was very clear to the Coalition Government when they came in, it has 
<br/>to go away with the ACCF. First, the issue of paying other agencies and also the issue of wages of 
<br/>the CEO. There are certain  CEOs which the Coalition Government  found objectionable to  take a 
<br/>chance with, and it did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I believe there is a sum of $400,000 which was paid to the CEO. 
<br/>Now, the Permanent Secretary for Labour is doing it on pro-bono basis. That is a huge saving for the 
<br/>Government, and it has been witnessed through evidence in terms of processing that it is now much 
<br/>faster and efficient with the Ministry then it was with ACCF. It had only four staff. They have this 
<br/>history of knowing the industry and the work and they are better equipped. Yes, when it was initially 
<br/>discussed,  from  the  very  beginning  there  was  some  questions  raised  from  within  Government, 
<br/>whether the Ministry of Labour was suitable and I think over the passage of time, now it is pretty 
<br/></span><span>clear that is the way it is going to go forward with the Ministry of Labour taking a key role.

<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2372 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  ACCF  and  the  Ministry  of  Employment  previously  shared  responsibilities  for 
<br/>investigating persistent workplace and school accident claims. Under the new Interim Chairman as I 
<br/>have  said,  the  Minister’s  enhance  its  procedures  by  implementing  strict  standard  operating 
<br/>procedures, only investigating seven claims. Yes, any legislation over time in this case, obviously it 
<br/>needs reform. Yesterday we were talking about FIU, ACCF, it is time to change and that is what we 
<br/>intend to do. Doing so through consultation, through the other agencies, particularly now, or in the 
<br/>next three months or so.  I applaud the previous Government for bringing the No Fault Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the previous Administrators of ACCF for their contribution, but I want to share this, 
<br/>that now the immense risk and danger that faces the Ministry of Labour when they do not prepare 
<br/>well in terms of action claims and here the beneficiaries lose out. I witnessed this in previous cases, 
<br/>that problem has been taken out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we want to do is try to simplify and separate it so that all the stakeholders are satisfied. 
<br/>I  note  the  work  that  the  Standing  Committee  has  done  and  also  note  the  findings  and  the 
<br/>recommendations. The Coalition Government is committed to ensure that SDG 5 and 8 is complied 
<br/>with and it is not only with ACCF, but it also goes for other agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the Adoption Accrual Report of the ACCF 2019 and 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, on Item 2.6 of the Report, the Standing 
<br/>Committee acknowledged the work done to raise awareness and education on road accidents. Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, there has been an alarming spike in road accidents over the last six months. That 
<br/>part of the Report, I mentioned about, confirms what many of us have feared, our roads once a symbol 
<br/>of development, have tragically become a killing field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the devastating incident on the Tacirua Road in Suva, where a father 
<br/>held his 13-year-old son, as the child died in his arms as the runaway vehicle struck them two weeks 
<br/>ago, is a stark reminder of the human cost behind these statistics. Just this past Thursday, another 
<br/>eight-year-old child died whilst crossing the road with her father. Yesterday, a man in his 20s died in 
<br/>a horrific accident in Sigatoka. These heartbreaking images, some viral on social media is not just a 
<br/>tragedy, it is call for action! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, no amount of compensation can bring back that young life or undo 
<br/>the trauma suffered by families. The true challenges lie in preventing such accidents from happening 
<br/></span><span>in the first place. We must move beyond compensation and begin addressing the root causes of this 
<br/></span><span>epidemic. The question before us is not just how we help victims, but how can we prevent for the 
<br/>victims? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we do not deny that the compensation provided to victims of road 
<br/>accidents serves as an important safety net. The work of the Accident Compensation Committee is 
<br/>valuable, and it has provided much needed support for families in the wake of these accidents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it is clear that compensation is not the solution to this crisis. The current system, as 
<br/>we can say is failing us and we must acknowledge that accidents caused by speeding are not accidents 
<br/>in the true sense of the word. They are instances of intentional negligence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when a driver chooses to speed recklessly, ignoring speed limits and 
<br/>endangering the lives of others, they are consciously putting lives at risk. These are not accidents 
<br/></span><span>waiting to happen. They are disasters in the making. The young 21-year-old driver speeding on our 
<br/></span><span>roads at 100 kilometres per hour in a 50 kilometre per hour zone, is simply not making a mistake.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2373 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are making a deliberate choice to disregard the law, and their choice has deadly consequences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we must ask ourselves, what kind of society are we, if we allow this 
<br/>to continue? A society that tolerates reckless driving where lives are treated as expendable? It is a 
<br/>society that has lost its moral compass. The figures we are seeing are deeply concerning and most of 
<br/>the  accidents  involve  young  drivers,  public  services  vehicles  and  heavy  commercial  vehicles 
<br/>speeding without a doubt is the leading cause of this crisis. This is no longer just a matter of driver 
<br/>error, it is a systematic failure to respect human life and uphold the law. We are failing to teach young 
<br/>drivers the value of life, the responsibility they bear behind the wheels, and the consequences of their 
<br/>actions.  We cannot continue to allow this disregard for life fester in our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the solution to this crisis is not just about imposing harsher penalties 
<br/>for reckless driving.  Though that is certainly part of it, the solution lies in a broader shift in our 
<br/>approach to driver education and road safety.  I propose we move beyond simply teaching people 
<br/>how to operate a vehicle and begin educating them on value-based driving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may repeat that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I propose that we move beyond simply teaching 
<br/></span><span>young people on how to operate and drive a vehicle and begin teaching them on value-based driving.  
<br/></span><span>It is not enough for drivers to know the rules of the road.  They must understand the importance of 
<br/>those rules. They must understand that speeding is not just an infraction, it is an act of irresponsibility 
<br/>that can cost lives. Every time a driver chooses to speed, they are choosing to endanger others.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we must emphasise responsibility, respect and sanctity of life in our 
<br/>driving  education  programmes.  These  principles  must  be  taught  from  the  earlier  stages  of  driver 
<br/>training.  We need to ensure that all drivers, especially young drivers understand the profound impact 
<br/>in their actions.  A driver who speeds through a residential area or tailgates another vehicle is not just 
<br/>violating the law, they are disrespecting the lives of others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is time for us to scale up our prevention effort.  Speeding kills.  
<br/>This is not a theory, it is a reality that we must confront, act and we must act now.  Government has 
<br/>taken steps in the right direction by regulating the licensing and defensive driving, but the truth is, 
<br/>we are not doing enough.  We need stricter enforcement of road safety laws.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  must  send  a  clear  message  that  reckless  driving  will  not  be  tolerated  and  those  who 
<br/>endanger  lives  must  face  severe  consequences.  The  penalties  for  dangerous  driving,  especially 
<br/></span><span>excessive speeding must commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.  Fines, suspensions and 
<br/></span><span>even jail  time should be on the table  for those  who put  others at  risk.   We cannot  afford to  treat 
<br/>reckless driving as a mere inconvenience.  It is a criminal act, and we must treat it as such.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Madam Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, in addition to stronger penalties, we must ensure that 
<br/>drivers  of  Public  Service  Vehicles  and  commercial  vehicles  undergo  additional  training.    The 
<br/>behaviour of these drivers often reflects the lack of responsibility and safety awareness.  We must 
<br/>ensure that they understand, not only how to operate the vehicles, but also the ethical responsibility 
<br/>they bear towards their passengers and the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us be clear, we are not simply talking about compensation for the families of the dead and 
<br/>injured, we are talking about the right to life.  Every 13-year old, every six-year old and every child 
<br/>and adult using our roads has the right to feel safe and protected.  No amount of compensation can 
<br/>replace the life lost.  Our focus must be on prevention or taking the steps necessary to keep our roads 
<br/></span><span>safe and protect the lives before accidents happen.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Madam Deputy Speaker, this is not a challenge we can afford to ignore.   We cannot allow 
<br/>the pain and the suffering we see on our screens and the face of grieving families to become our 
<br/>legacy.  Let us rise to the occasion, let us prevent further deaths, and let us make our roads safer for 
<br/>all.  With that being said, I support the motion before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker.  I would like to thank 
<br/>the honourable Members for their comments.  I would like to thank honourable Tuinaceva for what 
<br/>he has just raised. I think it is very important and very pertinent to the issue that we are discussing 
<br/>today. The more we create education and awareness and try not to move away from compensation 
<br/>and looking at the values that we want to inculcate in the lives of drivers of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other issues raised by honourable Koya on the legality of the transfer, that is not for 
<br/>this Committee to look at. We had the report for 2019, 2020 and 2021, so we just looked at the issues 
<br/>described in the report and during that time. We ask you not to ask the Committee to do that.  Maybe 
<br/></span><span>when we are looking at the 2024 Report, then we can look at the transfer, the legal of it being done 
<br/></span><span>and perhaps some recommendations on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Sachida  Nand  had  raised  some  very  important  issues  with  regards  to 
<br/>communications, and of course, that is a very important part of this. Communication to our people 
<br/>there, as you are aware, when we are trying to communicate, there are a lot of mediums, but how 
<br/>effective are they in trying not to change human behaviour? That is one of the challenges that we 
<br/>face when we are coming in and trying to push legislation, trying to push projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people are just the same out there.  They are just there, there is no impact on them. So, 
<br/>we have to come up with more innovative ideas in trying to change the behavioural pattern of the 
<br/>people. I think the honourable Leader of Opposition always discusses this issue with me about how 
<br/>he wants to change people, plant more when he was at agriculture, how he wants to do certain things 
<br/>to  change behavioural  patterns.  It  is  not  a very easy thing. We need to be coming up with more 
<br/>innovative ways of trying to address this problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Sachida Nand has raised an important issue on performance indicators.  That is 
<br/>what we had told ACCF, the lack of performance indicators.  How can we gauge when you do not 
<br/></span><span>have any performance indicators?    I think that is all from my side, Madam Deputy Speaker and I 
<br/></span><span>would like to thank all those who had contributed. I do support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the contents 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Report made by the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Almost there, honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  now  call  upon  the  Chair  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  to  move  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion.
