<div><span>Proactive Measures to Discourage Children Becoming Homeless 
<br/>(Question No. 273/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for  Women, Children and Social Protection inform 
<br/>Parliament on the proactive measures or preventative strategy that is currently being used 
<br/>by  the  Ministry  to  discourage  children  from  moving  over  to  towns  and  cities  and 
<br/>becoming homeless? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, I wish Fiji a Happy 
<br/>International Day for Persons with Disabilities, currently being celebrated around the country and 
<br/></span><span>this is spearheaded by organisations for people living with disabilities and the National Council of 
<br/></span><span>Persons with Disabilities.  Right now, our children living with disabilities are celebrating at Lawaqa 
<br/>Park in Sigatoka as the main event, especially there is a night programme as well planned for them.  
<br/>I want to thank the Disability District Committees in Sigatoka, Nadi and Lautoka, and also the parents 
<br/>and guardians and children for putting together the programme, as well as our donor partners who 
<br/>have come forward to celebrate with them.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the core responsibility for any child is the parent.  We live in a society where 
<br/>our people are embedded in our religious teachings, despite what their faith is or ethnicity or gender 
<br/>of the child.  It is still the core institution in protecting the child and that is the family.  So, when this 
<br/>crucial structure fails, then it is for the community or the village or the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, the </span><span>yavusa</span><span>, wherever 
<br/>we live, has to step in and take care of the child. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as  alluded to in the question, when children leave their home and come into 
<br/>towns and cities and become homeless, this is of great concern and community members continue to 
<br/>flag this with the Ministry and in the media and in the Government in terms of what we do with these 
<br/>children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we as a Ministry are working on all levels and this is not anything new for the 
<br/>Ministry or this Government, it has been done by previous Governments.  There is an inter-agency 
<br/>for children, as well as line Ministries that are working together, especially coming together for child 
<br/>protection  because  when  a  child  is  homeless,  of  course,  their  protection  and  safety  is  first  and 
<br/>foremost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the complexity surrounding this where there is a tussle between what Government can 
<br/>do, what our Child Protection Officers can do verses the primary responsibility and duty with the 
<br/>family or with the parents, we have had to bring in, of course, the assistance of the community in 
<br/>terms of where we draw the line, how we take care of our children, while their parents or guardians 
<br/>are still alive  or still around.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very different, of course, as you know, for children who are orphaned and are not taken 
<br/>care of because they become wards of the State and we can place them in homes where they can be 
<br/>taken care of so often, we see this tussle.  When we take children in and we place them in homes, 
<br/>family  members  will  come  and  take  them  away  or  family  members  feel  embarrassed  that  their 
<br/>children are at the homes and come and take them away, but not necessarily providing the care that 
<br/>they need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an actual taskforce set up for street dwellers, especially our children, 
<br/>working with UNICEF in the last year and identifying reasons for why they have moved to the streets 
<br/>and choose to  live on the streets.   I think I have mentioned that a few times now in  terms  of the 
<br/>associated  issues  with  children  living  on  the  streets,  whether  it  is  abuse,  whether  it  is  drug  use, 
<br/>whether it is just the lack of interest in education or being at home, or neglect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Ministry  has  seen  higher  cases  reporting  on  child  neglect,  rather  than  child  abuse  so 
<br/>children are being left unsupervised. They find friends and comfort living on the streets rather than 
<br/>living at home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no matter how much of awareness programmes we run as Ministries, no 
<br/>matter which Ministry, it still comes back to the setting of the home and what is lacking in terms of 
<br/>what children need. I thank the support of our CSOs, who are working with us - Empower Pacific, 
<br/>Medical  Services Pacific, Save the Children,  ARUKA Fiji  and, of course, Inspire Pacific and the 
<br/>Salvation Army, who are providing support and assistance for these children, and many churches and 
<br/></span><span>communities as well, taking in these children to take care of them. But it is obviously not long term 
<br/></span><span>or in a process that is complete to see their rehabilitation and reintegration back into their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few things that we have done in the last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I think this may answer 
<br/>Question No. 285/2024 as well on Wednesday, asked by the same honourable Member.  As I have 
<br/>mentioned yesterday, Salvation Army has opened a shelter, working with street dwellers, street kids 
<br/>that they have taken in, so we thank the Salvation Army for that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2342 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know in the current budget year, there was a commitment in terms of starting a child 
<br/>wellbeing  centre  in  Vunirewa,  Serua,  and  there  was  a  commitment  of  about  $230,000.    That  is, 
<br/>obviously, taking a longer process because if we are to include a clinical component in this child 
<br/>wellbeing  centre,  for  children  to  be  rehabilitated  from  drugs,  it  needs  to  go  through  a  thorough 
<br/>process,  calling  for  proposals  from  private  sector  or  clinics  that  have  done  this.    It  is,  obviously, 
<br/>overseas because we have never done this in Fiji for children.  So, it takes time in terms of calling 
<br/>for proposals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  Centres  that  have  been  set  up  by  the  Salvation  Army,  as  well  as  Inspire  Pacific, 
<br/>hopefully, the Ministry will be able to see if we can repurpose that funding that is there to invest in 
<br/>current  centres  that  have  been  set  up  and  these  centres,  obviously,  need  the  expertise,  like  child 
<br/>psychologists, child psychiatrists, which we lack in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we are taking our street children and they need assistance in terms of rehabilitation, 
<br/>whether it is drugs or other issues, there are no professionals to attend to them.  So, unfortunately, 
<br/>children get turned away from the Stress Management Ward at the CWM Hospital. They only deal 
<br/>with adults, as well as St. Giles hospital. So, this is a huge gap that needs to be filled to have our 
<br/>professionals working with children. That is taking some time so, hopefully, we will be able to do 
<br/>that in this budget year so that we do not waste that money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we are to invest in current centres like, the Salvation Army Centre, Inspire Pacific, and we 
<br/>thank Inspire Pacific, we have just completed that five-week camp that I talked about yesterday.  I 
<br/>thank the government of China for funding that to begin, but of course, we as government have a 
<br/>responsibility.  There is very little money that is usually committed to children and the need to look 
<br/>after our children. So, this needs to change. And that is something that as we put these programmes 
<br/>together, working with our partners, that we hopefully see a bigger budget commitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have begun with our Department of Children. As the programmes roll out and we submit 
<br/>that in our budget submissions, hopefully, in the coming year, we will be able to see more committed 
<br/>to  our  Department  of  Children.  However,  I  want  to  thank  UNICEF,  who  has  come  on  board  for 
<br/>technical support and have ensured to help our CSOs that are doing this, that the centres are safe for 
<br/>children, they meet certain minimum standards working with the Department of Children, so thank 
<br/>you to UNICEF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The taskforce dealing with street kids are now looking at a wider range of issues, like children 
<br/>living with HIV, children living with drugs and other social issues that they are facing.  So, we invite 
<br/>relevant partners and others that want to partner with the Ministry and these organisations. “Please, 
<br/>come on board and work with us.” We are hoping to then set up also in the Western Division and 
<br/>Northern Division for the same kinds of programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank our Churches as well - the Fiji Council of Churches. They continue to give a 
<br/>space and facilities to use for our programmes. I want to thank also our line Ministry, the Office of 
<br/>the Prime Minister, the Fiji Police Force, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Rural 
<br/>Development, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Local Government, Ministry of Youth and 
<br/>Sports, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Education and, of course, Ministry of Employment.  Thank 
<br/></span><span>you for your continued support as we work together.  It will take line Ministries to come together to 
<br/></span><span>get this done, but they are usually tapping into their operational budget to assist us.  So, hopefully, 
<br/>we see more of that in the next coming Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  we  needed to  build capacity, moving forward, it is  really to  help  our 
<br/>children  to  be  able  to  reintegrate  back  into  families  that  they  feel  they  are  cared  for.  It  is  not 
<br/>necessarily their parents or their immediate family, they may choose another family member to be 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2343 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with and that is what we are working with them, so we do really listen to our children. Again, I thank 
<br/>the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  agree  with  the  honourable  Minister  that  the 
<br/>loitering around of kids, especially in towns and in their school uniforms is an issue to address.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I would just like to ask the honourable Minister, she is talking about a safety net for 
<br/>these  street  girls,  but  at  the  same  time,  she  makes  a  comment  in  media  that  there  needs  to  be  a 
<br/>children’s curfew. If a child does not have anywhere to go, they get caught by the authorities, it is 
<br/>more issues for the children and even the authorities themselves.  So, where are we going with this 
<br/>honourable Minister? One side, you want to protect them, the other side there is a curfew. It is more 
<br/>issues, where are we going? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  It is 
<br/>not a Government policy, at the moment, it is certainly something that is floated and not approved 
<br/>yet.  It has been done in other jurisdictions, in other countries around the world, so it is nothing new.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  if  you  look  at  it,  honourable  Sharma  and  honourable  Members,  they  are  actually 
<br/>consistent because if you do introduce a curfew, you are not penalising the child.  It is going to be 
<br/>the  parents  and  carers  that  are  held  responsible  to  ensure  that  our  children  are  safe.    It  has  been 
<br/>practised right now in Fiji in the </span><span>Vanua o Sabeto</span><span>, they have imposed the children's curfew in their 
<br/>villages in the </span><span>Vanua o Betoraurau</span><span>.  So</span><span>, </span><span>it is already happening here in Fiji, in the villages so a child 
<br/>must be at home during certain hours, cannot be loitering and it is the responsibility of the parent or 
<br/>guardian, so it is consistent with child protection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you wish to have a follow up question, honourable Sharma, or are you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>satisfied with the answer?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the update that 
<br/>she has given. I think this is a very serious problem. All of us are concerned about it, when we walk 
<br/>into town, and we see the children. One of the things that struck me in particular, is the fact that the 
<br/>honourable Minister stated that they found that the cases of neglect was much higher than abuse. 
<br/>That is very interesting, that people are actually leaving because of neglect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was thinking along these lines, if neglect is a problem more than abuse, then there would be 
<br/>parents of these children that are recipients of assistance from the Ministry. Would that be something 
<br/>that  you  would  look  at  to  try  and  address,  to  link  up  the  fact  that  those  who  are  neglecting  their 
<br/>children,  are  still  getting  assistance  through  the  Ministry?  Would  there  be  a  possibility  of  timely 
<br/>structure so that you can use the assistance provided by the Ministry to parents who are neglecting 
<br/>their children as a possible way to get them to change their views on the way that they do things? It 
<br/>just struck me that neglect  is  hiding the abuse, because most of the time  we think abuse is  a big 
<br/>problem. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, certainly that is a good question. Again, it is not up 
<br/>to the Ministry when it comes to parental rights and parental responsibilities, the Ministry cannot 
<br/>hold parents to ransom. I mean, it certainly is a suggestion to link it to social protection, but not all 
<br/>of the parents or the children that have been reported have their parents in social protection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reasons are varied and there may be times when it is really not the parents’ fault.  There 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2344 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are parents who are working parents that do not have the ability to pay for a caregiver, so the reasons 
<br/>are varied, but it leaves the child helpless. So that certainly needs to be a responsibility not just of the 
<br/>Government, but I think the community can come in as well. There are less and less interest from 
<br/>family members in taking children, do you believe it? But we are moving into the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think as families become more or less extended families and more into nuclear families, we 
<br/>are even struggling to place children in kin care, in their family care, because it would not be the lack 
<br/>of interest, but just inability to take on more children to care for. So, if we are able to help parents 
<br/>and caregivers to be trained, to be better parents, so to speak, and it does not just take Government, 
<br/>it also takes our churches, our faith-based organisations, traditional leaders and communities, to help 
<br/>parents be better parents and provide the support when they need it. I think we will see less cases of 
<br/>neglect of our children, but, like I said, the reasons are varied, but we still need to be able to take care 
<br/>of the child when they are presented to us. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament, is there 
<br/>any policy or direction of taking the street kids to established homes? It may sound funny, but this is 
<br/>the reality in Ba. Some street kids are taken into established homes in Ba. So, those 10 to 15 boys 
<br/>who were taken to that home spoiled the existing boys and some of them had to leave that home. I 
<br/>know there are some Ministers who are good at making headlines when saying this and that, but this 
<br/>is the reality on the ground. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Bala,  it  is  a  very  valid  question.  In  the 
<br/>established Department of Children, the he Department is the regulatory authority to ensure that any 
<br/>homes  that  are  established  for  children  must  meet  certain  standards.  You  certainly  cannot  place 
<br/>children at risk, together with children who may be in conflict with the law.  So, that is part of the 
<br/>regulatory standards that we need to enforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me continue, to monitor Homes, that is part of our job, but I think it is upon those who 
<br/>start up these homes to ensure that these children are not put together.  I know that there are examples 
<br/>of children in the West, like the Tabitha Home.  They ensure that the children who come are kept 
<br/>separate from the other children. So, what we are really missing is the need for more psychosocial 
<br/>support for these homes, where the child psychologist can deal with the children, to counsel them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is the general message when we are dealing with children.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>often focus a lot on the victims but we need to look at the perpetrators, the child perpetrators as well, 
<br/>whether they are bullies, whether they are committing a crime, those children need help as well.  So, 
<br/>we  need  to  be  able  to  provide  that  psychosocial  support  to  counsel  those  who  are  also  hurting 
<br/>children. They need that as well. So, we need to encourage our homes to be able to have that kind of 
<br/>psychological services so that they counsel children and the issues that they present with. Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of the IHRDP  
<br/>(Question No. 274/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>status of the Integrated Human Resources Development Programme in its efforts to create 
<br/>employment and support livelihoods in the rural and peri-urban areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to thank honourable Vanawalu for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2345 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his question. Before I answer the question, may I just be allowed to respond to the comments made 
<br/>by  honourable  Usamate  regarding  the  need  for  a  plan  and  even  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, said that in 2009, he 
<br/>had produced a Labour Plan for Fiji and it was given to the Government. They totally flipped it on 
<br/>its  head  and  cancelled  all  the  TVET  institutions.  So,  I  think  he  is  contradicting  himself  in  his 
<br/>contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief,  given  that  there  are  a  lot  of  things  to  go 
<br/>through, but this Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRDP) was a construct of 
<br/>the previous Government and I have to say, actually before that, from the year 2000.  But the previous 
<br/>Government continued with it, and it is probably one of the more successful programmes that the 
<br/>Ministry has.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will certainly continue to push it because as we all agree, we need to really drive economic 
<br/>activity in our rural areas and stimulate the rural economy. And what we are finding, is through the 
<br/>IHRDP we are accessing a lot of these rural communities and starting to see significant movement 
<br/>and positive change. But what we also did, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was we increased the grant threshold to 
<br/>$250,000 and that has allowed us to do more in terms of the assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just by way of context, in 2023 and 2024, the Ministry observed that we had received over 
<br/>39 applications with $2.7 million requests. But despite the budget of only $1 million we managed to 
<br/>cover 21 applications valued at about $1.5 million which clearly shows that there is appetite for the 
<br/>IHRDP and hopefully we will continue to grow the funds going forward to sort of assist the rural 
<br/>economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have also discovered, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is a potential to do more within 
<br/>peri-urban and also the urban economy, and we now have started recalibrating the grant a bit because 
<br/>you know in the urban economy there are pockets of areas particularly the housing areas, that do not 
<br/>have much economic activity, so we are placing some focus on there, as well as encouraging co-
<br/>operative type of ventures and then trying to see how we can assist them as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I toured Western Division recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is wonderful to see some of the 
<br/>developments that are happening in the Division. One particular company called Mick’s Fiji Tours 
<br/>&amp; Transfers, a young man from Nadroga is doing a tour business. He actually came to Fiji after the 
<br/>change of the Government and set up his business in Fiji. He is now running with about 50 employees 
<br/>across the Coral Coast and into Nadi, and servicing customers, doing tours. We assisted him with a 
<br/>new boat just recently, on a one-third, two-third basis, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another interesting co-operative, I just thought I would share to the Parliament, just to sort 
<br/>of motivate us, so that the money that we are giving is actually going to some really good projects. I 
<br/>talk  about  Matababani  Co-operative,  deep  in  the  middle  of  Viti  Levu in  the  village  of  Nakaro  in 
<br/>Navosa. They are based about two hours to three hours out of Sigatoka. In the previous Government, 
<br/>they were given a solar farm. Through the advice from the Ministry, they decided to turn that into a 
<br/>co-operative business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because of what they saw and how that co-operative venture was working, and because it 
<br/></span><span>was working well and because they are big planters of </span><span>kava</span><span>, they decided to form a co-operative for 
<br/></span><span>kava</span><span>  and  invest  in  a  packing  house  for  their  </span><span>kava</span><span>,  together  with  the  pounding  machine  and 
<br/>implements, it was about $20,000 plus on the investment.  If you go up to the middle of Viti Levu 
<br/>now,  they  are  pounding  their  own  </span><span>kava</span><span>  and  bringing  it  down  to  the  market  for  purchase.  Their 
<br/>ambition is to eventually move into export, and we will try and assist them in that. So, these are the 
<br/>types of transformative things that are happening around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2346 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure the honourable Minister for Agriculture can relate a few more.  I would also like to 
<br/>just talk about Wailevu Cane Farmers’ Co-operative, which I met in the North just recently. Through 
<br/>the co-operative movement, they purchased, and they are cane farmers. This side of the Parliament 
<br/>is looking for a solution for cane, and we hope to bring some clarity to that issue soon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the farmers already know what the solution is. For the 
<br/>Wailevu Co-operative farmers, they have invested in a rice harvesting machine, so the farmers are 
<br/>already diversifying on the ground. They are saying that they are getting good money from the rice 
<br/>in the North, and they use that machine. I think it was about $150,000 that was the total contribution 
<br/>from our side. But for the rice harvester, it will improve their yields and production, and, of course, 
<br/>increase their returns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then in the North also is the Tavoro Forest Park Cooperative, which was supported through 
<br/>IHRDP. This is in Bouma Village and my prediction with this co-operative is that they will eventually 
<br/>become  a  hotel  property  owner  from  Bouma.  The  reason  for  that  is  because  it  is  such  a  special 
<br/>location, and it is an opportunity to see all the waterfalls around that area. You can actually go up 
<br/>and  see  Tagimoucia  from  that  area.  It  is  such  a  special  opportunity,  and  they  have  managed  to 
<br/>generate a good business from all the tourism in that area. We are now talking about some plans to 
<br/>scale  up  with  them,  and  that  is  what  is  happening  in  Bouma,  at  the  moment,  in  the  Tavoro  Co-
<br/>operatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I guess, in a nutshell, the short answer is that IHRDP funding is doing well. The Government 
<br/>will continue to support this programme. From the benefits of that programme, we have now moved 
<br/>to a cooperative grant as well under the same sort of structure.  So, this is the keenness to continue 
<br/>to stimulate the rural economy and I am pretty confident that we will resolve some of the challenges 
<br/>that we have in the rural economy through this particular grant and the other grants that the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture and some of the other Ministries are delving in as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister.  
<br/>Currently, Fiji is facing a shortage of </span><span>kava</span><span>, there are farmers who are not interested. So, based on 
<br/>this particular programme - IHRDP, is there any assistance or uptake to go and develop this particular 
<br/>sector, a little bit more at an enhanced level?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Kumar  for  that 
<br/>question. The short answer is ‘yes’, we are very keen to try and drive the </span><span>kava</span><span> assistance through 
<br/>IHRDP and also the cooperative grant. We find that the actual cooperative model is quite suited for 
<br/>a lot of our farming areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been assisting quite a few farmers of late, there is one that I did not mention here, 
<br/>but there is a young man called Sowane, up in Lovoni, in Levuka. A couple of hundred farmers come 
<br/>through him and there are some good opportunities there. He has his own solar plant and doing the 
<br/>same  thing  as  the  people  in  Navosa  are  doing.    So,  yes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  some  great 
<br/>opportunities to mobilise the cooperative movement, and I will make a statement later on my visit to 
<br/>India. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, just as a prelude, India’s success in terms of agriculture was built off co-operatives 
<br/></span><span>and  there  is  a  big  message  in  there  for  Fiji.  One  of  their  most  successful  brands  –  Amul,  which 
<br/>produces dairy milk, is a 100 percent co-operative.  It is now earning revenue, not in the millions but 
<br/>in the billions, so the point raised by honourable Premila Kumar is quite valid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  massive  opportunity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  unlock  our  rural  economy  using 
<br/>cooperatives and you will find, on this side of the House, a great enthusiasm and commitment towards

<div><span>encouraging the co-operative movement and trying to use it to boost our agricultural sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a final note, credit to the co-operative movement.  One of the co-operatives that we assisted 
<br/>from Natadola, the leader of the co-operative said to me, “I should have gotten into co-operatives a 
<br/>lot faster,” because through co-operatives you can share capital expenditure, and the commitment for 
<br/>one  farmer  becomes  less  of  a  burden  when  you  share  the  capital  expenditure  across  a  couple  of 
<br/>farmers. In the case of Natadola co-operative, you got 10 of them. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that 
<br/>answers honourable Premila Kumar’s question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  have  a  supplementary  question,  honourable  Minister,  in  terms  of 
<br/>IHRDP.  Has the Ministry looked at targeted assistance, especially in light of the fact that you spoke 
<br/>about diversification in areas, for example, organic farming, where that can benefit co-operatives or 
<br/>small groups? Are we looking at or getting the data for targeted assistance so we can actually grow 
<br/>these areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA.- To be honest, at the moment, we allow everyone to apply, 
<br/>for example, at the moment, the honourable Minister for Agriculture and I are basically working in 
<br/>sync on the Kava Bill because that will then create a good opportunity for us to really tap into the 
<br/>opportunities in </span><span>kava</span><span> and because of that, then of course, the assistance going to  </span><span>kava</span><span> co-operatives 
<br/>will have to be elevated as well.  That is probably one of the areas that we would be looking at a lot 
<br/>closer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By default, I think quite are few of those type of co-operatives are coming. It  is  certainly 
<br/>something that once as some of the regulatory frameworks that we need before we push support in a 
<br/>certain area come into play, then we can really go hard on the targeted project. So once the Kava Bill 
<br/>is out, there are few other things that will come with it.  The push to really maximise on </span><span>kava</span><span> will be 
<br/>harder, I will take that on board as something that I can talk to the Ministry of Finance and also the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture about in terms of just pushing certain things that the Government wants to 
<br/>do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, unfortunately not every project in the past 
<br/>succeeded  for  obvious  reasons,  some  mismanagement,  some  capacity.  There  are  two  parts  to  my 
<br/>question, if you can, please, respond to it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One is, any consideration for follow-ups to those that failed because we have spent money on 
<br/>these projects?   Secondly, the monitoring  and hand-holding process  and this  is  probably  why the 
<br/>Northern  Development  Programme  was  so  successful  because  of  the  programme.  So,  under  the 
<br/>IHRDP  projects  because  I  know  they  come  under  an  ILO  Framework,  what  are  the  plans  in  the 
<br/>Ministry to address such issues?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I had ran out of time, I fail to sort 
<br/>of share some of the statistics regarding monitoring.  I will just perhaps share them to answer to the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition’s question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on the recent visitations, there is about a 90 percent success rate in terms of recorded 
<br/></span><span>for IHRDP.    Monitoring and evaluation tells us that for every MSME we support through IHRDP, 
<br/></span><span>it has created about nine jobs and the effective benefit is about 36 livelihoods.  That is the assessment 
<br/>and  on  average,  one  recipient  can  earn  up  to  about  $200,000  annually  dependent  on  sectors  and 
<br/>particularly in the agricultural sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the probably most impressive things that happened recently with the co-operatives is 
<br/>the development of more green technology opportunities.  For example, because of the lack of access

<div><span>to  electricity,  some  of  the  co-operatives  are  now  moving  to  solar-powered  solutions  and  that  is 
<br/>something that we started to see a lot more of, for example, the Lovu Co-operative in Gau which 
<br/>hopefully will be visiting early next year.  They had got solar-powered equipment like freezers and 
<br/>dryers for their enterprise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a monitoring arm of the cooperative division and also the MSMEs, and they do track 
<br/>the success of the projects, if there are issues, try and help with the remediation and those kinds of 
<br/>things.  You are correct that there has been a lot of governance issues in the past with co-operatives, 
<br/>particularly.  What we try and challenge or encourage our farmers, particularly to look at the co-
<br/>operative model using good examples where there has been success.  We do monitor, we do training 
<br/>as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we also try and do is, training is very important before a co-operative 
<br/>is set up, so everyone understands the governance framework.  Hopefully, that is probably a way we 
<br/>can educate and inculcate the disciplines around, not only managing a business but the whole process 
<br/>around  running  businesses  and  those  kind  of  things  which  are  very  important  once  the  grant  is 
<br/>provided.

<div><span>Salary Differences – Radiologists and Sonographers 
<br/>(Question No. 275/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the salary differences between Radiologists, Sonographers and those performing doppler 
<br/>scans in the public health sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Ravunawa 
<br/>for his question.  Just for the purpose of clarification on the different cadres of health care workers 
<br/>referred  to  in  this  question,  radiologists  are  medical  officers  who  have  gained  their  Degrees  in 
<br/>Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery have gone through internship programme, gone through 
<br/>rural  appointment  before  joining  the  Radiology  Department  as  part  of  their  request  for  joining  a 
<br/>specialised field.  They are responsible for the interpretation of radiological imaging such as x-ray, 
<br/>CT, ultrasound, MRI reports and they do the reporting.  They are pegged at, starting on Band H, Step 
<br/>5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  for  sonographers  or  medical  imaging  technologist  who  perform  doppler  scans  like 
<br/>ultrasound modalities, they have completed their Bachelor Degree in Medical Imaging Technology 
<br/>and have joined the workforce as Medical Imaging Technologist (MIT).  Through in-house trainings, 
<br/>MIT  gain  additional  skills  to  perform  the  procedures  for  specialised  tests  such  as  ultrasound, 
<br/>computerised tomography or CT scan or MRI scanning and ultra-sonography as well.  Salaries for 
<br/>MIT start at Step 2 on Band F and MIT perform general radiography are paid at the same level as 
<br/>those performing ultrasound scans, CT scans, mammography and MRI scans in both hospital settings 
<br/>and the subdivision hospitals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In April this year, Mr. Speaker, I had stated in this august House that in the last decade, Fiji 
<br/></span><span>has  also  seen  a  share  of  radiological  imaging  development,  with  the  introduction  of  high-quality 
<br/>ultrasound  technology,  CT  scan,  MRI  testing  and  other  advanced  testing  technologies.    These 
<br/>developments have meant the need to increase the workforce and enhance their capabilities to operate 
<br/>these new advanced technologies for a better disease diagnosis and treatment.  Unfortunately, this 
<br/>did not happen concurrently with the introduction of new and advanced technologies over the years.  
<br/>Sir, this is an exercise that the Ministry is currently undertaking with the support of our partners to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2349 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>address the workforce needs now and, in the future, including the appropriate remuneration for our 
<br/>staff and the Ministry is committed to complete this task. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform the House, is there any 
<br/>qualified sonographer in the country?  The reason I am asking this, Sir, because no university in Fiji 
<br/>is offering courses in this field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- In general, they graduate with a Medical Imaging 
<br/>Technology Degree, and as I had mentioned, once they come on Board the workforce, then they are 
<br/>trained in the various other parts of medical imaging modalities that are available.  At the moment, 
<br/>as part of the review, we are trying to ensure that training to be accredited is also included in the 
<br/>review. As it is, they are just learning on the job and some of the local accreditation from various 
<br/>hospital settings overseas, they have been seconded too to work there, learn and then come back and 
<br/>perform the duties that they do perform. But at the moment, the ones that we have, they are locally 
<br/>trained, and they are doing the work as it is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  There are specialised 
<br/>fields in this particular scope of work, especially if we are looking at CT scans and MRI. We have 
<br/>radiologists reading the scans and doing the report, who are paid close to around $143,000, et cetera.  
<br/>Now,  we  have  technicians  who  are  carrying  out  this  work  and  are  only  paid  around  $22,000  to 
<br/>$23,000. Why this huge disparity in salaries because within the images, the radiologist will not be 
<br/>able to read the reports. Even the honourable Minister explained in his answer previously that these 
<br/>people are trained, but they are not accredited. This is just a band-aid solution to train our technicians 
<br/>to work in Fiji, but if they go abroad, it is not recognised. What is the honourable Minister doing in 
<br/>terms of bridging the gap of the salary difference?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess my colleague was not 
<br/>listening, I have just mentioned in my reply that as part of the review of their workforce, that we will 
<br/>include accredited training to be part of, especially the MITs, together with that then we can also 
<br/>remunerate them accordingly  based on the skills  that they have attained.   That  is  included in  our 
<br/>review and that will happen.  It did not happen in the last four, eight or 16 years ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move the suspension motion for the purposes of complying 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times.
