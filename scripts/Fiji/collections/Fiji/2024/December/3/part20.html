<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – SUGAR CANE GROWERS FUND 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 3rd October, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund (SCGF) is a 
<br/>statutory body providing affordable loans to sugar cane growers in Fiji, with the aim to increase the 
<br/>production of sugar cane, improve efficiency in planting, growing, harvesting and transportation of 
<br/>sugar cane, rehabilitate farms, buildings and other installations damaged, destroyed or affected by 
<br/>floods,    cyclones  and  natural  disasters  and  the  establishment  of  sugar  cane  farms  and  other 
<br/>installations on the farms.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Committee upon being referred to with the SCGF 2021 Annual Report received public 
<br/>hearing for the Fund to gather information on its operational dynamics as part of the Committee’s 
<br/>scrutiny  process.    At  the  end  of  the  review,  the  Committee  made  recommendations  based  on  the 
<br/>discussions  with  SCGF  and  the  Annual  Report’s  content.    While  the  Committee  scrutinised  the 
<br/>Report, it identified pertinent issues such as the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>absence of key performance indicators. 
<br/>lack of established targets.  
<br/>rate of returns were very poor during the review period. 
<br/>audit did not focus on issues pertinent to the reporting year instead emphasising elements 
<br/>from  the  previous  years.  The  largest  group  of  borrowers  produced  less  than  100  tonnes 
<br/>accounting  for  47  percent  while  the  majority,  90  percent  of  the  borrowers  are  those  
<br/>producing under 400 tonnes.  
<br/>issues with FSC’s long term debt to South Pacific Fertilizers Limited were highlighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Annual Report lacked details on how loans are monitored once issued to the groups and 
<br/>was also deficient in information on loan portfolios. There was insufficient information regarding the 
<br/>new farmers assistance programme which was launched in 2018. Furthermore, the Committee in its 
<br/>review report articulated 20 findings with recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  is  looking  forward  to  Ministry  implementing  the  recommendations  put 
<br/>forward by the Standing Committee and hoping to see changes in the Sugar Cane Growers Fund’s 
<br/>future  annual  reports.  However,  we  note  that  there  are  areas  that  can  be  improved  through  more 
<br/>enhanced coordination, commitment and accountability of all sugar stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to 
<br/>contribute to the debate on the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report.  
<br/>I also would like to extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for their comprehensive report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  under  the  Chairman's  Foreword,  it  is  noted  that  the  Committee 
<br/>identified several challenges faced by the SCGF such as the uncertainty of lease renewal.  For many 
<br/>farmers,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  their  leases  are  on  the  verge  of  expiry.  For  instance,  there  are 
<br/>numerous farmers who receive their 30-year lease in 2000 which are set to expire in 2030.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current policy of the Fund does not allow the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to provide loans 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to those in that category because the policy states that five years before the lease expires, the loan 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>must be paid  off.  This  raises a critical  question and  I ask, how will these growers increase their 
<br/>production of sugar cane under such constraints?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, they are also not aware whether the leases will be renewed or not.  
<br/>In addition, farmers have been complaining about the delay in delivery of fertilizers.  These delays 
<br/>will definitely affect farmers and their ability to increase production. This is very simple that less 
<br/>fertilizer will definitely reduce productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of recommendations, I support Recommendation 3.1 which 
<br/>calls for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to review the outdated Act of 1984. This review is important 
<br/>to enhance the structure of the Fund in line with the current business standards. For example, the 
<br/>existing policy does not allow the Fund to support Small and Medium Enterprises.  This limitation is 
<br/>a significant problem to the growth and innovation within the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Updating the Act to include provision for supporting MSMEs will enable the Fund to serve 
<br/>the needs of our growers better and contribute to the overall development of the industry.  As far as 
<br/>the industry goes, in recent weeks, we have heard the Chairman of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) 
<br/>making a statement that FSC will not bill the Rakiraki Mill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the people of Rakiraki and the entire sugar industry have been let 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down by the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It all connects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering all these difficulties and challenges, Madam Deputy Speaker, I had submitted a motion 
<br/>regarding the sugar industry which was refused by the Tables Office.  However, let me say this, the 
<br/>sector is in crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- With thousands of livelihoods dependent on it, the Ministry of Sugar's 
<br/>current approach has failed to address the escalating challenges.  The sugar industry is vital to our 
<br/>economy and the welfare of the countless Fijians, thus Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee must 
<br/>work urgently to develop recommendations that will address the industry’s current issues and secure 
<br/>its future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while I support the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>2021 Annual Report and commend the efforts of the Committee, it is clear that more needs to be 
<br/>done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  The  challenges  faced  by  our  cane  farmers  are  significant  and  require 
<br/></span><span>immediate action by addressing the issues of lease renewal, fertiliser delivery and the review of the 
<br/></span><span>SCGF Act. We can create a more supportive and effective framework for our cane farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy  Speaker, I rise to support the Standing Committee for 
<br/>Economic Affairs’ Report on the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 
<br/>Annual Report.  I thank the Chairman and the Members of the Economic Affairs Committee for the 
<br/>Report and findings.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2377 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recommendation  on  the  Annual  Report  structure  in  the  contents  such  as  the  Key 
<br/>Performance Indicators and the Sustainable Development Goals’ matrix are noted.  The Sugar Cane 
<br/>Growth Fund will have it incorporated in the Annual Report of 2023.  The Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>(in short, the Fund), and the Ministry of Sugar Industry acknowledge and agrees to the challenges of 
<br/>the Sugar Industry as highlighted in the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government in 2023 - 2024 Financial Year approved $2 million for the new farmer and 
<br/>lease renewal programme, whereas 30 percent of the cost or a maximum amount of $7,500 was paid.  
<br/>In  2023  -  2024,  the  Government,  with  the  support  of  the  Fund,  as  project  implementing  agency 
<br/>assisted 325 growers with a sum of $1.65 million. About 70 applications from the last financial year 
<br/>are being assessed now and the decision is expected to be made within this month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fund has been in the forefront of this, with key stakeholders like, iTaukei Land Trust 
<br/>Board (iTLTB), the Sugar Industry Tribunal.  The Fund has signed an MOU with iTLTB for  the 
<br/>administration of the process of lease renewal and both CEOs are working closely for the betterment 
<br/>of the industry and landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the current budget, the Government has allocated $1 million as well. Application forms are 
<br/>now available at all the Sugar Cane Growers Fund offices and can also be downloaded on the website 
<br/>- scgf.com.fj. The Ministry is encouraging applications to be submitted to the Ministry before the 
<br/>closing date of 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2025. The aging farmers are no exception to the sugar industry and are 
<br/>common across the agriculture sector.  However, mechanisation and commercial farming are the way 
<br/>forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government, in this year's Budget, has allocated a total of $7 million under the Sugarcane 
<br/>Development Assistance Programme for the cane planting, which is $0.5 million and is for the farm 
<br/>mechanisation, which is $3 million. For manual labour programmes and support to cover part of the 
<br/>labour cost, the farmers are encouraged to access this grant as well.  On the fertiliser and weedicide 
<br/>cost, we agree that the price was high during the reporting period of this Annual Report  of 2021. 
<br/>However,  there  was  minimal  impact  on  the  growers  since  the  Government  subsidised  the  cost, 
<br/>growers are still paying $20 a bag for 50 kilogrammes of fertiliser.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2020-2021, the total price of 50 kilogramme fertiliser was $80.90. Well, you see it now, it 
<br/>is declined to $65.25 per bag. The reduced price is beneficial especially for Government, whereby it 
<br/>is now required to only pay $45.25 as subsidy as compared to $60.90 per bag last year. In the 2024-
<br/>2025 Budget, a total of $20 million is allocated for the fertiliser subsidy program and $1 million for 
<br/>weedicide  have  been  allocated.    I  must  commend  the  Board,  Management  and  the  staff  on  the 
<br/>transformation journey of the Fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to also highlight some activities taken by the Fund during 
<br/>this year. Introduction of a new cane farmer lone package with an interest of 2.99 percent per annum 
<br/>for 12 months or 6 percent per annum after that. Policy changes is that the reduce farm purchase 
<br/>equity from 33 percent to 20 percent, reduce the farm machinery purchase equity from 10 percent to 
<br/>5 percent and increase on medical expenses loan cap from $10,000 to $20,000. Introduce banking 
<br/>and  rehabilitation  package  for  the  growers  who  normally  lose  cane  during  off  season  burnings. 
<br/></span><span>Farmers will get repayment holidays and an interest rate reduction from 6 percent per annum to 3.1 
<br/></span><span>percent per annum for the next 12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Introduce  green  cane  incentives.  Under  this  incentive  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  farmers 
<br/>harvesting over 75 percent or more green cane can receive 2 percent reduction in the interest rates 
<br/>and  6  percent  per  annum  to  4  percent  per  annum  respectively.    Based  on  2024  harvest  data,  791 
<br/>accounts with a loan value of $7.46 billion will get a 2 percent interest reduction. This reduction is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2378 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paid to $0.149 million for 12 months from January to December 2025. Under this environmental, 
<br/>social and governance framework and SDG and its Sugarcane Growers Fund is all without any donor 
<br/>funding, Madam Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fund devised a house repair termite loan product to complement the Government funding 
<br/>to the cane growers. This loan is expected to be launched this month and has an interest rate of 2.99 
<br/>percent per annum and 6 percent thereafter, with a maximum loan limit of $50,000. Furthermore, 
<br/>there is an early Christmas for the growers, as the Fund is introducing the SCGF Growers Wealthy 
<br/>Programme. The Fund has gone out to some service providers like hardware merchants, pharmacies 
<br/>and dealers for the farms, tractors or machines and negotiated discount for growers. Every product 
<br/>grower for a start whether they have an account or not, the SCGF Wealthy Card will enable them to 
<br/>get a discount with participating merchants. This is expected to be launched before Christmas, and I 
<br/>must once again commend the great work and innovation by the Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fund continues to reposition itself both within and outside the 
<br/>sugar industry. It is evident in the Fiji Human Resources Institute (FHRI) Awards in September of 
<br/>this year. The fund is also intending to diversify its balance sheet to absorb unexpected shocks, such 
<br/>as natural disasters and to generate returns for the benefit of the sugar sector is noted and encouraged.  
<br/>On this, the Fund is looking at its investment portfolio including the performance of its subsidiary, 
<br/>South Pacific Fertiliser Limited which is 90 percent owned by the Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fund does not have legislatives challenges in extending credit 
<br/>services to both the sugar and non-sugar sectors. It is the strategic intent to diversify and expand its 
<br/>functions for greater sustainability is commendable. In this context, the Asian Development Bank 
<br/>(ADB) was engaged to conduct a gap analysis. The ADB has developed a roadmap for the Fund to 
<br/>potentially become a licensed financial institution. However, this requires review of the Sugar Cane 
<br/>Growers Fund Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is also waiting for the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Report on the 
<br/>sugar sector study which is expected to be received in the next three weeks. Along with this sector 
<br/>analysis, this study also looked at the institutions operations. The report shall be helpful in designing 
<br/>the strategic path for all institutions.  I want to put on record, my sincere appreciation to honourable 
<br/>Sakiusa Tubuna for facilitating our request with FAO to conduct this at no cost to the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  sugar  industry  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  significant  contributor  to  economic 
<br/>growth and nation building. The Fund and South Pacific Fertiliser, both have significant roles within 
<br/>and beyond the industry as economic drivers, especially with the ongoing reforms of the Fund. Once 
<br/>again, I extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for their contribution and deliberation. Based 
<br/>on these remarks, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to address the Review Report of the Sugarcane 
<br/>Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report with a full sense of responsibility. I am well aware of the various 
<br/>problems faced and overcome by our cane farmers. I, therefore, have no other choice than to air their 
<br/>grievances and aspirations through this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund has been a pillar of support to our 
<br/></span><span>farmers since its inception in 1984. The fund has been mandated to provide loans for increasing sugar 
<br/>cane production, improving efficiency and aiding farmers in times of distress is commendable. But 
<br/>the Report brings to light several critical issues that need immediate attention. The most critical now 
<br/>is the uncertainty of lease renewals and the ageing farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2379 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bala has spoken about this, and you can see the number of sugar cane farmers 
<br/>have strictly reduced and there are many other reasons apart from lack of labourers and in the case 
<br/>of Rakiraki, the closing down of the sugar mill. But the lease renewals is a major issue. Why are a 
<br/>lot of farmers moving away from sugarcane farming?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, we heard from the Deputy Prime Minister that some cane farmers in the North 
<br/>are now turning to rice farming. Madam Deputy Speaker, yet our farmers remain very much as the 
<br/>backbone of the industry. They face the bleak prospect of an insecure future, rising fertiliser prices 
<br/>and destruction of farm infrastructure by various forces of nature add to the challenges of rural urban 
<br/>drift.  How  does  the  Government  hope  to  help  address  these  issues  that  stand  in  the  way  of  a 
<br/>sustainable cane farming industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  also  highlights  that  there  are  no  established  key  performance  indicators  and 
<br/>targets for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. Without such goals it is difficult to assess the effectiveness 
<br/>of the Fund and make appropriate recommendations. What steps will the Government take to ensure 
<br/>that the SCGF sets and meets its specific measurable target to enhance its performance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the archaic Act of 1984 urgently needs revision. The agricultural landscape has 
<br/>changed a great deal over the past decade and our policies are required to reflect the emerging reality. 
<br/>What is the timeline by the Government to review and update this very important piece of legislation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also highlights the impact of external factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war on 
<br/>fertiliser prices and the devastating effects of tropical cyclones. These events have severely affected 
<br/>our farmer’s livelihoods.  What measures are being implemented to provide immediate and  long-
<br/>term relief to those impacted by such crisis?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  however,  the  fund  has  been  resilient  and  adaptable  to  these 
<br/>challenges, more so in adopting modern technology. The mySCGF App, the online portal and the 
<br/>SMS alert services have been a step in the right direction.  At the same time, we will ensure that such 
<br/>tools are accessible to the majority of farmers, even those in remote areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  also  indicates  that  smaller  growers,  those  producing  under  300  tonnes,  are 
<br/>borrowing more than larger growers. What this does is, the point to the fact, that our smaller farmers 
<br/>are  in  a  greater  need  of  financial  support.  How  does  the  Government  plan  to  provide  targeted 
<br/>assistance to these smaller growers to ensure they can thrive and contribute to the industry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee also noted that the largest category of borrowers produce less than 
<br/>100  tonnes  and  they  make  up  to  47  percent  of  the  total  borrowers.  It  is  thus  important  that  their 
<br/>support  is  assured.  What  specific  programmes  or  initiatives  are  being  developed  to  support  the 
<br/>farmers and help them become more productive? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, the most important focus of this audit report seems to be more on the past problems 
<br/>than the current year. That is of utmost importance. So our audits will give a precise representation 
<br/>of the present. How does Government make the auditing exercise more relevant and focussed towards 
<br/>present challenges and opportunities in future?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of detailed information on how loans are monitored once issued to growers, is also 
<br/>troubling.  Effective loan monitoring is essential to ensure that funds are used appropriately and that 
<br/>growers can repay their loans. What measures will be put in place to improve loan monitoring and 
<br/>ensure transparency and accountability?  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2380 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this financial result, evidenced by the net surplus of $3.06 million 
<br/>during 2021, pays homage to our farmers and a reflection of hard work and the management of the 
<br/>Fund.  Local term deposits fell from $15 million to $14 million during this period. A drop due to 
<br/>general economic circumstances and outcomes linked with COVID-19. How does the Government 
<br/>plan to support the SCGF in maintaining its financial stability to be able to continue this vital support 
<br/>to our farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recommendations  are  very  clear  and  well  entrenched  in  the  Standing  Committee's 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>A review of the organisational structure of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Comprehensive information to be included in future reports; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Establishment of KPIs to justify budgetary allocations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These recommendations are key to making the Fund more effective and able to meet the needs 
<br/>of our farmers. The Report also stresses the importance of the activities of the Fund in alignment 
<br/>with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).  This  alignment  should  demonstrate  our 
<br/>commitment  to  the  achievement  of  international  goals  as  well  as  sustainability  and  inclusivity  in 
<br/>agriculture.  How  does  the  Government  intend  to  support  the  Fund  in  aligning  its  operations  and 
<br/>reporting on the SDGs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while I support the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>2021, I call on the Government for decisive action in addressing the concerns of our cane farmers. 
<br/>By doing so, we can secure the future of our sugarcane industry and the livelihood of hardworking 
<br/>farmers who sustain it. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a short contribution on 
<br/>this particular debate, the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, 2021. They were in the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Economic Affairs when I was in the Opposition, and one of the organisations 
<br/>which was under that Committee is the SCGF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we went there, we were very impressed with the organisation. How it was organised, 
<br/>the structure and also the services. I was wondering whether this could be replicated, I suppose with 
<br/>other farmers.  For example, </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and </span><span>dalo</span><span> farmers.  It would probably be a good analysis, but I 
<br/>think some of the responses from the Opposition is misleading because this is the only Government 
<br/>which is taking a serious look at the Sugar industry.  So, when the honourable Minister explained 
<br/>what we were doing with the uncertainty in lease renewals, and Government had allocated in 2023-
<br/>2024,  $2  million  and  as  already  stated,  $1.1  million  in  the  2024-2025  Budget.    So,  honourable 
<br/>Praveen Bala, this alleviates your concerns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing was the close liaison between the honourable Minister of Sugar and Minister 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs, in terms of the renewal of leases, which has been progressing really well. The 
<br/>other  issue  that  was  mentioned  on  the  fertilisers  and  weedicides,  again  the  Minister  has  clearly 
<br/>mentioned the reduction in the price, so clearly contradicting what you are saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point, to the honourable Vijendra Lal, regarding the organisation itself and what it 
<br/></span><span>needs  to  do  to  be  reformed  or  move  forward,  to  respond  to  the  farmers.  This  has  been  clearly 
<br/>articulated by the honourable Minister, and as a caring Government, we are addressing all those. The 
<br/>honourable  Minister  mentioned  eight  initiatives;  new  loan  packages,  policy  changes,  green  cane 
<br/>initiative, house termite repair loan, grow a loyalty programme to obviously create sustainability with 
<br/>the ADB, and the current Report which is upcoming from the FAO regarding the analysis on the 
<br/>sugar industry to charter a way forward.

<div><span>Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2381 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, all in all, the Coalition Government is taking the right steps, the strategic steps which will 
<br/>take our sugar industry forward in terms of what needs to be done, whether it is to diversify, sustain 
<br/>or increase sugar production et cetera. I support the Report and thank the Standing Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU. J.B. NIUDAMU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise today with a deep sense of 
<br/>duty and commitment as I address the reviewed Report of the Sugarcane Growers Fund 2021 Annual 
<br/>Report.  Being  from  Ra  Province,  one  of  the  provinces  that  benefited  mostly  from  the  sugarcane 
<br/>industry for many years, I am deeply connected to our cane farmers and their enduring legacy. The 
<br/>sugar industry has been the life blood of our communities in the Ra province and has provided not  
<br/>only economic sustenance but also a sense of purpose and pride for generations of farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund  which  was  established  in  1984,  has  been  instrumental  in 
<br/>supporting  our  farmers  through  loans  for  increased  production,  efficiency  and  during  times  of 
<br/>distress. However, the challenges highlighted in this Report reminds us that we need to do more to 
<br/>ensure the sustainability and prosperity of this vital industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our cane farmers are facing numerous challenges that threaten their 
<br/>livelihoods and the future of the sugar industry. The uncertainty of lease renewals, the aging farmer 
<br/>population and the rising cost of fertilisers are just a few of the issues that need urgent attention. I 
<br/>thank the honourable Minister for Sugar, that he had indicated about the sugar fertiliser subsidy. I 
<br/>believe I am going through this 2021 Annual Report, and I will continue with my submission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Natural disasters, like TC Winston, have caused huge damage to farm infrastructure. These 
<br/>are big challenges that call for equally big solutions. It is time that we make sure that these are solved 
<br/>properly so that our farmers can survive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report also points out the lack of established Key Performance 
<br/>Indicators (KPI) and targets for the Sugarcane Growers Fund. Without clear goals, it is difficult to 
<br/>measure the effectiveness of the fund and make informed decisions. I urge the Government to work 
<br/>closely with the Sugarcane Growers Fund and set specific measurable targets that will enhance its 
<br/>performance and provide better support to our farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugarcane Growers Act of 1984 has become  outdated, and it 
<br/>needs revision to meet present realities in the agricultural sector. We must have our policies changed 
<br/>with the time to answer the needs of our farmers and the industry in general.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I call on the Government to make the review and updating of this 
<br/>important law a priority with the aim of aligning it with contemporary standards and best practices 
<br/>in business.  External factors such as the Russian and Ukraine War which increased fertilizer prices 
<br/>and economic consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic, has stretched our farmers to the breaking 
<br/>point.  These events have pointed out the ills of our agricultural sector. We need to develop strategies 
<br/>that reduce the risk and give our farmers the ability to withstand such storms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, despite these challenges, I am heartened by the level of resilience 
<br/>and  adaptability  shown  by  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund  and  our  farmers.    For  instance,  the 
<br/></span><span>introduction  of  the  MySCGF  app  online  portal  and  SMS  alert  services  and  SMS  instance.    For 
<br/></span><span>instance, Madam Deputy Speaker, the introduction of the MySCGF app online portal and SMS alert 
<br/>services is commendable in modernising the Fund’s operations and increasing farmers’ access to the 
<br/>Fund services.  We must ensure, however, that these digital tools are user friendly and accessible to 
<br/>all farmers especially those farmers in the rural areas.

<div><span>Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2382 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it emerges from this report that small growers with less than 300 
<br/>tonnes are borrowing more than large growers.  In other words, the report show us that small scale 
<br/>farmers have bigger financial needs compared to their large-scale counterparts.  Basically, it becomes 
<br/>important that we offer better support to these small growers.  Programmes and initiatives specifically 
<br/>designed to support small scale farmers need to  be created with a focus on helping these farmers 
<br/>improve their production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund’s financial performance of 2021 with 
<br/>a net surplus of $3.6million is a testimony to the hard work and commitment by our farmers  and 
<br/>management of the Fund.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also highlighted that the local term deposits decreased from $15 million to $14 
<br/>million due to the COVID-19 pandemic that negatively affected economies around the world.  It is 
<br/>for this reason, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we need to support the Sugar Cane Growers Fund in 
<br/>maintaining its financial stability so that it can continue to provide the much-needed support to our 
<br/>farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the recommendations made by the Committee are quite clear and 
<br/>actionable.  This ranges from a review of the organisational structure of the Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/>Fund,  to  the  inclusion  of  comprehensive  information  in  future  reports,  establishment  of  the  key 
<br/>performance indicators with the view to justify budgetary allocations.  Such recommendations will 
<br/>go a long way in ensuring that the Sugar Cane Growers fund is efficient and able to respond to the 
<br/>need of our farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report also emphasized the importance of aligning the Sugar 
<br/>Cane  Growers  Fund  activities  with  the  SDGs.  This  alignment  is  essential  for  demonstrating  our 
<br/>commitment to international goals and ensuring that our agricultural practices are sustainable and 
<br/>inclusive.  I urge the Government to support the Sugar Cane Growers Fund in integrating the SDGs 
<br/>into its operation and reporting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the urgent support that are coming from the farmers which I would like to bring to 
<br/>the attention of this House are firstly, if the Government should consider providing interest subsidy 
<br/>to the Sugarcane Growers Fund so that they can reduce interest rate from 6 percent to around 3.99 
<br/>percent like the Fiji Development Bank.  There is a special package, Madam Deputy Speaker, given 
<br/>to resource owners with complete interest subsidy through Merchant Finance and FDB.  I request if 
<br/>this  can  also  be  given  to  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund.    I  also  request  if  the  climate  finance 
<br/>programme should be channelled also to the Sugar Cane Growers Fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I recommend as alluded to by the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Sugar, for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to come up with a green cane interest rate reduction for 
<br/>those that harvested 25 percent green cane with the interest rate reduced from 6 percent to 4 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while I support the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>Annual Report, I call all of us as Members of Parliament to take drastic measures and not politicize 
<br/>the sugar industry.  We have to take drastic measures to try and curb this issue faced by our cane 
<br/></span><span>farmers.  By doing so, we can ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for our sugarcane industry 
<br/></span><span>and the hardworking farmers who sustain it. Let us work together to revive the sugar industry and 
<br/>help our farmers thrive once again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, of course, I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Members for their comments.  All the comments that have been raised, we have partly included that 
<br/>into the Report but I think one of the major issues affecting the Sugar Cane Growers Council is part
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024              Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2383 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the huge problem that is affecting the whole industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I totally agree with what honourable Bala has just raised – it is all interconnected.  All the 
<br/>issues are connected but what we need to do is to look at the big picture, what is the right structure 
<br/>that the industry has to have to meet a certain market that we need to supply to?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, I would like to thank the honourable Minister, there is a current study undertaken 
<br/>by FAO, the Report will be delivered to him in a few days’ time.  I think that will be the Report that 
<br/>will show what needs to be done in the industry.  The issue of land leases as being alluded to by some 
<br/>of the honourable Members, when we  went  around in  our public consultations with  the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Economic Affairs, we noted the substantial amount of land vacant all over the place.  
<br/>Honourable Koroilavesau and I went to Lomawai, Nadroga - a big area of land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People are saying that the problem is with land leases, but I think people have just abandoned 
<br/>the land and moved on to other areas.  The issue here, we are subsidising an industry which is no 
<br/>longer efficient, and we need to find the solution because we are forfeiting other industries that needs 
<br/>support.  Why  we  are  supporting  sugar  cane  farmers  with  subsidised  fertilizer,  because  we  are 
<br/>forfeiting the Government resources that can go into other economical commodities. I think all the 
<br/>issues that have been raised, of course, short term but I think we need to look at the long-term strategic 
<br/>solution to address the future of the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before the House.
