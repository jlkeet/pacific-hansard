<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF WATERWAYS 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Ministry of Waterways 2017-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy  Speaker, on behalf of the honourable Members 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion in 
<br/>regards to the Committee’s Review Report on the Ministry of Waterways Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span><span>which was tabled in Parliament on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the effort of the Ministry of Waterways in safeguarding our environment and 
<br/>enhancing  flood resilience through its key initiatives.  The Ministry's work is  fundamental  to  the 
<br/>safety and well-being of our communities, particularly in  context of Fiji’s vulnerability to natural 
<br/>disasters  and  climate  change.    Water  is  the  fundamental  resource  of  life.    With  the  efficient 
<br/>management of waterways is integral to sustain development.  The Ministry of Waterways under its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>
<div><span>mandate has been at the forefront of ensuring that the country’s water system are resilient, equitable 
<br/>and productive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the obvious successes of the Ministry’s 2017-2018 initiative 
<br/>was the significant investment in the flood control infrastructure.  Projects such as river dredging and 
<br/>construction of flood walls that have reduced the devastating impact of flood on our communities, 
<br/>particularly in the most flood prone areas of the country.  These initiatives are key to protecting lives, 
<br/>property and ensuring that our infrastructure remains functional during prolonged extreme weather 
<br/>events. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite  these  achievements  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  has  faced  significant 
<br/>challenges  particularly  with  the  growing  impact  of  climate  change  on  our  waterways  and  flood 
<br/>control systems.  While the Ministry has made commendable progress, more work is needed to ensure 
<br/>that all waterways especially in coastal areas are resilient to the effect climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is crucial that the Ministry revises its plan for adaptation of climate 
<br/>change and explores more innovative climate resilient infrastructure solutions. Another issue that the 
<br/>Ministry faced during the review period was the limitation of resources both in terms of financial 
<br/>support  and  manpower.    The  scale  of  flood  mitigation  and  waterways  restoration  required  to 
<br/>safeguard all vulnerable communities cannot be achieved with current resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  we  look  at  the  future  of  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  remains 
<br/>steadfast in its mission to protect the management of our waterways in a sustainable and resilient 
<br/>manner.  Together we continue to create a safer, more prosperous Fiji for generations to come.  I urge 
<br/>the honourable Members of this august House to acknowledge the hard work done by the Ministry 
<br/>while continuing to offer support for the necessary investment and policy adjustments required to 
<br/>address the challenges ahead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/>I have a list with me, and I want to thank you in advance for sticking under your 10-minute time 
<br/>limit, as I am sure many of you just want to go home right now, maybe have a nice dinner and spend 
<br/>some time with your family.  This is my list: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Sachida Nand 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Ravunawa; and 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Right of Reply) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will try my best to be very brief as I 
<br/>will  speak  on  probably  four  issues  from  the  Committee  deliberations  and  analysis,  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations, but before doing so, let me acknowledge the Committee for the good work and 
<br/>the Ministry as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that the Ministry was established in 2017, had teething issues to go through and there 
<br/></span><span>were unfortunate incidences that was beyond our control - previous disasters and </span><span>TC Josie </span><span>and </span><span>TC 
<br/>Keni </span><span>in 2017 and there were some re-deployments.  Of course, I know the issues in terms of capacities 
<br/>and capabilities as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very quickly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will just speak on are few things from the Report.  
<br/>One is on their Committee’s findings, I just want to speak on the issue of the low utilisation of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div>
<div><span>2385 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report   3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget funds.  This is not only in Waterways, but also a recurring issue and a common one in most 
<br/>government departments. I would urge the Government, Madam Deputy Speaker, perhaps it is time 
<br/>for us to review Government’s Financial Management Systems and the procurement processes as 
<br/>well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say this because during my term, Madam Deputy Speaker, as Commissioner, I was part of 
<br/>the, was just into the end of the previous system that used to exist, particularly with the key ministries.  
<br/>Previously, we used to have what we call “Agency Tender Boards”.  The Agency Tender Boards are 
<br/>especially given to big Ministries with bit allocations, such as Ministry of Education, Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture, Ministry of Works, Ministry of Health, and the list goes on. There is a certain limit given 
<br/>to them so that they can expedite the processes of tender and, of course, procurement processes as 
<br/>well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  we  have  what  we  call  the  “Divisional  Tender  Boards”.    Above  the  Agency  Tender 
<br/>Boards, we have the Divisional  Tender Boards.  I  am  just giving some thoughts so that probably, 
<br/>because of the recurring issue, maybe something that needs to be reconsidered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I,  for  one  always  say  that  we  are  not  all  crooks,  we  are  not  all  thieves.    Government’s 
<br/>responsibility is to put the systems and processes in place and penalties for those that do contravene 
<br/>the process or act otherwise. Just because someone did this, it does not mean that we are all going to 
<br/>do it, Madam Deputy Speaker.  I know in the last budget, I did raise this, and I walked across the 
<br/>floor as well, speaking to are few Ministers including the honourable Minister for Finance because it 
<br/>comes under his portfolio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The procurement process and the financial management system which lays out the process, 
<br/>particularly when it comes to tender boards as well, because when it comes to tender boards, there 
<br/>even some small issues, it can be just issues on missing information. But coming all the way from 
<br/>Labasa to Suva and then goes back takes time, delays, delays and then something comes up and then 
<br/>money is diverted, money is used elsewhere, this is a major contributing factor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes this is just acquittals because acquittals were not done in the previous quarter, this 
<br/>causes delay and then the correspondence and whatever, and most Ministries perhaps do not have 
<br/>follow up systems from the headquarters of the Ministry into the Ministry for Finance and back and 
<br/>forth.  This is my suggestion, Madam Deputy Speaker, because this has been a problem for a long 
<br/>time, and I hope the Assistant Minister for Finance will perhaps bring it to the attention of his Minister 
<br/>or probably something that they are already considering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the other issue that I want to speak on is just on Recommendation 2 
<br/>– the Ministry strengthens its information management system. The reason why I am raising this, 
<br/>there are a lot of requests, and some are just lost along the process.  In my visit to the North two 
<br/>weeks ago, thankful to the honourable Speaker's Office, I raised this with the Commissioner Northen 
<br/>when I paid a courtesy visit to his office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Governments change but the priorities remain the same. The needs of the communities remain 
<br/>the same. It is your responsibility to ensure that, that continues. Bring it back into the process, bring 
<br/></span><span>it back to the attention of those that are in leadership because the communities need this and that is 
<br/></span><span>why the information system, the database is so important. Of course, it will be helpful as well when 
<br/>it comes to, we are going to submit our long-term strategy and nationally determined contributions 
<br/>next year when it comes to climate financing. When we have the information available, then we are 
<br/>in a better position to seek the funding because the resources that we have, unfortunately cannot meet 
<br/>all our requests. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report   3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Madam Deputy Speaker, on recommendation five on capacity, on human resources, I 
<br/>wish  to  comment  on  this.    The  honourable  Minister  knows  very  well  that  LAWRM  was  just 
<br/>transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture into the Ministry of Waterways. One thing, capacity in 
<br/>terms  of  human  resources,  the  honourable  Minister  knows  that  previously,  we  had  Burmese 
<br/>engineers, a lot of foreign engineers, but you know, they have aged and most of them have returned. 
<br/>Unfortunately, for those from the Ministry that went to China, when they came back, they left to 
<br/>other organisations, so it is that capacity that we need and, of course, capability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that they do not have a dredger. I read in the Report, that most that of the work is 
<br/>outsourced. Probably that is something that needs to be considered as well, given that Fiji has so 
<br/>many rivers and we have issues of flooding. I hope that, that capability can be looked into as well, 
<br/>because when the Ministry for Waterways was formed part of the capability from the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural Development was given to the Ministry for Waterways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  that  was  package  that,  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  requested  through  JICA  as  a 
<br/>contingency, as a strategic reserve for the Ministry of Rural Development when disasters do strike, 
<br/>particularly in the rural areas where there was no Public Works Department (PWD). So, the capability 
<br/>as well, because that is what is keeping the Ministry running now, the trucks, the bulldozers and the 
<br/>heavy  plant  machinery.  I  hope  that  the  Government  will  seriously  look  into  not  only  the  human 
<br/>resources aspect but the capability as well. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the 
<br/>Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Waterways for the Year 2017-2018 that was tabled in this 
<br/>august Parliament  on the 3</span><span>rd</span><span> of October 2024. Let me from the offset mention that the importance of 
<br/>the waterways to agriculture cannot be overemphasised and right now, there is an enormous amount 
<br/>of work that we need to do to fix; one, our infrastructure that has existed for almost  three to four 
<br/>decades now and is falling to pieces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had already stated this in  Parliament, and I had already stated also that it will be quite a 
<br/>costly exercise. The latest  forecasts that  I have discussed with  my  waterways engineers runs into 
<br/>almost a F$1 billion.  But we will see, how we can work around this figure. So, as to make it possible 
<br/>for us to fix waterways. When we say infrastructure in waterways, we are talking about the seawalls, 
<br/>flood gates and we are talking about the very structure that holds the flood gates together. So, these 
<br/>are the ones that are falling apart, the very foundation is starting to give up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  although  the  Report  is  an  old  one,  many  of  the  challenges 
<br/>highlighted  by  the  Standing  Committee  regarding  the  Ministry  of  Waterway’s  administrations, 
<br/>structure, budgetary allocation, programmes, reporting activities are still relevant and the Ministry is 
<br/>actively striving to address these issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry acknowledges the findings presented in the Report that 
<br/>highlights the failure to identify the key physical targets of the Ministry for the review period, the 
<br/>inadequate utilisation of the allocated funds, the lack of comprehensive information provision and 
<br/>the ineffective succession planning regarding the retention of staff and assets within the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition and what he has stated regarding 
<br/></span><span>the need to review the systems and processes in terms of the approval of funds so as to fasten big 
<br/>infrastructure projects, like the ones that are undertaken in the Ministry of Agriculture.  I also agree 
<br/>that we need to up our manpower intake in terms of getting in our qualified agricultural engineers 
<br/>because they are the ones who know the type of job that is required because they are water engineers, 
<br/>as well as civil engineers.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report   3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the six recommendations put forward by the Standing Committee 
<br/>are noted and will be used as a guide for the Ministry to align the development of its policies, and 
<br/>the implementation of programmes and activities. The Ministry assures this august Parliament that it 
<br/>actively engaged in enhancing its information management system to establish a comprehensive and 
<br/>standardised  reporting  process.  This  initiative  aims  to  facilitate  the  dissemination  of  effective 
<br/>information and to provide accurate reports on programmes pertinent to the Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  Ministry  is  also  committed  to  following  all  Government  systems  and 
<br/>processes, particularly the financial and operational procedures, and ensuring that all annual reports 
<br/>are submitted on time.  But of course, with due consideration to what has been stated, that we need a 
<br/>review of the systems and processes to fast track the approval of funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, the Ministry is committed to improving its Human Resource Development Plan, as 
<br/>this  is  vital  for  enhancing  employee  performance,  attracting  and  retaining  talent,  ensuring  legal 
<br/>compliance and fostering a positive organisational structure, all of which contribute to the overall 
<br/>success and growth of the organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to acknowledge the contribution of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Natural Resources on the review of the 2017-2018 Annual Report of the Ministry of Waterways. 
<br/>On that note, I thank you for the opportunity and support the motion before the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker. I stand to speak on the Ministry of Waterways 
<br/>Report or the motion before the Parliament. The Ministry of Waterways was established to manage 
<br/>the waterways in Fiji.  This is much more than simply drains. One of the recommendations in the 
<br/>report by the Standing Committee is for the Ministry to improve its human resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I totally agree with this recommendation because, improving the human resources will enable 
<br/>the Ministry to deliver better services to the people. Not only in the human resources,  it needs to 
<br/>invest  in  equipment  and  machinery,  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition. 
<br/>Machineries and trained personnel will enable them to deliver better service to the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Madam Deputy Speaker, the issues in relation to drainage and waterways 
<br/>still  remains  current.  Arable  land  has  become  waterlogged  and  cannot  be  cultivated.    Saltwater 
<br/>intrusions has become far too common in arable land, especially cane land closer to the rivers or sea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  the  Labasa  Sector  in  Vanua  Levu,  acres  of  land  cannot  be 
<br/>cultivated  due  to  saltwater  intrusions.  In  Walu  Sector  in  Labasa,  farmers  are  being  pushed  back 
<br/>because  of  saltwater  intrusions  on  their  farms  and  yet,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  dream  about 
<br/>increasing our cane production and improving efficiency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in Rakiraki, the rivers and the drains are poorly managed. Rakiraki 
<br/>town  and  the  surrounding  areas  get  frequent  floods.  The  floods  have  significant  and  far-reaching 
<br/>effects on the community. This cannot be simply classified as simple floods. In Rakiraki, flood waters 
<br/>damage roads and crossings making it inaccessible. First, isolating some communities from essential 
<br/></span><span>services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources visited the 
<br/>Rakiraki Water supply, concerns were raised on the disruptions to water supply during floods. Water 
<br/>intake gets affected or gets clogged and thus affecting the quality of water drawn for treatment and 
<br/>supply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>2388 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report   3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, agriculture is the prime source of livelihood for people in Rakiraki. 
<br/>It is rather unfortunate that they do not have anything else to sustain their livelihoods. Even so much 
<br/>as the new sugar mill that was promised has failed to materialise. I just hope that the Minister for 
<br/>Sugar can look into the eyes of the people and say, I failed and I lied.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Floods damage their crops, it washes away their livestock and erodes their fertile land, and 
<br/>this has been happening, and it is a current situation. Slowly, day by day, the livelihoods of the people 
<br/>are squeezed even further. Social impacts of the floods cannot be quantified. Floods in small towns 
<br/>like Rakiraki can have devastating long-term effects on the economy, infrastructure, public health 
<br/>and overall, quality of life. This is due to poorly maintained waterways, and I hope the Government 
<br/>will look into this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People expect better service from the Department or the Ministry of Waterways. Therefore, I 
<br/>request  the  Government  to  increase  the  financial  resources  and  optimise  budget  uses  to  enhance 
<br/>service delivery. The Ministry needs to develop a skilled workforce that is capable of delivering the 
<br/>service. It needs to attract talent, and it needs to retain that talent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the previous speakers have said that people do move, but you should have mechanisms to 
<br/>retain those talents and equip your team with modern technology and tools to enable them to deliver 
<br/>proper  service.  The  Ministry  also  needs  to  strengthen  its  inter-agency  and  inter-ministerial 
<br/>coordination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry must improve collaborations with other relevant Government bodies including 
<br/>Ministry of Environment, local Government and iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs. They need improve accountability 
<br/>and transparency in order to deliver efficient services, empowering their officers and decentralising 
<br/>decision making is important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to deliver better service, the Ministry needs to integrate its work with climate change 
<br/>adaption work. It should ensure that infrastructure and  the people  are prepared for the disaster. It 
<br/>should strengthen early warning systems and flood protocols and take its work and deliverables to 
<br/>the Green Climate Fund, so they are better funded and equipped to deliver the services. This will 
<br/>ensure that they are able to upgrade their aging infrastructure and ensure that whatever infrastructure 
<br/>is in place is well-planned for long-term usage.  It is important, not only the Ministry staff, they need 
<br/>to  have  public  awareness  and  engage  the  community  on  their  responsibilities  to  help  in  the 
<br/>maintenance of waterways. Proper cultivation methods is important, therefore, it is the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture and other institutions that need to work with the team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To round it off, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Waterways in Fiji must adopt to 
<br/>modern  and  holistic  technologies.    It  should  have  an  integrated  approach  to  the  management  of 
<br/>waterways, this involves securing adequate funding, strengthening its governance and coordination, 
<br/>improving  its  human  resources,  leveraging  on  modern  technologies  and  being  future  driven  to 
<br/>provide  better  and  efficient  services  to  the  people.    This  will  enable  the  Ministry  to  perform  and 
<br/>deliver what the people of Fiji expect from them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a short contribution on 
<br/>the Report before us on Waterways. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture, 
<br/>one of the main initiatives or changes that has been re-establishment of the Drainage Board from the 
<br/>practical point of view it has included members of the community on that board. So, the appointment 
<br/>basically includes those with local knowledge of the waterways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>2389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report   3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am speaking as one of the inhabitants of the delta areas. One of the issues in the past have 
<br/>been the lack of local knowledge input into the work which has been done. So, some of the contractors 
<br/>came and just did it without close supervision which resulted in some of the work not being done 
<br/>properly or made the situation worse by the saltwater intrusion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe that is a positive development and some of the inputs which has been made regarding 
<br/>the  waterways,  I  do  support,  I  really  support  that  and  the  way  forward.  But  as  mentioned  by  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition with his experience, that is definitely the way to go moving 
<br/>forward, in terms of the revival of the whole functional areas of the waterways, and how best we can 
<br/>deal with this particular subject. Waterways is really affecting a huge portion of our population, not 
<br/>only the population but also their livelihoods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  was  regarding  the  cooperation  and  coordination  with  our  development 
<br/>partners,  so  that  is  ongoing  too  and  close  collaboration  with  our  Ministry  which  deals  with 
<br/>infrastructure. For example, waterways and also roads, so, we are closely collaborating on that and 
<br/>that was also one of the main subjects we discussed when we went to COP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, with our COP participants here, I know that there were various areas discussed but this 
<br/>was also one of the key areas discussed. I suppose the challenge is how to cascade that discussion at 
<br/>that level down to the practical projects. So, within the Ministry for example, how do we resource 
<br/>the  Ministry  to  enable  access  or  facility  access.  We  as  a  Government  are  working  within  our 
<br/>individual Ministries to ensure that the right people are there, in terms of project initiation and project 
<br/>management and not only that, but also climate financing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the modalities which are there?  What is available?  So, there is close coordination 
<br/>between  the  various  Ministries  and  Ministry  for  Climate  Change  on  that  with  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary. So, we are looking forward to not only actual planning and budgeting from here, but also 
<br/>with the close collaboration with our development partners because this is closely related to climate 
<br/>change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We now have the final contributor before I hand over the floor to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chair of the Standing Committee, and the final contributor is the honourable Penioni Ravunawa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, a lot has been said about the Report 
<br/>presented by the Standing Committee of Natural Resources and in my 20 months in Parliament, I 
<br/>have been hearing the same story; late submission of report, unclear direction without KPI’s, non-
<br/>utilisation of funds, alignment to SDG’s and the lack of transparency, and we thank the Government 
<br/>for the re-establishment of the Ministry of Waterways of the establishment of the Drainage Board to 
<br/>look after the drains and  rivers that we have because it will help the agriculture sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will help the communities that are living in the low-lying areas as well, and if I may share, 
<br/>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, in  the Public Accounts Standing Committee, the last couple of days we 
<br/>were discussing about the Audit Bill to give independence to the Office of the Auditor-General. The 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition mentioned about the delays in the reports and how can we deal 
<br/>with the issues to penalise chief accounting officers, responsible CEOs of ministries and departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  this  Audit  Bill,  we  are  looking  at  it,  and  as  I  was  sharing  my  experience,  the  last  20 
<br/>months, it was the common issues in all ministries and departments, and I believe it is time that we 
<br/>put some teeth in the Bills that we present in Parliament and hopefully we can close the loop properly 
<br/>in allocation of funds, grants given by Government and also those that look after the projects and
