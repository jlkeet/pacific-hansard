<h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3>
<div><span>POINT OF ORDER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on a Point of Order, Standing Order 74.  I am 
<br/></span><span>raising this issue in relation to something that was quite unprecedented to my memory, something 
<br/></span><span>that happened yesterday, when a Member of the Opposition, the honourable Alvick Maharaj, raised 
<br/>a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 74(1), it says, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any member may only raise a Point of Order if – 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament; 
<br/>the member specifies…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The normal practice has always been, when a Member stands up on a Point of Order and quotes 
<br/>the Standing Order and talks about that issue, that issue is then addressed by the Speaker.  That is the way 
<br/>that it has always been handled.  When a Point of Order is made, the matter is then addressed by the 
<br/>Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, for the first time ever, without the Speaker ruling on that Standing Order, we had a 
<br/>Member of Parliament stand up. In this particular case, a Cabinet Minister, standing up and talking about 
<br/>that issue without giving the courtesy to the Speaker to address the issue.  This is something that has never 
<br/>happened before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Always, when Point of Orders are made, they are addressed by the Speaker. So, we believe this 
<br/>is a serious breach of the whole process by which Point of Orders are made.  A Point of Order is made 
<br/>by a Member of Parliament, it is the Speaker who makes the ruling.  But in this particular case, a Cabinet 
<br/>Member, stands up and starts commenting on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are worried that this might change.  It has never happened before.  It is 
<br/>always the Speaker who makes the decision. Now, if we are going to allow this to happen, every time a 
<br/>Member of the Opposition stands up to raise a Point of Order, a Cabinet Minister will then stand up to 
<br/>defend against it, without allowing the Speaker to make a decision on that Point of Order.  And we see 
<br/>this, Sir as something that is very serious, and that needs to be stopped.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When a Point of Order is raised, it is the Speaker, it is the position of Speaker that needs to make 
<br/>that  ruling  and  not  for  anyone  else  or  Member  of  Parliament  to  talk  on  this.    So,  we  will  beg  your 
<br/>indulgence, Sir, to make a ruling on this, so that it does not happen again, because there could come a 
<br/>time whereby every time you make a Point of Order from this side, a Cabinet Minister stands up all of a 
<br/>sudden, without giving the courtesy to the Speaker to make that ruling and start talking on the issue at 
<br/>hand.  So, that is the purpose of my raising this, and I hope you can see fit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make a 
<br/>ruling on this matter so we do not persist with it, because it has never happened in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Usamate.    I  take  your  point  to  the  extent  that  I 
<br/>understand that the practice, as far as the Standing Orders are concerned, when there is a Point of 
<br/>Order  raised,  it  is  specifically  addressed  to  the  Speaker  and  the  Speaker  decides  on  the  Standing 
<br/>Order before any other Member indulges in that.  I understand all that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, if you are referring specifically to Standing Order 74, it not only says that the matter is 
<br/>raised under Standing Order 74, but that it relates to another Standing Order which is breached.  So, 
<br/>you are not only raising the issue under Standing Order 74, as far as honourable Maharaj is concerned, 
<br/>but he should have gone on and raised what specific Standing Order within Standing Orders are being 
<br/>breached.  That we had not gone or indulged in.  It just went as far as him raising the Standing Orders, 
<br/>and I did ask after my indulgence or my considering the issue, I had then asked honourable Tabuya 
<br/>to make a comment.  After that, then I made a ruling on the point that was raised by him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I agree with you that there are certain rules that are to be followed as far as the Speaker 
<br/></span><span>is concerned, in so far as Standing Orders are concerned, and the Point of Order raised as a result 
<br/>through that under the provisions of Standing Order 74.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when honourable Maharaj rose yesterday,  he stood 
<br/>on  Standing  Order  7,  and  that  was  the  issue.    I  am  standing  here  to  clarify  to  my  viewpoint  that 
<br/>Standing Order 74, what happened yesterday was not in accordance with what we have in Standing

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Usamate.  I will take your comment on that. We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will proceed to the next item.
