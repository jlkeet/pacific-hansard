<div><span>US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; good morning to the people of Fiji who may be 
<br/>listening in today. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2321 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to share some insights on the US 
<br/>Fiji  Investment  and Savings Drive 2024, that was conducted along  the  West  Coast  of the  United 
<br/>States from 6</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024 to 12</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The US Fiji Investments Savings Drive, a first of its kind, was organised by the Ministry’s 
<br/>Trade Commission in North America as a direct outcome of the Fiji-North America Business Mission 
<br/>to Canada and the United States in May 2024, which I had the honour of leading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  drive  was  focussed,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  bridging  the  gap  between  Fiji  and  the  Fiji 
<br/>diaspora  by  providing  crucial  investment  and  savings  opportunities.  This  initiative  is  a  clear 
<br/>testament of the Coalition Government’s commitment to inclusivity, ensuring Fijians across the globe 
<br/>to remain integral to the national growth story of our country. It reflects our understanding that while 
<br/>the borders of our nation may be physical, the spirit of Fiji transcends geography.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s diaspora community plays a pivotal role in the development of our 
<br/>economy. The numbers speak volumes or speak for themselves.  Between 2019 and 2023, Fiji has 
<br/>received a staggering $4.5 billion in remittances alone. Remittances from the United States are the 
<br/>second  highest  at  24  percent,  Australia  being  the  highest  at  44  percent.    Personal  remittances 
<br/>increased by 23.2 percent to $1.1723 billion in the 2022 to 2023 period.  These figures have been 
<br/>increasing on an average of about 17 percent since 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To put this into perspective, it is almost 10 percent of the GDP, directly supporting countless 
<br/>households  and  businesses  across  the  country.  Many  of  our  diaspora  members,  particularly  in 
<br/>countries like the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, are eager to do more. They 
<br/>want to invest in Fiji, plan for retirement and actively participate in the country's development. What 
<br/>they often lack is information, access and support, and the right policies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to turn 
<br/>these aspirations into reality.  This is where the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive comes in, to 
<br/>bridge these gaps and provide our diaspora with the right tools and support they need to contribute 
<br/>meaningfully to our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 70 agencies and financial institutions, namely the Fiji National Provident 
<br/>Fund, Fijian Holdings Unit Trust, Fijian Holdings Stock Broking Limited, Solar FinTech, iTaukei 
<br/>Land Trust Board, the Ministry of Lands and the Fiji Embassy in Washington DC, participated in the 
<br/>US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive, coordinated by the Fiji Trade Commission in North America, 
<br/>and ably led by Mr. Alika.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These agencies provided a range of services including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment advice to empower diaspora members to diversify their contributions;  
<br/>savings promotion to support financial security and retirement planning;  
<br/>land  and  lease  conditions,  ensuring  transparent  and  accessible  pathways  to  owning  or 
<br/>leasing land in Fiji;  
<br/>passport services to simplify logistical challenges for our diaspora; and  
<br/>linking services where diaspora members were linked to Fiji agencies and partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, these services were made available in four key cities, namely, Seattle, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>San Francisco, Sacramento and Santa Rosa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response from our diaspora, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was overwhelmingly positive.  Over 1,000 
<br/>members were served and new diaspora investments exceeding $1 million was recorded over those 
<br/></span><span>six  days.    These  numbers  to  net  accounts  for  the  long-term  impact  of  the  relationships  and  the 
<br/></span><span>accounts established during this drive. This is a true reflection of what we can achieve when we listen  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2322 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to our people and work together for the betterment of Fijians, especially for our people overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond the numbers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the human stories are what truly highlight that full 
<br/>impact of this drive.  Among the many stories shared, one that stands out was the story of a Fijian 
<br/>woman who had lived in the United States for decades unaware that she had substantial funds in her 
<br/>FNPF account. Misinformation had led her to believe that she had nothing in her account. Learning 
<br/>otherwise was an emotional moment for her. Tears of joy and gratitude were expressed and are a 
<br/>powerful reminder of why these engagements are so critical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also heard from diaspora members who plan to retire in Fiji and look for the opportunity 
<br/>to open investment accounts in Fiji. These are powerful reminders of the latent potential within our 
<br/>diaspora and their eagerness to maintain strong connections with their homeland. These stories, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  highlight  the  deep  desire  of  our  diaspora  to  stay  connected  to  our  homeland  and 
<br/>contribute in tangible ways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the success of this drive is undeniable, it also has shone a light on the 
<br/>challenges faced by our diaspora. One major issue is the difficulty of opening bank accounts in Fiji 
<br/>remotely. Many diaspora members, particularly those who are unable to travel to Fiji, are excluded 
<br/>from accessing banking services due to stringent in-person verification processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  address  this,  our  very  own  local  bank,  HFC,  in  partnership  with  the  Fiji  Trade 
<br/>Commission, is looking at a way to allowing diaspora members to open bank accounts remotely. The 
<br/>teams have registered a few new bank accounts as part of this, and a formal announcement will be 
<br/>made as soon as everything is worked out logistically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will mean that we will witness an increase in deposits and investments 
<br/>from  our  diaspora  community.  I  would  like  to  also  acknowledge  the  Board  Chairman  and 
<br/>Management of HFC Bank, who have been working actively with the Trade Commissioner of North 
<br/>America. This initiative, Mr. Speaker, is the first of its kind in our country and a testament to the 
<br/>combined dedication to overcoming barriers with our diaspora.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, let me take a moment to reflect on why supporting our diaspora is so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crucial.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Diaspora  investments  and  savings  directly  contribute  to  Fiji’s  GDP.  The  funds  raised 
<br/>through initiatives like this drive support for businesses, create jobs and fuel infrastructure 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Facilitating investments such as this, in areas such as land and housing, will encourage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>long-term participation in our economy, ensuring a stable future for our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Engaging with our diaspora fosters a sense of belonging and loyalty to Fiji, encouraging 
<br/>them  to  return  home,  retire  and  even  start  businesses  here.  I  am  pleased  to  report,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that there are already quite a few doing that as we speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Beyond financial contributions, our diaspora represents a wealth of knowledge, skills and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>networks that can be harnessed to drive innovation and development in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two gentlemen, Sir, that we saw in Canada are quite well-heeled gentlemen who have 
<br/></span><span>made names for themselves in Canada, and they are here as an outcome from the North American 
<br/>Mission that we also conducted in May this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Both from Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, this drive was a trial, but we can see, and it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2323 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now being hailed certainly as a success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we look to the future, Mr. Speaker, our goals are very clear: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Annual engagement - we plan to make the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive an annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>event, aligning it to Fiji Day celebrations to maximise participation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>On top of that, we will be looking at rolling this out to other countries in the diaspora, so 
<br/>that we deepen our penetration with the diaspora.   The next step of course is to look at 
<br/>Canada and a few other countries in going forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Tailored solutions - through key partnerships, we will continue to identify barriers and work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on innovative solutions such as the partnership with the HFC Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Diaspora empowerment - our aim is to create an environment to every Fijian, regardless of 
<br/>where they live, can contribute to our nation’s success, without any unnecessary huddles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our vision, Mr. Speaker, is to expand to other countries, as I have mentioned, and ensure that 
<br/>going forward, our diaspora, our family, become a central cornerstone in the economic development 
<br/>of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to highlight in this House some other developments that are in train. Of 
<br/>course, changes to the rules of immigration that were introduced by the Coalition Government have 
<br/>been warmly received by our diaspora. The new exemption categories is based on membership in the 
<br/></span><span>Vola ni Kawa Bula</span><span> and also your birthright in Fiji, sends a powerful message to all our diaspora, in 
<br/>terms of their ability to come home and work at home and strengthen bonds between Fiji and where 
<br/>they reside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there are existing investment incentives as well, Mr. Speaker, we will tailor some of 
<br/>these incentives to the diaspora. The Ministry of Trade is currently designing some policies which 
<br/>will  be  tabled  in  Cabinet,  targeting  the  diaspora  specifically.  This  is  expected  to  attract  more 
<br/>investment, wealth creation and improve the wellbeing of our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, by creating a consistent and structured approach, we can ensure that every Fijian 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>abroad has the opportunity to invest, save and stay connected to their homeland.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish also to acknowledge at this stage, the local stakeholders in the United 
<br/>States, whose collaboration made this event possible.  This includes the venue organisers, the Fiji 
<br/>Day Santa Rosa Event Coordinators, community and church leaders, who supported this drive. Their 
<br/>contributions in facilitating logistics, rallying the community and providing an inclusive platform for 
<br/>engagement, were invaluable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  Fiji  Embassy  in  Washington,  His  Excellency 
<br/>Ambassador Ratu Ilisoni Vuidreketi, and his team, for their support in providing passport enrolment 
<br/>services to the diaspora in California during this drive.  Of course, I also would like to thank the Fiji 
<br/>Trade  Commission  in  North  America  and  their  leader,  Mr.  Cooper,  for  their  tireless  efforts  in 
<br/>coordinating the drive, providing immense support to the agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, now, a note for the Government, the desire for passport processing to be brought 
<br/></span><span>closer to the community is something which came up quite significantly in America and, perhaps, 
<br/>with the permission of the honourable Prime Minister, we are looking at setting up something on the 
<br/>West Coast to deal with those of our people on the West Coast, where the bulk of the population is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, the success of the US Fiji Investment and Savings 
<br/>Drive  2024,  is  a  shining  example  of  what  can  be  achieved  when  we  engage  our  diaspora.    This 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2324 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initiative  will  not  only  strengthen  our  economy,  but  also  reinforces  the  invaluable  connection 
<br/>between Fiji and our people abroad.  To our stakeholders and every Fijian who participated in this 
<br/>drive, </span><span>vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>.  Your efforts and enthusiasm are what make such initiatives possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are building bridges between Fiji and its diaspora, bridges that 
<br/>will  not  only  carry  investments,  but  also  the  hope,  pride  and  the  shared  vision  of  prosperity  for 
<br/>generations to come.  Let us continue to build a Fiji that every Fijian at home or abroad, is proud to 
<br/>call their own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to deliver this Ministerial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial 
<br/>Statement and his brief on the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive, which was conducted along 
<br/>the West Coast of the United States.  I think he somewhat touched on Canada also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, yes, Mr. Speaker, this initiative was aimed to strengthen our economic ties and 
<br/>attract investment and encourage more of our Fijian diaspora to participate in Fiji's economic growth.  
<br/>But let me just correct him, Mr. Speaker, this is not the first, it was done before in North America, 
<br/>and proof of the pudding is a very large investment that came out of the States.  This is in Wailoaloa, 
<br/>in a hotel that has currently just finished.  That was done under the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said  all of that,  I take  my  hat  off to  the honourable Minister  for 
<br/>having taken the initiative to do this.  It is a great place for us to try and tap into the diaspora because 
<br/>there are many success stories that come out of North America that we can tap into.  The last time, I 
<br/>think, we did all of these, COVID had put back to a lot of things, therefore, it stood still.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  mentioned  by  the  honourable  Minister,  we  have  a  huge  diaspora  and  that  relates  to 
<br/>remittances that come into the country.  That is actually  a pittance in  terms  of the capability that 
<br/>exists within North America in terms of investment into Fiji.  We have many success stories of former 
<br/>Fijians who have done extremely well in the US and Canada and are willing to come and invest in 
<br/>Fiji.  One such case, as I have said, is the Crown Plaza that is being built in Wailoaloa and it is a 
<br/>massive success story, and this is a gentleman called J. Singh, who is a former Fiji citizen. He has 
<br/>done extremely well in the United States, and he has now decided to invest in Fiji. That is just one 
<br/>example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other example is sitting in the room today.  As mentioned by the honourable Minister, a 
<br/>very well-heeled gentleman, Mr. Jeff Lal, who is also a very successful businessman, who also wants 
<br/>to come and invest in Fiji. But it just so happens, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Lal, even yesterday, pointed 
<br/>out some things that probably need to be looked at. This is not pouring scorn on anything but just 
<br/>something that we need to look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is, again, a Ba-born Canadian businessman. He talks about the investment landscape and 
<br/></span><span>there are issues with respect to scrutiny that they actually look at.  The investor’s concerns come out 
<br/></span><span>of  stability,  of  Government  policies  and  overall  investment  climate.  So,  I  think,  maybe  the 
<br/>honourable Minister needs to just take heed of the kind of stuff that actually comes out in the press 
<br/>and address these issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in terms of investments and incentives and policy stability and the different sectors that 
<br/>they are looking at that need to be looked at, the key issue that he raised, I think, was land lease 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2325 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issues,  et  cetera,  and  whether  different  sorts  of  land  was  affordable.  Investors  were  questioning 
<br/>whether  Government  would  provide  incentives.  So,  I  think  these  are  questions  that  need  to  be 
<br/>answered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But this is not a question that singularly comes from Mr. Lal, it actually comes from the entire 
<br/>diaspora.  As I have said, they look at the potential long-term risks if they are going to invest. And 
<br/>we must remember, Mr. Speaker, that these are large investments that they intend to undertake.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Tourism will understand that the Crown Plaza is now a jewel in 
<br/>the crown with respect to tourism. These are the kinds of investments that we can attract, regardless 
<br/>of who is in Government, so we can attract.  We just need to get it right. So, when an investor or 
<br/>someone who is about to invest is raising these issues, I think they need to be spoken to and we need 
<br/>to also ensure that we look at it in terms of when Budget time comes and the investments that can be 
<br/>done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the other things also is that we have a young population who actually 
<br/>exists in these parts of the world who are not born here, but they are children of Fijian citizens who 
<br/>have also done well. And there is a large interest in them taking up Fijian citizenship and wanting to 
<br/>come here and work. So, there is a skill that they now possess that we can actually tap into. So, these 
<br/>are areas that we most definitely need to expand on and look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, there are challenges that exist, but like anything, there is going to be challenges 
<br/>and I think these challenges will be addressed by the Minister because he is, obviously, got a team 
<br/>working on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji, the main arm of all of these, also needs to be beefed up, Sir.  They are an 
<br/>investment promotion agency and when Budget time comes, I think the honourable Minister will 
<br/>need to ask the honourable Minister for Finance for more money so that we can actually tap into 
<br/>these places, like we should, so that we can get more investment into the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of G-9 Bloc, or his designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the Ministerial  Statement given 
<br/>by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operative,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications, I commend the initiative aimed at the strengthening of economic 
<br/>ties between Fiji and the United States, as well as the encouragement of the Fijian diaspora to engage 
<br/>in building our economy and the economy of their home country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive 2024 is a commendable initiative, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>not just in the impact it promises for the economic growth of Fiji, but in its potential to create a global 
<br/>platform for local MSMEs.  Such a drive could enhance the capacity of these businesses, fostering 
<br/>innovation, competitiveness and economic diversification.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By targeting the Fijian diaspora in North America, the initiative recognises the significant 
<br/></span><span>contribution of our fellow citizens abroad, what they could bring in terms of investment, their skills 
<br/>and knowledge, and the potential boost for economic and social development in Fiji. This strategy, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, aligns with our global trend, leveraging diaspora for development and foster a sense of 
<br/>belonging which could, undoubtedly, be transformative. I also acknowledge the Government's effort 
<br/>in adopting the long-term prosperity and collaboration, but also would encourage and strengthen the 
<br/>strategy for all members of our society, including our youth and our women.

<div><span>2326 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building a prosperous nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires the active involvement of all citizens, 
<br/>both at home and abroad. That being said, it is fundamental that such initiatives come with robust 
<br/>mechanism to manage and monitor the execution and impacts of this investment. Transparency and 
<br/>accountability should not be compromised, and Government deliverables must result in tangible and 
<br/>meaningful progress for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  applaud  the  effort  and  the  direction,  and  I  urge  the 
<br/>Government to ensure that this initiative does not only attract financial investment, but also translate 
<br/>to real socio-economic development, job creation and, ultimately, a better standard of living for our 
<br/>people. It is also important to ensure that the interests of local communities and their environment 
<br/>are protected in any development strategies, and to be in line with Sustainable Development Goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  that  being  said,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Ravunawa.    I  was  going  to  add  the  fact  of  the 
<br/>presence of the business individuals in our midst this morning, Mr. Sam Basra and Mr. Jeff Lal, who 
<br/>are hugely successful businessmen in Canada. I understand that the honourable Prime Minister had 
<br/>met them in one of his trips there, but I am beaten to it by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>honourable Koya.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I only would like to add my own personal experience, is one of my most enjoyable line of 
<br/>work  as  Vice  Consular  in  New  York  in  the  late  1970s  was  to  visit  our  Fijian  communities,  the 
<br/>diaspora all around America and Canada. What I noted then and it was untapped then, was the huge 
<br/>enthusiasm to assist our country and the contact that they have maintained. I am only adding that as 
<br/>an observation to the statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a bit of bad news.  Honourable Members, our Secretariat has been advised by the 
<br/>UNDP Fiji Parliament Support Project that the workshop that was planned for next week at the Coral 
<br/>Coast  has  been  cancelled.    But  maybe  this is  a blessing  in  disguise.    I  think  after  this  morning’s 
<br/>intervention by the various Members, I would like to encourage, in the light of the cancellation, the 
<br/>respective Standing Committees to continue with their Committee meetings until prorogation. Our 
<br/>Secretariat stands ready to facilitate these meetings, if required.  Thank you, honourable Members.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>House, members of the public, members of the media, ladies and gentlemen; that retreat was actually 
<br/>going to be held in my neighbourhood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the day I took on the tourism portfolio till today, I receive requests 
<br/>from Fijians wanting to grow and to diverse their businesses in tourism. There was a gentleman who 
<br/></span><span>got a space by a big resort to set up a stable to operate horse riding, but he was not able to purchase 
<br/></span><span>the needed equipment. There was a lady who owns an art business, who wants to supply to more 
<br/>hotels,  but  needed  help.  But  these  businesses  for  whatever  reason,  could  not  tap  into  any  of  our 
<br/>established finance programmes.  It was either that the programme had closed, they were ineligible,  
<br/>or the programme was focussed on other sectors, so we saw a gap. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a critical 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>role in our nation's economy. They represent the vast majority of businesses, contribute significantly 
<br/>to job creation and drive innovation at the grassroots level.  The same is true for the tourism sector, 
<br/>not just in Fiji but globally. Some of today's greatest companies began as ideas. Some data suggest 
<br/>up  to  80  percent  of  the  sector  comprises  SMEs.  These  businesses  are  the  lifeblood  of  our  local 
<br/>economies, yet they often face challenges in accessing the resources needed to grow and thrive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recognising this gap, in the 2024-2025 financial year, the Ministry of 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation has been allocated $400,000 to implement the Pilot Tourism, Micro and 
<br/>Small Enterprises Fund.  The Fund, an initiative of the Coalition Government, is the first of its kind 
<br/>for the tourism sector.  It is designed to directly empower micro and small enterprises within the 
<br/>tourism sector by providing financial assistance in the form of a grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  initiative  reflects  our  Government's  belief  that  the  growth  of  our 
<br/>MSMEs  is  central  to  building  a  resilient  and  inclusive  economy.  We  recognise  that  these  small 
<br/>businesses form the backbone of our tourism sector. From friendly-run guesthouses and eco-lodges 
<br/>to local tour operators and handcraft producers, MSMEs embody the essence of Fijian hospitality 
<br/>and culture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the grants, we are creating a platform for these enterprises to rebuild, innovate and 
<br/>contribute  to  the  larger  vision  of  sustainable  economic  growth.  These  grants  are  not  just  for 
<br/>accommodation providers, it is to grow more experiences and activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Globally, we see that today's traveller is not choosing a destination solely based on the hotel 
<br/>brand. There used to be the belief that tourism in Fiji or sun, sand and sea, it is much broader than 
<br/>they are today. They want more immersive experiences where they leave their hotels and take part in 
<br/>community and cultural activities. This is an area that the Ministry wishes to focus on, because as 
<br/>investments takes shape in hotels and new markets come into Fiji, we need to be able to cater for 
<br/>their different needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wanted to share that the programme is being overseen by a public private panel. Besides 
<br/>government  agencies,  we  have  partners  like  the  Fiji  Hotel  and  Tourism  Association,  Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank and Business Assistance Fiji.  Through these grants, we want to support small 
<br/>businesses  who  want  to  enhance  their  product  and  experiences.  It  could  be  a  village  who  has  a 
<br/>waterfall and wants to build a small trail, it could be a new hiking route that wants to improve signage.  
<br/>To be eligible, you must be a Fijian citizen of 18 years of age and above, be a registered business in 
<br/>operation  for  two  years,  majority  Fijian-owned  or,  at  least,  51  percent  engaged  in  tourism,  with 
<br/>majority of revenue comes from the tourism sector; and ability to meet the one-third project cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative is more than just financial assistance. It is a demonstration of 
<br/>our Coalition Government’s dedication to creating opportunities for all Fijians. Tourism remains a 
<br/>cornerstone of our economy, and we are determined to provide it with the right type of support  - 
<br/>support  that  empower  small  businesses  to  succeed  and  innovate,  ensuring  their  long-term 
<br/>sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This programme is not an isolated effort, it is part of a larger integrated vision to ensure Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>tourism sector remains resilient, inclusive and globally competitive. From the Na Vualiku Tourism 
<br/></span><span>Development Programme to the Farm to Fork Initiative, we are creating a network of support that 
<br/>empowers entrepreneurs, sustains communities and drives innovation. This Government has shown 
<br/>time and again that we are committed to the principles of inclusivity and shared progress. The Fund 
<br/>is yet another example of our resolve to bring impactful, transformative change to the lives of our 
<br/>people.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now have the honour of informing this august House and the public that 
<br/>the pilot programme will be live and available effective tomorrow, Wednesday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024. 
<br/>The application is available on our website:  www.mpca.gov.fj and we will be reaching out to the 
<br/>various divisional offices of government to make these forms available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To our partners and stakeholders, we invite you to join us in supporting this initiative and 
<br/>ensuring a success.  Together, we can create an ecosystem where every business, regardless of its 
<br/>size,  has  the  tools  to  succeed,  and  to  all  Fijians,  this  is  our  journey.    The  Coalition  Government 
<br/>remains committed to working with you every step of the way, ensuring that no one is left behind, as 
<br/>we build a brighter and more prosperous Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With determination, vision and unity, we will ensure that tourism continues to be a source of 
<br/>strength and pride for our nation, empowering entrepreneurs and enriching lives. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial 
<br/>speech this morning and just to support him, Sir, also to say that this is a very, very good initiative 
<br/>that is actually being started tomorrow in terms of the tourism MSME Grant Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we must remember is that this is not the only programme that MSMEs 
<br/>can  actually  tap  into,  so  to  his  neighbour  sitting  next  to  him,  there  is  the  Trade  Enhancement 
<br/>Programme (TEP) under his Ministry that the tourism operators can tap into as well. These are great 
<br/>things for our MSMEs sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to put it into perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, pre-COVID, I think the MSME sector actually 
<br/>contributed about 18 percent to Fiji's GDP and 60 percent of it was also to the national workforce.  
<br/>Now, following the impact of COVID, a lot of people also who lost their jobs went into the MSME 
<br/>sector and so a lot had to be done to encourage them and, again, the tourism industry has actually 
<br/>benefited from it.  A lot of them supported themselves through these small livelihoods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the grant has some success. There are previous grants that we have done for 
<br/>tourism and through Tourism Fiji, similar ones, and two of them stand out as having done extremely 
<br/>well and these kinds of grants are also being supported by Tourism Fiji.  I think everyone in Fiji and 
<br/>worldwide  knows  about  our  Sabeto  Horseraces.  Aviva  Farms  was  actually  a  recipient  of  that 
<br/>particular tourism grant, and it is a massive success story of this particular initiative or this kind of 
<br/>initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know from having been at that particular races at that time that it is not 
<br/>just a Fiji phenomenon, it is a worldwide phenomenon now.  Everyone looks forward to it. It is a 
<br/>great day out and, of course, it is the weather in the West where everything is the best, obviously, 
<br/>Sir.  But these are the initiatives that actually work for our tourism sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also know that Zipline Fiji was also one of the recipients for the earlier initiative. So, this 
<br/>particular initiative given by the Ministry of Finance in terms of about $400,000 to support our small 
<br/>tourism businesses is welcomed and much look forward to, as an add on, to whatever else is being 
<br/></span><span>done at the Ministry of Trade.   I think the TEP actually allows it also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we have a wonderful opportunity for our MSMEs to grow and in order to increase our 
<br/>cultural  and  community  experiences  in  the  tourism  industry,  it  aligns  with  the  modern  traveller 
<br/>demand. Most people are looking for authenticity nowadays and these are areas that we can actually 
<br/>tap into.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a small way, this also contributes towards our economy in terms 
<br/>of diversification and reliance on very little things, but these things actually manage to make us grow. 
<br/>We saw that in times of need, people started doing many small businesses that still exists nowadays 
<br/>through these initiatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MSME sector is  the engine for growth  for our economy  and  I take  my  hat  off to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for starting this particular initiative on the back of all the other small initiatives 
<br/>for our MSMEs that actually exist around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said regarding the TEP, I hope the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  Trade  is  actually  forcefully  trying  to  encourage  more  and  more  people  to  get  on  to  this 
<br/>Programme. I also understand which is commendable, Sir, it is not just about the handing out of the 
<br/>money, there are training programmes, et cetera, that exist which is also very commendable because 
<br/>this is an industry that we can actually grow more and more. I thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the Leader of the G9-Bloc or his designate for his response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, honourable Gavoka, on the statement that he 
<br/>has been delivered on the Pilot Tourism MSME Grant Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank the Coalition Government  for launching this particular programme in the 2024-
<br/>2025  Budget.  There  is  also  $400,000  that  is  allocated  for  this  particular  support  to  support small 
<br/>tourism businesses especially in our communities. It will offer about a sum of $15,000 for applicants 
<br/>who can apply, given the applications will be available tomorrow online and also the requirement 
<br/>that is there that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has already announced, plus the one-third 
<br/>that they also have to contribute.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister for addressing the gap, and that gap has 
<br/>been there for a very long time. This particular funding will address the financial access that many 
<br/>of those, for the last 8 years to 16 years, have been denied, especially when we go down to Inter-
<br/>Continental, those operators are always at the borders of the hotel. They do horse riding, catering, 
<br/>plus other handicrafts. This will assist  them in providing better facilities for them, given the demands 
<br/>of travellers are now changing, not only do they want the sun, sand and sea, they probably also want 
<br/>our heritage, spiritual tourism plus other things that they have more interest to them, </span><span>sigidrigi</span><span>, </span><span>mekes</span><span>
<br/>that  are  available  elsewhere,  those  kind  of  knowledge  will  assist  all  given  another  Bill  that  the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei are also consulting on cultural expression and traditional knowledge that will 
<br/>also  capture  this  new  form  of  tourism  that  marketing  our  culture  and  the  taste  of  the  tourist  and 
<br/>travellers coming in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That will generate more income to our community especially in villages. More activities they 
<br/>can  do  to  improve  their  facilities,  footpath,  community  halls  and  other  things  the  ladies  can  also 
<br/>improve and empower them through business.  It can also create employment. I thank the Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and that is my response, and again thank you for addressing that gap that has been 
<br/>there for long. I hope it continues and this particular programme that more awareness and consultation 
<br/></span><span>will be done so that the staff from the Ministry can go out there and explain to those applicants where 
<br/></span><span>the application forms are and what are the requirements that needs to be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On another note, also to assist our landowners. If the Ministry of iTaukei and TLTB can look 
<br/>into other services that can provide to our landowners in terms of making business plans. These are 
<br/>also costly to them, and it can be effected as part of this, so that it can help in the registration of 
<br/>businesses before they are eligible to the requirement of this MSME. Those are few words that I

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and all those tuning in live on Parliament’s </span><span>Facebook</span><span>
<br/>channel; </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a Statement on Fiji’s hosting of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Commission for the 
<br/>Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific 
<br/>Ocean (WCPFC), which was held in Suva from Thursday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> November till today, Tuesday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>December, and catered for 470 participants. I would like to show my Ministry and the Commission’s 
<br/>sincere gratitude in thanking the honourable Prime Minister of Fiji for his gracious leadership and 
<br/>support in accepting our invitation to be chief guest at the official opening of the meeting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission for the Conservation of Management of Highly Migratory 
<br/>Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean is one of the five global tuna Regional Fisheries 
<br/>Management  Organisations  (RFMOs),  and  is,  perhaps,  the  largest  regional  fisheries  management 
<br/>organisation, catering to over 50 percent of the world’s tuna catches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WCPFC convention area caters to approximately 20 percent of the earth’s surface with 
<br/>the Western boundary to the East Asian seaboard, excluding the South China Sea and the Eastern 
<br/>boundary, to  the overlap area of the  Inter-American Tropical  Tuna Commission - one  of the five 
<br/>RFMOs the southern boundary to the 60 degrees South and the  northern boundary to Alaska and 
<br/>Bering Sea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the WCPFC Convention was established to conserve and manage tuna and 
<br/>other highly migratory fish stocks across the  Western Central  Ocean and was established on 19</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>June, 2004, with its Secretariat based out at Pohnpei in the Northern Pacific Islands of the Federated 
<br/>States of Micronesia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the WCPFC is made up of 26 co-operating members, seven co-operating 
<br/>members from participating territories and seven co-operating non-members. It should be noted that 
<br/>whilst all three categories take on the Conservation Management Measures (CMMs) developed under 
<br/>this RFMO, only the initial two categories may take part in the decision-making process.  Observers 
<br/>are also welcomed to the meeting, and they are categorised with an observer status.  There are 24 
<br/>inter-governmental organisations and 38 non-governmental organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission  is  built  on  the  United  Nation’s  Fish  Stocks  Agreement 
<br/>principles  to  address  the  Western  Central  Pacific  Ocean’s  unique  political,  socio-economic, 
<br/>geographical  and  environmental  characteristics.  The  Commission  progresses  much  of  its  work 
<br/>through its four subsidiary bodies on an annual basis and deliberates on their outcomes towards a 
<br/>decision-making process, like the WCPFC. The four such bodies of the Commission are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Scientific  Committee  which  ensures  that  the  Commission  utilises  the  best  available 
<br/></span><span>scientific  information  to  develop  appropriate  CMMs  in  order  to  allow  for  a  long-term 
<br/>sustainability of the highly migratory fish stocks in the convention area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Technical  Compliance  Committee  (TCC)  is  the  enforcement  committee  which  reviews 
<br/>members adherence to the Commission’s decisions and compliance to the CMMs that are 
<br/>developed therein. This is often done in closed sessions with members only in the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliberations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Northern Committee which provides recommendations to the Commission on species 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>found  20  degrees  North  of  the  convention  area.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  not  all 
<br/>members of the Commission are represented at the Northern Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Finance and Administrative Committee is the Committee that deliberates and advises the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission on matters related to its budget, finances and administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission’s  decision-making  processes  are  usually  made  by 
<br/>consensus.  Where  voting  will  be  needed,  the  Convention  also  provides  a  two  chambered  voting 
<br/>mechanism, with member countries of the Pacific Islands Foreign Fisheries Agency (FFA) forming 
<br/>one chamber and the non-FFA membership countries forming the second chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  further  to  this,  Fiji  has  access  to  three  funding  mechanisms  under  the 
<br/>Commission,  allowing  it  and  other  developing  States  and  participating  Territories  to  meet  their 
<br/>obligation under the Commission, and they are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Special Requirements Fund; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Chinese Taipei Trust Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Japanese Trust Fund; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  Commission  member,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  ensures  that  it  consistently  meets  its 
<br/>obligations  under  treaties  and  other  legally  binding  arrangements  regarding  the  harvesting  and 
<br/>managing of highly migratory fish stocks in the Commission’s convention area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  highlight  that  under  Article  30  of  the 
<br/>Convention text, there is recognition of the special requirements of developing  States, an element 
<br/>that  Fiji  sees  to  in  the  development  of  the  Commission’s  conservation  management  measures. 
<br/>Moreso,  Fiji  remains  vigilant  on  the  application  of  these  elements,  so  as  not  to  affect  Fiji’s 
<br/>sovereignty and sovereign rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is the only longline fishing industry in the Pacific Island Countries with 
<br/>a  fully  domesticated  longline  fleet.  To  ensure  the  protection,  sustainable  management  and 
<br/>development  of  our  domestic  longline  fishery,  the  Ministry  prioritises  the  needs  of  our  domestic 
<br/>fishing industry, to ensure its long-term viability as a thriving sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has obligations under the Convention and includes but is not limited to 
<br/>the  implementation  of  the  zone-based  management,  the  adoption  of  the  target  reference  points, 
<br/>maintaining rights in fish stocks, developing robust harvest strategies and addressing climate change 
<br/>impacts on tuna fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to the above and to maintain and protect our interests, and reinforce 
<br/>our support to the region, Fiji takes a proactive stance in chairmanship to the following technical 
<br/>working groups in the Commission and they are the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission 
<br/></span><span>(WCPFC) and the Intersessional Working Group on South Pacific Albacore Tuna.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Southern  Albacore  Tuna  species  primarily  dominates  Fiji’s  tuna  catch  within  our 
<br/>Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Hence, the need for a scientifically based, regionally acceptable 
<br/>catch  rate  and  an  adoption  of  a  target  reference  point  that  provides  the  best  vulnerable  biomass 
<br/>outcome for the long-term viability and sustainability of the species.

<div><span>On  the  United  Nations  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  Port  State  Measures  Technical 
<br/>Working Group, Fiji is combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing within our EEZ and 
<br/>the  high  seas,  much  like  the  Commission’s  membership  and  as  such,  it  is  leading  the  Port  State 
<br/>Measures Agreement (PSMA) discussions in the region to address this phenomena. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  tuna  fisheries  is  important  to  the  Pacific  Island  countries  as  it 
<br/>provides economic benefits and food security, the 21</span><span>st</span><span> WCPFC Meeting was attended by Fisheries 
<br/>Ministers  from  Palau,  Niue,  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  and  Marshall  Islands.  Also  included  in  the 
<br/>participation of the Meeting was the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, which clearly demonstrates, Sir, the 
<br/>importance of the tuna fishery in their respective island countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  tuna  stock  are  highly  migratory,  we  have  a  shared  responsibility  to  manage  it 
<br/>sustainably. Meeting with fellow Fisheries Ministers underscores our leadership roles in managing 
<br/>and conserving the tuna fish stocks in our Pacific Ocean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji, along with the FFA membership in the WCPFC, reinforces the concept

<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>membership’s commitment to developing robust harvest strategies that will build resilience in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>light of ecosystem changes by climate change;

<div><span>review of the regional transshipment measure that is poised to strengthen the regulation of this 
<br/>activity in the high seas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the subject arising out of the WCPFC meeting agenda, Fiji 
<br/>continues to seize this and other like opportunities to foster and strengthen our relations with other 
<br/>Pacific Island countries, fishing nations and fishing stakeholders to collaborate and share knowledge, 
<br/>resources and best practices to address critical issues such as the impacts of  overfishing, the IUU 
<br/>phenomena and climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  will  continue  to  support  the  region  in  ensuring  that  sustainable 
<br/>management  of  these  highly  migratory  resources  and  their  associated  management  decisions  are 
<br/>based on the best scientific information available and the utilisation of the precautionary approach 
<br/>where this has been developed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  will  also  continue  to  ensure  that  the  elements  of  Article  30  of  the 
<br/>Convention  is  reinforced  in  allowing  developing  States  and  Territories  and  even  platform  on 
<br/>developing  and  implementing  the  conservation  management  measures,  whilst  maintaining  our 
<br/>sovereignty and sovereign rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once  again,  I would like to  reiterate our sincere appreciation to  Cabinet 
<br/>support and decision to ensure the facilitation of hosting the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Western Central Pacific Fisheries 
<br/>Commission  Meeting  here  in  Fiji,  and  look  forward  to  providing  an  outcome  document  once  the 
<br/>meeting processes have concluded. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu </span><span>and thank you for your attention.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for the detailed brief that she has given on Western Central Pacific 
<br/>Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and its role. I do not want to reiterate the detailed explanation that 
<br/>she has already made, which basically covers the responsibility of WCPFC and the technical areas 
<br/>that they are responsible for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to make some general observations on the importance of WCPFC within the 
<br/>Pacific region, and Fiji has always been considered as the powerhouse as it leads the South Pacific 
<br/>in its negotiations with big island nations in this meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The last meeting was held at Sheraton in 2015 and then in Manilla after that, and this is the 
<br/>third one that I have come across.  But I thank the Government, and I thank the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>and Forestry, for having been able to accommodate and host such a huge concentration of people 
<br/>from all over the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  benefit  of  members  who  do  not  understand  the  content  or  the 
<br/>constitution  of  the  WCPFC,  it  is  the  Pacific  Islands  that  control  the  biggest  tuna  stock,  which 
<br/>constitutes about 50 percent, and the honourable Minister has alluded to that. It is our responsibility 
<br/>as big ocean States to make sure the stock stays above normal and the resources are used for the 
<br/>benefit of the Pacific Islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  WCPFC  and  the  Pacific  Islands  have  a  role  that  they  understand  very  well.  As  the 
<br/>honourable Minister alluded to, every decision has to be on consensus, and this is the only time that 
<br/>the small island States in the Pacific can check off the big countries of Asia and Europe.  In their 
<br/>effort to take the resources within the Pacific region, it is the consensus by the Pacific Islands that 
<br/>checks them and as it is by consensus, normally the Pacific Islands led by Fiji, would not agree to 
<br/>any conditions that will badly affect the resource owners in the Pacific, in other words, that will not 
<br/>benefit the Pacific Islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In two instances, I have found that the Ministers that were present can force the bigger islands, 
<br/>especially South-East Asia, like Japan and the other islands in South-East Asia and Europe, to listen 
<br/>to  them  because  any  walkout  by  the  Pacific  Islands  will  basically  mean  that  the  decision  will  be 
<br/>nullified.  I must state here an example, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  At one time, the Japanese did not agree to 
<br/>the repatriation of the sick on board fishing vessels to be the responsibility of countries that are fishing 
<br/>in the Pacific.  Basically, the Pacific Islands stood  their ground and said, “If you do not take that 
<br/>responsibility, we will not allow you to fish in the Pacific.”  That stand influenced the Japanese to 
<br/>reach back to their capital and ask them to agree to the Pacific and that was what happened in Manila, 
<br/>Philippines.   Again, I thank the honourable Minister for highlighting the aspects that she has raised, 
<br/>and I thank you for your time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement 
<br/>this afternoon and certainly align with the sentiments she expressed with regards to Fiji’s relationship 
<br/></span><span>under Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the obligations that we have, 
<br/></span><span>and the important role that WCPFC plays in our part of the world as far as the management of the 
<br/>migratory species of tuna and looking after our  tuna fishery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  I  may  just  speak  very  quickly  on  the  hosting  of  the  event  here  in  Fiji,  I  think  Fiji  is 
<br/>showcasing its ability to host big events in Fiji.  I thank the Government for allowing and giving the 
<br/>opportunity for that hosting to be happening in Fiji and I am happy to see that this one is happening

<div><span>in Suva, pulling it all the way back here to Suva.  We had a lot of events happening on the other side 
<br/>of the island, but I think Suva is also developing its capacity to hold and host these types of events.  
<br/>It is an aspect of the nation that is now beginning to be well known as that we are able to host and 
<br/>manage these big events very well.  I hope that that will continue into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Ministry of Fisheries for the work that they do in trying to manage this tuna fishery, 
<br/>a  very  unique  one  for  albacore  that  we  have  in  Fiji  and  I  am  sure,  as  we  have  heard  from  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, WCPFC helps a lot in that regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Out of interest, honourable Koroilavesau, I think one of my top students at 
<br/>the Marine Studies in my days of teaching there was your son.  So, I think I know where knowledge 
<br/>and wisdom comes from.  Thank you.

<div><span>2024 World Vocational and Technical Educational Development Conference 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>honourable Members  of  Parliament, ladies  and gentlemen;  I  rise  to  provide  a brief to  this august 
<br/>House on my recent Ministerial engagement in the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education 
<br/>Development Conference in Tianjin, China.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the above visit, Fiji had been engaged in multilateral meetings with the Education 
<br/>Ministers from more than 100 countries around the world.  As part of the visit, the Fijian delegation 
<br/>visited  Luban  Workshop  Research  and  Promotion  Centre  to  observe  the  technical  and  vocational 
<br/>programmes carried out at the Centre, as a follow up to the honourable Prime Minister's earlier visit 
<br/>to China. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People's Republic of China’s honourable Minister for Education had 
<br/>extended  an  invitation  for  Fiji  to  be  part  of  the 2024  World  Vocational  and  Technical  Education 
<br/>Development Conference which was held from 20</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2024 to 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2024.  The 
<br/>entire cost of the visit was borne by the Chinese Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of Parliament, the Conference is held every two years, 
<br/>the  last  being  in  2022,  whilst  the  next  Conference  will  be  held  in  2026  where  each  participating 
<br/>country will be required to present on the achievements relating to their TVET systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian delegation had the opportunity to have a bilateral meeting with 
<br/>the  Minister  for  Education,  honourable  Huai  Jinpeng,  to  discuss  the  possibility  of  developing  a 
<br/>communal-based programme for capacity building which is to be piloted in the Rewa Province.  The 
<br/>programme will feature the utilisation of the Luban Model, which would be further explored through 
<br/>bilateral meetings with the Ambassador to China, Mr. Robert Lee, and the Minister for Education for 
<br/>the  People's  Republic  of  China.  The  discussions  focussed  on  the  student  and  teacher  exchange 
<br/>programme, cultural exchanges, TVET teaching training, sharing of resources and the review and 
<br/>development  of  TVET  programmes  to  include  entrepreneurial  skills  for  primary  and  secondary 
<br/>schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Fiji's  High  Commission  in 
<br/>China, the Fijian Ministerial Delegation was privileged to visit the Luban Workshop and Promotion 
<br/>Centre and were met with senior staff led by Vice Dean of Luban Light Industry Vocational Technical 
<br/>College, Professor Li Yunmei.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Centre is an international cooperative project that focuses in cultivating technical skills 
<br/>and  engineering  practice  in  a  modern  apprentice’s  workplace,  making  it  a  distinguished 
<br/>representation  of  Chinese  Vocational  Education.    The  teaching  model  in  Luban  is  based  on 
<br/>Engineering, Practice Innovation and Project (EPIP) that had shaped the vocational education system 
<br/>in  China  through  students  and  teacher  training  and  has  expanded  its  partnership  to  more  than  30 
<br/>countries through vocational and higher education training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the key outcomes of the discussions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, held in Luban were:

<div><span>fostering and enhancing of bilateral relations between the two countries through vocational 
<br/>training in areas of need to Fiji. 
<br/>the  possibility  of  exploring  scholarships  for  Fijian  students  who  wish  to  further  their 
<br/>education through high quality vocational training at the Tianjin Luban Workshop. 
<br/>both  the  parties  agreed  to  consider  engaging  on  teachers  upskilling  training  programme 
<br/>currently employed at the Luban Workshop and introduce the advanced teaching models and 
<br/>high-quality equipment to our vocational training. 
<br/>options  for  online  training  for  both  teachers  and  students  have  been  explored  with  the 
<br/>possibility of utilising the Ministry of Education's digital and e-learning platform. 
<br/>the possibility for craftsmen’s skills training at village level was also explored. The concept 
<br/>would provide villagers with entrepreneurial skills that could be tailor-made into the Fijian 
<br/>village enterprising context.  It is an approach to develop communities and provide a mean 
<br/>to eradicate poverty through economic empowerment at village level. 
<br/>through the scholarship awards, both ethnic groups will be encouraged to understand each 
<br/>other's culture through the cultural exchange programme. The exchange scheme will help 
<br/>break down stereotypes and helps in building bridges of friendship  and respect  for other 
<br/>cultures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to inform Parliament that the Luban Workshop have expanded 
<br/>outside of China to more than 33 countries, providing internationally certified training, and Fiji would 
<br/>be the 34</span><span>th</span><span> partnering country, and the first partnering country, and the first in the Pacific to partner 
<br/>with, through the development of technical and vocational training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, meetings between the participating Education Ministers agreed that each 
<br/>participating country conduct a SWOT analysis of its TVET system. On this note, the Ministry of 
<br/>Education through the Technical Vocational Education Training Unit submitted a proposal to China 
<br/>outlining  the  specific  support,  areas  needed  and  how  both  countries  can  work  in  collaboration  to 
<br/></span><span>enhance Fiji's TVET system before the next 2026 Conference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The exercise would include visits to our national TVET training providers and industries to 
<br/>assess the strengths, weaknesses and plans which will assist in the development of a clear pathway, 
<br/>review and curricula mapping and prioritising of Fiji's TVET needs.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Sir, the TVET report would  encompass recommendations, an implementation,  plan and  a 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation mechanism which focuses on the National TVET Policy. Fiji will assist 
<br/>the People's Republic of China’s development of an implementation plan and monitoring mechanism 
<br/></span><span>for TVET Systems in participating countries as part of the Tianjin Consensus before the next World 
<br/></span><span>Conference.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key takeaways on Curriculum Review from the 2024 Tianjin

<div><span>Integration of Entrepreneurial Skills Training at Primary Level 
<br/>A team consisting of Officials from the Ministry of Education’s TVET and Curriculum 
<br/>Unit will develop a plan to pilot and implement the revised Integrated Entrepreneurial 
<br/>Education  Curriculum  for  Primary  Education  by  2025.    By  incorporating  creativity, 
<br/>problem-solving, basic financial literacy, collaboration and social responsibility into the 
<br/>classroom, the children can begin to develop skills at the early age that will benefit them 
<br/>in many areas of life. These entrepreneurial skills are not just for future business owners, 
<br/>they  are  also  valuable  for  personal  development,  leadership  and  understanding  the 
<br/>world around them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Introduction of TVET Programmes at ECE and Primary Level 
<br/>The team will explore the integration of TVET programmes into the Early Childhood 
<br/>Education (ECE) and primary curricula in 2025.  Integrating TVET programmes into 
<br/>ECE  and  primary  education  requires  a  holistic  approach  that  balances  practical 
<br/>vocational  skills  with  academic learning.    It  also focuses on  enhancing  capability of 
<br/>both, educators and students, through professional development, curriculum integration 
<br/>and community involvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)  Review of Education Act and National Curriculum Framework (NCF)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  team  consisting  of  senior  officers  from  the  Ministry  of  Education  will  develop  a 
<br/>proposal  to  be  considered  during  the  review  of  the  Education  Act  and  the  National 
<br/>Curriculum Framework.  The review will include the integration of Global Citizenship 
<br/>Education  (GCED)  and  Education  for  Sustainable  Development  (ESD)  goals  and 
<br/>principles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International Visits for TVET and Education System Improvement 
<br/>The  Ministry  of  Education  will  identify  relevant  officers  to  study  the  TVET  and 
<br/>education  systems  in  countries  like  South  Korea,  Japan,  Singapore,  China,  Finland, 
<br/>New  Zealand  and  Australia,  between  the  period  2025  and  2026.    Upon  their  return, 
<br/>these officers will develop discussion papers with recommendations for improving Fiji's 
<br/>TVET and education systems through pilot programmes starting in 2027. Their findings 
<br/>will inform the revision of proposals and discussion papers for implementation by 2028.  
<br/>The Ministry of Education’s Training Unit will develop a proposal detailing the visits, 
<br/>their findings and suggestions for adopting best practices from these countries and will 
<br/>coordinate with the hosting countries on the purpose of their visit.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I  now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial 
<br/>Statement  on  the  2024  World  Vocational  and  Technical  Education  Development  Conference  in 
<br/>Tianjin, China, which obviously is addressing this problem which is a global one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister talked about various things that he has learnt, then 
<br/>he talked about the need for a SWOT.  I will give my short analysis of what the weaknesses and the 
<br/></span><span>threats are of the system that we have in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our system in Fiji, coupled with a massive migration of skills that we have, 
<br/>means we have severe skills shortage that have been exacerbated over the past two years to three 
<br/>years.  It has been severely exacerbated, which is going to have a strong impact on our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fundamental problem is because we do not have a national skills development plan.  In 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2338 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this country, if you look at all the assessments, they are all talking about supply.  This institute is 
<br/>supplying that, this institute is supplying that, but there is no good data on demand.  If you want to 
<br/>be able to produce people for the sector, you will need to understand what the sector wants.  This is 
<br/>the big problem about this TVET.  There is that lack of information demand and this is not easy to 
<br/>do, I admit.    It  is  not  easy to  get  a firm  grip on demand, on what  is  needed, because sometimes, 
<br/>demand is not very easy to be able to get.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  we  have  a  good  system  that  is  established  in  Fiji.    We  have  established  a  National 
<br/>Qualifications  Framework.  We  have  the  Higher  Education  Commission,  under  that,  they  are 
<br/>supposed  to  establish  national  qualifications  based  on  the  industrial  demands  of  each  particular 
<br/>sector.  But the link between this setup (infrastructure), there is a setup here and getting the demand 
<br/>data has been lacking.  This is the big problem that we have.  How do we know that this is happening?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that 70 percent of the workers that we need in this country are TVET workers, but 
<br/>more  than  70  percent  to  80  percent  of  our  funding  goes  to  non-TVET  workers.    This  is  a  huge 
<br/>imbalance.  So, there is an imbalance - what we know the problem to be and where we are putting 
<br/>money, that is a major imbalance.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  In order to meet 
<br/>the demand, you will need to understand the demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the setup in place, but it is not working well.  Without 
<br/>that plan, without getting the demand, we will be just talking about supply and conceiving of things 
<br/>that need to be done, and you do not follow it through.  This is the problem that you find throughout 
<br/>this particular system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TVET is different from education. The purpose of education is to increase 
<br/>someone’s ability to understand something.  Sir, TVET is about jobs.  Jobs means it must be directly 
<br/>related to what the people who are going to employ them need.  This is where the biggest weakness 
<br/>we have.  Doing this sort of labour market analysis is not cheap.  It is something that we have to 
<br/>invest in, systems and structures are going to take time, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Finance will know.  It is not easy to be able to do that, but it is something that we 
<br/>need to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, demand is frequent because it changes.  Around the world 
<br/>now, there is a focus on digitalisation industry.  In all these things, everything is digital, everything 
<br/>is to be changing fast.  One of the problems that we have now, we identify demand, we design a 
<br/>programme, we put in the output for that programme, and by the time people graduate, it is too late, 
<br/>things have already changed.  So, the way in which we structure courses has to change, it has to be 
<br/>short courses, it has to be continual learning or sometimes delay the specialisation in training and do 
<br/>the specialisation just before people are about to enter the job market so that the specialisation meets 
<br/>the exact need in the market at that point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go and learn, if we have gone on about all the things that 
<br/>are happening around the world, if you do not address this fundamental challenge of understanding 
<br/>demand, and then tailor-make the programmes that even if the demands change and they evolve, the 
<br/>product that you get will meet the requirement of the market at that particular point in time.  I have 
<br/></span><span>made  two  suggestions  -  lifelong  learning,  short  courses,  modular  types  of  packages,  micro 
<br/></span><span>qualifications, all these things coupled together.  I think it is already happening to some degree.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Polytech, whoever it is, is immaterial, Fiji National University, anyone that can deliver the 
<br/>job because one of the fundamental problems that we have, one of the mistakes that the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education said, the staff from the Ministry of Education are going to look at TVET.  
<br/>Wrong approach!  You need to have the right people with the right lens.

<div><span>People from the Ministry of Education look at it from an education lens.  That is how they 
<br/>have been trained.  Academics look at things from an academic lens.  That is how they have been 
<br/>trained. People need to look at these things from a TVET lens. People that have gone through these 
<br/>ways of thinking and training, their ways of looking at things are very different. You need to use the 
<br/>right sort of person. I talk about this passionately because it is something close to my heart.  And the 
<br/>things that I am talking about here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are not easy to address, and I agree.  However, 
<br/>I believe we have the structure that is there.

<br/>made by the honourable Minister for Education, updating this august House on his recent Ministerial 
<br/>Engagement  at  the 2024 World  Vocational and  Technical Education Development  Conference in 
<br/>Tianjin, China.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at  this juncture,  I thank the honourable Minister for briefing this august 
<br/>House on what had transpired during the conference which is a major event for vocational education, 
<br/>characterised by high standards, significant exchange and fruitful outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Minister,  the  theme  of  the  2024  World 
<br/>Vocational  and  Technical  Education  Development  Conference  was,  “Innovation  Empowers  the 
<br/>Future,  Skills  Shapes  Lives,”  which  aimed  at  advancing  vocational  education  as  a  driver  of 
<br/>innovation and sustainable development worldwide. The event was meant as a catalyst for change, 
<br/>marked by openness and inclusivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to move with times, and with such conferences, it would enhance 
<br/>and benefit our education sector, and I concurred with honourable Huai Jinpeng, China’s Minister 
<br/>for Education, when he stated that vocational education should align with the trends of the times, 
<br/>uphold  the  essence  of  education  and  preserve  its  unique  characteristics.  It  should  anchor  its 
<br/>innovative 
<br/>development  goals  amid  evolving  opportunities  and  challenges,  striving  for 
<br/>breakthroughs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) was established in 
<br/>Fiji in 2017 through the Higher Education Act and it is acknowledged as a cornerstone of educational 
<br/>reform and supporting sustainable development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  (TVET)  is  a  type  of 
<br/>education and training that focusses on providing students with practical skills and knowledge for a 
<br/></span><span>specific trade or vocation.  It is often considered an alternative to traditional academic routes, such 
<br/></span><span>as university or college, and is designed to prepare students for a specific career or occupation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I commend the Ministry of Youth and Sports for the 
<br/>work  that  they  do  with  regards  to  youth  development  and  providing  second  chance  programmes 
<br/>throughout  its  five  training  centres  in  the  four  Divisions,  targeted  at  disadvantaged  youths,  who 
<br/>cannot continue in the formal education system.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  commend  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  plans  and  intentions  to 
<br/>improve  the  standard  of  living  for  the  iTaukei  communities  by  lowering  dropout  rates  and 
<br/>unemployment through prioritising TVET, so that it can help develop iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>students to be resilient 
<br/>and excel academically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, vocational and technical education should not only be regarded as providing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>second chances to our youth who cannot continue in the formal education system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, stated by Ellen G. White, all youth need to be taught that life means earnest 
<br/>work,  responsibility  and  caretaking.  They  need  a  training  that  will  make  them  practical  men  and 
<br/>women who can cope with emergencies. They should be taught the discipline of systematic, well-
<br/>regulated labour is essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes of life, but as an aid to 
<br/>all-around development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, she further stated that schools should be established, that in addition to the 
<br/>highest mental and moral culture, shall provide the best possible facilities for physical development 
<br/>and industrial training. Instructions should be given in agriculture, manufactures, covering as many 
<br/>as possible of the most useful trade, also in household economy, healthy cookery, sewing, hygienic 
<br/>dressmaking, the treatment of the sick and kindred lines, gardens, workshops and treatment rooms 
<br/>should be provided, and the work in every line should be under the direction of skilled instructors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, TVET is important as it will provide students with skills and 
<br/>knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen career, and to help address any skills gaps in the job 
<br/>market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this type of education and training can be an excellent choice for individuals 
<br/>who are looking for a more hands-on practical approach to learning, and who want to get started in a 
<br/>specific career as quickly as possible.
