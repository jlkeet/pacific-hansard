<div><span>New Town Developments in Nabouwalu and Keiyasi 
<br/>(Question No. 276/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the status of the work undertaken by the Ministry on the new town developments in 
<br/>Nabouwalu and Keiyasi? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question asked by the 
<br/>honourable Member this afternoon, that is, to provide an update on the work that currently is being 
<br/>undertaken in those two centres - one at Nabouwalu and the other at Keiyasi in Navosa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the development of the two project sites is part of the Ministry’s as well as 
<br/>this  Government's  plan  -  Urban  Action  Plan  to  identify  some  of  the  growth  centres  around  the 
<br/>country. The Ministry’s objective is to come up with a Pro-active Plan and also develop some of 
<br/>these centres into fully developed and fully fledged townships in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nabouwalu New Town is a landmark project for the Province of Bua. I 
<br/>am certain that the people of Cakaunitabua in the Province of Bua as well as neighbouring areas are 
<br/>looking  forward  for  the  completion  of  this  development.    It  is  specifically  designed  to  transform 
<br/>Nabouwalu  into  a  vibrant,  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  centre  that  will  serve  as  a  hub  for 
<br/>economic growth and activity innovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Government recognises the importance of developing these new townships 
<br/>in  rural  areas  to  diversify  the  economy  and  improve  the  standard  of  living  for  residents.  These 
<br/>initiatives aim to uplift these regions by creating employment opportunities and stimulating economic 
<br/>growth in these satellite towns, thereby enhancing and improving the quality of life for its residents.  
<br/>And  central  to  this  is  the  development  of  the  Nabouwalu  Passenger  Terminal  which  is  a  critical 
<br/>facility that will enhance connectivity and also boost trade and create more comfortable experience 
<br/>for the public that commute through the Nabouwalu Terminal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently 50 percent of the terminal construction is completed, and we are on track to deliver 
<br/>this facility by March 2025. This facility will provide very basic amenities, including 150 seating 
<br/>spaces for passengers, some kiosks, operational offices for agencies and recreation spaces ensuring 
<br/>convenience and comfort for all users. The total project is around $2 million of which $915,000 has 
<br/>been paid out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there will also be offices established in the Nabouwalu Passenger Terminal for 
<br/>essential  services,  including  Biosecurity  Authority  of  Fiji  (BAF),  Maritime  Safety  Authority, 
<br/>ticketing booths for boats operating companies and upgrading of both companies, kiosks, as well as 
<br/>coffee shops. There will also be parking spaces for cars and buses embarking from the boat to avoid 
<br/>waiting at the jetty and also some playing spaces for children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also to maintain law and order in the town centre, there will also be a police 
<br/>post  for  the  Fiji  Police  Force  within  the  building.    We  are  also  in  the  process  of  advertising  and 
<br/>obtaining a foreshore lease.  Preparation with the Ministry of Lands to secure that area from storm 
<br/>surges with  coastal  protection structures  with  an  allocated budget  of $500,000 for the 2024-2025 
<br/>financial year.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  parallel  to  this  development,  the  town  subdivision  development  of 
<br/>approximately 5.5 hectares is progressing with 23 commercial lots, four civic lots and four industrial 
<br/>lots planned to support businesses and essential services.  The project cost is around $8.9 million, out 
<br/>of which $3.2 million has been paid up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase  1  focuses  on  establishing  several  commercial  lots  along  the  Nabouwalu  Highway, 
<br/>which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.  To facilitate this development, the Ministry 
<br/>has allocated $500,000 in its annual programme for the current fiscal year to continue essential civil 
<br/>works on the site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  ensure  that  Nabouwalu  becomes  a  model  for  sustainability,  we  are 
<br/>mandating the use of solar panels and water harvesting systems and other green infrastructure in the 
<br/>new  development.    Only  some  challenges,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  such  as  land  leases  and  creating 
<br/>diversions that are yet to be finalised.  They are actively engaging with stakeholders, including the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands, iTaukei Land Trust Board, and consultants to resolve them swiftly and ensure 
<br/>steady progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Keiyasi  new  town  development  in  the  Sigatoka  Valley  is  another 
<br/>transformative project covering 9.4 hectares.  This development will provide essential services and 
<br/>infrastructure for the people of Keiyasi and the province of Navosa, as well as all the surrounding 
<br/>communities.    Estimated  civil  works  for  the  project  is  $10.8  million.    The  project  includes  27 
<br/>commercial lots, three open spaces, reserves, a market, bus station, service station and a space for 
<br/>National  Fire  Authority,  as  well  as  industrial  sites,  to  meet  and  support  the  needed  services  and 
<br/>residents alike. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of civil works, Mr. Speaker, Sir, began earlier this year, and we aim to complete 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this by 2026, focussing on six commercial sites, open spaces and a service station.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support the town, improvements to the town, improvements to  Valley Road, including 
<br/>road widening, footpaths are underway, ensuring safe and efficient access for residents and visitors.  
<br/>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are collaborating with Water Authority of Fiji to upgrade the water 
<br/>supply system, meeting the needs of this growing community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of  the very interesting feature about the development of Keiyasi, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  is 
<br/>this place is becoming an economic centre for people around the area and every Thursday, we have 
<br/>been told that we have been reliably advised that there is a sop in Keiyasi at the moment where people 
<br/>always converge and do their trading on that particular day and we see the potential of growing that 
<br/>and also developing Keiyasi to become a growth centre and later will become a satellite town where 
<br/>we will be able to stimulate economic activities within the area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  project  demonstrates  our  Coalition  Government’s  vision  to  bring 
<br/>growth  and  development  to  all  regions  in  Fiji.    Not  only  are  these  two  sites,  but  the  team  also 
<br/>identified some other possible sites within the country to ensure that we are able to produce these 
<br/>growth centres into a fully fully-fledged township in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With careful planning and sustainable practices.  We are not just building towns, it is building 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hope, opportunity and pride for future generations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Insured Boxers - Boxing Commission of Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 277/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2353 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports inform Parliament whether the 
<br/>Boxing Commission of Fiji failed to ensure that boxers were insured for the bouts held at 
<br/>King Charles Park on 26</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his 
<br/>question. The question, Sir, is related to the terrible incident that happened at Nadi’s King Charles 
<br/>Park concerning the late Mr. Heida. I wish to update Parliament that the Board of Inquiry have not 
<br/>completed  their  investigations.  They  are  still  left  with  interviews  to  be  done  with  people  from 
<br/>overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the investigation is completed, the report will be tabled for the public. 
<br/>Further to that, I will also be making a ministerial statement at the appropriate time. Therefore, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I am asking that the oral question be ruled out of order for the time being. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir;  Fiji has just lost a young 
<br/>talented professional boxer, Heida, also known as Nathan Singh. He was a champion boxer in Fiji, 
<br/>regarded as Fiji’s most promising boxers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nathan Singh could have been alive today if the boxing event on 26</span><span>th</span><span> October at King Charles 
<br/>Park was sanctioned properly. One of the most important requirements for any boxing event is the 
<br/>availability of an ambulance and a qualified doctor at the venue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Boxing Commission of Fiji should have ensured that all necessary… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise on a Point of Order, Standing Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>74(1) which states, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any member may only raise a point of order if –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Yes, one moment, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA. – The practice is when you stand up to raise a question, you 
<br/>stand up to raise that question, you do not go into a lengthy diatribe and take political advantage of 
<br/>what the honourable Minister is doing.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has just mentioned that there is a Board of Inquiry, and he is asking 
<br/>for us to  wait for the Board of  Inquiry. Stop  making a political  statement! Wait for the Board of 
<br/>Inquiry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Order, order! Thank you, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Chand, can you specifically ask the question directed to the Minister in respect 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of its a follow up question to your question that is being tabled?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2354 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  is,  Boxing  Commission  of  Fiji  should 
<br/>have ensured that all necessary requirements were met by the promoter before giving approval for 
<br/>the boxing event. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-Honourable Member, please, follow what I have just directed you to do and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is ask the question and not make a statement.  They are totally different. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Thank  you,  Sir.    What  necessary  steps  will  the  Ministry  take  so  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thorough investigation is carried out and those responsible are taken to task? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already mentioned that the Board of Inquiry 
<br/>is still doing their investigation and we should be respecting the investigation to continue and the 
<br/>report will be tabled publicly.  At the same time, since he has mentioned it, I attended the farewell 
<br/>service for the deceased.  I do not know whether you attended, honourable Member, but I was there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect of what this young lad has done to boxing in Fiji and we should respect what is 
<br/>being done at the moment until we get to the bottom of the problems that happened that night.  Until 
<br/>then, I am not in a position to divulge any information right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Minister is mistaken, thinking 
<br/>that if something is under investigation, according to the Standing Order, it should not be answered.  
<br/>That is wrong.  It is only if something is before the courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, can the honourable Minister confirm, if true, that this particular promoter that 
<br/>promoted this fight was actually  stopped from  promoting or had his licence withdrawn under the 
<br/>Chairmanship of the former Chairperson, Mr. Subhas Apna, and whether this has now returned…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate, let me clear your issue and that is, you are asking questions that will 
<br/>invariably be dealt with by the Board of Inquiry.  The Commission, may I remind you is, in fact, a 
<br/>couch in a legal frame that, in fact, would stop any questions being asked of Parliament from the 
<br/>proceedings until it is completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  we  have  exhausted  the  supplementary  questions  in  respect  of  honourable  Chand’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.  We will now move on the next question for today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014  
<br/>(Question No. 278/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the status of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>review of the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regarding the review of the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by stating that there have been unprecedented changes 
<br/>made  to  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loans  Service  Act  2014  since  2023,  and  the  Tertiary 
<br/>Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014 has been progressively amended over the last two years 
<br/>through the Parliamentary process with the aim to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2355 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthen this legislation and governance structure;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>provide clarity and additional powers to administer scholarship investments and  
<br/>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  implementation  of  these  legislative  amendments  was  made  possible  through  direct 
<br/>leadership of the Board and Management of the TSLS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, I will take this time to share a few of some of the amendments that was made. First, 
<br/>is the write-off of students’ loan amounting to $650 million.  That cancellation of the loan repayment 
<br/>of student debts has led to the relief of about 53,725 students that were indebted with this loan debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Hardship Assistance Scheme for students who were studying 
<br/>privately and are eligible to be sponsored, so they are now studying under TSLS and currently, there 
<br/>are about 348 students in their respective cadre or studies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third, is the Micro Qualification Scheme Assistance that is paid to students regarding those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are studying TVET courses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The areas that are mostly covered during the review is the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delegation to CEO and instruments of delegation;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>functions of the Service; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>powers of the Service; 
<br/>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>meeting process; 
<br/>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(f)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(g)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(h)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disclosure of interest; 
<br/>student's employment record for scholarship information; 
<br/>report on ‘at risk’ students; and  
<br/>additional criteria on new programmes for funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  provisions  in  the  Act  are  serving  the  purpose  of  the  Government’s 
<br/>ambitions, then review needs to be reconsidered.  There are provisions which need to be reviewed 
<br/>for amendments, and the same shall be carried out through the usual legislative process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, stipulates the powers of the Minister for Education and 
<br/>also the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the appointment of the 
<br/>Board, while the overseeing of the regulations of all scholarship schemes, study loans and grants, 
<br/>and appointment of CEO through the Board are vested with the Minister for Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  amendments  also  to  the  Service  this  year.    The  Coalition  Government  has 
<br/>allowed the repeaters on merit-based local scheme for degrees and vocational studies, the MBBS and 
<br/>pilot programmes. However, to be fair for the second attempt, the students need to meet higher cut 
<br/>off marks than the first attempt test. For example, the cut off marks for MBBS for first attempters is 
<br/>350 out of 400 and for repeaters is 365.  For pilot, it is 335 for repeaters and 310 out of 400 in Year 
<br/>13 for first attempt, and compulsory pass in Fiji Airways psychometric and aptitude assessments. 
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.R.  VOCEA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  supplementary  question  on  the  academic 
<br/></span><span>achievements for students in rural areas and those in urban areas.  Usually, those in urban areas are 
<br/></span><span>high achievers academically than those in rural areas.  Will the review take into consideration the 
<br/>range of marks or give some preference to students in rural areas so that they can also come up with 
<br/>the same privilege as those in the urban areas?  That is my supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the very important question.  
<br/>Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken note of the concerns that have been raised regarding marked 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2356 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>differences in the rural and maritime areas, and this is something that we will discuss also with the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance, considering the financial implications to expand the criteria for entry into the 
<br/>TSLS scholarship to also take into account those in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister, we know 
<br/>that the TELS under the previous Government had its conditions as well. One of the problems that 
<br/>most  of  our  youths  are  facing  now  is,  when  they  intend  to  travel  abroad,  they  are  held  back  at 
<br/>Immigration in Nadi. What is the process that they need to go through and what is your advice to 
<br/>most of them, as they may be listening as well, because this is a common issue that they keep referring 
<br/>to us Members of Parliament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendments that were undertaken during 
<br/>the Budget session that needed the operations of the student employment record and travel clearance 
<br/>and bond that used to be with Fiji Revenue &amp; Custom Services (FRCS) have now been transferred 
<br/>to TSLS and  they have an office in Nadi where they can have a process to clear their names before 
<br/>they travel abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Projections and Expectations for Global Tourism   
<br/>(Question No. 279/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  projection  and  expectations  for  Global 
<br/>Tourism as articulated by the World Travel and Tourism Council?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tunabuna for the question. 
<br/>As we all know, the Travel and Tourism Sector is growing.  It is growing everyday, every year and 
<br/>every decade. The recent World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the Global Leaders Dialogue, 
<br/>held  in  Perth  in  September,  provided  a  crucial  platform  for  global  leaders  to  engage  in  strategic 
<br/>discussions on the future of tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WTTC’s Annual Global Summit is one of the most influential international events. The 
<br/>2024  Summit  brought  over  800  participants  from  over  25  countries  representing  both  public  and 
<br/>private sector, including Heads of States, government ministers, Chairs, chief executives and global 
<br/>media.  It  was  headlined  by  the  68</span><span>th</span><span>  United  States  Secretary  of  State,  John  Kerry,  and 
<br/>Environmentalist, Robert Irwin. It was quite a high-profile Summit.  Some of the top profile speakers 
<br/>came from TripAdvisor, Trip.com, American Express and Intrepid Travel, who shared reliable ideas 
<br/>in the Summit.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, projections for WTTC estimates that the travel industry will account for $1 
<br/>out of every $10 spent globally in 2024.  Of course, they are using the US currency here. The sector's 
<br/>contribution to global GDP will increase to 12.1 percent on year to a record US$11.1 trillion in 2024. 
<br/>This means travel is responsible for 10 percent of global GDP, a 7.5 percent increase from 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking ahead, 10 years from now by 2034, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sector will supercharge the 
<br/></span><span>global  economy  with  a  staggering  $16  trillion,  making  up  11.4  percent  of  the  entire  economic 
<br/>landscape. It will provide 449 million jobs, nearly 12.2 percent of the workforce. More than three 
<br/>quarters  of  countries  analysed  are  expected  to  exceed  the  high  point  of  2019,  in  terms  of  GDP 
<br/>contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a report unlocking opportunities for travel and tourism in Ocean shows that

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in 2019, the sector contributed about $192 billion to Oceania’s GDP, supporting over 2.2 million 
<br/>jobs. If we invest in infrastructure, the labour market quality and sustainability and improved visa 
<br/>facilitation, there are projections over $29 billion increase in contribution to GDP by 2034.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Oceania’s travel and tourism sector could inject an additional 
<br/>$112  billion  to  the  region  by  2034,  bringing  the  total  contribution  to  a  record-breaking  US$336 
<br/>billion. This boost could also support an extra 1.1 million jobs, raising the total employment in the 
<br/>global region, supported by travel and tourism, to 3.5 million by 2024. Now, all these, Sir, what does 
<br/>it mean for Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the Fijian tourism sector, from January to October 2024, we have 
<br/>received a record of 822,253 visitors. That is 6.5 percent higher than the same period last year. With 
<br/>180,000 more visitors over November and December this year, we will be at 1 million visitors.  Sir, 
<br/>these numbers are not always organic. Destinations around the world are investing heavily in their 
<br/>tourism sector. Connectivity is increasing, destinations are emerging, and visitor demographics are 
<br/>evolving, so we cannot take for granted Fiji’s position in the global market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, aligned with these priorities, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/>remains  committed  to  leveraging  the  principles  outlined  in  Fiji's  National  Sustainable  Tourism 
<br/>Framework. This Framework, as we all know, underscores our dedication to fostering sustainable 
<br/>practices,  advancing  infrastructure  development  and  strengthening  our  air  connectivity.  Through 
<br/>such  initiatives,  we  aim  to  amplify  Fiji’s  appeal  as  a  destination  and  paradise  environmental 
<br/>stewardship while delivering exceptional visitor experiences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this approach is not only vital for ensuring long term economic growth, but 
<br/>also  maintaining  Fiji’s  position  as  a  leader  in  sustainable  tourism  in  the  Pacific.  The  Coalition 
<br/>Government  is  resolute  in  its  vision  to  make  tourism  a  cornerstone  of  our  national  development 
<br/>agenda, creating opportunities that benefit all Fijians. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Nothing thorny, honourable Minister, do not worry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, I know that WTTC reports 
<br/>are actually important, but if you align it with the reports that come out of the World Bank, have we 
<br/>fallen behind Samoa and the Solomon Islands in terms of our growth in that particular sector?  I think 
<br/>the World Bank Report might differ with respect to the figures  that we may be getting, and I am 
<br/>actually talking about the percentage growth in estimated aviation passenger arrivals. So, it would 
<br/>seem that we are slightly below even Samoa at the moment, subject to you telling me that I am wrong.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, honourable Koya. The growth from our neighbouring 
<br/>countries are showing higher percentages, but they are from a low base.  In terms of the whole Pacific, 
<br/>50 percent of arrivals are from Fiji and the other 50 percent comes from the other countries. They 
<br/>may be showing those numbers, but from a low base.

<div><span>Commensurate Salary for Teachers with Upgraded Qualification 
<br/>(Question No. 280/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on why teachers who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have upgraded their qualifications have not received their commensurate salaries? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2358 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.  In the last financial year, the Ministry of Education has processed salary upgrades of around 
<br/>250 teachers, the total potential financial implications of around $4.1 million. Along with this, there 
<br/>were  two  critical  policy-based  exercise  completed  with  the  Civil  Service.  Firstly,  was  the  policy 
<br/>direction of the Coalition Government for the regularisation and step up of eligible office in the Civil 
<br/>Service in February 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; the honourable Minister 
<br/>is trying to duck the question. The question is rather clear. The thing is that the teachers have not 
<br/>been  paid.  They  graduated  last  year,  and  they  have  not  been  paid  because  there  was  no  budget 
<br/>allocated for this payment. Can the honourable Minister confirm whether budgetary allocation was 
<br/>made for this or not?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  I  have  replied  to  the  question  on  the  payment  of  the  salary 
<br/>upgrade, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I had said 250 teachers with the financial implication of $4.1 million. Are 
<br/>you talking about this year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I just wanted to clarify, if you look at the 2024-2025 Budget, there is 
<br/>no allocation for salary upgrade when you compare it with 2023-2024 Budget where there was an 
<br/>allocation for which you have made the payment,  and I agree. But this one here, there is no allocation 
<br/>at all. So, those teachers who graduated in December and they are still working now, no payment has 
<br/>been made to them. They have  sent the questions to us, so that we can ask you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for 
<br/>acknowledging  that  we  have  made  the  payments  for  this  financial  year.  We  have  identified  395 
<br/>teachers  who  are  eligible  for  qualification  upgrade  and  salary  realignment,  which  will  cost  an 
<br/>additional  $4.1  million,  and  we  are  currently  in  discussion  in  making  submissions  to  make  this 
<br/>payment sometimes next year.
