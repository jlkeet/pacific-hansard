<br/>Minister for Finance who have ministerial oversight over the relevant agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Justice  does  not  deal  with  Stop  Departure.   Stop  Departure  Order  (SDO)  and 
<br/>Departure Prohibition Order (DPO) terms are used interchangeably in this response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the prerogative of the CEO, Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FCRS); CEO, Fiji National 
<br/>Provident Fund (FNPF); Commissioner, Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC);

<br/>b)   making  arrangement  satisfactory  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  the
