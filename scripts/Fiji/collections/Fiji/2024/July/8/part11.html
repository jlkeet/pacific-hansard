<h3>DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Bill for an Act to appropriate a sum of Three Billion Nine Hundred and 
<br/>Fifty-Five Million, Eight Hundred and Nineteen Thousand, Four Hundred and Seventy-
<br/>Nine Dollars, for the ordinary services of Government for the year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2025, 
<br/>be read a second time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  all  look  forward  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition’s response to the Budget, so I will not add anything at this stage. Thank 
<br/>you, Mr Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Thank you.  There is no invention in the wind on your sail, honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition.  The floor is now open for debate, and we will first hear the response from 
<br/>the Shadow Minister for Finance, after which we will continue with the order of the Speakers as 
<br/>listed on the Order Paper. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call upon the Shadow Minister for Finance and Leader of the Opposition, to deliver his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response to the National Budget. The floor is yours, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery and those listening in via livestream; 
<br/></span><span>ni sa bula vinaka </span><span>and a very good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me this opportunity to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for his Budget 
<br/>Address.  I  also  thank  the  Senior  Civil  Servants  and,  indeed,  all  who  had  contributed  during  the 
<br/></span><span>Budget consultations, for their efforts and input into the Budget. Putting together a National Budget 
<br/></span><span>is no easy feat, therefore, the hard work of all those involved in its formulation must be commended. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  the  way,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  the  new  Attorney-
<br/>General, honourable Graham Leung, for his appointment, and I wish him the very best in his tenure 
<br/>in office.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1003 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  Budget  reflects  attempts  to  respond  to  public 
<br/>concerns.  By incorporating new measures alongside continued support for existing initiatives, I can 
<br/>visualise the efforts by Government to force economic growth, improve public services and enhance 
<br/>the welfare of Fijians.  But is it enough, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  This is the question that we, the citizens 
<br/>of our beloved Fiji, will ask ourselves, moving forward.  In light of the many challenges that confront 
<br/>us as a nation and as a people, I will expound on this later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The plaudits that had followed the Budget announcement on Friday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024 by the 
<br/>honourable Minister maybe premature, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I say this because more often than not, 
<br/>budgets are viewed as achievements in themselves.  They are not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  national  budgets  are  ordinary  aspirations.    They  are  estimates  of 
<br/>government’s  expenditure  and  revenue  for  a  fiscal  year.    They  are  planning  tools  that  projects 
<br/>government’s  intentions  for  an  annual  period.  What  is  important  is  how  those  intentions  and 
<br/>aspirations impact communities and citizens when delivered. This should be the ultimate aim of all 
<br/>budgets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  issues  in  the  budget  process  that  ought  to  be 
<br/>reviewed, to ensure that the intentions of the budget are fully realised.  Our Budgets, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, have always been output oriental.  I know this, having been a Civil Servant myself.  Once the 
<br/>budgetary allocated funds have been utilised, there ends the budget process.  Whatever happens to 
<br/>the  project  that  has  been  funded  through  a  budgetary  provision  after  its  delivery,  is  the  least  of 
<br/>anyone’s worries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sad  to  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  performance  of  Government  agencies  and  senior 
<br/>management within those agencies are measured by their efficiency in the utilisation of funds, which 
<br/>is the delivery of outputs, not on the impact of those outputs, which can  be measured some years 
<br/>down the line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When a farm road has been constructed through the Ministry of Agriculture’s Farm Roads 
<br/>Programme, the intention is  for farmers to  have  easy access  to  their farm,  to  services,  and to  the 
<br/>markets to enhance the production capacities of farmers and, indeed,  to raise their income levels.  
<br/>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as it is, the budget process and the work of the budget implementing 
<br/>agency terminates when the road has been constructed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when a boat and engine is delivered as part of the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural Development’s Shelf-Help Programme to support a fishing venture, the role of Government 
<br/>ceases when a boat and engine have been delivered.  This is the sad reality we have at hand.  There 
<br/>is  very  little  focus  on  the  outcome,  or  the  impact  of  the  funds  utilised  for  certain  projects  in  our 
<br/>current budgetary system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our budgetary system now needs to transition from an output to an outcome 
<br/>focus.  This  will call for strong budgetary and project  implementation  and monitoring systems at 
<br/>national level and within respective agencies.  I would like to come up with two suggestions, Sir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>That the system of monitoring utilised by the past Government through the Implementation 
<br/></span><span>Co-ordinating  Unit  (ICU),  that  was  commonly  referred  to  as  the  Monitoring  Unit,  to 
<br/>monitor both, the output and outcome of the Budget implementation at national level be 
<br/>revisited. This should be the responsibility of the National Planning Office.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, probably, you would be aware that this was in the Office of the Prime Minister a few 
<br/>years back.  Now, that we have the Ministry of Strategic Planning under the Minister for 
<br/>Finance, it would be appropriate that this role, if considered by Government, can be given  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back to the Ministry of Strategic Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The other suggestion that I want to make this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the role of 
<br/>parliamentary Committees in the oversight and scrutiny of the budget process. Parliament 
<br/>plays a very important role. As you are aware from the recent visits and, of course, with the 
<br/>Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Parliament is not only responsible for legislative work 
<br/>but  also  in  terms  of  the  allocation  of  funding  and  approval  and,  most  importantly,  the 
<br/>scrutiny  and  oversight  of  the  implementation  of  taxpayers’  funds.  Probably,  this  is 
<br/>something that is already in consideration under your leadership, Sir, and I would strongly 
<br/>recommend that this be considered seriously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  will  ensure  the  efficient  and  proper  utilisation  of  the  budget  and 
<br/>eliminate wastage of public funds. Sir, allow me to raise this point which I have noted in the current 
<br/>Budget Address and in previous budget and parliamentary addresses too. Often governments use the 
<br/>excuse  of  the  perceived  weaknesses  of  the  past  governments  to  justify  their  inability  to  deliver 
<br/>services and, of course, their promises to the people. This budget was no exception. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has got to stop - it is loathsome.  No government comes into power 
<br/>blindfolded. All governments come into power with the full appreciation of the status of existing 
<br/>governance in any particular country, and a lot of their promises to the people, especially prior to the 
<br/>election, were made with the full comprehension of these realities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget Address which we just had, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was particularly bad with a list of 
<br/>issues titled, “what we have inherited”. Issues which the honourable Minister for Finance states as 
<br/>the uncomfortable facts that they had walked into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Were they forced to walk into these issues? No, Mr. Speaker, Sir! In fact, they campaigned 
<br/>vigorously in the lead up to the General Election so that they can get into power. Now, that they are 
<br/>at the helm, they have suddenly realised that they have bitten off much more than they can chew. It 
<br/>does not work that way, unfortunately, Sir.  Can I correct the misconception, particularly about the 
<br/>economy prior to COVID-19? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji recorded its strongest period of GDP growth… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Negative growth in 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  SERUIRATU.-  …in  the  decade  leading  up  to  COVID-19,  underpinned  by  rising 
<br/>productivity and investments, improved political stability and a booming tourism sector.  Can I repeat 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because this is important for every Fijian to know?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us  talk facts  when  we deal  with  the economy.  I have stated that Fiji 
<br/>recorded  its  strongest  period  of  GDP  growth  since  achieving  Independence  1970  in  the  decade 
<br/>leading  up  to  COVID-19,  underpinned  by  rising  productivity  and  investment,  improved  political 
<br/>stability and a booming tourism sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the shocks of COVID-19 and a series of natural disasters - </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, TC</span><span> Yasa</span><span>
<br/></span><span>and </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016 have been devastating for Fiji’s economy, bringing widespread production, 
<br/>disruptions and job losses. I hope we can agree to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  increasing  frequency  of  these  weather  events,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  also  complicated 
<br/>Fiji’s economic development strategies and plans.  Fiji’s real GDP decline by 15.2 percent in 2020 
<br/>and is estimated to have contracted a further 4.0 percent in 2021, with the long-term ramifications of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1005 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy yet to be fully seen, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On fiscal policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his Budget Speech, the honourable Minister for Finance 
<br/>stated that when they came into Government, they inherited a large public debt and a chaotic fiscal 
<br/>situation.  This is nonsense, Mr. Speaker!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us refer to the data on record.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is Government data.  It talks about 
<br/>the year, way back to 1980, until present.  The revenue for each year, the expenditure, the overall 
<br/>balance, the balance as a percentage of GDP, the debt, the debt as a percentage of GDP, the debt to 
<br/>GDP ratio, and the list goes on, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prior to 2012, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our debt to GDP ratio hovered at around 50 percent.  Let me 
<br/>go back from the period 2006 to 2012.  This is debt to GDP ratio.  In 2006, 53.8 percent; in 2007, 
<br/>50.3 percent; in 2008, 51.4 percent; in 2009, 55.8 percent; in 2010, 56.2 percent; in 2011, 52.7 percent 
<br/>and in 2012, 51.6 percent.  As I have stated, debt to GDP ratio hovered around the 50 percent mark 
<br/>during that period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, between 2013 and 2019, our ratio was below 50 percent, coming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down to as low as 43 percent in 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Go through the books.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is the Ministry’s books, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Let me go through it.  I have talked about the period from 2006 to 
<br/>2012;  2013,  49.7  percent;  2014,  44.5  percent;  2015,  43  percent;  2016,  44.6  percent;  2017,  43.5 
<br/>percent; 2018, 45.8 percent; and in 2019, 49 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  also  say  on  record  that  the  period  from  2016  to  2019  was  very 
<br/>interesting.    Why?    Because  of  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>.    While  Government  kept  on  with  Government 
<br/>programmes as normal, at the same time, we were focusing on building back better - the recovery, 
<br/>and that also contributed to the gradual increase, again, post-2016.  This is 43.5 percent in 2016-
<br/>2017, then 45.8 percent, then 49 percent and then in 2019, 2020 and 2021, 62 percent, 84 percent and 
<br/>90.6 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister loves to focus on the 2021 and 2022 period, and everyone in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>world, including all Governments, have to loan in order to survive and Fiji is not an exception.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We know what happened to the tourism industry, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir.  Our GDP was badly affected, and this is why we have these figures, and these are facts, and 
<br/></span><span>everyone should know.  These are the facts, and for the honourable Minister for Finance to insinuate 
<br/>otherwise, is misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hogwash!

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I will keep this and then I will come back to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on infrastructure and social transformation, the nine years of contained debt 
<br/>to GDP ratio and consecutive economic growth, facilitated the massive investment in infrastructure 
<br/>that we were able to make.  Those were real infrastructure investments rather than maintenance, Sir, 
<br/>and  together,  with  the  support  that  we  provided  to  our  national  airline  provided  the  impetus  that 
<br/>enabled us to recover quickly from the effects of COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  slow  and  steady  growth  put  in  place  by  the  previous  Government  led  to  huge 
<br/>transformations in this country. It led to a vast explosion of infrastructural development that drove 
<br/>growth and continues to do so today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  private  sector  is  benefiting  today  from  most  of  the  infrastructure 
<br/>development  that  was  done  during  those  years.  If  we  read  the  Joint  Economic  and  Trade  Survey 
<br/>Report by Australia and New Zealand, it talks about the level of investment at that time. It was around 
<br/>almost 25 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But where is the level of investment today? Very, very low, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we need to 
<br/>create that environment through infrastructure development and that is why our CAPEX to OPEX 
<br/>ratio is so important.  I will come back to that, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  assistance  that  we  provided  to  the  vulnerable  within  our  communities 
<br/>through welfare assistance to the elderly, support to school children and women, among other things, 
<br/>which  Government  is  continuing  was  groundbreaking,  to  say  the  least.  Those  empowerment 
<br/>programmes  have  freed  the  shackles  that  bound  the  less  fortunate  in  this  country,  opening  the 
<br/>opportunities for all, and has led to where we are now, where there are more females graduating out 
<br/>of our Universities than males.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will talk about some structural vulnerabilities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to give context to my 
<br/>delivery this morning before I focus on the Budget itself.  The shocks emanating from the effects of 
<br/>climate change and global events, such as the economic slowdown and COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>have also exacerbated some of Fiji’s long standing structural vulnerabilities, including the economy 
<br/>being vulnerable to repeated climate-related shocks, its lack of sectoral diversification and sluggish 
<br/>private sector job growth, particularly among youth and women.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the later part 
<br/>of my submission, I will be talking more about this sectoral diversification which we expected more 
<br/>from the Minister to be part of his delivery. Why am I saying this, Sir, is that it is important because 
<br/>this problem needs to be addressed to prepare us well for future shocks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sectoral diversification imperative stems largely from the vulnerability 
<br/>of  Fiji’s  tourism  to  global  shocks  in  travel  demand,  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  painfully 
<br/>illustrated, as well as growing threats to its natural tourism assets from climate change. I am thankful, 
<br/>Sir, that the new framework has been launched and we congratulate the honourable Minister and 
<br/>thank the Government for that.  The painful lessons of the past should, therefore, be a guide to our 
<br/></span><span>future development planning and aspiration, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, I come to the Budget, but let me talk first about the National Development Plan (NDP). 
<br/>There has been much talk about the NDP. In an ideal scenario, the NDP should inform the budget. 
<br/>But we are now here, and there is still no sight of the NDP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Coming soon. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1007 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- How soon is soon?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I beg to question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rationale for developing a new NDP when we already 
<br/>have one in existence. To save the cost of the formulation of a brand new document, Government 
<br/>could have opted to review the current one, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Trade Policy Framework is still 
<br/>current and still utilised by the current Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, quite a new development 
<br/>plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In any case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to digress to the current Budget. I must thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Finance and Government for the ongoing concessions, including School Bus 
<br/>Fare Scheme and Back to School Grants, welfare assistance to the elderly, free water and electricity 
<br/>to low income earners and other concessions granted to the vulnerable within our communities but 
<br/>they are not new, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  These are welcome relief to most families in Fiji, and which also 
<br/>acknowledges the vision of the previous Government when putting in place these programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased investments in the education and health sectors 
<br/>are acknowledged with much appreciation.  But I know that honourable Members from this side will 
<br/>also  talk  and  raise  their  concerns  about  the  utilisation  of  the  funds.  Sir,  it  is  one  thing  to  get  the 
<br/>budget, but what is important is how those taxpayers’ funds are well utilised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants Congress, I spoke briefly about Strategic 
<br/>Pragmatism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is where the leadership of Government and the Executives 
<br/>must  work  together,  particularly  the  political  leadership  and  the  Permanent  Secretaries  and  those 
<br/>within  the  Ministries.  We  must  be  strategic  in  our  thinking,  but  we  must  be  pragmatic  in  our 
<br/>implementation.    Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  honourable  Members  from  this  side  of 
<br/>Parliament will raise their concerns about the implementation.  Funds are not utilised according to 
<br/>the purposes in which they were given in the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Vatukoula Assistance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is acknowledged and this is long overdue. They 
<br/>have suffered enough and for Government to announce the assistance, it did brings closure to their 
<br/>sufferings which have persisted for some decades, and for which a good number of them have not 
<br/>lived to see this day. I know the efforts that were taken in the previous Government to try and resolved 
<br/>this issue. It was an issue between the mining company and, of course, the striking workers, but I 
<br/>hope that this case must not be taken as a precedent for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In such cases, the responsibilities of the employer and Government must be clearly defined.  
<br/>As I have stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are thankful for the assistance, but I hope that this will not be 
<br/>taken as a precedent for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget Deficit:  On the gist of the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government should be concerned 
<br/>that our spending continues to race ahead of revenue collections. Government spending in 2024-2025 
<br/>will exceed revenue by $639 million that is equal to 4.5 percent of GDP.  Adding debt repayments 
<br/>of another $345 million means that the gross deficit will approach $1 billion or 7.0 percent of GDP. 
<br/>This is rather high and contrary to Government’s promises of bringing down Government debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, against the actual revenue of $2.7 billion in the 2022-2023 
<br/></span><span>period, and a revised revenue forecast of $3.4 billion for 2023-2024 (I know that we are coming now 
<br/>towards the end of July), the honourable Minister for Finance is projecting revenue for 2024-2025 to 
<br/>be $3.7 billion - an increase of almost $1 billion from the 2022-2023 period.  I think this is somewhat 
<br/>too optimistic, but I wish him well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Realistically, if Government is not able to reach 
<br/>its revenue forecast for 2024-2025, the shortfall will add to the Budget deficit, which will mean that 
<br/>we will be looking at a much larger budget deficit.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the assumption, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Budget deficit will be funded domestically 
<br/>largely from the savings of workers that is housed within the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), 
<br/>this will push inflation higher and create pressures on the current account of the balance of payments.  
<br/>The  inflationary  pressures  will  lead  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  (RBF)  to  lift  interest  rates,  while 
<br/>pressure on the balance of payments will deplete foreign reserves that, in turn, risks a devaluation of 
<br/>the Fiji dollar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, families in Fiji are already feeling the brunt of the rise in prices on basic 
<br/>food items, such as food and clothing.  Any further increases in prices and/or interest rates will only 
<br/>add to the pain that the public is under. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am amused that the honourable Minister for Finance, while in Opposition, 
<br/>was always keen on highlighting the nominal value of our debt.  Now, that he is in the driver’s seat, 
<br/>he has shifted, and is referring to debt as a percentage of GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Debt to GDP ratio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Oh, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The public need to know the real figures, honourable Minister.  
<br/>The reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that while the debt to GDP ratio is decreasing towards 78 percent, 
<br/>the nominal debt is at a record high of $10.9 billion from the $9 million that they inherited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me justify what I have just stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is not what you campaigned on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! No running commentaries, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- “The begging-bowl government” by Professor Biman Prasad on 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2021, stated and I quote, “Fiji is drowning in debt. By the middle of next year, when 
<br/>it is expected to reach $9 billion, every Fiji citizen will be carrying $10,000 of it”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  per-capita  allocation  was  not  included  in  your  Speech,  honourable  Minister,  you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliberately left that out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me comment on the Capital to Operating Mix.  Whilst assistance and 
<br/></span><span>concession to the public are welcomed, Government must always ensure that there is an equitable 
<br/></span><span>balance in the manner with which public funds are managed. A good example, Sir, is the Operating 
<br/>to Capital mix in the current Budget which stands at 73:27 ratio, which is 73 percent for Operating 
<br/>and 27 percent for Capital Expenditure, when the preferred mix ratio is 2:1, that is, 66.6 percent for 
<br/>Operating and 33.3 percent towards Capital Expenditure preferably, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I raise this 
<br/>because,  again,  in  his  Speech,  the  honourable  Minister  stated,  “unlike  in  the  past  when  the 
<br/>government borrowed to fund its operations with nothing much to show after the borrowed money 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1009 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was spent”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Government allocated more in terms of Capital Expenditure 
<br/>and,  of  course,  we  were  not  short  of  our  Operating  Expenditure,  and  we  did  not  borrow  for  that 
<br/>purpose but, mostly, for development purposes and that is why CAPEX is so important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government must look  at  innovative ways to reduce the bloated blatant 
<br/>Operating  Expenditure  and  increase  the  Capital  Expenditure  allocation.    Increase  in  Capital 
<br/>Expenditure  allocation  leads  to  investments,  which  should  translate  to  job  creation,  thus  creating 
<br/>employment opportunities.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  acknowledge that debt  as  a ratio of GDP  has fallen largely  due to the 
<br/>recovery of the economy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.  While public debt continues 
<br/>to increase, GDP in 2024 had recovered all the 20 percent ground that was lost at the height of the 
<br/>pandemic in 2021 from the level in 2019.  This recovery in GDP alone is responsible for the fall of 
<br/>debt as a proportion of GDP by 13 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be more specific, Mr. Speaker, Sir, debt as a share of GDP, peaked at 91.5 percent in 2021 
<br/>when GDP itself was 20 percent below the level in 2019.  By mid-2024, GDP had recovered to the 
<br/>level in 2019 that would, on its own, bring down the debt to GDP ratio to 78.5 percent, or roughly 
<br/>equal to the figure of 78 percent quoted in the Minister’s Budget Speech.  In other words, all the 
<br/>decline in debt as a share of GDP has been due to economic recovery.  The Coalition Government 
<br/>cannot take credit for this since the rebound in tourist arrivals was due to the foundations put in place 
<br/>by the previous Government.  Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government seems to have 
<br/>ditched the target of bringing debt down to 60 percent of GDP in a decade as was proposed by the 
<br/>Fiscal Review Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for far too long, our people have been inundated with Government handouts.  
<br/>The focus now should be on ‘help out’ rather than ‘hand out’, as budgetary subsidies and concessions 
<br/>will be difficult to unwind or sustain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would know that we never, during our term in Government, referred to 
<br/>these as hand-outs but it was for leg up.  It was not to buy their votes, something that the Government 
<br/>used to blame us for in the previous Budgets.   But my point here, Sir, is about shifting from such 
<br/>assistance  to  economically  empowering  our  people  -  creation  of  job  opportunities,  financially 
<br/>independent, et cetera.  I know that we are not going to have immediate results, but the efforts must 
<br/>be taken for us to move towards this direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, experiences both in and beyond Fiji, show that subsidies, once provided, 
<br/>are nearly impossible to withdraw.  This is because political constituencies form around the subsidies, 
<br/>and they often demand increases over time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interest Subsidies: Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, Sir, interest of subsidies for certain enterprises 
<br/>create room for access to the public purse by the well-off and better connected.  Such subsidies will 
<br/>only encourage greater risk-taking, a problem of moral hazard by the subsidised, leading to losses 
<br/></span><span>for  the  taxpayer.    Tilting  of  the  business  environment  for  a  favoured  group  using  subsidies  will 
<br/></span><span>encourage corruption, entice the better connected to feed off the public purse, and divert resources 
<br/>from public services. In sum, these actions are inimical to growth of the private sector, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Private Sector Support:  It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that while it is recognised that the 
<br/>private  sector  is  the  engine  of  growth,  the  Budget  has  done  little  in  lowering  the  costs  of  doing 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business in Fiji.  The private sector needs policies stability, a competitive environment and a level 
<br/>playing field for all entrepreneurs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While a long  list  of projects  underway are  announced in  the Budget,  little was mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about reducing red-tapism, including more expedited processing of investment proposals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour Mobility: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the expansion of enterprise will continue to be negated by 
<br/>the acute shortage of workers confronting Fiji.   A total  of 34,000 Fijians emigrated in  the period 
<br/>2022-2023, which is equal to some 4.0 percent of the population and a lot more of the total pool of 
<br/>skills available in the economy.  People are moving places for work or to play rugby is normal, but 
<br/>the large spike in emigration over the past 18 months is unusual, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  must  develop  a  programme  to  mitigate  vacuums  in  the 
<br/>workforce that have resulted from the departure of professional and highly skilled manpower.  This 
<br/>must be an ongoing process, as it is to be expected that our trained workers will continue to be enticed 
<br/>by better pay and better working conditions, and generally, a better life overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same token, we acknowledge that migrant workers from Fiji play a large part in the 
<br/>unprecedented large receipts of remittances, which is helping boost our economy.  The balance of 
<br/>payments and the stock of foreign exchange reserves could have been in a serious position if not for 
<br/>the large and growing volume of remittances being received.  The economy gains without cost when 
<br/>an unemployed worker leaves for foreign employment, remitting the savings home. This is different, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when a Fijian employed at home leaves for overseas employment, where the gain 
<br/>in income to the migrant is the difference in wages for the worker abroad verses at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stemming outflow of skills due to higher wages abroad can only be mitigated by providing 
<br/>better paying jobs at home. The Budget hardly speaks to the challenge of lifting employment at home.  
<br/>But  if people are ‘voting with  their feet’ against the instability  of our political  environment,  then 
<br/>some  introspection  is  required.    In  this  regard,  the  Government  has  work  to  do  in  restoring  and 
<br/>inspiring the confidence of the people to make them elect to stay at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the interim, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government must look at innovative ways as a ‘stop gap’ to 
<br/>addressing the issue of labour shortage in this country. I would suggest that Government provide 
<br/>more  flexibility  in  allowing  migrant  workers  to  work  in  Fiji.    With  that,  ‘knowledge  transfer’ 
<br/>arrangements must be part of the plan, to ensure that our workforce gains from the knowledge of 
<br/>those migrant workers recruited to work here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen what can be done with innovativeness and knowledge through Grace Roads.  
<br/>They  have  shown  us  much  that  can  be  done  in  a  very  short  time.  They  established  themselves, 
<br/>innovate, diversify and expand in a very short period of time.  With knowledge, and the will to grow, 
<br/>Fiji can do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we will need assistance in the meantime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Jobs and Wages:  Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, must create good jobs and good paying jobs 
<br/>for all at home.  Workers at the bottom rungs of the employment ladder deserve a living wage.  The 
<br/>lift in minimum wages is welcome, but many workers are of the view that the 50 cents increase is far 
<br/></span><span>short of compensating them for the significant increases in prices for basic goods, food items and 
<br/></span><span>services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji some 
<br/>days ago, pay increases must be accompanied with a lift in productivity, if inflationary pressures are 
<br/>to be contained.  The increases in wages within the Public Service that was announced will now get 
<br/>transmitted to the wider economy.  This, in turn, has the potential to trigger a wage price spiral.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate Change:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  rather unfortunate that  despite our past  efforts to 
<br/>champion climate change mitigation and adaptation, the Budget gave close to no prominence at all 
<br/>to our climate change issues, especially investments required to build resilience to the adverse effects 
<br/>of climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many Fijians are exposed to the adverse effects of climate change.  Some 
<br/>are already facing rising sea levels, storm surges and encroaching salinity. It is only a matter of time 
<br/>before we are struck again by our major natural disaster.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget has largely ignored the plight of many Fijians vulnerable to climate change, with 
<br/>some already forced to move residences due to the rising in sea and warming oceans, with the latest 
<br/>figure indicating that 42 villages from around Fiji should now be relocated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I raise this issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because in our role as a legislators, parliaments are not 
<br/>only well-placed to scrutinise how Governments are responding to national and international climate 
<br/>change issues, but also can hold their executives to account over their actions or lack thereof.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few budget takeaways, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Civil Service.  The pay rise for our civil 
<br/>servants is well deserved.  It must be noted that contrary to claims by some, the previous Government 
<br/>also raised the pay levels of civil servants in 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It’s a long time! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 3 percent to around 79 percent for some of the workers.  That is on record in the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Seven years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service pay increase announcement 
<br/>has left more questions than answers.  Whilst the increase in pay for Government Wage Earners is 
<br/>clear, civil servants are still at a loss with the manner with which their raise was announced.  This 
<br/>has led to assumptions, some of which are rather negative, some are even raising the question if their 
<br/>salary increase will indeed amount to the 7 percent to 10 percent as announced.  Anyway, while the 
<br/>salary raise is welcomed, the bloated size of our Civil Service should be a cause of concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the total strength of 42,000 civil servants for a small nation like ours, 
<br/>at a cost of $1.2 billion is not sustainable.  Comparatively, New Zealand with a population of over 
<br/>five million, has 65,000 civil servants.  This means that Fiji civil servant to population ratio is 1:22, 
<br/>while New Zealand has its at 1:77.  This is a huge disparity.  I agree that we cannot compare ourselves 
<br/>to  a  developed  country  like  New  Zealand,  but  we  can  at  least  aspire  to  emulate  their  level  of 
<br/>performance.    The  solution  lies  in  developing  a  highly  skilled  and  a  well-paid  workforce.    The 
<br/>Government should be investing in capacity building and training in the Civil Service to enhance 
<br/>productivity.  It is about doing more with less.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Once we have reached the desired skill level, we can gradually 
<br/>reduce the size of the Civil Service to a more sustainable level.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the large size of 
<br/>our  Civil  Service  could  also  be  a  case  of  productive  workers  remaining  unproductive.    This  is  a 
<br/>leadership issue, and not one for the workers.  What it means is that the workers must be supported,

<div><span>trained, provided the right training, that is, equipped and led effectively to be able to fully utilise their 
<br/>potentials and become as productive as they can be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same token, investments in Information Technology must be pursued in earnest if we 
<br/>are honest in our commitment to reducing the size of our Civil Service.  Information Technology 
<br/>reduces cost while enhancing efficiency and accessibility.  Let me thank the Government as well, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the plans to introduce a medical insurance scheme for civil servants.  This is 
<br/>welcomed, but there is an issue that I would like to raise.  If Government could consider setting aside 
<br/>funds to cover funeral expenses of civil servants, who unfortunately pass away while in the service.  
<br/>With  the  non-existence  of  such  facility,  </span><span>reguregu  </span><span>and  related  funeral  cost  is  often  borne  by  their 
<br/>colleagues out of their own goodwill in the respective Departments and Ministries.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Authority Corporatisation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the water concession granted to 
<br/>low  income  earners  is  welcomed,  I  am  concerned  with  the  ambiguity  surrounding  the  proposed 
<br/>corporatisation of Water Authority of Fiji.  If I am not wrong, the corporatisation in the service sector 
<br/>equates to  user pay.  The depleted state of our infrastructure requires this type of arrangement to 
<br/>generate income to help improve services in this sector, but only those in the high income brackets 
<br/>should pay for this service.  The low income earners should be spared the grief of having to fork out 
<br/>additional funds from their pockets to cover additional costs of water usage.  The six-month period 
<br/>given to the corporatisation programme is tight.  If corporatisation were to eventuate, ample time 
<br/>must be given to those who will have to pay to adjust and acclimatise to any rises in cost of water 
<br/>and sewerage services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  health  services,  the  increase  in  the  budget  for  the  health  sector  is  acknowledged,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but it is quite apparent from the latest reports that the budgetary provisions alone is 
<br/>insufficient to raise the standard of infrastructure and services within our health services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can do two things: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Budget must focus on preventative care and public health rather than curative care. In 
<br/>doing  that,  the  cost  reductions  from  providing  services  to  the  already  sick  could  be 
<br/>channelled to infrastructure upgrades and training for our health personnel.  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The privilege in society should pay or considered to pay for health services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Infrastructure  Development,  I  note  with  appreciation  the  budgetary  allocation  for 
<br/>infrastructure development. Improved infrastructure facilitates better connectivity and attract foreign 
<br/>investment, but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as for the previous year, much of the budget allocation marked for 
<br/>infrastructure development was channelled to maintaining existing facilities. It ought to be noted that 
<br/>while maintenance works is necessary, it does not in any way contribute to GDP growth hence the 
<br/>need for investments in new infrastructure to boost GDP growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is noted that no emphasis at all is placed on the improvement 
<br/>of our port facilities. This can be a lost opportunity if not addressed now. I am aware, Sir, that some 
<br/>discussions are taking place between some foreign shipping agencies and local shipping partners to 
<br/>use Fiji as a transhipment hub for the Pacific, but the limited capacity of our ports is inhibiting those 
<br/></span><span>discussions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  enhance  trade  and  economic  growth,  port  development  should  become  a  priority  for 
<br/>Government.  A concerted effort to expand the country’s infrastructure is essential to supporting the 
<br/>private sector investment and the expansion of primary sector activities that is required for economic 
<br/>growth and stability.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Affordable  Housing  for  Low  Income  Earners,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  plan  to  provide 
<br/>affordable  housing  for  our  low  income  earners  is  commendable.  The  question  that  we  should  be 
<br/>asking  ourselves  in  planning  such  initiatives  is  how  affordable  is  affordable  for  our  low  income 
<br/>earners, a lot of whom are teetering on the fringes of poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had experiences, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where Housing Schemes planned for low income 
<br/>earners were snatched by the rich within our communities due largely to the inability of those for 
<br/>whom the housing estate were earmarked for to  buy lots in  these estates, and now built  on those 
<br/>estates are large rental castles which have become a taut wire in  the horizon for our low income 
<br/>earners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  bring  this  to  Parliament,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  provoke  Government  with  all  its  good 
<br/>intentions to be innovative in developing such programmes and hopefully to build ringfences around 
<br/>those programmes … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … to ensure that the benefits are reaped by only those that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme were intended for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On FNPF Dividends, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the efforts of the management and the staff of FNPF 
<br/>must be commended for their tremendous  effort in  achieving a  record of 8 percent  for the FNPF 
<br/>members for their past financial year. It is our hope and the hope of all members of FNPF and their 
<br/>families that the interest level attained in the past year will continue into the years to come. After all, 
<br/>for most of the working population, their FNPF savings are the only source of sustenance for them 
<br/>and their families after their working life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am continually intrigued by how FNPF dividends are divided amongst its 
<br/>members. I am of the view that pensioners whilst they may not be active members, are members 
<br/>nevertheless and should be considered in the annual distribution of FNPF dividends. Their pension 
<br/>funds retained by FNPF are invested and in that sense, pensioners remain as active members hence 
<br/>they should be included in the distribution of the FNPF annual dividends.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a few national issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Governance and Stability, the Government must 
<br/>demonstrate to the people that it is a force united in its efforts to move Fiji forward. However, the 
<br/>recent media reports of disunity within Government is creating insecurity and is counter to progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the matter of Governance, the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, needs to be more transparent 
<br/>and  forthcoming  with  information  so  that  there  can  be  meaningful  participation  by  Fijians  in  the 
<br/>process of governance, including the budget process, and in the most critical matters affecting them 
<br/>as citizens. This is a general observation, and I am sure, I am by no means the only Fijian to hold this 
<br/>view.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  must  also  exercise  greater 
<br/></span><span>transparency and accountability in the implementation of the budget. Clearer mechanisms must be 
<br/>put in place to prevent mismanagement of funds and eliminate corrupt practices. Regular audits and 
<br/>public  disclosure  of  financial  information  can  help  this  build  trust,  enhance  stability  and  ensure 
<br/>efficient use of resources.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Rising Cost of Living, the continued rise in the cost of living, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 
<br/>something that Government should be concerned about. In April this year, our inflation rate - the rate 
<br/>at  which  the  prices  of  goods  and  service  has  increased  rose  to  7.1  percent,  which  according  to 
<br/>newspaper reports was the highest observed in the last 10 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Ongoing inflation causes prices to continue to increase, and due 
<br/>to the accumulative nature of inflation, it is fundamentally important for Government to ensure that 
<br/>inflation  is  contained.  It  has  been  noted  that  the  rise  in  prices  has  been  due  in  large  to  the  VAT 
<br/>increases introduced in the previous years' budget. The Government must note that once the prices 
<br/>of goods increase, it will be very difficult to reverse the price hike. The reluctance of Government to 
<br/>reduce VAT from 15 percent to 9 percent in the current budget to help relieve citizens from the high 
<br/>cost of living is a concern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this demonstrates Governments' lack of compassion for the underprivileged 
<br/>within our communities. When prices increase, the losers will always be the poor, as they will become 
<br/>poorer, while the rich get richer.  An American journalist Mr. Charles M. Blow once said and I quote, 
<br/>"One  does  not  have  to  operate  with  great  malice  to  do  great  harm.  The  absence  of  empathy  and 
<br/>understanding are sufficient.". This is exactly the case here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Poverty  Levels,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  Bureau  of 
<br/>Statistics’ Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) for 2019-2020 period was around 29 
<br/>percent of Fijians live under the national poverty line, but the honourable Minister used to argue that 
<br/>this was supposed to be 15 percent, but this was downgraded by the World Bank to 24.1 percent.  I 
<br/>still have not heard him in Parliament to talk about the official figure whether he has finally accepted 
<br/>that or not, but Mr. Speaker, Sir, we look forward to the next HIES report.  The latest reports indicate 
<br/>that our attempts and poverty reduction have stagnated due to economic and social vulnerabilities.  
<br/>The nation has been unable to continuously drive economic growth and deliver on development and 
<br/>poverty targets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a developing nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has obstacle to overcome on its path to poverty 
<br/>reduction putting our 2030 Sustainability Goals at risk.  A strong economic growth is essential and 
<br/>with a forecasted slowdown in the tourism industry, a revitalisation of the primary industries sectors, 
<br/>and the provision of policy support to emerging sectors should be a priority for Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drug Abuse, the high levels of drug use and peddling in the country is alarming, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. Drugs usage and abuse inflict immeasurable harm on public health and safety, and threatens the 
<br/>economy, and the peaceful development and functioning of societies. And the segment of our society 
<br/>most susceptible to drug use are our youth, the future of our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must find answers to this plague now. Whilst Government has taken 
<br/>steps to address this through the formulation of the Counter Narcotics Strategy 2023-2028, the setting 
<br/></span><span>up of the Narcotics Bureau and Drug Rehabilitation Facilities, there is still much that can be done at 
<br/></span><span>community level to support Government’s high level efforts.  The Government must develop, as part 
<br/>of its efforts to counter drug usage, educational and awareness framework that is built into community 
<br/>networks and programmes to ensure there is consistent messaging to, and within communities on the 
<br/>negative impacts of drug usage and abuse, at all levels.  The recent report of a 14-year old being 
<br/>admitted to a mental hospital as a result of drug abuse drives home the point of the dire level of drug 
<br/>abuse Fiji is in.  The Government must act now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1015 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On open access to the World Wide Web, the proper use of the internet is good and has 
<br/>many advantages, especially for educational and health purposes. On the downside, however, it 
<br/>is use for ulterior motives is extremely detrimental to society.  As of June this year, there are 
<br/>reports stating that over 626 terabytes of internet traffic were used to view pornographic material 
<br/>in the second quarter of 2024 alone. According to newspaper reports, this volume is equivalent 
<br/>to the amount of data stored in 100 million books. Further as quoted in </span><span>The Fiji Times</span><span> of 23</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>November, 2023, that adult content and pornographic sites is among the 10 most used data traffic 
<br/>in the country. This is frightening, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the Government’s efforts to curb this problem with the establishment by 
<br/>Cabinet of an Anti-Porn Task Force.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a race against time, and viewing of 
<br/>adult sites by the vulnerable within our communities leads to the breakdown of the very fabric 
<br/>and values that bind us as families and as a community.  If China can place caveats on certain 
<br/>internet and social networking sites, I am sure we can do the same. Of course, there are ways to 
<br/>by-pass these blockades, but we can at least try to limit their use.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welfare  assistance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  Budget  addresses  various  economic 
<br/>sectors, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to social welfare.  Enhancing social 
<br/>welfare programmes  for  the most  vulnerable populations,  including  the elderly, disabled, and 
<br/>low-income families is essential to ensure inclusive growth and reduce inequality. The current 
<br/>allocation for social welfare programmes needs to be carefully monitored to ensure it reaches 
<br/>those in need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  investments,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  continuous  enhancements  and  investment  in 
<br/>infrastructure,  the  growth  in  the  tourism  industry,  supported  by  our  business-friendly  tax 
<br/>structure are key essentials for attracting inward investments to Fiji.  The Government must work 
<br/>hard to provide the policy and regulatory environment that will make it even more attractive for 
<br/>all industries other than services and tourism, to invest in Fiji.  It must be noted as well, that 
<br/>while  the  pipeline  projects  look  promising,  investment  activity  is  slow  paced.  This  must  be 
<br/>rectified.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the investments that are currently in place, of 
<br/>course, are for the tourism sector as well.  We appreciate that because of the limitations that we 
<br/>have in terms of spaces, but of course, I have talked sectoral divestment – this is something that 
<br/>we need to consider seriously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge that the largest portion of the budget goes to education 
<br/>and skills development. I recognise as well, the Government’s desire to improve the quality of 
<br/>teaching and learning in schools. However, we ought to understand the reasons for the prevalence 
<br/>of unemployment in Fiji, and for the significant losses through the brain-drain to other countries.  
<br/>Some self-examination is required to ensure that we have an education system, at all levels that 
<br/>addresses the skills and knowledge needs within our workforce. Fiji needs skills that not only 
<br/>ensures that our people are able to enter the workforce, but also skills that can propel them to 
<br/>assume  leadership  roles  within  the  various  industries  in  Fiji.  This  must  be  the  focus  of  our 
<br/>education system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Employment Creation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sectors with potential to generate high numbers 
<br/></span><span>of  quality  jobs  must  be  at  the  heart  of  Fiji's  rebuilding  and  long-term  development  efforts, 
<br/></span><span>especially those offering opportunities to women and youth.  Women are a growing majority in 
<br/>higher education, but female labour force participation is considerably lower than for males, a 
<br/>gap which is wider in Fiji than in other Pacific Island countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Emigration Reforms as I have mentioned earlier, the need for migrant workers to work 
<br/>in Fiji is imminent, we need to change our polices to attract emigrant with the qualifications and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>skill- sets required to support growth in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Law Reform, the honourable Attorney-General, Sir, it is obvious that many of our laws 
<br/>are  archaic  and  ambiguous  and  are  negating  growth.  These  laws  such  as,  if  I  may  name  two, 
<br/>Pharmaceutical and Quarantine Laws needs to be reformed immediately to support innovation and 
<br/>progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate Resilience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, strengthening economic and climate resilience is the 
<br/>ability to recover from a disruption. In the context of economic development, economic resilience 
<br/>aims to better prepare regions or countries to anticipate, withstand and bounce back from any type of 
<br/>shock, disruption or stress it may experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  limited  resources  we  have  against  the  so  many  competing 
<br/>sectoral priorities, Fiji must invest in programmes to strengthen its economic and climate resilience. 
<br/>The lessons learned from the pandemic and the recent climate-induced disasters have taught us that 
<br/>low resilience to economic shocks, climate change and natural disasters is also a feature of many of 
<br/>Fiji’s sectors such as agriculture, housing and fisheries and must be bolstered both to preserve the 
<br/>jobs  and  incomes  in  these  sectors  and  to  reduce  the  fiscal  burdens  of  economic  relief  and 
<br/>reconstruction after every major disruptive event.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  key  component  of  building  this  economic  resilience,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  economic 
<br/>empowerment of the people. This involves the process of enhancing individuals’ economic status, 
<br/>including income generation, employment opportunities and financial independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific Economic Hub, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government must leverage Fiji’s potential as 
<br/>an economic hub in the Pacific region. Parallel to developing sector that will contribute to increased 
<br/>economic diversification and resilience in Fiji as an island nation, must also prioritise sectors and 
<br/>reforms that can expand its external market and leverage its geographical centrality in the Pacific to 
<br/>become an economic hub for the Pacific Island countries and potentially for the broader Asia-Pacific 
<br/>region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have already quoted the Fiji-Australia Joint Economic and Trade Study (JETS) Report in 
<br/>2019 and it had explored this opportunity stating that Fiji has developed comparative advantage in 
<br/>maritime  transport  infrastructure  to  serve  the  region  as  an  entrepot,  based  on  its  central  location 
<br/>within the region and its deep-water ports in Suva and Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Growing the Economy, there are opportunities for growth.  I am 
<br/>intrigued that this years’ Budget appears to be not very different from last years. The honourable 
<br/>Minister has already stated that there will be no surprises, but when there are no surprises, it becomes 
<br/>boring and predictable. Quite apart from the capital developments within the tourism sector, there is 
<br/>very  little  else  in  the  Budget  to  support  existing  programmes  and  generate  new  industries  with 
<br/>potentially good income to leverage our nation’s economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot continue to do the same things and expect to get a different result, 
<br/>and that is the problem with this Budget. We must seriously start looking at alternative economies. 
<br/></span><span>Can we continue to focus on tourism and sugar and be able to be successful? Yes, maybe, but our 
<br/></span><span>growth will remain at 2 percent to 3 percent yearly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We need to start looking at an alternative source of economy and 
<br/>an alternative source of income for the people. The opportunity is within our primary industry sectors, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  remains  underutilised  and  more  attention  must  be  given  to  it  to  grow  to  create 
<br/>employment, improve the livelihoods of the people and support the nation’s economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Forestry  and  Fisheries,  the  Forestry  and  Fisheries  are  two  main  key 
<br/>sectors where there is real potential to support national economy in the medium to long term. While 
<br/>the forest industry contributes approximately $554 million annually in terms of ecosystem services, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it only accounts for 0.3 percent of the nations’ GDP. Additionally, current figures 
<br/>indicate a decrease in exports for the sector while imports are increasing.  This is a disparity that 
<br/>should be a cause of concern for Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fisheries sector in Fiji makes an extremely important contribution to the lives of many 
<br/>Fijians. The sector is a large employer generating over 9,100 jobs and annual consumption of fresh 
<br/>fish is estimated at over 44 kilogrammes per capita. With investments the performance of this sector 
<br/>should improve significantly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Fisheries sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would rather focus on those not participating in the 
<br/>already  well-established  industries  within  the  sector,  like  the  tuna  industry,  for  example.  Our 
<br/>collective interest and the focus of planning and policy interventions are to be on the empowerment 
<br/>of those not involved in commercial fishing activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would strongly recommend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that more attention is given to commercial 
<br/>seaweed farming, aquaculture and BDM. Improvement in these commodities in the Fisheries sector 
<br/>will contribute significantly to the participation of more of these so-called unproductive population 
<br/>in  meaningful  economic  activities,  including  income  generation,  employment  opportunities  and 
<br/>financial independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Sugar Industry, I am grateful, Sir, for the support offered to the sugar industry. While 
<br/>its performance has been on the decline, it remains the third largest contributor to export earnings 
<br/>and supports the livelihood of close to 200,000 Fijians. The sugar industry will undoubtedly continue 
<br/>to play an import role in Fiji’s' economic growth and development in the foreseeable future, hence 
<br/>should continue to be supported.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Economic Affairs Committee already have plans for 
<br/>the  setting  up  of  a  special  committee  to  review  the  performance  of  Fiji's  sugar  industry.  This  is 
<br/>appreciated, Sir, and we look forward to the Committee's findings and recommendations with much 
<br/>anticipation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>The Non-Sugar Agriculture sector contributes around 7 percent to GDP. With approximately 
<br/>500,000 hectares of arable land available for agricultural purposes in Fiji, the potential for the sector 
<br/>is immense. This is where real opportunity lies for all Fijian, especially within our peri-urban and 
<br/>rural communities to grow and to participate in our capitalist economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Non-Sugar Agriculture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sustains around one-third of Fiji's population 
<br/>engaging  in  subsistence  farming  cultivating  traditional  fruits,  vegetables  and  root  crops.  Of  this 
<br/>output, a limited quantity enters the domestic market while very little is exported. However, at the 
<br/></span><span>same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there are huge potentials to gradually raise the levels of production 
<br/></span><span>and  graduate  some  of  these  farmers  from  subsistence  to  semi-commercial  or  even  commercial 
<br/>farming  levels,  targeting  the  export  markets,  there  is  even  better  opportunities  for  expansion  of 
<br/>domestic agriculture by satisfying the tourism market within Fiji itself. This will mean producing 
<br/>higher quality products and more reliable supplies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given a strategy of meeting the 
<br/>food needs of tourists in Fiji, the agriculture sector would have to step up in terms of quality and 
<br/>consistency of supply.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we acknowledge the efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is high 
<br/>time that we demand more from them. but to be able to elevate its performance to a higher level, the 
<br/>Government and key partners must create the environment for them by providing all the necessary 
<br/>support needed to make the sector realize its full potential. This is not only in terms of budgetary 
<br/>support,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  Ministry's  programmes,  but  more  importantly  on  public  sector 
<br/>investment and supported by the private sector to improve agri-logistics in this country. As I have 
<br/>stated earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot continue to do the same things and expect to get a different 
<br/>result, and if we as a nation are really serious about raising the sector's contribution to GDP, now is 
<br/>the time to show that new level of commitment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Driven by demand, organised production in the four major geographic Divisions, good market 
<br/>access supported by an efficient  agri-logistics system and networks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will play a 
<br/>critical role in enabling Fiji’s capacity for large commercial agriculture and presents new areas for 
<br/>both, public and private sector participation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outsourcing  Services,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  lot  has  been  discussed  about  our  outsourcing 
<br/>services particularly we acknowledge the efforts in the Kalabu Tax Free Zone and probably the focus 
<br/>now should not only be on the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) but of course to make use of the 
<br/>skills  that  we  have  in  Fiji,  we  would  strongly  recommend  the  shift  to  Knowledge  Processing 
<br/>Outsourcing (KPO). This will give the opportunity for our accountants, our lawyers, our technical 
<br/>people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to get employment and of course contribute significantly to our growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us learn from the success of the BPO and the KPOs in the Philippines. 
<br/>What is stopping Fiji from following suit and of course in the ICT Sector, this is another industry 
<br/>that could be exploited to advance our economic growth, and which would be critical to support the 
<br/>BPO industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Likewise on Medical Tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge the rise in the number of 
<br/>private  hospitals  in  Fiji,  this  provides  yet  another  opportunity  where  Fiji  could  enhance  its  niche 
<br/>market for Medical Tourism.  Medical Tourism is often associated with people from lesser developed 
<br/>countries travelling to more advanced countries to receive high medical care and with the exponential 
<br/>rise in cost of healthcare services in developed countries, there has been a reversal of trend where 
<br/>people from  developed  countries are now travelling  to  lesser developed countries to  receive high 
<br/>quality treatment at such lower costs.  This is where the opportunity lies for Fiji but that will require 
<br/>extensive Government support, upskilling of our health professionals, and infrastructural upgrades 
<br/>for Fiji to benefit fully from Medical Tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  of  course,  the  Audio-Visual  Industry,  with  so  much  potential  for 
<br/>employment creation and to support economic growth, this appears to continue to be downtrodden 
<br/>and of course, Fiji is becoming one of the most  sought-after production locations in the world.  It 
<br/>makes good business sense to shoot in Fiji and for Fiji filmmakers to take advantage of the beautiful 
<br/>diverse  locations  and  the  best  incentives  in  the  world;  the  20  percent  film  tax  rebate.  The  very 
<br/>reasonable  wage  rates,  the  diversity  of  our  cultures,  our  high  literacy  levels  together  with 
<br/>technological advancements in Fiji, should be added inducements for filmmakers to choose Fiji as a 
<br/>filming  location  and  the  onus  is  on  the  Government  to  create  the  business  environment  to  entice 
<br/></span><span>filmmakers to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ordinary  Fijians  are  feeling  the  pressure  of  price  rises, 
<br/>unemployment, deteriorating access to public services, and the intensifying effects of climate change. 
<br/>These are the very people who voted us into Parliament and are providing us the revenues for the 
<br/>budget. They expect better value from their money. Many Fijians, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are struggling to 
<br/>put food on the table, provide shelter to their families, and lack confidence in Government to protect 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them from the proliferation of illicit drugs and criminal activity. Most are worried about the quality 
<br/>of education, healthcare and utilities. These are legitimate concerns, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is not only 
<br/>the job of the Government to address those issues. It is our collective responsibility as members of 
<br/>Parliament to attend to the needs of the people of our beloved country. Unfortunately, this budget 
<br/>falls short of the expectations of the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more could  have been done to  reduce inflation, improve access  to  basic 
<br/>services, and most of all improve access to secure and create jobs, better paying jobs. Government 
<br/>has a responsibility to improve the livelihoods of our people. It is time that they begin to deliver on 
<br/>those responsibilities. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his Budget Address, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Finance stated that the core issue for economic security and stability is trust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he also stated that on the big and contentious issues which 
<br/>confront  us,  building  long  term  national  consensus  is  critical.    Those  words  not  only  caught  my 
<br/>attention, but its deep meaning still resonates within me, given the critical juncture or the crossroads 
<br/>we are currently at in our journey as an independent democratic country.  I hope that these words are 
<br/>not merely hot air, but a genuine commitment to freeing us from the ills of the past and building a 
<br/>Fiji that we can all be proud of.  The starting point is to move forward with the efforts to unite us as 
<br/>Fijians.  Our unity as a people and as a nation should take precedence over all other efforts aimed at 
<br/>building  national  consensus,  and  I  would  urge  the  Government,  through  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister to kindly consider it as a national priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year’s Budget theme of </span><span>Stability, Security and Sustainability</span><span> is, therefore, not a mere 
<br/>coincidence, but is relevant both economically and politically for Fiji now, tomorrow and always.  
<br/>On the basis of all that I have said,  it is  unfortunate that  I do not  have enough confidence in  the 
<br/>presentation by the honourable Minister for Finance to give this Budget my unreserved support and 
<br/>approval.  I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought they were not going to bring me the little 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bench for only 10 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been many calls for a Budget for the people.  I congratulate the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics 
<br/>for doing that.  This is a Budget for the people.  I also thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for his contribution to the debate this morning on behalf of the Opposition as the Shadow Minister 
<br/>for Finance.   I believe that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has delivered the Budget for the 
<br/>people.  I have with me a 40-page print-out of the speech by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  
<br/>It  is  an outstanding  blueprint  for progress  in  the  coming year, extending  the initial  effort that we 
<br/>started last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every page of the new Budget is devoted in one form or another to the people, to their overall 
<br/>welfare  and  needs,  to  the  betterment  of  their  families,  to  improving  services  to  them,  defeating 
<br/>poverty, opening up opportunities for prosperity, protecting their environment and overcoming the 
<br/>other challenges that we all face. It is all here.  The several hundred pages of support documents are 
<br/>also dedicated to getting things right for the people.  Some of the language is officialese in tone and 
<br/></span><span>the statistics are not very easy to follow, but the intent follows the same path as the Budget - how life 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji can be improved so that the people attain as much happiness and prosperity as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government’s responsibility is to lay the platform and foundation for 
<br/>the people to build for themselves a healthy, happy and prosperous life.   As the old adage goes, “You 
<br/>can take horses to water, but you cannot make them drink.”   A village in Nadroga asked the Alliance 
<br/>Government to assist them with some farming implements when they were adjusting from sugarcane

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to food crop farming.  While presenting the implements, the late Dr. Kuruisaqila asked the villagers; 
<br/></span><span>“Muju kua ga ni kerevia vua na Viagwane na PM, na Jui Nayau, me lama i lovonia, hamakinia, 
<br/>cavusia, me qei vajubunia na kemutu tavioka!” Ma!  </span><span>Please, do not ask the Government to come and 
<br/>plant your cassava. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  bare  figures  in  the  Budget  often  hide  the  larger  human  impact.  For 
<br/>instance,  I  looked  at  the  section  about  electricity  subsidies  and  free  water  for  households  on  low 
<br/>income,  the  electricity  initiative  involves  $10  million  divided  among  55,000  households  (about 
<br/>$181.80 per household). The benefits, therefore, will be widely felt. Similarly, the Free Water Project 
<br/>for around 40,000 households will reach many individuals (about $200 per household) and equal to 
<br/>the Back to School Grant per child. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the huge increase in the Social Welfare budget last year to $200 million 
<br/>continues in the new budget to bring relief to approximately 100,000 people. There are many other 
<br/>examples of financial support to make daily living a little easier for those in need (about $2,000 per 
<br/>Social Welfare Beneficiary).</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new National Development Plan (NDP) for charting Fiji’s way ahead 
<br/>for the next five years is officially the People’s Plan. It will complement the budgets going forward. 
<br/>About 20,000 citizens took part in consultations prior to its drafting. So, there should be no doubt 
<br/>about our commitment to doing right by the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  I warned during the  elections that the obstacles  we would  face in 
<br/>office were formidable. And so, it has proved. But that is what we signed up for, we are not deterred. 
<br/>We have had our setbacks and made errors. That happens with all governments. When I survey the 
<br/>economic, social and political landscape in its entirety, I see the profile and vision of a new Fiji, the 
<br/>country of our dreams. I will not have time to talk in detail about that today, but I am confident that 
<br/>we together can get there.  I can just say Fiji has been wounded, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but those wounds 
<br/>can be healed. We can do this together, all of us, starting here in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji  are awakening to  a compelling truth, although we are 
<br/>divided  by  language,  customs  and  traditions,  we  nonetheless  share  something  that  binds  us, 
<br/>something that should make us brothers, sisters and neighbours. We belong to Fiji. These islands are 
<br/>home to all of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, touching briefly on the foreign affairs aspect of my portfolios, we now have 
<br/>diplomatic relations with more than 182 countries. Those relationships and how we manage them are 
<br/>of vital importance and I will mention something about that soon.   Just recently there were claims 
<br/>that we were falling down on the job. This came amidst all the ups and downs of democracy, attendant 
<br/>controversies and robust exchanges of opinions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Characteristics of democracies, I am not aware of any democratic government that does not 
<br/>face accusations or allegations of incompetence or poor management.  I remind Parliament again that 
<br/></span><span>during the elections in 2022, I anticipated an incoming government would face enormous difficulties 
<br/></span><span>and challenges, loaded with frustrations, and it would take time to get things right. There is no way 
<br/>in  the world  we could  overcome these in  the first  18 months in office.  However,  I can say with 
<br/>confidence, we are steadily getting a grip on the virtual reconstruction of the country. I thank the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  accepting  that  challenge  that  we  together  can  do  that 
<br/>reconstruction job.  Perhaps we need to be more effective in communicating that to the people.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  plan  to  share  with  Parliament  a  list  of  what  I  see  as  just  some  of  the 
<br/>Government successes because of the speech time limitation, I will not be able to address these, but 
<br/>hopefully some of my colleagues will take over part of that task.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I briefly share with  you now the story of the project  that will transform  Vanua Levu.  We 
<br/>pushed  hard  to  achieve  agreement  with  development  partners  that  would  enable  us  to  proceed. 
<br/>Complex negotiations with the World Bank produced confirmed funding of approximately $302.6 
<br/>million  over  10  years.  In  a  related  initiative,  the  Government  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China 
<br/>agreed  to  provide  $300  million  for  road  upgrading.  That  was  a  success  of  our  diplomacy,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and we thank China for its willingness to support us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) may finance rehabilitation of bridges and jetties.  The 
<br/>broad scope of the plan will improve virtually all the islands’ infrastructure. We expect that at least 
<br/>60,000 Fijians, particularly women, will benefit from the new jobs and there will be a substantial 
<br/>boost  to  farming.  Protection  of  natural  resources  will  be  central,  especially  through  30  locally 
<br/>managed Marine Protected Areas. It is estimated that with private sector investment coming in, the 
<br/>total volume of finance will increase to about $1 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for many months I have been pursuing a unique project, I call it the  “Ocean 
<br/>of  Peace”.    It  does  not  have  a  direct  bearing  on  this  year’s  Budget,  but  it  is  nonetheless  of  huge 
<br/>importance for our country and the Pacific Island Forum countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  essentially  a  mission  to  promote  peace,  not  only  as  a  virtue  in  itself  but  a  source  of 
<br/>prosperity in our region and a symbol of hope in a world teetering on the edge of calamity. I have 
<br/>raised  in  a  number  of  local  speeches  including  one  last  week  at  the  Kadavu  Provincial  Council 
<br/>meeting. When I am ready, I intend to make a full address on this peace project calling for  broad 
<br/>support for the initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel duty-bound to call for the Parliamentary Members to become 
<br/>part  of  a  Parliamentary  Keep  Fit  Project.  It  is  important  for  the  nation  to  set  an  example  of 
<br/>maintaining good health and basic fitness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the young nurses told me that I was obese few months ago, I felt very bad; that was at 
<br/>104 kilogrammes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, I started work on it, now even at 98 kilogrammes, still I am 
<br/>obese or at least overweight and I encourage all of us to participate on Wednesday afternoon with 
<br/>our civil servants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am assuming that you, my colleagues, will be very eager to join in and I intend to raise the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>matter with the Business House Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you  very  much,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  for  that  invite  to 
<br/>participate in the reduction of weight, et cetera. Just before I adjourn Parliament for tea, I would like 
<br/>to acknowledge once more some of the faces who are familiar to us who are sitting in the gallery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On my right up on the first bench, these are some of our colleagues from Vanuatu. You are 
<br/></span><span>most welcome to Parliament. Further on my left, we have Mr. Semi Leweniqila, a lawyer who has 
<br/></span><span>come back to Fiji from the United States of America and to his right is Mr. Simione Rasova, former 
<br/>Member of Parliament including the former Assistant Minister for Sports, Mr. Rajesh Singh, and a 
<br/>well-known figure in the SODELPA Party, Ms. Faith Grace. I now intend to adjourn Parliament for 
<br/>morning tea. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.49 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there has been a slight change on the Batting Order.  
<br/>I have just received a request from the honourable Government Whip that immediately after this, the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  will  speak  and  then  to  be  followed  by 
<br/>honourable Bala.  That is what we are going to be taking now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament; before I go on to my Speech proper, I would like to address some of the issues that was 
<br/>raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition with regard to the Primary Healthcare approach.  
<br/>Yes, the Ministry is making that a priority - primary healthcare, in terms of sustainable financing for 
<br/>health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is aware that the way forward is through prevention, which is still better than 
<br/>cure and, therefore, we are prioritising our primary healthcare through allocation in last year’s as well 
<br/>as this financial year’s budget, together with our development partners. You would have seen that 
<br/>most  of  the  developments  by  one  of  our  development  partners  mostly  centred  in  the  province  of 
<br/>Tailevu,  Sir.    As  we  speak,  the  end  of  the  month  and  the  beginning  of  next  month,  we  will  be 
<br/>commissioning  the  new  Dogo  Health  Facility,  still  in  Tailevu,  and  thereafter  in  Vunitogoloa,  the 
<br/>province of Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver the Ministry of Health and Medical Services' full support for 
<br/>the 2024-2025 National Budget that was presented before this august Parliament on Friday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 
<br/>2024.   I  wish  to  commend  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics and his Ministry staff, who have worked tirelessly to 
<br/>deliver  a  visionary  and  pragmatic  Budget  that  economically  empowers  Fijians,  while  promoting 
<br/>good health and wellbeing for the Fijian population.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  proposed  increase  in  salaries  of  civil  servants  and  the increase  in 
<br/>minimum wage to $5.00 are clear indications of the Coalition Government’s commitment towards 
<br/>workers  in the  country.  The  resolution  of  the  world  record  three-decade  old  dispute  with  the  368 
<br/>Vatukoula gold miners has to be among the top and memorable highlights of this Budget - a truly 
<br/>historic event that will be remembered in the annals of Fijian history for many generations to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has been allocated $540 million 
<br/>for the next financial year, of which $90 million has been specifically allocated for the Private Public 
<br/>Partnership (PPP) with the Lautoka and Ba Hospitals. The allocation is adequate for the Ministry's 
<br/>need, and will allow the Ministry to effectively deliver health programmes and achieve favourable 
<br/>outcomes in the health service through:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the upgrading and improvement of healthcare facilities and health services 
<br/>support systems;  
<br/></span><span>strengthening and building our human resource for health;  
<br/></span><span>establishing innovative and collaborative partnerships for a resilient health 
<br/>system;  
<br/>transforming our Primary Healthcare approach to achieve Universal Health 
<br/>Coverage for our people; and  
<br/>instilling the culture of wellness that empowers our communities to live a 
<br/>long, healthy and productive life.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $12 million has been allocated for capital projects and maintenance work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which will focus on our prioritised projects such as the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interior works at Labasa Hospital;  
<br/>refurbishment of Savusavu Health Facility, and  
<br/>construction of a new Rehabilitation Centre in Tamavua. This is a four-year 
<br/>project sponsored by KOICA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also welcomes the allocation of $3.8million for minor works 
<br/>which represents an increase of $0.8million from the current year and will allow our Divisional Teams 
<br/>to promptly work on much needed repairs and minor renovations for our health facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  talking  about  access  to  medicine,  medical  products  and  biomedical 
<br/>equipment, the allocation of $96 million for drugs and medical equipment, which is an increase of 
<br/>$4  million  from  this  financial  year  will  be  managed  by  the  Fiji Pharmaceutical  &amp;  Biomedical 
<br/>Services (FPBS).  Sir, $15 million is provided for the procurement of biomedical equipment, and the 
<br/>availability  of  high  quality, well-maintained  and  fully  functional  medical  equipment that  ensures 
<br/>effective delivery of health services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as  alluded to  by the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics,  there  has  been a  significant 
<br/>improvement in  the procurement and logistics management system  at  the  Ministry of Health. Our 
<br/>electronic  stock  inventory  management  system  called mSUPPLY  has  been  rolled  out  fully  to  234 
<br/>health facilities, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dental  Departments,  Laboratory Departments  and  Operating  Theatres  at  CWMH 
<br/>Hospital and Labasa Hospital; 
<br/>Subdivisional Hospitals at Nadi, Sigatoka and Nabouwalu in Bua; 
<br/>rural-based health  facilities,  such  as  Cicia  and  Lakeba  in  the  Lau  Group,  Qamea  and 
<br/>Bouma in Taveuni, Kioa and Saqani, Lekutu and Kubulau in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At these facilities, our staff can now use either a tablet or desktop computer to place their orders and 
<br/>monitor their inventory.  Ongoing use will lead to further improvement and strengthening of this 
<br/>important system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s new budget is highlighted by the establishment of two new 
<br/></span><span>cost centres to better align our health programmes and build more efficiently and accountability in 
<br/></span><span>our implementation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Family Health:  As a new cost centre in the Ministry, this has been allocated $3 million in the 
<br/>new financial year.  The allocation will facilitate and further strengthen the Ministry’s programmes 
<br/>pertaining to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Maternal and Child Health; and 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Sexual Reproductive Health and Gender. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Division, the budgetary allocation will enable the effective implementation of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry’s: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Expanded Programme Immunization (EPI) and the Early Childhood Development (ECD)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wellness and NCD:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Division is our second new cost centre with its 
<br/>own budget of $1.9 million.   Tackling Fiji’s highest disease burden of NCD, the allocation will assist 
<br/>the Division to deliver and evaluate, amongst other things, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>NCD Prevention and Control Programme and the Mental Health and Suicidal Prevention 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>activities with an allocation of $600,000;

<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>National Food and Nutrition Security Programme and Oral Health Promotion; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Rheumatic  Heart  Disease  Prevention  and  Control  Programme  with  an  allocation  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$200,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Division will also complete the much-awaited STEPS Survey with the support of our partners 
<br/>and the Fiji Bureau of Statistics in the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $2.48 million has been allocated to the Health Protection Division of the 
<br/>Ministry in the new financial year.  With this allocation, the Ministry will address acute threats to 
<br/>public health from communicable diseases, environmental hazards and health emergencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Health Protection Division will work closely with our Divisional Health Teams to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respond to outbreaks of leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue fever and diarrhoeal disease around 
<br/>the country; 
<br/>carry out Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project activities for schools, healthcare 
<br/>facilities and communities; 
<br/>conduct responsibilities as the Competent Authority for Food Safety; and 
<br/>implement our mosquito control strategic plan and operational research to support vector 
<br/>control. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the coming financial year, the Division will work to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>strengthen our tobacco control enforcement and quarantine and port health service roles; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>finalise our Health National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change and Health; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>prepare  well  for  the  international  re-certification  for  the  Fiji  Emergency  Medical  Team 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(FEMAT) by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also to note that in the coming financial year, there is allocation within the 
<br/>Ministry for the review of our legislations.  As alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>there is a much needed review of certain legislations within the Ministry of Health which I believe 
<br/>are outdated and needs to be updated to be in the context of the current setting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by affirming my full support for this Budget, and the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Health and Medical Services is ready to forge on and roll out its programmes and plans, 
<br/></span><span>laying out the platform for a secure healthy future for our people. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Sir.  God bless 
<br/>Fiji and I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not that well today, but I will do justice for the

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Government Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and friends; at the outset, I would like to 
<br/>congratulate the appointment of the new honourable Attorney-General, as well as the new honourable 
<br/>Minister for Fisheries and Forests.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I extend my gratitude to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  for  presenting  the  Budget.  
<br/>However, I must express my profound reservations regarding the lack of policy directions embedded 
<br/>within this Budget, in particular, there are glaring omissions of counter measures to tackle inflation 
<br/>and escalating cost of living, which impacts the daily lives of ordinary Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are no measures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to offset the rising cost of living that the Budget 
<br/>chooses  to  ignore.    This  includes  lack  of  specific  tax  and  duty  reductions  to  cushion  this  impact 
<br/>beyond the lame excuse that prices will continue to rise because of rising cost of production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is not an answer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the problems faced by ordinary Fijians who want 
<br/>real action to make their lives easier.  That is a classroom answer that does not warrant any space in 
<br/>the national dialogue when it comes to economic and finance matters, and ways and means of making 
<br/>the lives of those who are struggling to put food on the table better.  Surely, Sir, our people deserve 
<br/>better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must acknowledge that the increase in debt, increase in expenditure and 
<br/>slow economic growth are alarming indicators of our current path.  As a country, we need to ask 
<br/>ourselves, where are we heading? What are the solutions? Recently, the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>had  proposed  a  government  of  national  unity  or  a  bipartisan  approach,  but  what  is  the  common 
<br/>ground, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the past two years, we have witnessed drama after drama, instead of action.  The people 
<br/>of Fiji are suffering because the country is not progressing.  No matter how much funds are allocated 
<br/>to Ministries, or how good policies are introduced, none of these will work without political stability.  
<br/>We need to resolve and work towards that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  told  that  funds  have  been  approved  by  lending  agencies,  but  the 
<br/>investors are hesitant to invest because they do not feel secure because of their lack of confidence in 
<br/>the Government. This is after my talks with the businesspeople.  We do meet, and they have said that 
<br/>banks have approved their loan, but they are not prepared to start their construction, so we need to 
<br/>see the solution to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government lacks direction and has lost its way due to shortsighted decisions on many 
<br/>fronts,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    We  are  losing  our  best  and  brightest  Fijians  because  they  see  the 
<br/>discrimination and lack of secure progressive future for themselves and their children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the way forward requires real unity on the ground, and not just the use of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>multiracial card during special events, like the Girmit celebrations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I am coming to you, honourable Tabuya, just wait.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget lacks positive growth because it is rooted in backward looking 
<br/>and negative thinking.  What else can we expect from my good friend, the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance,  when  in  almost  every  speech  and  you  must  have  heard,  Mr.

<div><span>Speaker, Sir, that when he delivers, he just plays the blame game - that the previous Government did

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me remind him, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the previous Government was  delivering on the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  The people of Fiji have experienced and had an open debate on Churchill 
<br/>Park and Govind Park.  I am putting a challenge today, I have been hearing this from the last two 
<br/>years and today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I challenge the Government for an open debate on Govind Park 
<br/>and the swimming pool.  What is this nonsense?  Now, that you are in Government, go and do it, that 
<br/>is your job!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji have experienced what it means to have an ‘all talk no action’ Government 
<br/>in the past 18 months.  Sadly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji will continue to suffer, as they 
<br/>await relief from the cost of living pressures, compounded by the lack of action to provide that needed 
<br/>relief.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji were expecting this Budget to offer them the relief.  Unfortunately, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, they were wrong.  The people are watching and listening, and they are concluding that 
<br/>this  is  a  Coalition  Government  by  the  Coalition  and  for  the  Coalition,  and  none  of  this  inspires 
<br/>confidence in our country’s future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics has criticised the Ba Hospital and Lautoka Hospital Projects - a 
<br/>Private  Public  Partnership  (PPP).    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  should  have  also  explained  the  service 
<br/>provided for that money, the lives saved through heart surgeries and interventions, as well as the 
<br/>high-end care equipment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  told,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  around  170  Fijians  have  had  successful  heart  surgeries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine if that service was not provided here… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Paid for by the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  You will have your turn to respond, do not worry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… families would have been paying to go to India, New Zealand or Australia.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very interesting.  Can the  honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  explain  to  the 
<br/>people of Fiji, what was the healthcare level and the cost before the Aspen partnership because he 
<br/>did mention around $10 million to $12 million per month?  So, when Aspen was not there, what was 
<br/>the cost to the Ministry of Health?  That needs to be told, so that we can balance and justify whether 
<br/>it is really a bad or a good decision that was taken at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can he explain why the health service delivery is more than three times better than what it 
<br/>was since Aspen has taken over, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   The honourable Minister must understand that 
<br/>quality healthcare is more important than making the books look good.  I want to share this because 
<br/>we are in the Standing Committee and we did a tour.  The Ba Hospital is supposed to be a District 
<br/>Hospital but now, people are treating that as a Divisional Hospital so people right from Rakiraki and 
<br/>Tavua all come to Ba Hospital.  That is something good about Ba Hospital.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1027 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics about the understanding between the 
<br/>Indian Government and the Fijian Government on the construction of the new state-of-the-art hospital 
<br/>in Suva. Is it true that the Indian Government asked the Fijian Government to pay off the FSC loan 
<br/>before giving the new grant for the new hospital?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nonsense! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Alright, if it is nonsense, then let it be nonsense, but the truth will come 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out one day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You’re talking nonsense.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, but the truth will come out one day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Ask them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, itt is concerning that this Budget was formulated with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>minimal open and transparent consultation, relying heavily on the in-house fiscal advisors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiscal Review Committee advised the Permanent Secretary to be disconnected from the 
<br/>realities  faced  by  our  people,  offering  solutions  that  will  push  more  Fijians  into  poverty.    Their 
<br/>reliance on a narrow set of advisors who may not fully understand the ground reality, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  is  evident.  It  shows  the  lack  of  respect  for  the  principles  of  inclusive  governance  and, 
<br/>furthermore,  the  exclusion  of  key  stakeholders,  such  as  industry  leaders  and  community 
<br/>representatives from this consultation only makes …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They all came.  You don’t know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- How many consultations did you do in Ba, Lautoka and Nadi? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I apologise for the running commentaries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it makes it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I like your line where you said, if it is nonsense let it be nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the minimum wage implementation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lag in the implementation of 
<br/>minimum wage with a nominal increase to $4.50 in August 2024, and an additional 50 cents in April 
<br/>2025, is deeply troubling. The slow approach, coupled with a low starting point, will result in little 
<br/></span><span>relief against the backdrop of the continuous inflation and rising living cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  previous  Government  initiated  and  completed  the  wage  review,  and 
<br/>addressed  issues  of  inequality,  and  redressed  sectors  that  needed  better  rewards  for  labour.  This 
<br/>Government’s continuous about-turns on the key promise reflects a profound disconnect from their 
<br/>electoral commitments.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  difference  between  promise  and  actual  implementation  is  not  just  a  matter  of  poor 
<br/>planning, it is a breach of trust with the people of Fiji who place their faith in this promise during the 
<br/>Elections. In the next nine months before the $5 minimum wage is awarded, the poor people will 
<br/>suffer, as they are suffering now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Once they reach April 2025, they will find that, 
<br/>that extra $1 per hour does not even extend enough to meet their extra cost of living reflected in the 
<br/>basic groceries in their basket. Many of our poor will reduce to poor healthy choices,  Sir, if any, 
<br/>adding to our productivity issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the removal of benefits and the imposition of additional taxes in charitable 
<br/>and sporting organisations shows the lack of empathy and understanding of the critical role these 
<br/>organisations  play  in  our  society.  This  fiscal  policy  appears  to  be  designed  to  enrich  the  already 
<br/>wealthy  while  the  burden  of  these  measures  falls  on  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable.  The  rich 
<br/>corporations and high-end businesses continue to receive favourable treatment, which only widens 
<br/>the gap between the rich and the poor. My time is up, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So, I have got five pages left. I will give it to the media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank you very much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought you were going to lay it on the table, now you are giving it straight 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, I knew you will not allow me to.

<div><span>HON. A.B.V.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable

<br/>Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and  gentlemen  and  members  of  the  public  tuning  in  live  on

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is with great pleasure that I rise to deliver my response to the 2024-2025 
<br/>National Budget that was delivered on Friday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024.  Firstly, I would like to thank my 
<br/>heavenly father, the mighty God I serve for his guidance, strength and wisdom.  I would also like to 
<br/>thank the honourable Prime Minister for entrusting me with the ministerial portfolio for  Fisheries 
<br/>and Forests, the first time a woman has ever been appointed to this position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  for  his  leadership  and  guidance  and  all  the  staff  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation.  To  my  predecessor,  honourable  Kalaveti  Ravu,  thank  you  for  your 
<br/>service to the people and assisting the people and the stakeholders of both the Fisheries and Forests 
<br/>sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my family and supporters, thank you for journeying with me.  </span><span>Vei kemuni na kaiciqu, kei

<br/>drivers, our nurses and every person in Fiji by the way we manage our money and set out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the comments made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for the Fisheries and the Forestry sectors and I would like to applaud the Coalition Government for 
<br/>its foresight and support to resourced-based sectors.  Both the Ministry of Fisheries and Forests have 
<br/>been provided an increased budget of $25.3 million and $31.4 million respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $744,918 has been allocated to 
<br/>the  Offshore  Fisheries  Management  Division  to  support  its  Monitoring, Control  and  Surveillance 
<br/>(MCS)  systems  in  combatting  the  illegal,  unregulated,  unreported  fishing  phenomenon  in  Fiji’s 
<br/>offshore  sector.    Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  grateful  to  be  hosting  this  year’s 
<br/>Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) 21</span><span>st</span><span> Annual Session where 550 participants 
<br/>from across the globe will be converging in Suva to engage in considerations around the region’s 
<br/>tuna stocks and its development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $837,666 has been allocated for Fisheries Research Development to support 
<br/>the work currently being undertaken in terms of species identification for commercial development, 
<br/>region wide species stock assessments and species development along life cycles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the technical services, $123,024 has been allocated to allow for 
<br/>the  purchasing  of  technical  equipment  that  will  assist  with  maintenance  and  repair  works  of  the 
<br/>Ministry’s  technical  equipment  noting  that  there  are  23  ice  plants,  32  service  centres  and  43 
<br/>institutional quarters across the four divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of Aquaculture Development, $1.9 million has been allocated to 
<br/>cater  for  the  provision  of  technical  equipment  to  support  the  staff  and  further  supplement  the 
<br/>development of capital construction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of projects that are under “R”, a total of $150,000 is being provided 
<br/>for the upgrades of the Lautoka, Sigatoka and Ba Fisheries Stations, $500,000 is being provided for 
<br/>Coastal Fisheries Development, $700,000 is to support the Aquaculture Association Development 
<br/>Aspirations and $400,000 is to increase support to the Food Security Programme (FSP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for projects  that are not  under “R”, $400,000 is  provided to  cater to  the 
<br/>increase in solar panels at the Makogai Research Station, $100,000 to support Fisheries Research and 
<br/>Conservation; $230,000 to support the Cawaro Ice Plant; and $100,000 for the initial preparatory 
<br/>works for Natewa Fisheries Station and Natovi Fisheries Station.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $350,000  to  increase  the  support  provided  to  farmers  engaging  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commercial brackishwater fisheries and $170,000 towards seaweed development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry welcomes the allocation of $31.4 million for the 
<br/></span><span>2024 – 2025 financial year, an increase of more than 40 percent from the previous financial year.  
<br/></span><span>The  Ministry  will  continue  to  address  the  issues  of  degraded  forests  through  our  forest  and  eco-
<br/>system  restoration  programme  with  an  allocation  of  $2.5  million  in  the  next  financial  year.    The 
<br/>funding will strengthen and support our efforts on the reforestation of degraded landscapes, forest 
<br/>conservation and the reforestation of native and exotic species.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  will  contribute  to  forest  cover  whilst  contributing  to  our  emissions 
<br/>reduction  programme  and  Fiji’s  international  commitments  in  combating  climate  change.  The 
<br/>allocation  will  also  support  the  establishment  of  nursery,  purchase  of  seedlings,  plantation 
<br/>establishment and provide further incentive payments to communities engaging in the reforestation 
<br/>project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reforestation  activities  also  support  our  programme  on  Reducing 
<br/>Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme also known as REDD-Plus and its 
<br/>long-standing working arrangements with the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  welcomes  the  allocation  of  $1.2  million  for  this  project,  an  increase  of  44 
<br/>percent from the previous year to support the Readiness Phase of Carbon Trading to be implemented 
<br/>throughout Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and Taveuni, across 10 provinces, 20 districts and targeting 117 
<br/>villages and lay the strategy of operationalising the Look North Policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to expand pine projects to ensure socio-economic 
<br/>benefits of the Forestry sector including rehabilitation, rebuilding and economic development which 
<br/>is now extended to our maritime communities.  Recently, a jetty in Muani, Kadavu was constructed 
<br/>through  the  support  of  the  Ministry  to  enable  the  subsidised  transport  of  logs.    The  increase  of 
<br/>allocation  for  maritime  pine  development  and  the  commercial  maritime  pine  subsidy  from  $1.9 
<br/>million  to  more  than  $2.8  million  will  allow  the  Ministry  to  continue  its  efforts  in  extending  the 
<br/>maritime project to additional islands in the Lomaiviti Group and Lakeba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our vision to support our economy and provide opportunities to resource 
<br/>owners  through  the  development  of  Public-Private-Partnership  (PPP),  the  Ministry  welcomes  the 
<br/>allocation of $450,000, an increase of more than 100 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will  focus  on  upgrading  of  Colo-i-Suva  Forest  Parks,  establishment  of  new 
<br/>community  forest  parks  and  upgrading  of  existing  community  forest  parks.    The  successful 
<br/>operations  of  Colo-i-Suva  serves  as  a  model  for  the  establishment  of  other  community  parks  to 
<br/>benefit resource owners and to generate related economic activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will  continue  with  Phase  2  operations  for  Lutu  and  Nadarivatu  Community 
<br/>Forest Parks established in the current financial year and in the next financial year and will support 
<br/>the Look North Policy through targeting the upgrading of the existing Lavena Community Park in 
<br/>Taveuni as well as looking into unlocking the potential of developing the province of Bua through 
<br/>this initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will also extend the establishment of community forest parks 
<br/>into the Nadi district through converting natural resources into sightseeing opportunities for tourists 
<br/>and local visitors benefitting landowners, generating employment, boosting economic growth and 
<br/>further contributing to GDP growth.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also acknowledges the potential that exists in our cottage and small enterprise 
<br/>sector.  The development of Cottage Industries in Fiji remains a priority for the Ministry to enhance 
<br/></span><span>landowner involvement in the sector.  The budgetary allocation for the Forest Subsidy Programme 
<br/></span><span>of $200,000 will provide financial support for new and existing small cottage industries. Funds will 
<br/>be  utilised  to  procure  woodworking  machines  and  equipment  to  support  youths,  women  and 
<br/>community-based businesses who will, in turn, contribute to the growth of the sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  welcomes  the  new  allocation  of  $1.1  million  for  the  full 
<br/>upgrade of the Timber Industry Training Workshop and purchase of technical equipment to improve

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Community Development Training will continue in the next financial year for 
<br/>house construction, chainsaw training and portable sawmill training and work attachments facilitated 
<br/>by the Ministry through our Timber Industry Training Centre (TITC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to support the plantation sector both the Fiji Pine Limited 
<br/>in accessing pines from Maritime Pine Schemes woodlots and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited 
<br/>to  support  their  certification  process  as  well  as  restructure  for  improved  governance  and  more 
<br/>landowner engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Landowner Trusts for both of these companies, Fiji Pine Trust Extension 
<br/>and Fiji Mahogany Trust will receive a grant of $1.7 million and $0.5 million respectively.  This will 
<br/>allow  landowner  training  and  development  to  generate  revenue  from  their  resources  through  the 
<br/>Trust. Mr Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I commend and support the 2024-2025 Budget and I 
<br/>thank you for the opportunity to speak. </span><span>

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution on the recent Budget that was delivered by 
<br/>the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.  Firstly, we must give credit where credit is due 
<br/></span><span>and at the outset, thanking Government for the pay rise allocated to the civil servants and ordinary 
<br/></span><span>Fijian workers.  Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an issue that has grappled the Vatukoula gold 
<br/>miners for over a decade, now about 368 mining workers and families have shared tears of joy about 
<br/>the decision to pay out the Vatukoula strike settlement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the most welcoming news to all workers who are members of the FNPF 
<br/>was the increase on the return on investment from 7 percent to 8 percent. This will increase every

<br/>would like to thank the Government as well for approving the celebration of a Melanesian Day that 
<br/>will  be  held  in  Suva  later  this  year  and  this  has  never  been  done  before.  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei Affairs for again confirming that to fellow Melanesians community members in 
<br/>Navutu, Lautoka over the weekend. This is a start towards the right direction and certainly brings a 
<br/>new  lease  of  life  to  us,  Melanesians,  as  we  continue  to  cry  for  justice  and  equality  towards  all 
<br/>Melanesian descendants living in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking about reforms and incentives brought by Government through 
<br/>Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), it is disheartening to inform this august Parliament, that 
<br/>majority  of  us  Melanesians  living  in  our  Melanesian settlements  cannot  apply  for  their  own 
<br/>money to improve their living condition in some of the communities they live in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many were turned away from FNPF and having to hide their tears, just 
<br/>to be told that they cannot access their funds because the land they reside in is not theirs and they 
<br/>cannot access their eligibility to even improve their living standard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge Government if a leeway can be given or</span><span> </span><span>may be, some sort of 
<br/>consent to allow them to access their funds such as their housing eligibility, to raise their standard 
<br/>of living and empower them economically. We have close to 40 communities around Fiji and 
<br/>wherever  we  live,  we  have  called  it  as  our  </span><span>Koro</span><span>  (village),  and  we  have  hold our  Melanesian 
<br/>Communities close to our heart.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I bring your attention to an issue that is highlighted by the media 
<br/>last year that 75 percent of  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  are living  in  poverty. I</span><span> </span><span>wanted to  hear during the Budget 
<br/>Address  as  to  how  Government  will  tackle  this  issue  and,  at  the  same  time,  empower  the 
<br/>indigenous owners of this land to get them away from poverty, or even introduce schemes that 
<br/>will empower indigenous Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kevaka era na sega ni qaravi vakavinaka na i taukei ni vanua kei na vei Turaga Bale kei 
<br/>na Marama Bale ni yasana e 14 ni noda vanua, ena sukusukura tikoga na gaunisala eda muria, 
<br/>ka na baya tikoga na noda veiqaravi.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand that an SME funding has been allocated, but I felt that Government should 
<br/>have  allocated  more,  given  the  increase  in  the  interest  of  forming  cooperatives  from  rural 
<br/>communities and rural villages around Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the cooperative idea, it 
<br/>enhances  the  idea  of  venturing  into  business,  but  we  do  it  in  a  more  traditional way  of 
<br/></span><span>solesolevaki</span><span>, where all members have a fair share of the profit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I turn your attention to an area that I am so passionate about and, 
<br/>that is, sports. I do understand that majority of our athletes are young people, but I always believe 
<br/>that sports should be standalone on its own, given the growth  and the economic return it can 
<br/></span><span>project to our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From my observation, when clinic and awareness is done regarding any sports, there is 
<br/>age limitation and sometimes it caters only for the youth. With sports, this should not be the case.  
<br/>Sports  awareness  and  clinic  should  not  be  limited  to  any  age  group  and  sports  development 
<br/>should be done across</span><span> </span><span>all levels of society.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1033 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Nasinu 
<br/>Town  Council,  Mr.  Felix  Magnus,  for  his  vision  and  innovation  in  partnering  with  Nasinu 
<br/>Volleyball to pilot a model that can revive the sport of volleyball and take it to greater heights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now speaking of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I</span><span> </span><span>call on the honourable Minister for Youth and 
<br/>Sports to seek more dialogue with the Fiji Sports Commission as to how they can reach the very 
<br/>heart of our rural communities through sports development and empowerment.  I do</span><span> </span><span>understand 
<br/>that there have been talks by Government to review the Fiji Sports Commission and this is in 
<br/>terms of funding as well, however, I want to question as to why review an organisation that has 
<br/>been very effective, and they closely monitor and scrutinize every sporting body that do receive 
<br/>funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the minority sports fund is what I was more interested about during the 
<br/>Budget  Address  and  how  minor  sports  can  be  best  developed  to  compete  at  the  highest 
<br/>level.  Most of minority sports do access funding from the Fiji Sports Commission and through 
<br/>the Office of the Prime Minister, should have more access to these funding, given the extent of 
<br/>work  they  do  and  the  accountability  and  transparency  of  demanding  acquittals  from  various 
<br/>minor sporting bodies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted a decrease in funding for sports ground in the rural areas. A 
<br/>lot of the rugby teams in</span><span> </span><span>the Skipper Cup competition and various </span><span>Vanua</span><span> teams in the B Division 
<br/>do  not  have  an  official  ground  on  their  own.  This  allocation  should  increase,  given  the  rapid 
<br/>growth  of  the  game  of  rugby  in  our  rural  areas  with  both,  our  Fijian  Drua  and  Fijiana  Drua, 
<br/>performing exceptionally well at the Super Rugby Competition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we need to invest more on this, and we cannot develop our local players to the 
<br/>standard that is required at international level, if the lack of standard playground continues to be a 
<br/>major concern.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with the Budget being delivered with a lot of bold promises and assurance, now 
<br/>the hardest part is how Government, and in this case, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will deliver to the 
<br/>people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are here to serve for the best interest for all Fijians and most importantly, be the change 
<br/>that they wanted. And if this demand some independent Opposition Members like me to assist and 
<br/>support the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister to govern the people of Fiji, then I am more 
<br/>than happy and willing to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  will  not  stop  us,  as  independent  Members  supporting  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister,  to  address  something  we  feel  may  be  detrimental  to  the  people  of 
<br/>Fiji. The bottom line is, we are here for the people, we are bounded by the people and no matter what 
<br/>it takes, we need to put our body on the line for the sake of ensuring that the voices of the people are 
<br/>heard in this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to conclude, I have already mentioned this in Parliament and, please, allow me 
<br/></span><span>to say this again, if not us, then who, if not now, then when?  We, as Members of Parliament, need 
<br/>to show the people of Fiji that we must take action now and not to wait for someone else, rather than 
<br/>being considered as a bystander which will make us part of the problem and not bringing any solution 
<br/>to issues concerning the people of Fiji. </span><span>Vinaka Vakalevu</span><span> and God Bless Fiji.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, honourable Bia, for your contribution.  I now call upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable and learned Attorney-General to make his Maiden Speech. The floor is yours, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, my fellow citizens; I wish to 
<br/>pay my respects to the traditional landowners of the land upon which this Parliament sits. </span><span>Vakaturaga 
<br/>saka ena vanua vakaturaga o Nadonumai, vei ira na Gone Turaga na Roko Tui Suva</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  thank  and  congratulate  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for his Budget Address, and 
<br/>wish to comment briefly on the allocation for the Office of the Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  welcome  the  allocation  to  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  and  in 
<br/>particular,  to  the  different  entities  that  come  under  my  ministerial  portfolio.  They  have  all  had 
<br/>significant increases. The increases, though come with increased responsibilities and deliverables, I 
<br/>have stressed to my staff, Mr. Speaker, that the general public expects us to work harder and to deliver 
<br/>more.  Money  to  run  the  Government  does  not  come  easily.    It  comes  from  the  taxpayers  of  this 
<br/>country to whom we are all accountable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to briefly comment on my role as the Attorney-General of Fiji. I 
<br/>come  to  this  role  unhindered  by  membership  of  any  political  party.  It  allows  me  a  degree  of 
<br/>independence, unavailable to an Attorney-General who is an elected Member of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it affords me the opportunity to speak with greater candour and objectivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will try to use that privilege wisely and respectfully at all times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  see  my  role  as  the  Attorney-General  to  give  the  best  legal  advice  to  Cabinet  and  the 
<br/>Government,  consistent  with  the  laws  of  Fiji.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not  my  role  to  do  what  is 
<br/>politically expedient or convenient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I view the unique role of the Attorney-General as a fundamental pillar of the rule of law in 
<br/>this country.  In its simplest formulation, the rule of law ensures that no one, including the elected 
<br/>Government of the day, or any public official, is above the law.  The rule of law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>does not mean rule by law.  Rule of law does not mean rule by law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent conviction of a former president in one of the most powerful countries in the world 
<br/>for falsifying business records, is an important reminder that be you ever so high, the law is above 
<br/>you.  It is a lesson that we, in this country, could well bear in mind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rule of law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the foundation of our system of government.   There is 
<br/>not one set of laws for the powerful and another for the powerless; one for the rich, and one for the 
<br/>poor; depending on one’s race, or ethnicity, or religion.  Sir, the rule of law ensures that executive 
<br/>power is not exercised arbitrarily.  The rule of law will promote a peaceful country and build more 
<br/>effective and accountable institutions at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Attorney-General, as the guardian of the rule of law, is tasked with upholding the public 
<br/>interest.  It is my intention to discharge my constitutional duty apolitically.  I am not a politician.  
<br/>First and foremost, I am a lawyer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the Solicitor-General, my responsibility extends to broad oversight of civil litigation, 
<br/>by or against the State.  The State is supposed to be the model litigant.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, put simply, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1035 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it means that Government lawyers must first obey the law and abide by the ethical obligations which 
<br/>apply to all legal practitioners.  They must act fairly at all times and with complete propriety, and in 
<br/>accordance with the highest professional standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is part of my duty to promote respect for the law in all Government affairs.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  under  our  system  of  law,  as  a  member  of  the  Cabinet,  I  am  collectively  responsible  and 
<br/>accountable to this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to mention some matters that form part of my vision as Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Code of Conduct, the requirement of a Code of Conduct for leaders, including the 
<br/>honourable Ministers and Members of Parliament is contained in Section 149 of the Constitution.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Code of Conduct Bill 2016 (Bill No. 22 of 2016) was first introduced in Parliament in 
<br/>April 2016 and read for the first time on that date.   It was later read for the second time in late April 
<br/>2016.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/>Rights.  Whilst still under review in that Standing Committee, Parliament was dissolved, in which 
<br/>case, the Bill lapsed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has a constitutional obligation to give effect to Section 149. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Codes of Conduct already exist in the public service and in many private companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  far  back  as  1996,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Reeves  Commission,  whose  work  led  to  the 
<br/>adoption of the 1997 Constitution had recommended that the Constitution should have an Integrity 
<br/>Code, which is similar to a Code of Conduct.  This</span><span> </span><span>was to ensure, Mr. Speaker, that national leaders 
<br/>did not use</span><span> </span><span>their offices for personal gain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Code of Conduct forms an important part of the integrity system of Government.  It will 
<br/>encourage ethical conduct, reduce risks to the integrity of Government, and the Parliament, as the 
<br/>paramount political institution, and enable it to perform its functions more effectively.  This will help 
<br/>to enhance transparency and public accountability of our leaders</span><span>, </span><span>strengthening the public's trust in 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, intend to seek Cabinet's approval to commence work on the 
<br/>drafting of legislation to implement a Code of Conduct with a view to its early introduction in this 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Freedom of Information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Information Act was passed as far back 
<br/>as 2018. Regrettably, however, it has not commenced. The delay in implementing the Information 
<br/>Act is unfortunate. It is my intention to go to Cabinet as soon as possible and seek its support to give 
<br/>effect to this law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public  access  to  government-held  information  is  important.  It  allows  individuals  to  better 
<br/></span><span>understand the role of Government and the decisions that are being made on their behalf.  When our 
<br/>citizens  are  informed,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  can  be  held  accountable  for  its  actions  and 
<br/>policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once the Act is in force, it will allow access to information to improve the lives of the people, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>making available to them information relating to education, healthcare, and other public services.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The right to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is central for upholding other basic human rights, for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promoting transparency, justice and development. It underpins and strengthens our democracy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  intend  to  seek  the  endorsement  of  Cabinet  to  proceed  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation of this law as soon as practicable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Legal Aid Commission, Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 26th year of the Legal Aid 
<br/>Commission's establishment.  The Commission plays a pivotal role in the administration of justice</span><span>. 
<br/></span><span>It provides a range of legal services to those who would, otherwise, be left without help. It helps to 
<br/>ensure equal justice, particularly for the poorest and the most vulnerable in our community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some respects, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Legal Aid Commission has become the victim of its 
<br/>own success.</span><span> </span><span>This has resulted in the workload of the Commission lawyers increasing, and this has 
<br/>required additional funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we have to recognise that there will come a time where the Commission must accept that 
<br/>there are limits to its continued expansion.</span><span> </span><span>There are budgetary constraints and demands for resources 
<br/>from other departments. It might be an opportune time to review the guidelines and means testing for 
<br/>legal  aid  to  stem the flow of cases and applications for assistance.  From its original  intention of 
<br/>dealing with family law issues and representing accused in criminal trials, it is now drafting wills and 
<br/>dealing with estate matters from the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While I recognise that this is about accessing justice, this has led to an expansion of legal 
<br/>services from its original purpose.  It may be time to reconsider what the core service of the Legal 
<br/>Aid Commission should be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully accept that access to justice should not just be for 
<br/>the rich and the powerful, it should be for everyone. A society that values liberty and justice for all 
<br/>must ensure that our citizens, especially the poorest, are able to have access to legal aid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Human  Rights  &amp;  Anti-Discrimination  Commission  (HRADC),  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  an 
<br/>independent constitutional body established under the Constitution. Its job is to monitor, protect and 
<br/>promote the human rights of all.   The Commission opened its first-ever regional office in Lautoka 
<br/>in  March  this  year.  The  Lautoka  office,  Mr.  Speaker,  means  that  people  in  the  West  and  the 
<br/>surrounding  areas  are  able  to  access  its  services.    I  understand  there  are  plans  for  other  regional 
<br/>offices around Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission presently has a staff of 12 and it has a Complaints and Awareness Section 
<br/>with  only  two  persons  per  team.    This  is  not  enough  to  handle  complaints  from  throughout  Fiji. 
<br/>Between 2022 to April 2024, the Complaints Section received more than 800 complaints.  I have 
<br/>already  started  discussions  with  the  Director  of  that  Commission  and  others  to  explore  how  the 
<br/>capacity and staffing of the Commission might be strengthened.  It is my intention in the coming 
<br/>months to work closely with the Commission and to give it as much support as is needed to ensure 
<br/>that Fiji has a national human rights institution which is effective and credible.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>am committed to working with the Commission so that it meets minimum international standards, 
<br/></span><span>founded on pluralism, independence and effectiveness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption  (FICAC),  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a 
<br/>constitutional body set up to receive, investigate and prosecute various crimes, including bribery and 
<br/>corruption.  FICAC is independent in the performance of its functions and is not subject to the control 
<br/>or the direction of any person or authority.  By law, FICAC is required to provide updates and advise 
<br/>the Attorney-General on matters relating to its functions and responsibilities. That is as far as it goes. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1037 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, my office does not have any legal powers to tell FICAC what to do.  One might ask then, 
<br/>so who is FICAC answerable to? Broadly speaking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC is answerable to the 
<br/>law and to the people of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a functioning and effective FICAC needs strong and experienced leadership.  
<br/>I am pleased to say, the position of Commissioner of FICAC has been recently advertised and it is 
<br/>my hope that the position can be filled as soon as possible. There is much unfinished business before 
<br/>FICAC. Individuals responsible for stealing from the public purse in the recent past must be held 
<br/>accountable  for  past  wrongdoing  and  crime.  The  public  interest  demands  this.  If  the  anecdotal 
<br/>evidence is to be believed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been serious dipping into public funds in the 
<br/>past, some of it in possible breach of the law. Those responsible must face the full brunt of the law. 
<br/>With the recent budgetary allocation to the Commission, they have the resources to deliver what the 
<br/>public and the law expects of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC has cases going back as far as 2014. I was told by their staff that it 
<br/>was hard to get confirmed dates of hearing in court. There were part heard matters before the courts, 
<br/>and many FICAC cases were stuck in the long criminal lists awaiting their turn. There may be a need 
<br/>to restore a dedicated "corruption court", and I intend to liaise closely with stakeholders in order to 
<br/>consider this justification for it, if any.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, corruption and poor governance are security challenges which undermine 
<br/>democracy,  the  rule  of  law  and  economic  development.  The  FICAC  must  carry  out  their  duties 
<br/>fearlessly however difficult or inconvenient and go where the facts and the evidence takes them.  This 
<br/>will go some way to restoring trust in government, but FICAC must never again be used as a weapon 
<br/>to remove or punish the Government's political opponents.  That would be an abuse of power and 
<br/>unacceptable. Fiji is not a police or totalitarian state.  There can be no returning to the dark days of 
<br/>tyranny where agents of the state were routinely sent to the homes of people who disagreed with the 
<br/>government.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.E.  LEUNG.-    On  Law  Reform  Commission,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  heard 
<br/>respectfully the comments of the honourable Leader of the Opposition with respect to law reform.  I 
<br/>look forward to working with the members of the Government and the Opposition to identify laws 
<br/>that need review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Law reform, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is vital to the legal system and the country.  Fiji’s laws must 
<br/>keep abreast with the changing social, economic, legal and political developments in the country and 
<br/>outside it.  Globalization and the rapid  pace of technological  innovation  will require a  change of 
<br/>mindset and possibly laws.  It will affect the way we do business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Artificial Intelligence, cybercrime, money laundering, new trading agreements and climate 
<br/>change means that Fiji must be ready to deal with new and emerging problems.  Many of Fiji’s laws 
<br/>were  inherited  from  when  Fiji  was  a  British  colony.    Many  are  outdated  and  often  written  in  a 
<br/>language  and  style  better  suited  to  that  era.    Some  laws  are  unclear,  complicated  and  difficult  to 
<br/></span><span>understand.  Laws should be clear and predictable.  I hasten to say that we cannot cure all the ills in 
<br/></span><span>our country by passing more and more laws.  Too many laws can add to more bureaucracy and more 
<br/>bottlenecks to development.  What is sorely needed is greater and more effective law enforcement of 
<br/>existing laws.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  early  discussions  I  have  had  with  the  Commissioner  Director,  I  have  suggested  that 
<br/>consideration be given to appointing part time Commissioners to spearhead particular reviews on

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>special law reform issues.  Reform and development of the laws of Fiji will help achieve coherent 
<br/>and accessible laws that reflect the heritage and aspirations of the diverse communities that comprise 
<br/>our country.  In consultation with my colleagues in the Cabinet, I intend to work closely with the 
<br/>Law Reform Commission and prioritize laws that need urgent introduction, review or amendment.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Accountability and Transparency Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that 
<br/>the setting up of the Accountability and Transparency Commission is crucial and overdue and I intend 
<br/>to  make  every  effort  to  put  in  place  the  legislative  measures  to  enable  the  Commission  to  be 
<br/>established.  This will be a further step towards promoting good governance, reducing corruption and 
<br/>building trust among our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission will bring about greater accountability in government.  It will help to ensure 
<br/>that public officials are held accountable, leading to fairer treatment of people.  When people can see 
<br/>how decisions are made and how funds are allocated and spent, it will strengthen their confidence in 
<br/>government and our democratic institutions.  The Commission, when established will contribute to 
<br/>good  governance  which  is  reflected  in  Fiji’s  National  Development  Plan  and  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Judiciary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an independent impartial honest and competent Judiciary is 
<br/>essential to upholding the rule of law, to bring about public confidence and dispensing justice.  The 
<br/>Judiciary has a vital role in upholding the rule of law, a role which is respected by this Government.  
<br/>Government,  seen broadly,  is  at its most effective when this respect  is  mirrored both  ways.  I do 
<br/>mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my lengthy speech that the courts have suffered delays in the delivery 
<br/>of judgements and rulings.  Long delays are a sign of stress in the system and that things are not 
<br/>working  as  they  should.  People  start  losing  confidence  in  the  legal  system  and  the  courts  when 
<br/>disputes take too long to resolve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The judges are aware of the problem of delays in the courts.  An efficient judicial system is 
<br/>crucial  to  attracting  new  foreign  investment  into  the  country.    It  is  vital  in  ensuring  social  and 
<br/>economic  progress.    I  am  pleased  to  say  that  the  Civil  Division  Rules  Committee  comprising  a 
<br/>number of senior judges and magistrates has just completed its work on how legislation and rules 
<br/>governing  the  courts  might  be  amended  to  bring  about  greater  efficiency.  The  whole  system, 
<br/>however, may need a complete overhaul to streamline and simplify court proceedings and processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1994, the Government commissioned a review into the workings of the courts.  That was 
<br/>over 30 years ago.  Sir, David Beattie’s Inquiry into the courts was duly tabled as a parliamentary 
<br/>paper.  A follow up review may be necessary.  Alternate dispute resolution, arbitration and mediation 
<br/>are some options which should also be explored to reduce some of the pressures on the court system.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  localisation  in  the  Judiciary.    However, 
<br/>localisation must not be an end itself, and should never come at the expense of compromising on 
<br/>competence, integrity and maturity.  Carefully selected expatriate judicial officers have the advantage 
<br/>of minimal or no ties to the country.  Ideally, there should be a good mix of locals and expatriate 
<br/>judges.  The latter can play a big role in mentoring young judicial officers.  I am pleased to note that 
<br/>at the level of Supreme Court and Court of Appeal, this is already happening.  Perhaps it can extend 
<br/></span><span>to the High Court as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  a  small  country  such  as  Fiji,  having  outsiders  with  no  local  links  to  preside  over 
<br/>controversial cases, especially with political overtones can be reassuring.  I would like to see more 
<br/>judicial appointments  drawn from  the private bar, and not  confined  to  Government  lawyers only.  
<br/>This is standard practice in other places such as New Zealand and Australia.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1039 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in  2021, assessors in  criminal  trials  were abolished.   It  had  been part of our 
<br/>criminal justice system for over 100 years.  Fiji’s history has shown that the system worked.  The 
<br/>value of the  assessor system  is  that it provided an important  check  and balance on judges sitting 
<br/>alone.  I believe it introduced a greater element of fairness in criminal trials.  In my view, the removal 
<br/>of assessors has resulted in an important safeguard and oversight in criminal trials being lost.  I intend 
<br/>consulting relevant stakeholders, including the judiciary on whether assessors in criminal trials in 
<br/>High Court should be restored.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nationhood, Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, with your indulgence as this is my maiden speech, I 
<br/>just wish to conclude with some comments on nationhood.  For better or worse, circumstances and 
<br/>history have brought together the various people who call Fiji home.  It is the duty and responsibility 
<br/>of every citizen of this country to break down the barriers that have kept the different races in silos 
<br/>for far too long.  It will require that we teach today’s youth to be tolerant, open-minded and concerned 
<br/>about each other’s past, and considerate of each other’s heritage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  fifty  years  after  Independence,  our  sense  of  nationhood  remains 
<br/>underdeveloped.  We need a renewed understanding and commitment to nationhood.  We often talk 
<br/>about citizens’ rights.  However, we should also talk about citizens’ responsibilities.  The two go 
<br/>hand in hand.  This requires, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a commitment to realising that we are one people with 
<br/>a common destiny.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our multi-ethnic fabric is a cause for celebration, and we are richer for it.  Irrespective of race 
<br/>or religion, our diverse communities have many shared values, including a strong commitment to 
<br/>family, children and the aged.  With goodwill, tolerance and understanding, we can build a stronger 
<br/>and more prosperous Fiji and our country will be better for it.  The process will be challenging, but 
<br/>it is our duty as citizens to try.  We cannot postpone or delay this sacred duty of together, building 
<br/>our nation.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the future of our country lies in all our hands.  It must not be hijacked by 
<br/>insular politicians bent on division and sowing the seeds of distrust.  This has set us back and has 
<br/>come at great cost, in both human and financial terms.  Despite all its trials and political upheavals, 
<br/>Fiji is still a beautiful country and as the honourable Prime Minister mentioned this morning, it is our 
<br/>home, it is your home, it is my home.  For all its faults and frailties, Fiji remains a country full of 
<br/>promise and hope, underpinned by the enduring goodwill of our people that has survived the political 
<br/>shocks which  at  times, have driven us  close to  the abyss.   Achieving  full nationhood will not  be 
<br/>achieved overnight, but by steady incremental steps, and it will require leadership, statesmanship and 
<br/>courage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I truly believe that the failure to attain a real sense of nationhood will impede our national 
<br/>development.  If we do not work hard to develop a sense of community at the national level, we will 
<br/>possess neither the energy nor the force to pool together our resources to realise our common vision 
<br/>and shared goals.  The simple truth is that we need each other.  As the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>said, we can do this together.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our love of Fiji is</span><span> </span><span>central to achieving national unity, social cohesion and people-
<br/></span><span>centred  development.  Nationhood  in  its  ideal  state  will  bring  with  it  the  promise  of  healing  our 
<br/></span><span>ethnically fragmented national psyche. Our problems must be resolved through reasoned debate in an 
<br/>atmosphere of civility and respect.  Honourable Members of Parliament must set the example because 
<br/>our people will take their cue from our leaders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us not be so easily discouraged or distracted by the noise generated by some politicians 
<br/>and their sponsors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe as a country that our best days are ahead of us. I want

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to refer to a popular musician, Apakuki Nalawa.  You will excuse me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I speak in 
<br/>vernacular. In the lyrics of his later song, Kuki as he is known sings:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Isa noqu Viti, o cei beka me na liutaka</span><span>; </span><span>na noda kalougata sa tu voli</span><span> </span><span>ga </span><span>e </span><span>ligada, 
<br/>taura matua na nona vosa, ka mo na cakacaka taka, ni sai koya oqori na sala kina me 
<br/>bula ko Viti ni mataka."  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, he is saying, “With great leadership, comes great responsibilities. Who will lead us</span><span>
<br/></span><span>to a better Fiji?  Who will set a great example for the younger generation to follow?  The power is 
<br/>in your hands, our leaders.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my fervent prayer that I will approach the responsibilities 
<br/>that come with my office</span><span> </span><span>with a heart of a servant. It is</span><span> </span><span>my solemn pledge today that I will discharge 
<br/>my constitutional duties without fear or favour, malice or ill will and that I will at all times respect 
<br/>the rule of law and do what is right by the people of this country. May God bless Fiji.

<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Attorney-General, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, I rise today to deliver my response to the 2024-2025 National Budget that was delivered 
<br/>on the 28th June, 2024 by the honourable Minister for Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is my 11th Budget response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2014 and out of the previous Budget 
<br/>that I have responded to back in 2021, I had supported the Government on a Budget being a Member 
<br/>of the Opposition.  But this occasion is totally different, Sir, I am rising today as an Independent 
<br/>Member of Parliament,  and it  is  public knowledge now that we have pledged our support to  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Listening to the debate this week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, plus the observation, it will be a very 
<br/>hard transition given some of the deliberations coming from this side of Parliament, given we have 
<br/>to transit or in transition from being a member of a political party to become Independent Members 
<br/>of Parliament.  So that political party thinking as somewhat entrenched in us given the very unique 
<br/>situation we are in.  As you very well understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given that there are also grey 
<br/>areas in the 2013 Constitution plus our Standing Orders, probably this particular situation will make 
<br/>us think deeply on how we have to improve the laws to accommodate such unique situations that we 
<br/>are in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before, I move further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for your wisdom and also 
<br/>your  decision  in  the  past  few  months  that  has  enabled  us,  most  of  the  Members  on  this  side  of 
<br/>Parliament, 17 of us to keep our seats and not vacate our seats.  We thank you for your confidence 
<br/>in us, given that our party that has been deregistered, had abandoned us by trying to terminate us, 
<br/>but I thank you that you were able to hear our side of the story and also with the decision that you 
<br/>concluded  from  the  various  legal  opinions  that  you  have  sought,  you  came  with  that  particular 
<br/></span><span>decision for us to continue as Members of Parliament, not vacating our seats.  Also, the situation 
<br/></span><span>that led to that is very well known, given that I was also part of the Emoluments Committee that was 
<br/>tasked by this Parliament to prove back the motion that was very much a controversy in the last 
<br/>sitting of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the 16 of us who actually voted for 
<br/>the motion for trusting the process and participating in the process.  As the honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1041 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition had publicly said, that its integrity that we had to participate in the process.  Whether 
<br/>you have voted for the motion or not, and whether you have abstained or not, come 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024, 
<br/>it will be effective.  I think we will all be part of the benefits of that particular motion.  Some of us 
<br/>chose not to vote, some of us abstained and some of us deliberately stayed out of the Chambers to 
<br/>evade the vote, but again, most of us voted according to the process that we participated in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, I have already said what I have said to thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the 
<br/>Budget and the expectations of the people, I thank the Government for establishing the Economic 
<br/>Summit Committee.  A few weeks ago, the Chairperson of that Economic Summit Committee also 
<br/>expressed  some  of  the  views  where  the  Government  can  improve  its  performance,  especially,  in 
<br/>service delivery and in other areas where that particular Committee sees that Government is lacking 
<br/>behind.    It  is  a  good  set  up,  given  that  it  becomes  a  mirror  to  the  Government  to  improve  its 
<br/>performance, especially in service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to acknowledge what the honourable Prime Minister had said in opening the 
<br/>Kadavu Provincial Council Meeting.  He spoke in </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> especially to the Government officials in 
<br/>the province, given they are the people who will be implementing all these programmes.  The Budget 
<br/>needs to be with the civil servants who are at the divisional level and also in various Government 
<br/>Ministries as they are fully aware of what has been announced and passed to help them move in the 
<br/>communities  and  make  people  understand  what  the  programmes  are,  where  the  forms  will  be 
<br/>available, and to assist the  </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span>, </span><span>mata ni tikina</span><span> and the various community leaders who 
<br/>make up the development committees of our various divisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  pleased  to  hear,  and  also  thank  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary  for  Finance,  Mr.  Shiri  Gounder.    We  hear  this  morning  there  are  plenty  arguments  on 
<br/>economics  and  figures,  but  the  very  same  people  who  had  made  the  budget  with  the  previous 
<br/>Government are the very same people who have done this budget.  They will be the ones who will 
<br/>know very well what is the financial standing and the policy advice they had given to the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance that has allowed them to make the budget that is before us.  We thank them for 
<br/>the hard work, most of them have not slept for nights probably in trying to put up the Estimates plus 
<br/>the Consequential Bill with the team from FRCS.  That will be reflected in the various changes in 
<br/>the Budget announced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are pleased to hear that the economy is recovering, given that the previous Government 
<br/>had put  in  an Economic Recovery Plan, and the Coalition Government has continued it.  We are 
<br/>pleased to hear from the Supplement of the Budget that the GDP is surpassing pre-pandemic levels 
<br/>in 2023 and Fiji’s economic recovery is one of the fastest amongst the other tourism based dependent 
<br/>countries.  That is due to the bold and decisive decision by the previous administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I also thank the current honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Finance 
<br/>and the Coalition Government for carrying  that  forward.  That  is  for  Fiji  and not  for a particular 
<br/>political party, it is for the people moving forward.  We are also pleased to hear that the Government 
<br/>will be launching a National Development Plan for 2025 to 2029 and also a vision to 2050.  I heard 
<br/>this  morning  from  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  that  the  Budget  has  been  announced 
<br/>without a National Development Plan.  But, again, it is never too late, given even in the previous 
<br/></span><span>Government, the NDP came in 2017 when it was launched in Bonn, Germany in COP 23.  Even that 
<br/></span><span>was three years after the 2014 General Election. So, we are never late. We cannot say that there is no 
<br/>plan because they also had in the past where the NDP came even three years later.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The focus of the Budget, as I have already said, needs to focus on the 2030 SDGs on reduction 
<br/>of  poverty,  education,  healthcare,  affordable  housing,  empowering  women  and  protection  of 
<br/>children, people with disabilities, plus other 17 goals that are there in the UN SDGs.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whenever a Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, moves to give our report on whether Government 
<br/>is achieving these Goals, this is other areas where we always see where the Government has put the 
<br/>money into achieving these Goals.  We have seen the continuation of previous programmes and the 
<br/>continuing programmes, the bus fare assistance, health assistance, pension schemes, are all areas that 
<br/>are targeting the goals and now we are faring with the SDGs. We see that continuing pattern in the 
<br/>Budget that we have today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would like to  thank the Government  for the increase  of minimum  wage.  There is 
<br/>plenty  public  reactions,  but  it  is  a  balancing  act,  given  that  the  employers’  situation  need  to  be 
<br/>considered because employers are paying PAYE and also FNPF of their employees.  Whether it is 
<br/>an increase whether of 50 cents or $1, we thank the Government for doing that. We also hope that 
<br/>the Government will look into other areas where they can cushion the increase in the cost of living. 
<br/>Few of the honourable Members who have spoken previously have highlighted this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE), I thank the Government for the JEE for Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service and also the independent bodies, especially Parliament, given it came through our Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights as part of our recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, we celebrated the Civil Service Day. Most of them were really happy and it is a 
<br/>double celebration, not only after a long time where they came together as Ministries and creating 
<br/>their bond, but  they are  also  happy with  the pay rise announced by the  Government.  It was long 
<br/>overdue, but we thank them for the commitment and hard work put towards in moving our country 
<br/>forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund  (FNPF),  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  welcome  the 
<br/>reinstatement of payments since 2011 for pensioners, and also the 8 percent that will be credited into 
<br/>individual members’ account that was announced last week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  the  other  thing  that  will  be  coming  in  the  Consequential  Bill  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance had talked about where this particular Bill that will be part of the Consequential 
<br/>Bill will allow the partial or full transfer from a member’s fund to another member, especially when 
<br/>we want to build onto the legacy of our children. These are some of the things that will improve 
<br/>future investment when investment comes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On education assistance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many education systems that are there 
<br/>and also the competency-based training. I thank the honourable Minister for the continuation of those 
<br/>programmes from pre-school right to tertiary level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the targeted approaches for indigenous businesses, I would like to thank the Government 
<br/>for the programme to assist indigenous businesses, especially in tax free zones, where they will not 
<br/>be paying taxes. That will be a big boost for indigenous businesses, especially the existing ones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, moving from the first business to diversify in trying to invest in other areas, I 
<br/>would like to also thank the Government for the removal of interest free loan that will be available 
<br/>through the facilities that will be helping us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My plea also to the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, given that provincial companies 
<br/>and </span><span>tikina</span><span> companies that are in operation for the last 25 years where they have even paid the principal 
<br/>amount, if Government can also waive those debts so that we can then benefit from the two policies 
<br/>that  have  been  announced.  That  will  be  very  great,  moving  forward,  especially  in  encouraging 
<br/>indigenous businesses and empowering the indigenous people economically.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1043 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For public works, water, road and infrastructure, electricity and energy in the rural areas, it 
<br/>will be the duty of all Civil Servants to tell them how this assistance will be coming and probably the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Transport  and  Meteorological  Services  will  list  down  the 
<br/>areas that will be of focus in this financial year that we have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  allocation  for  Farm  Mechanisation  and  also  Farm  Access 
<br/>Road, the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways is leading the way. In creating farm 
<br/>road access, that will empower our farmers in the rural areas. Sometimes you have to walk for hours, 
<br/>some without horses, to bring their produced to a particular area so that they can sell them.  So, these 
<br/>are some of the areas of focus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the theme of the Budget is an economically stable, secure and 
<br/>sustainable Fiji and from what I have spoken so far about and also the outline that is already there, I 
<br/>would say that the Budget meets the requirement that will achieve the SDGs. a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I conclude, I would like to thank on behalf of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> leaders, the allowances that 
<br/>they are receiving which is really helpful in their </span><span>vanua</span><span> and church obligations, given the amount of 
<br/>‘</span><span>oga</span><span>’ that we cannot evade.  But this particular allowance has helped our </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> and the 
<br/></span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I welcome the Review of the iTaukei and Fisheries Commission and the implementation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the GCC implementation team, plus implementation of the UNDRIP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  resource  owners  support  and  development  fund  that  will  be  there.    The 
<br/>Native Reserves Commission, its establishment plus the inquiry that can be done to address some of 
<br/>the long-standing land injustices, plus the resettlement committee that can be established, plus an 
<br/>inquiry probably led by a Judge or Magistrate to hear these historical injustices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see that I have only about 18 seconds left, the 
<br/>Budget has progressively addressed, moving towards achieving the various SDGs that I have already 
<br/>said.  It will increase domestic consumption and spending, it will allow more investment in growing 
<br/>the economy, it gives space and options for the people to economically empower themselves in order 
<br/>to cushion the cost of living, but there could be other things that could be done to improve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I fully support the 2024-2025 National Budget.  </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today, in this august Parliament, to lend my 
<br/>full support to the 2024-2025 National Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, the Fijian economy has recovered strongly from the pandemic, 
<br/>with  fiscal  deficit and debt  to  GDP ratio continuing  to  decline but  remain at  elevated levels.  The 
<br/>monetary  policy  has  remained  accommodative,  although  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  has  begun 
<br/></span><span>tightening  up  on  liquidity.  In  addition,  the  Coalition  Government  is  developing  a  programme  of 
<br/></span><span>growth, and enhancing reforms which is articulated in the new National Development Plan (NDP).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the 2024-2025 Budget theme focuses on an "</span><span>Economically Stable, Secure 
<br/>and Sustainable Fiji</span><span>".  I am of the firm belief that this new Budget is set amidst a backdrop of renewed 
<br/>confidence and optimism and is befitting for an economy that has struggled to persist its way through 
<br/>uncertainties due to the previous Government’s excessive expenditure and inability to inclusively

<div><span>perceive impending development issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget supports Government’s commitments in 
<br/>bridging the development inequalities existing between the rural and urban areas. Our rural people 
<br/>have long been marginalised, with limited access to essential services, infrastructure and economic 
<br/>opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising  and unlocking the wealth of resources, cultural  heritage  and  human potential 
<br/>existing in our rural communities remains our priority. As we focus on these, aligning our efforts 
<br/>with  the  global  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  is  imperative  to  ensure  our  progress  is 
<br/>inclusive, sustainable and transformative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  delighted  to  note  that  Government  has  prioritised  initiatives  that 
<br/>focusses on expanding the rural economy by investing in rural infrastructure, enhancing economic 
<br/>opportunities, empowering individuals and communities, as well as addressing climate change issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  an  increase  of  $8.8  million  from  the  2023-2024  Budget,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management is now allocated a budget of $37.9 million.  This 
<br/>substantial  investment  demonstrates  Government’s  commitment  to  progress  with  developing 
<br/>resilient rural communities as part of SDG 11. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government firmly believes that enhancing access 
<br/>to  the  main  road  networks  for  rural  communities  helps  integrate  them  more  effectively  into  our 
<br/>national economy and overall progresses as a nation.  I note with great appreciation the allocation of 
<br/>$354.8 million to the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) for the ongoing construction and maintenance of 
<br/>roads,  upgrading  and  replacement  of  bridges  and  jetties  and  the  upgrading  of  rural  roads.    The 
<br/>Ministry also acknowledges the allocation of an additional $5 million to the Ministry of Public Works 
<br/>for the maintenance and upgrade of rural roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of $3 million towards the Ministry’s Rural and Outer Island 
<br/>(ROI) Development Programme provides the Ministry with the funding opportunity to invest in such 
<br/>infrastructure.  Through the allocation of $2.5 million allocated for the ROI Programme in the 2023-
<br/>2024 Budget, the Ministry was able to implement a total of 50 projects across the country, focusing 
<br/>on three main sectors, including Agriculture, Fisheries and the Forestry Sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Access  is  key  to  the  development  of  these  sectors  for  farmers,  markets,  women,  children, 
<br/>senior citizens and those with special needs.  The two areas of support that were provided for the 
<br/>Agriculture Sector include assistance for livestock farming and the construction of more than 103 
<br/>kilometres of rural farm roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, access to clean and safe drinking water is a basic human right.  I wish to 
<br/>express  my  gratitude  for  the  allocation  of  the  sum  of  $5.7  million  to  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and 
<br/>Mineral Resources, to provide around 1,700 boreholes across the country - 1,000 in Viti Levu, 500 
<br/>in Vanua Levu and 200 in our maritime islands, ensuring access to safe and clean water for all Fijians 
<br/>and contributing to sustainable development and community wellbeing.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1045 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  aligning  to  our global commitment to  Sustainable Development  Goal 
<br/>(SDG) 6 on achieving clean water and sanitation, the Ministry remains dedicated to addressing high 
<br/>risk water and related infrastructure needs.  We are grateful to the allocation of $1 million, an increase 
<br/>of $0.2 million from the current financial year, to achieve this initiative.  Since the inception of the 
<br/>Programme in the 2021-2022 financial year, the Ministry has implemented more than 70 projects 
<br/>across our rural and maritime communities, totalling around $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture remains the backbone of the rural economy.  We continue to 
<br/>stress  that  our  rural  areas  are  resource  rich,  but  majority  are  cash  poor  as  we  have  been  slow  to 
<br/>appreciate the potential wealth and economic gains that we can derive from the sustainable use of 
<br/>our natural resources, especially in the Agriculture Sector.  The Ministry welcomes the $6 million 
<br/>increase in the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture to boost productivity in the sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, rural poverty remains a stark reality.  It holds the key to transforming these 
<br/>communities  and  breaking  the  cycle  of  poverty.    I  must  commend  Government’s  investment  in 
<br/>enhancing  market  access  through  allocating  $2.5  million  to  the  Agriculture  Marketing  Authority 
<br/>(AMA).    This  investment  will  complement  the  assistance  offered  under  the  Ministry’s  ROI 
<br/>Programme, paving the way for an enabling environment to boost economic capabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  agricultural  institutions  play  a  critical  role  in  supporting  rural  farmers.  
<br/>Institutions such as the Navuso Agriculture Technical Institute and the Tutu Training Centre have 
<br/>made immense contributions towards the growth of the agriculture sector.  The total allocation of 
<br/>around $3.3 million to these institutions is timely, as we strive to encourage and educate more young 
<br/>farmers to venture into commercial farming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a lot of untapped potentials in rural Fiji.  I am pleased to note that 
<br/>the Coalition Government is committed to empowering our rural communities that support tourism; 
<br/>micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through the setting up of a pilot Tourism MSME 
<br/>fund.  Under this fund, the Government will provide assistance of up to $15,000 to rural communities 
<br/>to assist in creating an enabling environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, youth unemployment remains a challenge, especially in the rural areas.  Its 
<br/>transition  from  education  to  employment  remains  an  obstacle  for  many  of  our  rural  youth.  We, 
<br/>therefore, commend Government’s efforts in bridging this gap through the provision of $5 million in 
<br/>grant  to  the  Pacific  Polytech.  This  grant  will  enable  the  institution  to  offer  technical  training, 
<br/>equipping  our  children,  especially  those  from  rural  and  maritime  communities,  with  skills  and 
<br/>expertise needed to address Fiji’s skills shortage.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these initiatives contribute to 
<br/>achieving targets associated with decent work and economic growth under SDG 8.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Shipping  Services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry recognises the challenges present  in 
<br/>accessing  some  of  our  remote  maritime  islands.  Ensuring  connectivity  through  the  provision  of 
<br/>reliable transportation services to the islands is critical to their development and economic growth. I 
<br/>acknowledge  the  allocation  of  $1  million  for  the  upgrading  and  enhancement  of  Government 
<br/>shipping services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Rural  Housing  Assistance  Scheme,  it  remains  a  core  commitment  of  the  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government since taking office.  We are delighted to inform this august Parliament that in the 2023-
<br/>2024 financial year, the Ministry was able to implement more than 160 housing projects across the 
<br/>four Divisions. These projects included newly constructed houses, completion and extension works 
<br/>and  retrofitting  works,  directly  contributing  to  targets  associated  with  SDG  11of  achieving 
<br/>sustainable cities and communities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to personally thank every Fijian that applied via our online 
<br/>platform  in  this  financial  year.  The  Ministry  was  overwhelmed  with  the  number  of  applications 
<br/>received  via  our  online  platform  for  the  Rural  Housing  Assistance  Programme.  More  than  6,500 
<br/>online applications was received by our team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are not merely numbers but a clear reflection of the neglect of the 
<br/>previous Government in addressing growing housing needs in our rural and maritime areas. However, 
<br/>as we progress together in this new era, we are working towards ensuring that the needs of our rural 
<br/>populace are met, maybe slowly, but surely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of another $3 million in the 2023-2025 financial year for the 
<br/>Rural Housing Assistance Programme will enable the Ministry to continue meeting the housing needs 
<br/>of those in our rural and maritime communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must commend Government’s efforts in ensuring that Civil Servants are 
<br/>provided  with  decent  work  standards  through  the  promotion  of  healthy  and  safe  working 
<br/>environments.  With this, the Ministry acknowledges the budgetary allocation of $1 million for the 
<br/>refurbishment  of  the  Ministry’s  Headquarters,  $1.5  million  for  the  renovation  and  upkeep  of 
<br/>Government  pool  quarters  and  an  additional  $0.5  million  for  upgrade  works  at  the  Vunisea 
<br/>Government Station in Kadavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government recognises the invaluable contributions of Civil Servants 
<br/>in public service delivery, I wish to commend the increase in their salaries and wages as a strategic 
<br/>investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sorry, I had sprint through the final of that.  The commitment’s made with 
<br/>the  Coalition  Government  in  its  2024-2025  National  Budget  reflects  the  strong  dedication  to 
<br/>achieving the economic stability, security and sustainability for our nation. The initiatives set out for 
<br/>the  Government  collectively  demonstrates  our  strategic  approach  to  nurturing  inclusive  growth, 
<br/>raising living standards and paving the way for prosperous and stable future for all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate my support for the 2024-2025 Budget. </span><span>Vinaka saka

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to make 
<br/>my  contribution  to  the  Budget  Estimates  presented  to  Parliament  by  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Finance on 28th June, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his words 
<br/>of  wisdom  which  I  fully  support  and  wholeheartedly  endorse  the  sentiments  offered  to  promote 
<br/>economic growth and manage the affairs of the State prudently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Member of the Opposition and representative of my people, I intend to 
<br/>highlight some issues related to the policy measures announced through this Parliament on 28th June, 
<br/>2024. The primary objective of the Government Budget is to create a comprehensive financial plan 
<br/>that  supports  economic  growth  and  wellbeing  of  all  its  citizens  while  ensuring  efficient  and 
<br/>transparent use of public funds.  It is rather unfortunate that the Coalition Government’s 2024-2025 
<br/>Budget offers hardly any innovative measures to address high cost of living for ordinary Fijians who 
<br/>are being pushed into poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in VAT rate from 9 percent to 15 percent last year is having a 
<br/>devasting effect on the poorest of the poor in our community.  Fijians now have to dig deeper into 
<br/>their pockets to make ends meet.  Many have the desire to buy essentials but lack the ability to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government must seek alternative ways of raising revenue 
<br/>and growing the economy.  They should stop extracting more revenue from the weakest in the society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Coalition Government should come up with some new initiatives of 
<br/>growing the economy rather than punishing the poor Fijians with heavy VAT and corporate tax.  This 
<br/>is an indication that the Coalition Government lacks critical thinking, creativity and originality, but 
<br/>is  just  rewording  the  successful  policies  designed  and  successfully  implemented  by  the  previous 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians know that this Government will consider VAT reduction in the next 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget as we come closer to the next election to address the high cost of living issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in the minimum wage from $4 to $5 an hour is not enough to 
<br/>cushion  the  high  cost  of  living  caused  by  VAT  and  corporate  tax  imposed  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government last year. It only goes up by 50 cents from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August and another 50 cents  from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>April, 2025. Will the new $4.50 minimum rate effective on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August bring any relief to ordinary 
<br/>people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how was the new minimum wage determined? Where is the report of the 
<br/>Committee  on  the  review  of  minimum  wage?  What  was  the  Committee’s  minimum  wage 
<br/></span><span>recommendation and on what basis they recommended $5 an hour. Fijians want answers to these 
<br/></span><span>questions. The independent review came at the cost of taxpayers and the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Finance confirmed this during his Budget Address that minimum wage was set after a comprehensive 
<br/>review and consultations. The findings of the review committee should be publicly available. I want 
<br/>all our workers in the country to receive a fair and just minimum wage. I would like to suggest that 
<br/>the Government at least increase the minimum wage to $5 an hour effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August and not 
<br/>wait for nine months.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Finance confirmed in his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget Speech a major pay rise for our civil servants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You did not do it for 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The salary increase for the Civil Service was eagerly anticipated by the 
<br/>civil servants. This pay rise ranges from 7 percent up to 20 percent depending on the salary bands. 
<br/>The proposed increase is far short of what the two-teacher unions were lobbying for. Salary increases 
<br/>sounds impressive, but the devil is in the details; 5,000 civil servants received a step increase earlier 
<br/>in  the year.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  be specific, the step increase for about  5,000 civil  servants  was 
<br/>effective somewhere around March 2024. It is not clear how it was determined, which criteria were 
<br/>used to give a step increase earlier in the year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are a former civil servant, you should know better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  With  this  approach,  instead  of  fostering  equality,  more  inequality  is 
<br/>created. There are about 38,000 civil  servants  and all should be treated fairly. Why two different 
<br/>effective dates? To be fair, all the civil servants pay increase should be backdated effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>March, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Now you want more money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, teachers together with other civil servants received a pay 
<br/>rise in 2018, not 17 years ago. The average increase for teachers was 14.3 percent and those civil servants 
<br/>at headquarters of most Ministries had an average increase of 15.8 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are all very happy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Unfortunately, the two-teacher unions did not say anything about the 2018 
<br/>pay rise for the teachers. How can they forget so easily and quickly when both the General Secretaries 
<br/>of FTA and FTU were teachers back then in 2018?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Selective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Many were thinking that there would be some relief in this budget for them 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but sadly it is not there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the $200 Back to School support for our children from families with household 
<br/>income of less than $50,000 is good, but I was hoping for an increase to offset the increase in the cost of 
<br/>living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Similar support was known as Inflation Mitigation Assistance for Children.  
<br/>This was introduced by the previous Government with the same purpose, that is, to buy school uniforms, 
<br/>bags, stationeries, shoes, lunch boxes and other essentials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Don’t lie.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1049 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The objective is the same, but it has been renamed “Back to School Support”.  
<br/>I urge the Government to increase Back to School Support because cost of living pressures is far greater 
<br/>today than they were two years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  noticed  that  allocations  have  been  made  to  Pacific  Polytech  for  skills 
<br/>development  despite  the  Government  having  its  own  established  TVET  programme  through  its 
<br/>national  university,  FNU,  which  is  a  dual  sector  university.    After  careful  analysis,  I  found  that 
<br/>funding to higher education institutions decreased by $12.6 million, that is about 12 percent, but the 
<br/>grant to Pacific Polytech increased from $1 million to $4 million; an increase by 400 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  many  well  established  vocational  and  training  institutions  and  these  institutions 
<br/>have received small amounts compared to substantial funding given to Pacific Polytech.  Why the 
<br/>huge increase in funding for Pacific Polytech?  Is it a calculated move to reward Pacific Polytech?  
<br/>While awarding grants to institutions, did the honourable Minister for Finance consider and comply 
<br/>with the provisions in the Fiji Higher Education Commission Act?  On what rationale did Fiji Higher 
<br/>Education Commission propose an increase of $4 million to Pacific Polytech?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are interested in the graduation data.  How many students have graduated with Level 3, 
<br/>Level 4 and Level 5 qualifications as per Fiji Qualifications Framework, and how many of them have 
<br/>graduated with one day to one month of short courses?  We are also interested in the employment 
<br/>data for those who have graduated from Pacific Polytech.  What criteria is being used to allocate 
<br/>funds and how is the quality of what they deliver assessed?   We need a thorough explanation on the 
<br/>unfair distribution of grants to higher education institutions.  I urge the Government to reassess the 
<br/>grants to higher education institutions and do a fair distribution of grants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  needs  to  provide  a  clear  vision  and  a 
<br/>strategic  roadmap  that  addresses  the  pressing  issues  of  inflation,  the  cost  of  living  and  social 
<br/>inequality.  Unfortunately, this Budget is on a shaky policy and fiscal grounds, living the people of 
<br/>Fiji unsure of where we are heading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  theme  of  2024-2025  National  Budget  is  long  term  economic  </span><span>Stability,  Security  and 
<br/>Sustainability</span><span> of Fiji, but the 2024-2025 National Budget has failed to inspire confidence needed to 
<br/>bring about sustainability and stability.  This Budget will ensure that thousands are trapped in a cycle 
<br/>of poverty.  This Budget has shown Fijians that the Government does not care for the people.  The 
<br/>Budget falls short of the expectations of the people.  Therefore, I do not support this Budget that is 
<br/>punishing the poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members 
<br/>of  the  media,  and  fellow  Fijians,  I  would  like  to  start  by  acknowledging  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister,  his  guidance  over  the  19  months  has  been  invaluable  in  leading  the 
<br/>Coalition Government in our achievements.  I would also like to commend the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, the Permanent Secretary and the team for putting together 
<br/>another fair and focussed Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism is the cornerstone of our economy.  It is an industry that not only 
<br/></span><span>stimulates growth, but creates the most jobs, foreign exchange earnings and fostering infrastructure 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  year,  we  broke  visitor  record  with  929,740  visitors  contributing  $3.2  billion  to  the 
<br/>economy and we expect to surpass that record this year.  The $3.2 billion is spent not only in hotels 
<br/>and airlines but also food and beverage, tours, supermarkets, cruise, transport, retail, art, village

<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- All by FijiFirst.

<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  That  was    made  possible  by  factors  such  as  FNPF  large  hotel 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>portfolio.At the rate we are growing, tourism can bring in $4.2 billion by 2027.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation has been allocated an increased 
<br/>budget  of  $68.9  million  for  the  2024-2025  financial  year.    Firstly,  the  Budget  will  fund  the 
<br/>implementation of Fiji’s National Sustainable Tourism Framework 2024-2034. This Framework is a 
<br/>comprehensive policy designed to guide the tourism sector over the next decade with an overarching 
<br/>goal of transforming the sector to ensure a sustainable future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will focus on four goals: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)  Prosperous visitor economy; 
<br/>(2)  Thriving and inclusive communities; 
<br/>(3)  Visible and valued cultures; and 
<br/>(4)  Healthy islands and oceans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s commitment to sustainability is also evident in its support 
<br/>for  the  Vanua  Levu  Tourism  Development  Programmes.    In  its  first  phase,  we  will  focus  on 
<br/>improving access to essential services and infrastructure such as waste management and transport.  
<br/>By investing in these critical areas, we want our people of Vanua Levu to benefit too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to  draw special attention to  a milestone in this Budget, the 
<br/>allocation of $400,000 for the Pilot Tourism Micro and Small Enterprises Fund.  This is the first time 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  has  introduced  such  a  grant.    This  initiative  marks  a 
<br/>significant departure from our usual operations ensuring the smallest of businesses too are part and 
<br/>parcel of and benefit from tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we make our best efforts to invest in the sector, we also need to market 
<br/>ourselves  and  our  brand,  “Fiji  where  happiness  comes  naturally”.    We  have  already  seen  very 
<br/>proudly; our brand in cities like Sydney and Beijing to Times Square in New York.  This costs money, 
<br/>a lot of it.  One thing we should not expect is that everyone knows Fiji.  And just because it is doing 
<br/>well, it does not mean it will stay that way or that it does not need Government support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  at  the  Tourism  Investment  Summit  last  week  where  we  spoke  about  how  globally 
<br/>demand has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, but we can start expecting growth to slow down in pace.  
<br/>So, we must invest in the industry so that we reach potential visitors ahead of our competitors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are grateful for the additional $5 million marketing budget to $35 million. We could do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with more and we know that it will be forthcoming when the need arises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the tourism sector, this Budget also emphasises the importance 
<br/>of civil aviation in supporting our economic growth.  The allocated funds will be utilised to enhance 
<br/>our  aviation  infrastructure  and  services  which  are  crucial  for  both,  domestic  and  international 
<br/>connectivity.  By protecting the integrity of the aviation system, we must ensure that our safety and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>security processes are intact and conform to international standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The International Civil Aviation Organisation conducts audits on the level of implementation 
<br/>by states on its safety and security oversight capabilities.  Fiji’s current rating is sitting at 76.3 percent 
<br/>which is above the global average of 69.4 percent. However, this is not to say we cannot do better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  two  of  the  critical  elements  in  the  audit  process  is  the  aircraft  accident 
<br/>investigations and primary aviation legislations. In the new financial year, we will work on improving 
<br/>our standards in line with global best practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our national airline, Fiji Airways, continues to soar to new heights, making 
<br/>Fiji more accessible. We are looking at new direct routes in the United States, as well as beyond, 
<br/>through codeshare agreements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  line  with  our  Aviation  Policy,  we  appreciate  the  global  shift  and  economic  benefits  of 
<br/>liberalisation and acknowledge that Open Skies could lead to economic benefits such as increased 
<br/>trade, investment and tourism.  We are now evaluating opportunities for bilateral and multilateral 
<br/>Open Skies Air Services Agreements (ASAs) on a case-by-case basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform Parliament that our discussions with the 
<br/>United States (US) Government for an Open Skies air transport agreement is progressing positively. 
<br/>Such an agreement will open up the entire continental US, allowing Fiji Airways to operate direct 
<br/>services between Fiji and destinations such as Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and Seattle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Airways  has  more  than  40  pending  codeshares  that  will  be  activated  with  American 
<br/>Airlines,  Alaska  Airlines  and  Finnair.    Activating  these  codeshares  will  provide  more  access  and 
<br/>open  more  markets  within  the  US,  and  more  options  to  international  markets  via  US,  ultimately 
<br/>providing more passengers onto Fiji Airways and Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with more airline seats come the need for more hotel rooms and beds.  The 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics announced a number of hotel investments, 10 of which are already in 
<br/>construction  with  two  major  refurbishments.  This  shows  a  great  deal  of  confidence  in  the  Fijian 
<br/>economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Tourism  Investment  Summit  held  last  week in  Denarau  attracted  some  300  delegates 
<br/>globally and locally, the second held under the Coalition Government.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the quality 
<br/>of the delegates, many from global brands, was quite uplifting. It was the first time we have seen this 
<br/>type of interests from those wishing to build in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In todays’ </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Jones Lang Laselle (a Global Real Estate Company) 
<br/>said that from investment perspective, just as it is from a tourism perspective, the world is looking at 
<br/>Fiji and wants to be here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  extending  the  Short  Life  Investment  Package  tax  holiday  to 
<br/></span><span>investors, who acquire existing hotels and undertake renovations and refurbishments of more than 
<br/></span><span>$50 million. This is welcome news to incentivize and accelerate investments in hotel capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir, there are those that say that tourism gets away with too many concessions, 
<br/>but these concessions are invested back into the tourism products, ensuring quality and standards.  
<br/>We are confident of our tourism, because of the quality of our products, justifying the concessions 
<br/>extended to the tourism industry.  As we know, for Fiji, tourism is 40 percent of GDP. That means, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is very dear to us and to the livelihoods that depend on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism is everyone's business and by extension, responsibility. Ensuring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their sustainability and growth is a responsibility we should all share.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  budgetary  support,  we  must  also  focus  on  fostering  partnerships  and 
<br/>collaborations with local communities, businesses and international stakeholders. The success of our 
<br/>tourism and aviation industries depends on the collective efforts of all these players.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  investment  in  human  capital  is  essential.  The  tourism  and  aviation  industries 
<br/>require skilled and knowledgeable workforce to deliver high-quality services.  Therefore, part of our 
<br/>strategic focus, as delivered in this Budget, will be on education and training to equip our people with 
<br/>those skills needed to thrive in these sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  lastly,  we  must  continue  to  innovate  and  adapt  to  changing  market  and 
<br/>consumer  trends.  The  tourism  and  aviation  landscapes  are  constantly  evolving,  and  we  must  be 
<br/>proactive in our approach.  This means leveraging technology, promoting sustainable tourism and 
<br/>aviation practices, and diversifying our tourism products to cater for different market segments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Budget  reflects  our  commitment  to  an 
<br/>economically stable, secure and sustainable Fiji. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support 
<br/>the 2024-2025 National Budget. Thank you and God bless Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; my heartfelt greetings to you all 
<br/>and the people of Fiji.  Before I start my speech proper, I would like to inform all my voters and 
<br/>supporters that I will continue to serve you all as an honourable Member of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the 2024-2025 Budget that was delivered by the Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics 
<br/>on 28</span><span>th</span><span> June,2024.  Before I do so, I wish to draw your attention to a significant development leading 
<br/>up to the final delivery of the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first time, Cabinet met a week before the delivery of the Budget to deliberate on the 
<br/>draft Budget.  This allowed Ministers to understand their respective Ministry allocations, discuss it 
<br/>with the honourable Minister for Finance and the honourable Prime Minister, question the honourable 
<br/>Minister, scrutinise the policy stance taken by the honourable Minister to ensure it is a Government’s 
<br/>policy stance and take ownership of the Budget and policy stance.  This is  a departure from  past 
<br/>practices  under  the  FijiFirst  Government  where  Ministers  only  saw  total  allocations  after  the 
<br/>Estimates were printed, one hour before the delivery in Parliament with no discussion of the overall 
<br/>policy stance.  I commend the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for setting a 
<br/>new norm of financial governance going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about the Budget since its delivery.  Some in the vocal 
<br/></span><span>minority have said, “It is bad, we are finished, we are dead, and it is taking us in the wrong direction”.  
<br/></span><span>Some of the silent majority, whom I interact a lot with, have labelled this Budget as courageous, 
<br/>responsive, responsible, appropriate to the time we are in, intelligent and befitting a dynamic and 
<br/>forward-looking economist.   It is crucial to acknowledge these diverse opinions and the concerns 
<br/>they raise, as it is through open and respectful dialogue that we can move forward as a nation.  Each 
<br/>opinion, whether critical or supportive, is a valuable contribution to the discourse on our nation’s 
<br/>future.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1053 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to emphasise that there is no one correct or right budget.  It is a matter 
<br/>of perspective and the ideological position we take.  Are we leaning towards the left, or the right, or 
<br/>are we positioned around the centre in the political spectrum?  We all have our opinions and each of 
<br/>our voices and our perspectives are crucial in shaping the future of our nation and its finances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to examine the Budget, we need to first set out the broad parameters within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which to examine the Budget, noting that we –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are a developing country;  
<br/>have idle resources, in particular land;  
<br/>have the potential for tourism development;  
<br/>have a small but significant population living in squatters;  
<br/>are facing climate change challenges;  
<br/>have  sizeable  proportion  of  low-income  households,  destitutes  and  people  with  special 
<br/>needs; and 
<br/>have high debt levels and potential to jump-start growth in key sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Noting the above, we ask the following questions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is the Budget supporting the critical growth sectors? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Are we supporting children in achieving their educational dreams? 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Have  we  ensured  that  deficit  and  debt  are  reined  with  a  plan  to  meet  the  international 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>benchmark in the future? 
<br/>Is our operating expenditure fully financed by operating revenue so that borrowings are 
<br/>only used for capital projects? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Overall, does the Budget strike a good balance between addressing the needs of the poor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today, addressing the fundamentals, and providing a framework for a growth economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now address these critical attributes of a reasonable and responsible 
<br/>National  Budget.    On  supporting  our  critical  growth  sectors,  like  tourism,  agriculture,  forestry, 
<br/>fisheries  and  remittances,  I  am  happy  to  note  that  except  for  remittances,  this  Budget  very  well 
<br/>supports all these sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tourism Sector is in autopilot mode.  The Budget provides a massive $35 million for 
<br/>Tourism Marketing, an increase from $22 million provided in the 2022-2023 Budget, with additional 
<br/>financial support for the Ministry of Tourism. I hope that that maybe increased by $1.5 million once 
<br/>the Israel </span><span>dinau</span><span> trip is paid by honourable Gavoka and the team.  The rest is for the industry to ensure 
<br/>they differentiate their products, as we operate in a highly competitive market.  We need to ensure 
<br/>we do not  price ourselves out.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, these things  are not  for the Budget,  but  for the 
<br/>industry to answer and address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Primary Sector Ministries have received substantial increases in their 
<br/>budget.    We  are  a  small  economy.  Our  comparative advantage  lies  in  the  primary  sectors,  such 
<br/>as Agriculture, Fisheries and Forests. The recent COVID-19 pandemic brought to the forefront how 
<br/>critical primary sectors are.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  substantial  budgetary  support  for  these sectors  puts  the  ball  in  the  court  of  respective 
<br/>Ministries, as well as the farmers, entrepreneurs and landowners who are engaged in these sectors.. They 
<br/>must seize this opportunity to grow these sectors for themselves and in the national interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  are  the  growth-generating  sectors,  and  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Finance, being an economist, has sent a silent message to us all that these allocations are not really an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure, but rather an investment to grow these sectors so that we can, indeed, have 6 percent to 8 
<br/>percent real growth in the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to note that remittances are now a major source of foreign income in the 
<br/>country.  In 2015, total remittances were $494.2 million, which grew to $1.26 billion in 2023. This is a 
<br/>major boost to foreign reserves and national income. The question that arises is, are we doing enough to</span><span>
<br/></span><span>protect and grow this sector?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not see much evidence of this in this Budget or in the honourable Minister for Finance’s 
<br/>Speech, and I am sure the honourable Minister will think about it and develop some strategies going 
<br/>forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I note the pursuit  to  raise  the National  Minimum  Wage  to  $5 in 2025. The 
<br/>raising of the National Minimum Wage is based on the wrong premise that it will help reduce poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Raising  the National  Minimum  Wage  will  be  an unnecessary  intervention  in  the  operations 
<br/>of the market. We are destroying the business model of the private sector. The sustainable way to raise 
<br/>household income is to enhance their earning capacity by upskilling them so that the market offers them 
<br/>higher wages, noting higher productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Raising wage rates without commensurate productivity increase will push inflation, as there will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be no room for the business sector to absorb the rise due to no change in productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On support for children's education, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has continued with free 
<br/>education  policies  of  the  FijiFirst  Government,  and  I  wish  to  thank  them  for  doing  so.  They  have 
<br/>further brought in scholarships in place of loans.  I do hope that those who get a place in the University 
<br/>but have lower marks will also be considered for financial assistance, as some limited scholarships 
<br/>will deny these students to realise their dreams. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will closely watch developments 
<br/>in this area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  something  that  has  bothered me  for  some  time  is  the  disparity  in 
<br/>educational infrastructure between urban and rural schools, pushing parents to move their children to 
<br/>urban schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not seen any firm commitment by the Government to provide 
<br/>additional funding to improve the learning environment of these schools, such as the renovation of 
<br/>ablution  blocks,  the  construction of  library  rooms,  teachers’  quarters,  computer  labs  and  internet 
<br/>connectivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I note the support from the Australian Government on this.  This is one 
<br/>and a half years of Coalition Government rule, but no substantial resources have been provided and 
<br/>time is running out. I urge the Government to consider this seriously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  support  for  squatter  development,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  note  that  around  200  squatter 
<br/>settlements in Fiji need to be formalised urgently. These settlements are struggling to deal with issues 
<br/>such as waste disposal, sewage disposal, water and electricity connection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget only provides an allocation of $13.5 million for developing five 
<br/></span><span>squatter settlements  which  is  2.5  percent  of  the  total  squatter settlements.    Sir,  I  suggest  a  10-year 
<br/>squatter formalisation plan with 20 settlements formalised per year. This would require approximately 
<br/>$54 million per year allocation to formalise 20 settlements outsourced to private contractors in a year. 
<br/>Now,  that  the  estimates  are  out,  I  suggest  that  the  Government  seek assistance  from  development 
<br/>partners.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1055 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On operating expenditure, deficit and debt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, various commentators have said 
<br/>a lot about Government expenditure, deficit and debt. The honourable Minister for Finance is a highly 
<br/>accomplished  economist  in  his  field.  If  anyone  understands  better  the  relationship  between  large 
<br/>expenditures and deficits and large deficits and debts, it is him, but let me shed light on these economic 
<br/>terminologies that have a bearing on this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  a  careful examination  of  the  Budget  reveals  that operating 
<br/>expenditure is covered by operating revenue. This implies that borrowings are not compromised when 
<br/>paying for operating expenditures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, our deficit is within our limit of 4.8 percent of GDP. Thirdly, our debt level is 78 
<br/>percent  of  GDP.  This  is  way  above  the  international  benchmark of  40  percent  of  GDP.  Everyone 
<br/>knows that the high debt level was arrived at during the COVID-19 era when revenue sources dried 
<br/>up, while the Government had to step in and assist the poor and needy while maintaining Civil Service 
<br/>SEG 1 and SEG 2 expenditures.  Let us look ahead.  How do we reduce the debt to GDP ratio? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no Diego Maradona magic hand can do this overnight.  We need to rein in 
<br/>unproductive expenditures and push for high economic growth. Reining unproductive expenditure is 
<br/>the Government’s job and we will continue to raise red flags when we see evidence contrary to this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On growing the economy, it is the job of the private sector.  Government’s role is to create 
<br/>an enabling environment; ensure that law and order, security and required legislations are in place; 
<br/>the cost of doing business is reduced; Government bottlenecks are removed; and courts dispose of 
<br/>cases quickly so that businesses are not held up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will watch these key Government roles so that we unblock growth.  If 
<br/>we hold back growth, the debt to GDP ratio will continue to escalate, and we will be locked up in 
<br/>what economists call a ‘low-growth-high debt’ trap.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the balance between growth and addressing distributional issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>last issue I wish to address is whether budget balances pursuing economic growth and addressing 
<br/>societal distributional problems. The Budget has provided for both.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  respective  honourable  Ministers  and  the  Executive  arms  now  have  to  deliver.  
<br/>Service delivery in most of the Ministries is well below par.  The data that I have been given by some 
<br/>civil servants reveal that expenditure utilisation rates in some Ministries are as low as 60 percent.  If 
<br/>this is true and continues in 2024 to 2025, then this expenditure bundle will not mean much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I implore all Permanent Secretaries and staff below them to put our ordinary 
<br/>people’s priority as their priority and serve them diligently.  Use the resources wisely to address their 
<br/>plight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to ask the honourable Minister for Finance to set up a designated 
<br/>Budget  Monitoring  Team  with  a  dedicated  Desk  Officer  for  each  Ministry  to  assist  in  the  fund 
<br/>utilisation in line with the Public Finance Management Act.  I hope these resource bundles will help 
<br/></span><span>the poor and grow the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I end my speech, I would like to congratulate the newly appointed Attorney-General, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Graham Leung, and we look forward to working with you.

<div><span>fellow  citizens;  I  rise  in  support  of  the  2024-2025  National  Budget,  a  Budget  which  builds  the 
<br/>foundation for an economically stable, secure and sustainable Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget reflects the deep commitment of the Coalition Government to 
<br/>foster inclusive growth and improve the lives of our people, including our farmers, teachers, nurses, 
<br/>other civil servants, our rural communities, our people with disabilities, our women, youth, elderly 
<br/>and our children who are the future of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  investing  in  our  people  and  skill  development,  and  we  are  ensuring  that  our  civil 
<br/>servants  are  better  paid  so  that  we  can  recruit  and  retain  good  people.    We  are  ensuring  that  our 
<br/>workers are paid a just and a fair minimum wage, and their rights are protected and promoted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  rebuilding  our  infrastructure  and  rescuing  our  public  assets  that  have  been  left  to 
<br/>deteriorate over the years.  We are working on economic diversification and rural development where 
<br/>almost half of our population resides.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  investing  in  strengthening  our  independent  State  institutions,  to  ensure  better 
<br/>functioning of our democracy.  We are investing in our Police Force to ensure that law and order is 
<br/>maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  keeping  our  taxes  stable  and  working  on  streamlining  business 
<br/>approval to support our private sector.  All these measures are critical for the overall development 
<br/>and the prosperity of our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On fiscal sustainability, Mr, Speaker, Sir, this is a Budget that ensures that we continue to 
<br/>rebuild  fiscal  sustainability.  The  Coalition  Government  inherited  a  debt  over  90  percent  of  GDP, 
<br/>therefore  the  decisive  revenue  reforms  in  the  last  budget  and  overall  fiscal  discipline,  we  have 
<br/>managed  to  bring  down  the  debt  level  to  around  78  percent  of  GDP  and  this  is  contrary  to  the 
<br/>statement by the honourable Leader of the Opposition through our deliberate policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a great achievement for us as a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A 12 percent reduction in the 
<br/>debt to GDP ratio in less than two years.  This political and national commitment to tackle our debt 
<br/>problem have been applaud by the international financial institutions like the IMF, World Bank, the 
<br/>credit rating agencies and all our development partners.  In this Budget, we are keeping up with the 
<br/>momentum to ensure that our debt to GDP ratio continues a downward trajectory.  This continuous 
<br/>reduction in the debt ratio is critical to rebuild fiscal buffers and ensure macro-economic stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to stay in this course, it will take some time before we can bring 
<br/>down the debt to GDP ratio to below 50 percent. Our economy must grow faster, and we need to 
<br/>maintain fiscal discipline if we want to reach the 50 percent debt to GDP ratio much sooner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our economic growth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are seeing some headwinds. The slowdown 
<br/>in  some  of  our  major  trading  partners,  the  challenges  in  our  labour  force  and  potential  declining 
<br/>population and the natural tapering in growth after rapid economic rebound in the last two years is 
<br/>posing some challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  Budget  fiscal  stimulus  that  is  being  provided  is  aimed  at  mitigating  some  of  these 
<br/>challenges. The good news is that growth remains positive, that means the economy is still growing 
<br/>although at a slightly slow rate of 2.8 percent.  We need to increase this growth to 5 percent and there 
<br/>are over 2 billion of private sector investments in the pipeline and the Government is working on 
<br/>expediting these projects.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1057 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  these  major  investments  in  the  hotels  dealt  with  the  rooms,  inventory  which  has 
<br/>become a major bottleneck to take our tourism industry to the next level. We are also lining up some 
<br/>major  public  centre  investment  projects  and  working  with  some  of  our  entities  in  increasing  our 
<br/>capacity  at  our  airports,  renewable  energy  and  our  port  infrastructure.      There  are  some  major 
<br/>commercial agricultural projects which will support economic diversification and food security. We 
<br/>are also seeing outsourcing industry expanding from the usual call centres to high value service like 
<br/>accounting services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker. Sir, we need a private sector to take the driving seat and Government to provide 
<br/>the enabling environment for the private sector investment to flourish.  It is only through sustained 
<br/>private sector-led growth that we can create more and better paying jobs to improve our infrastructure 
<br/>and overall living standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our cost of living, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our approach to cost of living is to raise income and 
<br/>the areas that are therefore put in place or initiatives put in place by the Government to raise income 
<br/>and some of these will be announced or probably shared by the respective Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One is such that on the Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an independent, professional and well-
<br/>equipped Civil Service is vital for effective service delivery.  In this Budget, the Government has 
<br/>provided  a  major  boost  to  the  Civil  Service  with  pay  increases  ranging  from  7  percent  up  to  20 
<br/>percent. This will inject $85 million into the pockets of our civil servants.  This pay rise has already 
<br/>uplifted the morale of the civil servants as this is a major pay rise since 2017.  This is a great start, 
<br/>and  the  Government  will  continue  to  work  with  our  Unions  to  ensure  that  we  further  improve 
<br/>employment conditions in the Civil Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is the National Minimum Wage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our people have welcomed the 25 
<br/>percent increase in the National Minimum Wage from $4 an hour to $5 an hour.  This is a major 
<br/>boost to the income level of our workers, and this will ensure that no one will earn less than around 
<br/>$10,000 per year effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2025. With higher income, we should expect productivity 
<br/>to rise as workers will feel motivated and work hard for their higher income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on social protection on social wages, for those who are vulnerable, we had 
<br/>increased  the  Social  Welfare  Allowance  in  the  last  Budget.    This  increase  has  continued  in  this 
<br/>Budget with a total funding of around $200 million.  We are also continuing with other social wages 
<br/>like  Subsidised  Electricity,  Free  Water,  Transport  Assistance,  Free  Education  and  various  other 
<br/>programmes to help the vulnerable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Accounts Committee with the Office of the Auditor-General, a 
<br/>funding of $7 million has been provided to the Office of the Auditor-General.  This is to ensure that 
<br/>they are well resourced and to keep the Government in check apart from clearing the backlog of audit 
<br/>which has been dragging for some time under the previous Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  updated  the  Public  Financial  Management 
<br/>System (PFMS) which will go live on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024 and with that, we have established a new 
<br/>Strategic Planning Office within the Ministry which will beef-up project coordination delivery and 
<br/></span><span>support the overall development of projects for future funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  office  will  also  ensure  that  we  monitor  the  implementation  of  the 
<br/>expenditures laid out in the Budget apart from the Ministries being on their feet to ensure that we are 
<br/>able to address so many challenges in every sector of the economy, so this will allay a concern raised 
<br/>by the honourable Leader of the Opposition on implementation and monitoring of projects.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  are  the  areas  that  we  have  spent  or  increased  funds  on  including 
<br/>Education and TELS, Health and Medical Services and Drugs.  To conclude the 2024-2025 Budget 
<br/>also provide a range of measures to strengthen our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> institutions and bring about improvements 
<br/>in the lives of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> including government commitment to promote and preserve </span><span>iTauke</span><span>i culture, 
<br/>custom,  tradition  and  language  apart  from  other  cultural  groups.    The  Government  has  increased 
<br/>allocation to the Ministry to $39.4 million from $38.6 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will continue to provide support to the needs and 
<br/>has provided its support to the 14 provincial councils to cater for the cost of operation for its council 
<br/>which  used  to  be  funded  through  the  </span><span>soli  ni  yasana</span><span>  around  $7.3  million,  iTaukei  Affairs  Board 
<br/>operating grant of around $3.2 million, </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> Allowance monthly and </span><span>Vanua</span><span> Leadership 
<br/>Allowance and </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> Allowance will continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through 2024-2025 Budget, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs has again been 
<br/>allocated  $2  million  for  Village  Development  and  Transformation  Programme  and  a  further  $3 
<br/>million  for  iTaukei  resource  owners  support  and  development  fund.    All  these  will  strengthen 
<br/>development empowerment and will support the overall development of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to express 
<br/>my views on the Budget delivered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and Economic Planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would call the Budget a budget of blaming, excuses and being economical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the truth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget itself did not spur any surprises 
<br/>or any innovative ideas to invigorate the economy and bring relief to Fijians.  I intend to make some 
<br/>general comments on the budget presentation then dwell on resource-based sectors covering sugar, 
<br/>agriculture, fisheries and forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formulation of a budget follows a regular pattern.  Calculation of total 
<br/>expected revenue through taxation then distribution of revenue to various ministries and agencies to 
<br/>fund the various plans formulated by Government  in  that particular financial year.   In this recent 
<br/>difficult economic outlook and challenges, the expenditures normally would be greater than revenue 
<br/>resulting in a budget deficit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has never experienced any budget surplus in recent years.  In recent times, the statement 
<br/>that the Government is paying off debt is not true, and we can see the loan portfolio of Government 
<br/>would not reduce but increase every year.  That is normal Mr. Speaker, Sir, but let me repeat in this 
<br/>august  Parliament  that  loan  has  not  been  repaid  as  the  exercise  is  carried  out  is  refinancing  and 
<br/>moving loans to financial institutions that have better or lower interest rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  The  principal  amount  will  continue  to  grow  and  it  will 
<br/>exceed  $11  billion  compared  to  the  $10.8  billion  when  the  Coalition took  over  in  running  of  the 
<br/>Government in 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1059 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  highlight  the  budget  mix  covering  operating  and  capital 
<br/>expenditures.  The trend is quite worrying, and it is budget for 2024-2025.  The operating budget has 
<br/>increased to 72 percent, capital is around 28 percent.  To compare the budgets of 2016 to 2019, the 
<br/>budget mix average 65 percent on operating and 35 percent for capital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I can see the honourable Minister looking at me, but I am 
<br/>telling  the  truth.    These  distinct  comparisons  indicate  the  cost  of  running  Government  has 
<br/>dramatically increased from an average of 60 percent to over 70 percent of the total budget.  In simple 
<br/>layman’s term, the above figures indicate that the budget allocation is concentrated towards paying 
<br/>on  the  running  of  Government,  reducing  capital,  an  allocation  to  be  spent  on  infrastructure 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on the state of economy as contained in the 
<br/>Minister’s speech.  The Minister correctly highlighted that the economy returned to pre-pandemic 
<br/>level faster than expected.  Our economy strongly rebounded in 2022 with the economy increasing 
<br/>by  20  percent.    This  was  followed  by  a  further  8.1  percent  in  2023  and  thanks  to  the  previous 
<br/>Government.    This  also  had  a  flow  on  effect  on  other  sectors,  fuelling  increase  in  domestic 
<br/>expenditure and employment opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism has been the mainstay of our economic development and continuously growing our 
<br/>economy.  I am however disappointed in the increase of departure tax, $175 this year and $200 next 
<br/>year.  This will be a big challenge going forward as increase in departure tax will not assist tourism 
<br/>but will increase the cost of holiday in Fiji.  Therefore, tourists opting for cheaper holiday destination 
<br/>in Southeast Asia and reducing Fiji’s income that were to be generated from tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Minister had highlighted another setback in the huge loss of skills that we had faced in 
<br/>the last few years.  We are losing our trained people to Australia and New Zealand in this </span><span>Vuvale 
<br/></span><span>Partnership and Seasonal Work Programmes.  Government needs to concentrate in retraining people 
<br/>to upskill and replace these loss of skills. We cannot stop our people from looking towards greener 
<br/>pastures and we cannot blame them or discourage people for looking at better opportunities. If we 
<br/>want to retain them, then we need to create better conditions locally. The Government needs to create 
<br/>investment and must take the lead role in this and invest in infrastructure, as this will give a sense of 
<br/>confidence to the private sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Servants need to be encouraged to improve and participate in creating good investment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>climate. We must not reinvent the wheels but improve the systems that are already in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister highlighted and explained in detail the National 
<br/>Development Plan for the next 5 years and 20 years. Development plan is an ongoing exercise and 
<br/>Government needs to focus on what has been achieved and improve on those. The Government must 
<br/>provide an enabling environment with the right policies to ensure certainty, maintenance of rule of 
<br/>law and additionally independence of State institutions and the economic  and political stability is 
<br/>most important to provide a stable platform for development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister highlighted the importance of remittances and thanks to Australia, 
<br/>New Zealand and the United States of America for our people working  abroad sending  a total of 
<br/>$1.25 billion last year, which was a major contribution to the economy. However, with that economic 
<br/>slowdown in Australia and New Zealand, the two years of strong rebound is going to be tested. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiscal Policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a comment on fiscal policy.  The 2024-2025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>1060 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget is set on a total expenditure of $4.552 billion and the revenue of $3.917 billion, the fiscal 
<br/>deficit is set on $635.5 million which is 4.5 percent of GDP. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the worrying 
<br/>issue in  this Budget  is the budget  mix. The operating expenditure stands at  73.27 percent  and 25 
<br/>percent for capital. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is very high and we are returning to the old traditional 
<br/>budget mixed of 80 percent operating and 20 percent capital which will stagnate the economy and 
<br/>provide nothing for expenditures on infrastructure developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On Valued Added Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji were expecting a reductions from 
<br/>15 percent to a lower and manageable level. While I understand the reason of maintaining the same 
<br/>level, a lot of Fijians do not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note the increase in minimum wage to $4.50 and later to $5.  The National 
<br/>Minimum Wages introduced in 2014 and gradually increased to $4 by 2023. This increase, if not 
<br/>properly  monitored,  will  close  some  small  businesses  unless  they  are  initially  assisted  by  the 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resource-Based Sectors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to expand on my views on resource-
<br/>based sectors which include sugar, agriculture, fisheries and forestry. I urge the Government to have 
<br/>a closer look at the four sectors above and make planned approach to revitalise the sectors so it can 
<br/>make  better  contributions  to  our  national  economy  and  provide  employment  to  our  rural 
<br/>communities. These will also assist in reduction of rural to urban drift, which is a contributing factor 
<br/>to poverty, unemployment and rise in crime. We need support from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, 
<br/>the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development for resettlement of our people back to our rural 
<br/>settings.  We need support of our people in the Provincial Councils and other institutions to help the 
<br/>Government in this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Industry, with its present and heritage colonial structure needs to be reviewed and 
<br/>if required collapsed and rebuilt. The politicisation of the sugar industry must be removed as this has 
<br/>greatly contributed to the deteriorating performance of FSC and associated agency within the sugar 
<br/>industry. Sugarcane farmers must be encouraged to participate in alternative farming and diversify 
<br/>the activities within their farm holdings. They should be encouraged to expand to animal farming 
<br/>and  mix-cropping  to  ensure  greater  contributions  towards  the  agricultural  products  for  export 
<br/>revenues and local consumption for food security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture must be provided assistance for bankable projects 
<br/>involving landowning units who can become great producers of commodities that can be exported, 
<br/>assisting in national economy and provide employment to the members of landowning units. This 
<br/>exercise will greatly assist in the provision of food security and employment and encourage our 
<br/>people to continue to live and work in their local and rural settings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, value adding for SMEs can also be set up within these rural settings where 
<br/>they can form cooperatives and contribute towards those industries. I see huge work that has been 
<br/>carried out in the above  area, but it needs capacity building, to ensure provision of markets  and 
<br/>improve infrastructure development to assist in production and access to market sources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fisheries:    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  fisheries  is  concentrated  around  coastal  and  rural  island 
<br/></span><span>communities where there is ample natural habitat for the various species to flourish. Provision of 
<br/>proper storage and efficient transportation to main source markets is greatly needed to be developed 
<br/>to enable the movement of these various commodities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research  and  funding  are  needed  to  enable  new  farming  practices  to  be  introduced  to 
<br/>villages and settlements to participate in aquaculture and mariculture. There is a huge potential for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1061 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these products to be sourced as export, and to reduce imports of these commodities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local  market  is  readily  available  if  consistent  supplies  can  be  guaranteed  for  our 
<br/>international tourists that come to Fiji and stay in our various hotels and resorts. Concentration on 
<br/>high value species is a must to maximise return for export and local consumption.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forestry:   Mr.</span><span> </span><span>Speaker,  Sir, there  is  an urgent  need for  Fiji to  participate in  reforestation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nationally. This will be in line with international efforts on climate change mitigation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These schemes will provide huge potential for employment in our rural areas. High value 
<br/>trees need to be planted so that returns can benefit the landowners and communities surrounding 
<br/>our rural villages and settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  Government  in  providing  and 
<br/>bridging the gaps that exist between these four sectors which I have alluded to. Every institution, 
<br/>including the various Ministries, needs to be encouraged to work together and set a platform that 
<br/>will  target  outcomes  for  our  people  in  our  rural communities. I  hope  that  this  platform  will 
<br/>encourage our people to return to their rural villages and settlements and discourage rural to urban 
<br/>drift. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social  Issues:    Mr.  Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>Sir,  I  would  like  to  express  my  concern  on  crime  rate, 
<br/>particularly  on  women  and children.   It  is  the  responsibility  of  this  august  Parliament  and 
<br/>its Members to protect all citizens and ensure that people feel safe within their communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is reported that while releasing the statistics for June 2024, the Office of the Director of 
<br/>Public Prosecution stated that 15 people were charged with a total of 32 counts of sexual offences 
<br/>in June only, and prior to that, 39 people charged with a total of 113 counts of sexual offences in 
<br/>May. These numbers are alarming and should be brought to the attention of Parliament, particularly 
<br/>in finding the root causes and then deriving solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe that a contributing factor to sexual crimes, among other reasons, is the early access 
<br/>and excessive use of mobile phones by children, which provides a window to the world through the 
<br/>internet and leads to the use of pornography - a window that the young minds of this nation are not 
<br/>ready for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at an age where children are still learning and adopting behaviour, I would 
<br/>strongly suggest that Government restrict the ownership and use, without supervision, of mobile 
<br/>phones and other gadgets, that have access to internet for children from ages one to 15. This will 
<br/>allow parents to use their time to build strong moral values within their children and equip them 
<br/>with the right mindset to overcome peer pressure and be able to make sensible independent decisions 
<br/>when surfing the internet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to commend the Government for settling the Vatukoula Gold Mine 
<br/>Union strikers, which has been outstanding for decades.  I also wish to thank the Government for 
<br/>reinstating the pension for FNPF members that were called for previously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  na  Tui Cakau</span><span>, the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister, honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers, the  honourable  Leader  of  the

<div><span>Budget presented by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  on  28</span><span>th</span><span>  June,  2024.  I  also  thank  his  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary, Mr. Shiri Gounder, and his team, for delivering on the Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget aims to raise incomes for everyone and improve the quality of 
<br/>life for our communities. The 2024-2025 Budget allocates $106 million to the Ministry of Trade, Co-
<br/>operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. This funding will fuel economic 
<br/>growth, support new film tax rebates, advance our digital initiatives, assist with the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister’s  'Look  North'  Development  Programme  under  the  World  Bank  and  also  the  Chinese 
<br/>Government and, of course, continue to focus on the ease of doing business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will welcome investors to our shore and offer a world-class 
<br/>destination for businesses, such as Google, Starlink, and most recently, the Lindhurst Business Park 
<br/>in Kalabu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr,  Speaker  Sir,  when  you  look  at  the  economic  situation  in  Fiji,  I  am  filled  with  great 
<br/>optimism. Whilst we do have a slowdown, as reported in the financial forecast by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance, I would like to make this most important point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a massive pipeline of investment on the way, particularly in the 
<br/>second half of this year, and should that come to light, we are expecting an uptake in the economy. 
<br/>And do not believe me, believe the ANZ Bank forecast, that is already talking about a 3.4 percent 
<br/>economic growth this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  international  trade  is  the  lifeblood  of  Fiji's  economy. The  Ministry  has  been 
<br/>negotiating for stronger and better trade terms for Fiji, and as the only Pacific Island in the 14 member 
<br/>Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, we have delivered some good benefits for our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next on the horizon is the negotiations on PACER Plus this year, and we will also intend to 
<br/>bring forward the I Interim Economic Participation Agreement (IEPA) of the EU, which will open 
<br/>up market access into the European Union.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would just briefly like to touch on the  investment’s outset in Fiji.  When I 
<br/>talked about the pipeline last year, we were looking at $4.25 billion worth of investments.  As of 
<br/>today, Sir, we are looking at 184 projects worth $6.2 billion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A big part of attracting billions of dollars of investment, Mr. Speaker, will be the Ease of 
<br/>Doing Business Project, which is a digital ‘BusinessNOW FIJI’ portal, which will act as a virtual 
<br/>one-stop  platform  for  investors  going  forward.  Investors,  over  time,  will  have  a  single  platform, 
<br/>which will enable them to get services in Fiji and we expect to extend that to the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are launching the ‘Starting a Business Solution’ next month and then we will deal with 
<br/>one  of  the  hardest  or  biggest  issues  in  investment,  which  is  Construction  Permits  approval,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, and we hope to deliver by August next year.  Should that be done, we will significantly 
<br/>make attempt in ease of doing business in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  our  Economic  Unit,  the  Ministry  has  been  dedicated  to 
<br/>diversifying the economy, redeveloping its architecture and trying to deliver on sustainable growth.  
<br/>The  Cabinet’s  approval  of  the  recent  Policy  Framework  for  Significant  Investments  will  actually 
<br/>accelerate some of the big projects, particularly hotel projects that are in front of us.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1063 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  establishment  of  a  Commercial  Agriculture  Taskforce,  partnering  with  private  sector 
<br/>investors, such as Fiji Water and FMF, will revitalise our industries and expand into other sectors, 
<br/>such as vanilla and cocoa, promoting economic diversification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to also make a point which I made the last time, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The three 
<br/>major  institutional  investors  in  Fiji  which  are  FNPF,  Fijian  Holdings  and  BSP  Life,  are  looking 
<br/>closely at diversifying into commercial agriculture, and hopefully, aquaculture.  That is happening 
<br/>now, Mr. Speaker, and we are positioned for very good things in terms of diversifying the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also advancing the medicinal cannabis industry exercise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and intend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to bring the legislation forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the kava industry which the other side actually ignored, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are 
<br/>bringing forward the Kava Bill this year, which will not only improve the quality standards for kava 
<br/>but will ensure that our people start benefitting from this very promising industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, we are rejuvenating the Fijian Made brand and improving market access  for 
<br/>local businesses.  Fiji’s participation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Expo 2025 in Osaka Japan which will 
<br/>attract 25 million visitors, will provide a platform to continue to promote our unique identity and 
<br/>attract investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  also  focusing  on  getting  mahogany  going,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    We  are  looking  at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>retirement villages.  It needs legislation which we will bring forward to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned also, the audio-visual industry has a lot of promises.  Right now, there 
<br/>is an audio-visual company that has actually hired out a hotel in the West for two years.  We are 
<br/>looking for a permanent place for them, and if they get a permanent place, it will transform the audio-
<br/>visual industry in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of MSMEs and co-operatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are over 50,000 businesses 
<br/>that are registered as Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. The Ministry will continue to support 
<br/>economic diversification and growth through the $3.6 million which has been budgeted for it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I would like to also emphasise, Sir, is that if we include the total budget for MSME 
<br/>support and co-operatives, it is a staggering $120 million.  That is the level of commitment that the 
<br/>Government has in that space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  co-operatives,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have,  for  the  first  time,  tried  to  launch  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$400,000 capital grant to boost co-operatives and also focus on training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In communications, we are, of course, developing a digital strategy that will take this country 
<br/>forward.  I certainly believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the digitisation of Fiji and the Fiji Government 
<br/>lies at the basis of a transformative economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  standards,  we  are  trying  to  raise  standards  in  Fiji.    We  are 
<br/></span><span>currently reviewing  the  Acts  that are currently under the Department  for Standards, and  we have 
<br/></span><span>received some money, which will be used to continue to improve the equipment of those standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I humbly believe that this Budget will be the catalyst for growth in Fiji.  By 
<br/>investing  in  digital  infrastructure,  enhancing  trade,  empowering  our  local  businesses  and  SMEs, 
<br/>ensuring food safety,  we are setting  the stage for sustainable development  and prosperity.  These 
<br/>initiatives, Mr. Speaker, will drive job creation, attract foreign investment, foster innovation across

<div><span>all sectors and ensure that Fiji continues to hold its own in the global economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our commitment to these transformative efforts will pave the way for a resilient and thriving 
<br/>future for all Fijians. Together, we will forge a legacy of progress and prosperity that will be felt for 
<br/>generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I support this Budget wholeheartedly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  just  let  me  remind  you  of  the  lights,  it  signifies 
<br/>something. So, let us try and be consistent with how we use our time and the warning that the lights 
<br/>give out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was planning to adjourn Parliament for tea, but I think we will just continue. I am sorry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, we have lights in the West, lights 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the East, lights in the South, but we do not have lights in the North, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Our Northern Star.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  fellow  Members  of  Parliament,  first  of  all,  let  me 
<br/>congratulate the new Attorney-General, honourable Leung.  Welcome to Parliament, Sir, and I wish 
<br/>you well in your stint as the Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an independent Member of the Opposition to address the 2024-
<br/>2025 Budget. While the name of this Budget is an economically ‘Stable, Secure and Sustainable Fiji’, 
<br/>it is evident that this Government has fallen short of actually delivering on these promises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My critique today, Mr. Speaker, will focus on the glaring deficiencies in this Budget, the lack 
<br/>of accountability and transparency and the urgent need for more inclusive and a  forward-thinking 
<br/>approach, and also an urgent need for a lot of creativity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  Budget  projects  a  net  deficit  of  $635.5  million  or  4.5  percent  of  GDP, 
<br/>leading to a debt to GDP ratio of 77.8 percent by July 2025.  Despite the Government’s rhetoric about 
<br/>fiscal responsibility, we see increasing debt levels without corresponding investments in projects that 
<br/>will actually spur long-term goals and long-term growth. Where are the infrastructure developments 
<br/>that justify this debt?  Two years have passed with no significant projects to actually show for it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We understand, Sir, when they say that the debt is high but there is a reason for it, and I think 
<br/>that has been explained by many on this side of Parliament already.  There is a reason why the debt 
<br/>level was that high, it was COVID. The figures have been spelt out this morning. What the entire 
<br/>population  in  Fiji  wants  to  hear  and  wanted  to  hear  is  that  you  have  moved  on  from  blaming 
<br/></span><span>everything on the FijiFirst Government. We just wanted to hear about some creativity, about you 
<br/></span><span>making sure that the economy grew, but nothing came forward on this, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Poor performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, everyone knows about the dependency on tourism. This 
<br/>Budget relies heavily on the tourism sector as the main driver of economic growth. We have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1065 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hearing about diversification now for 18 months, but nothing in this Budget shows us that there has 
<br/>been some creativity regarding incentivising anything that is going to diversify.   I have got some 
<br/>examples  which  I  will tell  you at  a later stage,  which my  friend, who sits behind  the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Tourism and Civil Aviation, he will agree there is a sector that needs to be tapped into, they have 
<br/>forgotten about it.  I think he has been crying till he’s blue in the face that he has not been listened 
<br/>to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic shows us that the dangers of putting everything in one basket 
<br/>are there.  This Budget offers no substantial incentives to stimulate growth in other vital sectors, such 
<br/>as agriculture or manufacturing or technology.  There is a pipeline of investments, and the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications says that that pipeline is quite long, might be from Russia to here because it still 
<br/>has not arrived.  We need a diversified economy to build some resilience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  This  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  actually  skidding  in  the  same 
<br/>place  it  was  18  months  ago.    It  is  skidding  with  no  clear  plan  for  diversification,  and  instead  of 
<br/>supporting the great efforts, a limited marketing budget for tourism.  There is so much more that can 
<br/>be done, Sir.  No new incentives or packages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We do not need incentives, we need to respect the private 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector, that is it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Of course, I do not disagree with you.  You have not even incentivised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  widening  inequality  and  the  burden  on  the  poor,  the  current  fiscal 
<br/>policies are widening the gap between the rich and the poor.  Increases in fringe benefit tax and other 
<br/>indirect  taxes  will  be  passed  on  to  the  consumers,  making  everyday  goods  and  services  more 
<br/>expensive for the average Fijian.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government’s  policies  are  burdening  ordinary  citizens,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while 
<br/>benefiting a select few and it is actually very obvious. It falls short on tax collections, raising concerns 
<br/>about  Government’s  effectiveness  of  the  Government’s  revenue  strategies  and  without  robust 
<br/>revenue, the ability to fund essential services and support the vulnerable diminishes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  has  this  Government  done  for  the  poor  and  the  working  class?  
<br/>Teachers, feel undervalued and underpaid.  There is a glaring lack of initiatives to retain the talent 
<br/>within  the  country,  or  to  invest  in  human  capital.    No  significant  projects,  no  meaningful 
<br/>infrastructure development, no concrete plans to uplift the poor, have been proposed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government’s  social  protection  measures,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  are  inadequate,  leaving 
<br/></span><span>many vulnerable communities without the help  they desperately  need.   I think one of the biggest 
<br/>reasons why the honourable Minister did not go right around the countryside because he knew the 
<br/>reaction he was actually going to get.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget also lacks some transparency and some accountability.  There 
<br/>are  allegations  of  financial  benefits  flowing  to  close  associates  and  donors.    This  lack  of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accountability is unacceptable. The Government must provide a clear and detailed account of how 
<br/>the public funds are being used. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget actually neglects critical sectors that are essential for long term 
<br/>economic  growth.    There  is  no  substantial  support  for  agriculture,  a  sector  that  can  provide  food 
<br/>security and livelihood for thousands of Fijians.  The manufacturing sector which has potential to 
<br/>create jobs and reduce our reliance on imports is also overlooked. Additionally, the Government’s 
<br/>fiscal management is poor, falling short of tax collections and failing to diversify revenue sources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst actually going through all of these, I decided that I have a quick read 
<br/>of some of the reports that were around, especially those from IMF and the World Bank’s, the ANZ’s 
<br/>that have just been mentioned.  Of course, ANZ says good things.  It says bullish, but there is a lot 
<br/>of  caution  in  what  you  read,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand also that in our own Budget Book, the honourable Minister has 
<br/>said that there is going to be a holistic review being undertaken to right-size the Civil Service and 
<br/>also to contain the public sector wage bill.  Sir, that raises alarm bells, already it raises alarm bells 
<br/>for the public sector.  What happens is, when you say such things or about to do some things, it will 
<br/>actually mean more migration.  Our young and our educated young staff are suddenly going to say, 
<br/>“well, hang on, this is too unstable for me, I am out of here”, and that is exactly what is happening, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to ask some questions that emanate from these reports that I read.  
<br/>Had we actually addressed the downside risks?  No, we have not.  There is an expected slowdown in 
<br/>tourism arrivals, have we addressed it?  No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have we addressed the worsening 
<br/>skill labour shortages that everyone knows about?  No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have we addressed the 
<br/>high immigration?  No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have we addressed the high global commodity prices?  
<br/>No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have we actually got enough fiscal space?  No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have we 
<br/>got an improved business climate?  Go ask.  Honourable Bala spelt it out this morning, go and ask 
<br/>the businesspeople.  The answer is, no, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have we stimulated private investment and 
<br/>boosted  growth?    No,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Have  we  addressed  the  climate  change  issues?  No,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  The honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry is nodding his 
<br/>head.  Wait till I tell you about sustainable aviation fuels, he has not even addressed you on it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these questions as I said, they come from very valued reports which I 
<br/>know that the Ministry of Finance has actually looked at.  Have we fostered diversification which is 
<br/>widely acknowledged and sorely needed?  No, we have not, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Turn around and speak 
<br/>to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation,  he  will  tell  you  the  importance  of 
<br/>sustainable aviation  fuels and that involves our Sugar Industry  and something that can take us to 
<br/>another level.  Have you addressed it?  No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have they actually incentivised the 
<br/>MSME Sector?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S. KOYA.- Even their 16 year calculation is  all wrong.  The highest  growth  this 
<br/>country has ever had, came within those 16 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They are all wrong, they cannot 
<br/>do their math properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MSME Sector which is the engine for growth for any country has been

<div><span>stifled for the last 18 months.  Walk around the country and speak to the shopkeepers and they will 
<br/>tell you.  Are we sufficiently geared for the potential headwinds that we are about to face?  No, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, we are not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now for the great water hoodwink; this is important. In the last Budget, we 
<br/>allowed water bottling companies a tax free holiday or tax free incentive, et cetera, that were given 
<br/>right across the board for all the water companies.  Guess what?  Now, our local water companies 
<br/>are being hit with a 5 cents tax instead of a one cent.  That is a 500 percent increase.  Guess what?  
<br/>They gave with one hand, and they slapped them and brought them back and said, “no, you are going 
<br/>to actually pay this.”  Hoodwinked, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what they are actually saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Fire the Minister!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just 12 months ago, all our local water bottling companies were happy 
<br/>with the tax free status that they were given.  Guess what?  They are no longer very happy.  There 
<br/>have  been  very  little  incentives  in  the  tourism  industry,  and  you  must  realise  it  and  put  it  into 
<br/>perspective.  We can actually bring in a million and a half people into Fiji, but we do not have the 
<br/>rooms.  You have to incentivise the industry so that we can build faster.  How are we going to build 
<br/>faster when all the skilled labourers have actually gone?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, private investors look at all of these.  So, what I am saying is, there are not 
<br/>enough rooms, and it will stifle our tourism development plans which I know the honourable Minister 
<br/>has worked very hard at.  I am actually told by a very good authority that, yes, it will actually taper 
<br/>off.  The tourism boom will actually taper off soon, but what are we doing to ensure that we make 
<br/>sure those shocks do not happen to us?  We have actually done nothing.  Too many projects are still 
<br/>in the pipeline, nothing off the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  had  to  beg  the  question,  why?    It  is  because 
<br/>confidence is not there.  They have not shown any confidence in the last 18 months purely because 
<br/>of the instability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was going to say about the sugarcane industry.  There is an actual gem in 
<br/>the making and, Sir, if I am not believed, ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation.  He took me along with him, we both saw the same result, but no one 
<br/>listens to him.  This is the Sugar Industry and the industry that can be for us, a major saviour, which 
<br/>is the sustainable aviation fuels industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to be ready for tomorrow, we are not.   We need to ensure that our 
<br/>young people actually stay in this country and do us good, but are we?  Not at all, Sir, we are losing 
<br/>them by the dozen.  I think the numbers are now up to 70,000 people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reports  that  were  mentioned  earlier  on,  we  are  talking  about  ANZ 
<br/>Reports, Westpac Reports, IMF Reports, World Bank Reports, and as I have said, there are many 
<br/></span><span>things that I have just mentioned come out of those reports. You need to be reading them with caution. 
<br/></span><span>Of course, ANZ says there is going to be bullish growth, but they are actually very cautious about 
<br/>what they are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are certain industries that need to take off, but everything right now seems like it is 
<br/>sitting in the pipeline.  There is going to be a slowdown in economic growth.  We have a susceptibility 
<br/>also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to natural disasters, has that been factored in?  I have not heard one word and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not think there is anything subject to correction by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.  I do not think 
<br/>there is anything in there that has actually looked at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, I am not sure because you have the same people who used to do the 
<br/>budget for us, but where is the creativity?  It is gone. Where is the innovation?  It is gone.  The only 
<br/>thing that changed is the leader of that particular place and I think that might be the net effect of what 
<br/>is actually happening.  You need to start thinking outside the box.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, private sector growth will only happen if you incentivise. There is nothing 
<br/>there.  Let  this  be  a  warning  to  the  honourable  Minister,  Sir,  if  you  do  not  start  actually  thinking 
<br/>outside the box, we will not get anywhere.  We will be losing; we are losing, and we are losing on a 
<br/>daily basis.  If you cannot create more jobs, then maybe you ought to leave that job and hand it over 
<br/>to someone else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are doomed with respect to this Budget, I definitely do not support this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular Budget.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the time to deliver my response. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you may note that the lights ( I do not know what is 
<br/>happening). It is giving a wrong time; the lights are flashing but the time is four minutes.  We are 
<br/>manually handling that now.  We will continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers 
<br/>and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise today in support of the Coalition Government’s Budget 
<br/>for  Financial  Year  2024-2025.  It  certainly  is  a  people’s  budget  and  I  believe  it  is  evidence  of  a 
<br/>government that has been working towards taking care of all its people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  touch  on  a  few  points  raised  in  the  Budget  Address  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Finance because they are important to me personally as a Parliamentarian 
<br/>but also to the Ministry I work in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first of these points is the need to rebuild trust in the Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>entered politics reluctantly, but I did so because in 2022 we were at a point where we could no longer 
<br/>trust  the people who ruled us. The Government  and all its resources were devoted entirely  to  the 
<br/>personal agendas of two people. If you were the enemy of those two people, you were a target.  If 
<br/>you did not matter to those two people, you got nothing. If we were not going to vote for those two 
<br/>people, we got nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I saw with my own eyes the way the previous Government wasted resources 
<br/>during the COVID-19 crisis and the politicking and pettiness of leaders who refused to join hands 
<br/>with community organisations they did not like because they had criticised them. I was accused by 
<br/>the then Minister  for Economy  of using the resources of my  organisation, FRIEND, only  to  help 
<br/>supporters of one political party when we are reaching out to all at the request of their Government 
<br/>officials.  I wondered at the time why he did not use the resources of the Government to reach out to 
<br/></span><span>those in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are far from being a perfect Government. We have been criticised for 
<br/>many things.  There are many things we can improve, but I hope that our people at least believe that, 
<br/>for all of our faults, we are a Government for all of the people.  We have tried to right the wrongs of 
<br/>the past, to the Vatukoula gold miners, to the FNPF pensioners.  We do not do this for votes, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we do this because it is the right thing to do.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1069 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of living is the people’s biggest concern.  We 
<br/>talk  to  the  people,  we  read  the  opinion  polls  and  the  letters  to  the  editor.    We  know  people  are 
<br/>struggling and we know that people find it hard to understand why we had to increase VAT.   But I 
<br/>also understand that without the VAT increase, we could not pay for increased welfare allowances, 
<br/>we could not pay for a better healthcare, and we could not bring down the Government debt that 
<br/>stands in the way of the greater social spending that we need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It didn’t go down, it went up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, on the cost of living issue we can only control prices so far.   
<br/>As the honourable Minister for Finance has said, we must focus on increasing incomes, so I welcome 
<br/>the increase in the minimum wage and the overdue increments for civil servants.   The honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister earlier talked about the different social protection mechanisms.  While our honourable 
<br/>Minister will discuss the depth, the overall impact of the new Budget and the Ministry’s plan for the 
<br/>new  financial  year,  I  want  to  draw  attention  to  the  work  undertaken  for  the  people  living  with 
<br/>disabilities, older people and street dwellers.  Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to return to the 
<br/>theme of trust in this Government.   These are not things which are done for votes, but these are 
<br/>things that are done because they are the right things to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  disability-specific  budget  lines  for  our  Ministry  estimated  at  $31.9 
<br/>million, an increase of $4.6 million from this financial year.   To ensure Government honours our 
<br/>commitment  under  the  UN  Convention,  we  continue  to  consult  and  engage  with  the  different 
<br/>organisations  representing  people  with  disabilities.    The  Ministry  would  like  to  acknowledge  the 
<br/>relevant specific disability budget lines sitting in six Government Ministries, and looking forward to 
<br/>working with these Ministries, with organisations for persons with disabilities and implementing the 
<br/>much-needed interventions for the inclusion and participation of people living with disabilities on an 
<br/>equal basis with others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main targets for our Disability Policy in the 2024-2025 Financial Year include passing 
<br/>of a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities and consultations on the Marrakesh Treaty, 
<br/>which is a worldwide agreement to facilitate timely access to published works for persons who are 
<br/>blind or otherwise print material for those who are visually impaired.  We want to strengthen our 
<br/>collaboration  with  the  Government  of  Australia  on  pre-agreed  activities  with  organisations  for 
<br/>persons with disabilities, and relevant Government Ministries in making schools and hospitals more 
<br/>accessible and creating advocacy on the meaningful inclusion of persons with disabilities.  We also 
<br/>want to strengthen collaboration with the National Disaster Management Office in the areas of Early 
<br/>Warning Inclusive Systems and with Fiji Disabled People’s Federation on the review of the Disaster 
<br/>Disability Toolkit among others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  discussing  about  older  persons,  I  want  to  briefly  address  the  issue  of 
<br/>inclusion,  protection,  health  and  enabling  environment  for  older  persons.    According  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Population Census in 2017, more than 10 percent of Fijians were aged 60 years or more, so more 
<br/>than 90,000 people.  Many of them face issues such as poor physical access, health, disability, abuse 
<br/>and neglect.  They need an advocacy and policy platform.  In 2012, the National Council of Older 
<br/>Persons Act was approved and in 2013 the Council was appointed.  However, no resources were 
<br/></span><span>allocated to help with the functioning of the Council.  We are currently working on recruiting the 
<br/></span><span>relevant personnel to help in establishing the Council to perform the roles and responsibilities already 
<br/>determined.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  also  establishing  District  Committees  for  Older  Persons.    These  Committees  will 
<br/>create the inclusive platform and also champion the needs of older persons within the communities.  
<br/>This  year,  the  Ministry  carried  out  four  Divisional  consultations  as  well  as  a  National  General 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assembly for Older Persons.  The discussions were centred on inclusion, protection, health and an 
<br/>enabling environment for older persons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  allocation  of  renovation  budget  for 
<br/>Vunirewa Bible School, which the Methodist Church of Fiji has kindly provided for the Government 
<br/>to use as a location for the much-needed Rehabilitation Centre for the vulnerable children living on 
<br/>our streets.   The shelter will enable the children to be resocialised to accepted norms and receive 
<br/>much needed interventions before they enter into skills training and re-integrated back with families 
<br/>and communities.  The Ministry is currently working with the civil society, faith-based organisations 
<br/>and relevant  Government  Ministries to  help  set up other facilities and programmes to  ensure that 
<br/>interventions for the vulnerable children are relevant and holistic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, finally, I want to speak about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  This 
<br/>is a project to which I am personally deeply committed to. This Budget supports the  setup of the 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission secretariat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have taken the first step. We are not rushing this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. To do this well, we 
<br/>must listen to our people and also learn the lessons from other countries and communities who have 
<br/>been through this experience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want the Commission to be a key foundation for the national unity and nation-building 
<br/>that is so critical for all of our futures, and I want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for acknowledging that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, this is why I have many reasons to support this Budget. As the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance himself has said, it is not flashy, it is not laden with gimmicks, it is a solid and 
<br/>honest Budget that begins the long-term and often unseen work that must be done to help progress 
<br/>us as a people, as of different communities and as one nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support and commend the Budget for the financial year 2024-2025.  Thank you, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Budget Estimate delivered 
<br/>by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before that, I would like to express my disappointment with the reduction of speaking time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, and the cut in Parliament Session from two weeks to one week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last 18 months, speaking time and the number of speakers has been reduced on crucial 
<br/>motions. This is not a democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This Parliament belongs to the people, and they 
<br/>deserve sufficient time for us to debate and scrutinise important issues affecting them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You have the votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget can be summed up in just three words -myopic, inequitable and 
<br/>neglectful.  This Budget demonstrates how out of touch this Government is with the real needs of 
<br/>our  people.  This  Budget  is  myopic  because  it  heavily  relies  on  the  tourism  sector.  This  short-
<br/>sightedness leaves our nation vulnerable to global market conditions.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1071 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Budget  is  inequitable.  I  expected  fair  distribution  of  wealth  and  resources,  to  reduce 
<br/>inequality between ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’. However, it neglects low wage workers and pensioners. 
<br/>Does the Government truly believe that a 50 cents increase per hour is enough to keep a roof over 
<br/>their head and put food on the table?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget is neglectful, failing to tackle the exodus of skilled workers, stimulate private 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector growth or address the high cost of living. These are the critical issues affecting our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, I cautioned the Government about the consequences of passing a 
<br/>budget relying on easy revenue by increasing duties and taxes. We have already seen clear signs of 
<br/>a troubled economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since November 2023, our economic growth forecast has been revised downwards two times 
<br/>from an initial 3.8 percent to 2.8 percent.  Inflation peaked at a 10-year high of 7.1 percent in April, 
<br/>slightly dropping to 5.8 percent in May, and it is anticipated  that the inflation will be around 4.4 
<br/>percent at the end of 2024, and with all these spending, we expect inflation to go up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also know that the forward booking for Fiji Airways is also slowing down, and this can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be gauged with the number of advertisements that is coming out from Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Except for gold and few commodities, other sectors are underperforming. Job advertisements 
<br/>are  declining.  New  customer  lending  is  sluggish,  and  imports  of  investment  goods  needed  for 
<br/>businesses are decreasing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite ample liquidity of $1.9 billion and a low interest rate, investors are hesitant to borrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why? It is all about confidence, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  $1.2  billion  approved  loan  is  not  being  uplifted  and  the  promising  pipeline  from  the 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>and Communications remains slow moving.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Just keep watching, it’s coming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our economic growth is uncertain, but no effort was 
<br/>made in this Budget to address that. I have previously warned that any tax hike hurts consumers and 
<br/>businesses alike, by reducing purchasing power and investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are seeing the negative impact in an already high-cost domestic environment, driven by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>high global prices, raising VAT was a misguided decision and maintaining it is neglectful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a case to reduce VAT to promote consumer confidence and retail 
<br/>sales and I expected the honourable Minister for Finance to do that. The expected VAT revenue has 
<br/>not materialised, even with higher disposable income from remittances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When VAT was 9 percent, we collected $1 billion.  Raising it to 15 percent only increased 
<br/></span><span>collection  to  $1.3  billion,  missing  the  target  by  $200  million.  This  shows  the  VAT  hike  has  not 
<br/></span><span>resulted in a revenue windfall.  Reducing VAT could restore confidence, and consumers to buy and 
<br/>businesses to expand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  US  President,  Jimmy  Carter,  once  said,  and  I  quote,  “The  measure  of  a 
<br/>society is found in how they treat their weakest and most helpless citizens”.  This sentiment highlights 
<br/>the Government’s duty and responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Opposition and throughout the campaign, this Government made the cost of living a key 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue, promising to alleviate it, yet in their first Budget, they increased VAT to 15 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, food prices in Fiji remained higher than the pre-pandemic level, causing a 
<br/>constant pinch at the cash registers.  Groceries, utilities, bus fares, fuel, gas, and even basic staples, 
<br/>like bread and butter, have also seen price hikes.  How can we expect our people to thrive under such 
<br/>condition? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after COVID-19, the FijiFirst Government raised wages to $4, reduced VAT 
<br/>to 9 percent and cut duties on 2,000 products to ease living cost. Now, that the pandemic is over and 
<br/>bus fares have gone up, the least this Government could have done was to restore pensioners’ bus 
<br/>fares to $40 per month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has not upheld its many promises before the Election, and 
<br/>I  want  to  remind  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  that  he  made  grand  promises  to  reduce 
<br/>Government expenditure in hundred days.  It is 18 months now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and what did he 
<br/>say?    Slashing  Minister’s  salaries  and  allowances  by  30  percent.    Instead  in  just  18  months,  the 
<br/>number of Ministers, salaries and allowance, and related costs, have increased, while our pensioners 
<br/>aged 60 years are denied Bus Fare Assistance.  What a shame, Mr. Speaker, Sir!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also promised ministerial motorcades and he will pool Government vehicles, particularly 
<br/>he was going to pool ministerial vehicles, cutting their use by 50 percent. However, the opposite has 
<br/>occurred.  New vehicle purchases and leasing costs have surged.  Just talk to the public and they will 
<br/>tell you that Government vehicles are seen dropping off civil servants after late night grog sessions, 
<br/>dropping children at school and, of course, visiting relatives and friends.  Is that cost cutting?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he also said that he will stop holding government meetings and consultations 
<br/>at expensive hotels and resorts and use community halls at schools and religious institutions.  Did 
<br/>that happen?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics held his first </span><span>‘kala</span><span> </span><span>vata’</span><span> Economic Summit 
<br/>at the Grand Pacific Hotel.  How can we expect other Ministers to cut back? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following his lead, the Ministry of Agriculture used the same hotel, just to announce a new 
<br/>Drainage Board.  That is how they waste money, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This is the betrayal of public 
<br/>trust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government’s  big  spending  spree  began  with  the  first  Budget, 
<br/>committing around $9 billion in just two Budgets.  New Departments and Ministries have added to 
<br/>the cost, and with all Coalition MPs now Ministers or Assistant Ministers in a country with 960,000 
<br/>population, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what a shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at a time when our citizens are suffering under the crushing weight of the 
<br/>cost of living, I challenge the honourable Prime Minister, Sir, please, reduce the number of Ministers 
<br/>and  Assistant  Ministers  and  their  travel  expenses.    Our  people  are  tightening  their  belts,  will  the 
<br/></span><span>Government do the same?  Honourable Prime Minister, this is the right time for you to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  ask  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to stop treating 
<br/>taxpayers’ money as their piggy bank and consider the common people’s plight.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1073 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time for this Government to show fiscal responsibility and compassion.  
<br/>The  people  of  Fiji  are  not  fooled  by  this  Government’s  propaganda.    They  can  see  through  the 
<br/>narrative  being  spun  around  freedom,  consultation  and  high  government  debt,  just  to  divert  the 
<br/>attention from Government’s poor performance and failures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government’s narrative has lost its appeal to the public.  The promised 
<br/>freedom has made our homes, streets and social media unsafe.  The crime rate, including drug issues, 
<br/>has skyrocketed and the racial divide has deepened.  The so-called newfound freedom has left Fijians 
<br/>living in fear both, at home and when out in public places.  This is the stark reality of their governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their commitment to consultation is also selective.  Where was public input on the MPs’ pay 
<br/>rise?  Tell me, where was consultation on the MPs’ pay rise?  How much consultation was conducted 
<br/>before the Budget?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not long ago, we heard from the honourable Minister for Women, Children 
<br/>and Social Protection on the absence of consultation when the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics unilaterally 
<br/>changed the Bus Fare Subsidy from a fixed $25 a month to utilisation base, hurting the elderly and 
<br/>disabled.    Where  were  the  public,  political  parties  or  Cabinet  consultation  when  it  unilaterally 
<br/>increased  payments  to  each  political  party  with  $325,000,  benefitting  just  two  parties  -  NFP  and 
<br/>SODELPA by $240,000 and $280,000 every year?  Is this fair, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their  repeated  claim  of  genuine  consultation  is  merely  to  create  an  image  that  they  are 
<br/>listening to the people.  Did they listen to the public on the cost of living, VAT reduction and poor 
<br/>service delivery? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government borrows more but builds less.  Under this Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the stock of debt will keep rising. We need new projects, not just infrastructure upgrades.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the only guarantee in this Budget is that they will end this financial year 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the next with much debt, ignoring economic risk that will harm the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National  Development  and  Statistics  presented  the  Government’s  achievement  in  Budget 
<br/>Transparency Consultation and Building Foundations for Economic Growth in the last 18 months.  
<br/>It was all wishy-washy.  Do these accomplishments really matter to low-income earners, homeowners 
<br/>battling  termite  infestation,  farmers  who  want  farm  access  road,  fishermen  who  need  ice,  rural 
<br/>dwellers who want electricity, and market vendors who are trying to earn enough to support their 
<br/>family? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What matters to them, is whether the Government has delivered on its budget promises.  This 
<br/>is how the public judges the performance of the Government. So, what is the Government’s report 
<br/>card in the last 18 months?  Let me tell you, honourable Minister for Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no work was undertaken for rural electrification for which $4.1 million was 
<br/></span><span>allocated.  Farmers were denied farm access road, only 30 percent of $1.8 million was used, not a 
<br/></span><span>single cent used for the Rice Development Programme, $3 million allocated for termite control being 
<br/>the flag bearers of termite control, only 24 percent was used, people are still waiting for assistance 
<br/>as termite problem escalates.  From $12 million allocation, only 39 percent was used for the hospitals 
<br/>to buy equipment.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is how they are running the show. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I acknowledge the significant contributions of the former

<div><span>Finance for their outstanding work in preparing the Budget documents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, before I take my sit, I also like to congratulate the new honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>and the honourable Minister for Fisheries.  She is the first woman Minister to head  Fisheries and 
<br/>Forests, something that she was entitled to be given from the beginning of the year.   But I thank the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, at least, he woke up, and decided to give a portfolio to another lady.  So, 
<br/>that makes two Ministers in Cabinet.  The only change I would request, honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>please, put these ladies in front, do not put them at the back.  They are very closed the door and I am 
<br/>worried that one day, they will be out of the door. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, honourable Premila Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  first  line  of  your  contribution,  you  did  comment  heavily  on  the  expenses  being 
<br/>incurred  by  Government  and  when  I  say  ‘Government’,  that  includes  Parliament  as  well,  and 
<br/>especially on tours.  I make it a point to include the Opposition as well for Parliamentary tours.  So, 
<br/>hopefully, whilst you are so heated up with the shortness of time now being undertaken in having a 
<br/>Budget debate, there was quite a lot of heated contributions from the Oppositions as well, especially 
<br/>from  the  honourable  Whip  when  he  mentioned  that  the  time  allocated  for  us  to  speak  keeps 
<br/>dwindling.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, I cannot do much.  If the Head of Government, the honourable Prime Minister, decides 
<br/>for the betterment of the country to attend a very important meeting, it is our duty to see that we 
<br/>support him there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, we did not take that with just lying down, et cetera, no!  We did raise our 
<br/>issues, especially on the time for speeches to be made and especially the time that the hardworking 
<br/>Secretariat staff undertake when we have these lengthy meetings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you reach your homes and in the comforts of your bed, poor staff are still working here 
<br/>preparing the Chambers and everything, for the next day. The next day, like tomorrow, is another 25 
<br/>Speakers, and you watch - by the time we take off from here or leave here, the poor members of the 
<br/>Secretariat will be hard slogging their way in cleaning up the Chambers and everything, right down 
<br/>to the Big Committee Room where we have our meals, to ensure it is spick and span, ready for the 
<br/>next day.  And if we continue to do that, it will be really quite heavy on them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have lost two staff this year - one that used to work in this very Chamber’s, cleaning, that 
<br/></span><span>was Lemeki, and the other one was my Personal Assistant.  So, that is the remarks that I would like 
<br/>to  counter  because  your  colleagues  did  raise  quite  heated  points  during  the  Business  Committee 
<br/>meeting.  However, honourable |Members, I cannot divulge what we have discussed in the Business 
<br/>Committee meeting.  That stays there and it does not come here into this Chamber.  But I am only 
<br/>raising this just to ensure that I highlight this with some perspective, that it was not easy.

<br/>let us hear it.  Let us make a stand and see, do we agree?”  I will only act on those kind of decisions 
<br/>being reached.  I am sorry to be raising this, but I cannot just sit silently here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speak er, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General, honourable Leader of the Opposition, my fellow honourable Members of the Opposition, 
<br/>esteemed guests and fellow citizens, a warm greeting to you all. Thank you for your interest in the 
<br/>Budget Debate 2024-2025.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I stand before you today as an Independent Member of Parliament united in a shared concern: 
<br/>the  2024–2025  Budget  presented  by  the  Coalition  Government.  While  it  speaks  of  optimism  and 
<br/>promises, a closer look reveals shortcomings in addressing the core issues facing our nation and its 
<br/>people. Let me look deeper and understand how we can design a budget that truly serves all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget  outlines a concerning level  of borrowing  -  $635.5 million,  a 
<br/>hefty  portion  of  our  national  income.  While  lower  than  past  deficits,  it  remains  high,  especially 
<br/>considering  our  current  economic  climate.  It  is  like  a  temporary  fix  for  a  deeper  wound.  The 
<br/>Government justifies this by needing to stimulate a sluggish economy and fund vital projects. But 
<br/>from  what  we  are  seeing,  the  economy  is  on  a  continued  downward  spiral.  Investment  in 
<br/>infrastructure that grows the GDP is what is needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In April this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the inflation rate had soared to 7.1 percent and it stands 
<br/>at 6.7 percent as of last month. To paint a picture for the people of Fiji that the economy is doing 
<br/>well, but with a debt that is over $10 billion, an inflation rate that is far too high, and a GDP growth 
<br/>rate that is on a downward spiral, we must ask the Coalition Government - What are we going to do 
<br/>that will put the brakes on the downward growth and start to stimulate the economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to 77.8 percent by the end of July, 2025. While 
<br/>this might seem like progress, it is important to remember that this is still an alarmingly high figure. 
<br/>The Government's long-term goal is to bring this down to 60 percent by 2040.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not good enough. Our children and grandchildren will bear the brunt 
<br/>of  this  debt,  especially  with  little  in  the  way  of  economic  stimulus  and  major  infrastructure 
<br/>development that would be needed to grow the economy and help lessen the debt burden. The only 
<br/>way to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio with the deficit being so high every year is to make sure 
<br/>that our GDP is growing faster. The post-COIVD economic rebound has completed, and it is now 
<br/>time for the Government to find creative and innovative ways to ensure that our economy is growing 
<br/>every year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker. Sir, the allocation of funds also warrants closer examination. The Ministry of 
<br/>Finance is provided with a total budget of $96.9 million, with an increased grant of $55 million to 
<br/>the  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service.  While  improving  tax  compliance  is  important,  one  must 
<br/>question whether this significant increase is the best use of our limited resources. Additionally, the 
<br/></span><span>allocation of $8 million for the Government's Financial Management Information System (FMIS) 
<br/></span><span>raises questions about the prioritisation of spending. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget allocates $169.6 million to the Republic of Fiji Military Forces 
<br/>(RFMF).    National  security  is,  undoubtedly,  paramount,  but  does  this  allocation  truly  reflect  the 
<br/>current need of our people? One might ask, is this increase necessary?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>1076 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many Fijians struggle with the rising living cost and unemployment, exacerbated by inflation 
<br/>and supply chain disruptions. Families face financial difficulties, and unemployment rates remain a 
<br/>pressing concern. Is the RFMF allocation proportionate to these urgent economic challenges faced 
<br/>by ordinary Fijians?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji recently almost every second day we hear of robbery, violence, murder, hike in drug 
<br/>cases forming headlines, perhaps mobilising the Budget to tackle these issues is more paramount than 
<br/>peacekeeping overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, equally crucial is the robust healthcare system, especially during a global 
<br/>health  crisis.  The  Budget  must  prioritize  adequate  funding  for  hospitals,  medical  supplies  and 
<br/>healthcare  personnel.  Does  it  adequately  address  healthcare  infrastructure  and  pandemic 
<br/>preparedness, or does it favour defence spending disproportionately?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government’s allocation of $66 million for free education from early 
<br/>childhood  to  secondary  school  is  a  commendable  step.  I  am  happy  that  free  education  grant  will 
<br/>continue despite the PS for Education talking about reintroducing school fees for urban schools to 
<br/>force families with low incomes to move their children to rural schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just in May this year, it was revealed that 39 percent out of 90,000 or some 35,000 students 
<br/>dropped out of school between the Years 8 and 12. This is an alarming figure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 
<br/>we need to all come together in this august Parliament to work out a way that we can make school 
<br/>more enjoyable and bring this number down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the systemic deficiencies plague our education sector. Insufficient facilities, 
<br/>overcrowded  classrooms,  outdated  curriculum,  and  underpaid  educators  persist.  Can  we  truly 
<br/>transform education with these modest efforts? The Back-to-School support of $40 million, while 
<br/>positive,  remains  insufficient  to  tackle  broader  issues  of  poverty  and  inequality.  Many  families 
<br/>struggle to afford basic school supplies, uniforms and transportation. How can we effectively bridge 
<br/>this gap and ensure all children have a fair shot at education? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current Budget lacks a clear vision and strategic roadmap. It prioritizes 
<br/>short-term gains and appearances over addressing the underlying causes of our economic challenge. 
<br/>What we need is a budget that balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability. We need to 
<br/>live within our means and invest in long-term solutions, not burden future generations with crippling 
<br/>debts. Investments should prioritize education, healthcare and infrastructure, areas critical to national 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we need is a budget that promotes social justice, uplifting vulnerable communities is 
<br/>essential, eradicating poverty and ensuring equitable access to education and healthcare should be 
<br/>central tenets of the budget. Let us not forget those who struggle daily to make ends meet. What we 
<br/>need is a budget that outlines clear strategic priorities.  How do we enhance economic resilience, 
<br/>promote innovation and create jobs?  Let us move beyond promises and focus on actionable steps 
<br/>that build a stronger future for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In its current form, the Budget fails to meet the genuine needs of our populace. It is time for 
<br/></span><span>a  budget  that  reflects  fiscal  prudence,  social  justice  and  strategic  wisdom.  Our  nation  deserves  a 
<br/>budget that tackles our challenges head-on, invests in our future and uplifts all Fijians. We can only 
<br/>hope that in next year’s Budget, creativity to address the woes of the people is addressed and that 
<br/>investment stimulus is given, thus allowing jobs to be created.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need a Budget that will take care of every Fijian and will see our nation come out of the

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1077 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic downward spiral that we are witnessing today. We need a budget that has a plan to cover 
<br/>any debt that will come from the budget deficit and will help lower the debt-to-GPD ratio even further 
<br/>without tightening the grip on ordinary Fijian pockets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I conclude my response to the uncreative Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to ask the 
<br/>Coalition Government, why not lower the VAT from 15 percent to 10 percent? By reducing VAT on 
<br/>essential goods, the Government not only alleviates financial stress on the grassroot population, but 
<br/>also stimulates broader economic benefits, fostering a healthier and more dynamic economy from 
<br/>the ground up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I end my speech and I just wonder if we will ever get a budget 
<br/>that will truly look after the people of Fiji.  On the same note, I thank the Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament and the viewers for their time in listening to the 2024-2025 Budget Debate.  I also take 
<br/>this time to thank the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his team for preparing the Budget book 
<br/>for 2024-2025.  I congratulate honourable Alitia Bainivalu on her appointment as the Minister for 
<br/>Fisheries and Forests and I also congratulate the honourable Attorney-General on his appointment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public who are present 
<br/>in the gallery and those joining us through livestream, </span><span>ni bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good afternoon to 
<br/>you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before this august Parliament to express my unwavering support to 
<br/>the  second  Coalition  Government’s  National  Budget  for  Financial  Year  2024-2025,  that  was 
<br/>presented by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Finance on 28</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>June, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, I wish to thank some honourable Opposition Members for 
<br/>declaring their support towards this Budget.  The reason I am saying this is because it is our Budget, 
<br/>so it is the Government’s Budget, the Opposition Members’ Budget, as well as the public’s.  I believe 
<br/>that at the end of the Budget Debate, all honourable Opposition Members are going to support this 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  commend,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  effort  of  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and his team have taken in crafting a Budget that aims to provide 
<br/>an economically stable, secure and sustainable Fiji.  This is the people’s Budget and has been well 
<br/>received by the general public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance  has highlighted in his 
<br/>Speech, our immediate focus is to get the basics right and address the day-to-day challenges of our 
<br/>people.   We understand that the strength of our nation lies in the wellbeing of every Fijian.  The 
<br/>Coalition  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  remains  steadfast  in  its  commitment  to  enhancing  the 
<br/>education, health and infrastructure across Fiji, as reflected in the 2024-2025 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to emphasise the importance of education, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and recognising that our 
<br/></span><span>young people are the future of our nation and $778 million has been allocated to provide our leaders 
<br/>of tomorrow with  the  resources to  gain  knowledge, skills  and opportunities they need to  succeed 
<br/>through the Back-to-School Support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  significant  budget  allocated  to  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services,  as  well  as  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Transport  and  Meteorological  Services  is  a

<div><span>testament of the Coalition Government’s efforts in prioritising the wellbeing of our people, as well 
<br/>as enhancing road networks, water supply systems that are crucial for sustainable economic growth 
<br/>and improve the living conditions nationwide.  These investments underscore our commitment to 
<br/>building a healthier, more educated and a prosperous Fiji for all.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Vatukoula Mine workers strike, Mr. Speaker, Sir, being the longest strike known, lasting 
<br/>for  over  three  decades,  has  now  been  settled.    It  is  a  testament  to  the  power  of  negotiation, 
<br/>compromise and working together with the Coalition Government towards a common goal, resulting 
<br/>in such a peaceful resolution.  This Budget is dedicated to uplifting lives where it is most needed and 
<br/>building a foundation for a bright future for all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  now  speak  on  the  Ministry  of  Housing’s  budgetary 
<br/>allocation  of  $32.3  million  for  the  coming  financial  year  that  will,  undoubtedly,  have  a  positive 
<br/>impact on the works that have been planned to be carried out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increase  in  the  presence  of  informal  settlements  poses  a 
<br/>significant  challenges  to  urban  development  but  this  will  not  deter  the  Ministry  of  Housing 
<br/>continuing  with  its  formalisation  of  the  informal  settlements  programme  which  aims  to  enhance 
<br/>living  conditions  through  infrastructure  upgrades  and  provision  of  utility  services  for  these 
<br/>communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must also thank honourable Hem Chand for raising this issue on informal settlements.  I 
<br/>think it is also very important, but our Coalition Government is committed to ensure that we continue 
<br/>with our upgrading programme so that people in informal settlements do have access to better living 
<br/>conditions and also better access to basic amenities and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of $13.5 million has been allocated to the Ministry for the completion of four ongoing 
<br/>projects in Sakoca, Nasinu; Tavela, Nadi; Tore and Field 40 in Lautoka, and the commencement of 
<br/>capital works in Valequwayaya in Ba and Vunika in Labasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have informal settlements that are also established on random spaces 
<br/>around  urban  centres,  especially  on  land  that  are  subject  to  potential  development  activities.  The 
<br/>Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Housing, is exploring opportunities and working with 
<br/>Habitat for Humanity, Fiji National University and other stakeholders in identifying and acquiring 
<br/>greenfield or green space to develop  and build communities for deserving  residents that meet the 
<br/>criteria  or  are  facing  eviction.    The  budgetary  allocation  will  assist  the  Ministry  in  working  with 
<br/>Habitat for Humanity to commence a Greenfield Pilot Project and relocate families from Veidogo 
<br/>Settlement here in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  First  Home  Ownership,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  first  home  transition  will  continue  as 
<br/>allocated in the Budget in the coming financial year with an allocation of $5.5 million. We plan to 
<br/>assist a total of 295 applicants through this Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  recognises  the  importance  of  supporting  individuals 
<br/>living  with  disabilities.    For  the  current  financial  year,  $300,000  had  been  allocated  which  will 
<br/></span><span>provide  them  with  necessary  accessibility  and  modifications,  demonstrating  our  commitment 
<br/></span><span>towards the most vulnerable.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  families  that  have  lost  their  homes  through  financial  difficulties  and  fire  will 
<br/>continue to be assisted through the Fire Assistance Grant of up to $5,000 per family or per applicant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Housing Authority and Public Rental Board (PRB) continue to play a

<div><span>1079 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vital role in providing affordable and social housing to low and middle income earners throughout 
<br/>our  country.    The  provision  of  $2  million  to  assist  Housing  Authority  for  the  development  of  its 
<br/>residential lots in Valelevu through the construction of the Veikoba Bridge will allow the residents’ 
<br/>ease and safe movement on an upgraded access.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An allocated budget to cater for PRB subsidy and funding for capital works at Jittu Estate will 
<br/>benefit those who are financially disadvantaged, as well as those who want to have safe and secure 
<br/>dwellings for their family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry recognises the change in dynamics on the need to renew the 
<br/>strategic framework for the housing sector, therefore, the Ministry has also completed a thorough 
<br/>and comprehensive review of the implementation of  the 2011 National Housing Policy. This was 
<br/>carried out through the assistance of the New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The 
<br/>revised National Policy will create an environment to unite all stakeholders in the housing sector to 
<br/>work together under an improved legal framework.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  been  allocated  a  total  of  $31.5 
<br/>million in the next financial year.  We are so fortunate that we have been given the allocation to assist 
<br/>the Ministry in the area of Sustainable Waste Management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the support from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, 
<br/>the National Development Programme, and the Asian Development Bank, the Ministry will embark 
<br/>on a comprehensive workplan for a possible Western Division Landfill and a feasibility study with 
<br/>establishing Waste Management Authority which has been endorsed by Cabinet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  an  allocation  of  $2.1  million  has  been  provided  to  assist  small  and  medium 
<br/>Councils  with  garbage  collection  compacted  trucks.  These  trucks  are  crucial  for  better  service 
<br/>delivery to the residents, ensuring efficient waste collection and management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  a  new  capital  project,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  also  been  allocated  $300,000  for  the 
<br/>initial Nasau Park Upgrade in Levuka and this also will provide another additional income stream 
<br/>for the Levuka Town Council.  Honourable Bala is saying something about the Local Government 
<br/>Elections, it is coming, honourable Bala, and unlike you, it is coming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          (Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the ongoing capital project, in the coming fiscal year, we are committed 
<br/>to finalising two of Fiji’s pivotal capital projects - the Lautoka Swimming Pool and the Ba Govind 
<br/>Park,  at  a  budget  of  $1.5  million  underscores  our  determination  to  see  these  projects  through  to 
<br/>completion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Thank you once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity and I offer my  full 
<br/>support towards the Budget for the 2024-2025 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now since we will be 
<br/></span><span>taking both the afternoon tea and dinner and will resume when the bell is sounded.  The Parliament 
<br/></span><span>is now adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  here  deeply  concerned  about  this  Budget  and  I  have  a  lot  of 
<br/>reservations with regards to this booklet that is presented to us.  Sir, it really shows how badly the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics is managing our economy.  This Budget is not just flawed, it highlights 
<br/>the failures and his inability to lead our country wisely.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have already seen the need for change in the Attorney-General’s role 
<br/>because  of  poor  performance.    It  is  clear,  we  need  similar  changes  in  our  Minister  for  Finance 
<br/>leadership.  This  Budget is  like a run-away bulldozer, threatening our economic stability and our 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has clearly put political games and incompetence above 
<br/>responsible financial management.  Our nation deserves leaders who can build a stable future, not 
<br/>ones who will drive us into chaos.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  blatantly  disregards  the  voices  and  the  needs  of  the  Fijian 
<br/>people.  This Budget has seen nearly no contribution from the general population of Fiji in terms of 
<br/>face-to-face consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people were not consulted, their concerns were not addressed, and their 
<br/>hopes ignored.  Yet, again, we see a government that operates in a bubble, disconnected from the 
<br/>realities on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I commend the hardworking Ministry staff and other civil servants 
<br/>for their efforts, I cannot extend the same gratitude to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister has failed to engage with the people, and as I have heard from many on the ground, who are 
<br/>deeply dissatisfied with his performance, and I hope that the honourable Prime Minister is hearing 
<br/>my comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by highlighting the voices of the people who were left out.  In 
<br/>the  past,  ministers  would  go  down  to  the  people  and  conduct  budget  consultations  in  various 
<br/>locations, for example, at FNU, USP and other town hall meetings, ensuring that every Fijian had a 
<br/>say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  fast-track  to  2024,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics has 
<br/>forgotten the very people who voted for him and given his Party five seats in Parliament, and now 
<br/></span><span>part of that Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the questions on everyone’s mind are:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the honourable Minister for Finance afraid of the people; 
<br/></span><span>is he so disconnected that he cannot face them and conduct budget consultations; and  
<br/></span><span>is he scared that the frustration of the people will be too much for him to handle?  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1081 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  people  are  asking,  and  rightly  so,  whether  the  honourable  Minister  is  avoiding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accountability for the promises he made over the past eight years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget, void of public input, is a clear indication that this Government 
<br/>is afraid to face the truth and the needs of the Fijian people. It is a betrayal of trust and a gross neglect 
<br/>of duty.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me dissect this Budget at the core of the most pressing issue 
<br/>affecting the people of Fiji, which is the high cost of living.  The burden on our citizens is immense, 
<br/>exacerbated by the 15 percent VAT and 25 percent corporate tax. To add insult to injury, businesses 
<br/>that strive to retain their employees by providing benefits are now further burdened with an increase 
<br/>in the fringe benefit tax.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my </span><span>kai</span><span> from Savusavu and the honourable Prime Minister of Fiji, I urge him to reconsider 
<br/>his stance on the 15 percent VAT and 25 percent corporate tax.  Reverting these taxes would ease 
<br/>the burden on countless families and businesses, especially in our Northern Islands and the islands 
<br/>around Fiji where the cost of freight drives prices even higher.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we continue with these exorbitant taxes, the ripple effect on consumers will be devastating. 
<br/>Higher  taxes  on  businesses  mean  higher  prices  for  goods  and  services,  making  it  harder  for  the 
<br/>average Fijian to make ends meet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just a financial strain, it is an emotional and psychological burden 
<br/>on our people. This Budget fails to alleviate that burden and instead, exacerbates it, showing a lack 
<br/>of empathy and understanding from this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  on,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  education  was  the keystone  issue  that  swayed  many  voters, 
<br/>especially  students,  to  support  this  Coalition  Government.  They  were  promised  free  education,  a 
<br/>promise that resonated deeply with young Fijians. However, once in power, the Government quickly 
<br/>changed its tune.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  without  consulting  students,  they  introduced  a  bond  system  that  has 
<br/>disadvantaged many.  Now, they have imposed a 50 percent extra penalty on students who wish to 
<br/>pay off their bond arrangements early and move overseas or other countries because of better job 
<br/>opportunities.  This is a blatant betrayal of trust and a clear indication that this Government does not 
<br/>care about the future of our young generation. This Budget adds more financial burden on students, 
<br/>pushing their dreams further out of reach and placing their futures in jeopardy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government does not prioritise our youth agenda or their education, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and this Budget reflects that cruel reality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  we  had  also  expected  an  increase  in  student  allowances  which  did  not 
<br/>happen, recognising the significant impact of the current economic policies on the cost of living. The 
<br/>rise in taxes and inflation has made it increasingly challenging for students to sustain themselves.  
<br/>An increase in allowances is not merely a financial relief but a necessary adjustment to ensure that 
<br/>our students can continue their education without undue financial stress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The additional funds would help students cover essential costs such as accommodation, food, 
<br/></span><span>transportation and educational materials, ensuring they can focus on their education and achieve their 
<br/>full potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to unleash a shockwave concerning the minimum wage rate. 
<br/>On 21</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2024, it was reported that the Government had appointed consultants to review the 
<br/>National Minimum Wage and Sectoral Wages. These consultants were highly qualified individuals 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from  our  esteemed  Universities.    However,  the  Fijian  public  has  yet  to  see  the  independent 
<br/>consultant’s report on minimum wage.  I ask this question to honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics,  where  are  the 
<br/>recommendations and why has this crucial information been hidden from the public eye?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji demand transparency.  This Government’s failure to disclose the findings 
<br/>is a disservice to the public and a blatant breach of their promise of transparency.   Without 
<br/>this 
<br/>information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how can the public trust that this Government is acting in their best 
<br/>interest?    This  secrecy  breeds  distrust  and  further  alienates  the  Government  from  the  people  it  is 
<br/>supposed to serve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to also recognise the delicate balance required to support both, 
<br/>our workforce and our businesses.  The issue of increasing wages and taxes is one that requires careful 
<br/>consideration, particularly given the current economic climate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the need for higher wages, especially in light of the 
<br/>skills shortage and the tight labour market.  But imposing higher wages or taxes by regulation could 
<br/>lead to unintended consequences, such as increased financial strain on these SMEs and businesses, 
<br/>potentially pushing some of them out of operation, which means closing down.  Instead, we should 
<br/>focus on creating an environment where businesses can thrive and naturally offer higher wages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this can be achieved through policies that support SMEs’ growth, such as 
<br/>tax  incentives,  access  to  affordable  financing  and  investment  in  skills  development  and  training 
<br/>programmes.  While the intention behind increasing wages is commendable, the approach must be 
<br/>carefully considered to avoid adverse effects on our smaller businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Budget, we also expected a revision of the nightclub hours back to 
<br/>its original timings, but that did not happen as well.  Extending these hours would have a positive 
<br/>ripple effect across several industries, for instance, taxi drivers would see an increase in clientele, 
<br/>providing  them  with  additional  income  during  late  hours.    Nightclub  owners  would  benefit  from 
<br/>extended business hours, potentially leading to increased revenue and job creation within the nightlife 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, numerous  small  vendors, such  as  those operating BBQ stalls and other  food 
<br/>services  rely  on  the  night  crowd  for  extra  income.  Extending  hours  would  support  these 
<br/>entrepreneurs, enhancing the local economy and fostering a vibrant nightlife culture that can attract 
<br/>tourists and boost tourism-related revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on, it is evident to every Fijian that the state of our roadways is 
<br/>rapidly deteriorating, with potholes becoming a constant hazard for drivers.  I hope the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Servicesis listening to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  This  decline  in  road  quality,  not  only  jeopardizes  the  safety  of  our 
<br/></span><span>commuters, but also hampers economic activities, as transportation becomes less reliable and more 
<br/></span><span>costly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  some  may  argue  for  a  decrease  in  the  budget  for  the  Fiji  Roads 
<br/>Authority (FRA), it is imperative that we consider this stance.  Investing in our roads is not a luxury, 
<br/>it is a necessity, and I acknowledge the support by the Chinese Government towards the Vanua Levu 
<br/>Road Project, and also the Government for looking into these initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1083 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  properly  maintained  roads  are  the  backbone  of  our  economy,  and  that 
<br/>facilitates tourism, trade and daily commutes.  By allocating sufficient funds to FRA, we ensure safer 
<br/>and more efficient travel for our citizens and support long-term growth and stability of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been highlighted today, and as per my research with regards to the 
<br/>Fiji National University (FNU), it is also concerning that FNU has been allocated around $36 million 
<br/>this year, a significant decrease from last year’s $44 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a merely very small NGO which is newly established, named 
<br/>Polytech,  has  received  an  unprecedented  $5  million  substantial  increase  in  funding.    Polytech, 
<br/>although new in the education sector, has raised questions amongst various alumni and academics 
<br/>from other Universities regarding the quality of programmes at Polytech, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the 
<br/>graduates to be concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask this question to the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education because I do not think the honourable Minister for Finance will answer this, 
<br/>but  has  the  Government  conducted  any  research  or  benchmarking  with  our  established  local 
<br/>universities before making such a substantial allocation to Polytech?  If not, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 
<br/>perplexing why such a hefty amount is given to a nascent organisation when our national university 
<br/>which has a proven track record is facing budget cuts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as per data, FNU TVET graduates supporting the industries in Fiji over the 
<br/>last five years from 2019 to 2023, according to FNU’s data, they have trained people in the rural 
<br/>remote areas for around 32,282.  So why are we decreasing their budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to give more to our university. The reduction in funding for FNU will inevitably 
<br/>lead to cost-cutting measures (and I hope the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and 
<br/>Industrial  Relations  is  listening  to  this),  adversely  affecting  service  delivery.  In  the  worst-case 
<br/>scenario, many people can lose their jobs at FNU, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Government must justify 
<br/>this decision, ensuring that our established universities are adequately supported to maintain their 
<br/>high standards of education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I end my Budget  response, I wish to share some thoughts on the 
<br/>recent events on the deregistration of the FijiFirst Party.  Politics is often seen as a ruthless game, 
<br/>one where numbers and betrayals can dominate.  However, I believe that our true strength lies in the 
<br/>values instilled in us by our parents, our former political leaders and our elders in society, and these 
<br/>values are integrity, resilience and unwavering commitment to the service of Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During my time with FijiFirst, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had the privilege of learning a lot from my 
<br/>former leader and the former Attorney-Geneal, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum.  They taught me principles, 
<br/>ethics and loyalty, qualities that define us as leaders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank them for the legacy they left behind, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Because of them, our nation 
<br/>has progressed this far as one of the fastest growing economy in the Pacific region and we are now 
<br/>in the big league, fighting issues which we champion such as climate change, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the longevity of any politician, Mr. Speaker, Sir, lies the decision that he or she makes 
<br/>during their term as a Parliamentarian, and it is important that we must always look forward to the 
<br/>future that is beyond 2026.  Sir, one can take the easy road to political success, but one can take a 
<br/>principled route and gain that respect for his or her political journey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the youngest Parliamentarian in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am deeply committed

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  continuing  my  service  to  the  Fijian  people  as  an  Independent  Member  of  Parliament.    It  is 
<br/>imperative that we remain steadfast in our work, upholding the principles and ethics we have always 
<br/>stood for and protect our 2013 Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka saka</span><span>, Sir.  The honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  fellow  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; I extend to you all a very good evening, and also extend warm greetings and </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> to 
<br/>Fijians who are tuning in to the Parliamentary proceedings tonight and to those present today in the public 
<br/>gallery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise to deliver my response to the 2024-2025 National Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to add my 
<br/>voice to the support for it.  I also wish to take this time to thank all honourable Members who have spoken 
<br/>before me, including honourable Members from the other side, who supported or will support this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is now under a newly leadership, a leadership that listens, a leadership that 
<br/>is open, a leadership that is inclusive, truthful and a leadership that is transparent; one that dispels the 
<br/>glamorisation of our economy for its own sake. This is reflected in a Budget which puts our people as its 
<br/>centre, by deploying our very limited resources and marshalling our collective efforts as a journey that 
<br/>gives our people hope for the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the global and regional context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>Ministry, being Fiji’s gateway to the world, will continue to embrace a spirit of collaboration but 
<br/>determined diplomacy in our international undertakings.  This is to allow for an appropriate reset of 
<br/>relations, the advancement of global, regional and sub-regional aspirations, the protection of Fiji’s 
<br/>interests, and the enhancement of our engagements.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the Diplomatic Mission focus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the move towards increasing Fiji’s degree 
<br/>of economic and political cooperation among countries around the world, as part of our intent vis-à-
<br/>vis,  expanding  our  frontiers  and  diplomatic  footprints  globally,  is  an  admirable  gesture  by  the 
<br/>Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is deeply committed to its new diplomatic representation in 
<br/>Washington  DC,  in  Malaysia  and  Papua  New  Guinea,  and  any  other  future  localities  to  enhance 
<br/>relations, support economic, cultural, security and sports engagement, including the welfare of Fiji’s 
<br/>diaspora communities in these countries.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the groundwork at these Missions had to start a step back from where the 
<br/>previous Administration took the country.  New strategies have been applied to provide a robust base 
<br/>to rebuild relations that demonstrate the values and principles that speak of us as a sovereign nation.  
<br/>Further, we are focused on realising the return on investment on these deployments.  We are also 
<br/>mindful of our position and role within the Blue Pacific Continent and our responsibility to the region.  
<br/>The frequency and intensity of our engagements have increased substantially. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to touch very briefly on Fiji’s Foreign Policy.  As announced 
<br/>by the honourable Prime Minister, the Ministry is guided by the pillars of sovereignty, security and 
<br/></span><span>prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry anticipates the finalisation and soon launch of Fiji’s first Foreign Policy White 
<br/>Paper, which will set the framework and the pathway to advancing Fiji’s strategic interests and goals.  
<br/>The  Ministry  further  understands  that  this  umbrella  document  will  be  anchored  on  a  calculated 
<br/>direction which is grounded in our context, values and aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry wishes to acknowledge the support of the Australian Government Technical

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adviser, with expert input from our very own experienced and long-time international affairs and 
<br/>diplomacy personalities  under the leadership of the Permanent  Secretary  of Foreign  Affairs.  We 
<br/>express our gratitude to all those who have shared their thoughts and experience in this project, and 
<br/>this includes the honourable Leader of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On to the Ministry’s operations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with an allocation of $43.8 million, the 
<br/>Ministry of Foreign Affairs will prosecute our foreign policy goals, a mandate that demand agility 
<br/>and a learning organisation culture with streamlined systems and processes.  This is supported by a 
<br/></span><span>modus  operandi</span><span>  that  also  invests  in  building  our  capability,  on  our  workforce,  system  and 
<br/>infrastructure.  This also includes supporting our diplomats and, very importantly, the repairs of our 
<br/>properties  abroad  that  are  in  a  state  of  disrepair  after  years  of  neglect.  After  finishing  with  one 
<br/>property in New Zealand, we are now focusing on two others, three in the United Kingdom, two in 
<br/>Australia and one in Brussels.  As we strive to deliver more, we will be frugal and calculated as we 
<br/>are very mindful of the limited resources available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank and commend the good work of the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance team, in putting forth a Budget that is smart, under present circumstances, with an eye on 
<br/>the future.  The Budget is building the confidence of our people and those who think about Fiji as a 
<br/>preferred tourism and investment destination, under the Coalition Government.  Our foresight, unity 
<br/>as a government, and ability to listen, and importantly, hearing our people, is what this Budget has 
<br/>demonstrated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Budget, but before I take my seat, I wish to wish a very 
<br/>happy birthday to honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka. I know he wishes I did not do this, but 
<br/>I had to do it for my </span><span>turaga tauvu</span><span>. Happy birthday, Sir!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A belated happy birthday to you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and those watching live through various digital devices, ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>ni sa bula 
<br/>vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is our duty as elected Members to demand honesty, integrity and a genuine commitment to 
<br/>the welfare of every member of our community. Regardless  of origin or  status  we must hold  the 
<br/>authority in question responsible for its actions.  I advocate for strong accountability and transparency 
<br/>that is crucial to good governance and we ensure that the Budget represents the needs and goals of 
<br/>all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  present  my  response  on  the  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  take  this 
<br/>opportunity  to  inform  the  people  of  this  nation  that  I  will  remain  as  an  Independent  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament after the deregistration of the FijiFirst Party. I would like to continue with the values and 
<br/>principles of FijiFirst and serve all Fijians with the best of my abilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  acknowledge  that  there  is  no  comparison  to  the  legacy  and  the 
<br/></span><span>unparallel  contribution  of  the  previous  Government  under  the  Prime  Ministership  of  Mr.  Voreqe 
<br/>Bainimarama. My humble gratitude and prayers to Mr. Bainimarama for good health and wellbeing.  
<br/>My heartfelt, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Budget, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank the Government for restoring the pension 
<br/>for  the  pensioners.  Since  the  pension  was  reduced,  a  lot  of  pensioners  were  facing  financial

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>difficulties  since  some  of  them  were  entirely  dependent  on  their  pension  for  survival.  For  some 
<br/>pensioners, the struggle has been long and traumatic.  News of restoring pensions has brought relief 
<br/>to our senior citizens, and I commend the Government for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, resolving the infamous Vatukoula Mine Workers strike is another milestone for this 
<br/>Government.  These workers were on strike for more than 30 years and the Coalition Government 
<br/>had the courage to settle their dispute.  FijiFirst when in government tried to resolve this dispute but 
<br/>I am told the strikers then were asking for a million dollars each to reach a settlement.  The Union 
<br/>leaders also played a part in not letting the matter settle then. Now, the strikers have agreed to be 
<br/>paid only $25,000 each of which $10,000 will be paid from this Budget and another $15,000 from 
<br/>the next budget. Anyway, reaching an agreement with the strikers is commendable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members of Parliament and fellow citizens, allow me today 
<br/>to voice a crucial issue that is raising serious concern.  The Government’s Budget 2024-2025 lacks 
<br/>transparency and accountability.  Prior to the 2022 General Elections, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Finance was talking about national debt and this was one of the tactics he used to manipulate people’s 
<br/>emotions as to sway votes his way to win the elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- After forming the Government, honourable Prasad forgot about the high debt 
<br/>and started borrowing himself and thus the national best has now increased to more than $10 billion.  
<br/>Sir, I am not against borrowing but one needs to justify how the borrowed money is utilised.  We 
<br/>will  be  able  to  generate  employment  and  create  more  economic  activities  if  we  invest  in  capital 
<br/>projects.    If  you  look  at  the  books,  there  are  no  capital  investments.  We  are  only  investing  in 
<br/>upgrading or maintenance of existing projects. None of the capital expenditure is public investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our operating expenditure is increasing, it is quite extraordinary that instead of reducing debt, 
<br/>honourable Prasad is now increasing it. He, while in Opposition, had been the most vocal about the 
<br/>debt and we have been having nonstop propaganda from him about the national debt. No debt has 
<br/>been paid but it is refinanced with a higher interest rate. Those who know economics, know that debt 
<br/>will always increase unless we have a balanced budget or a surplus budget that is highly unlikely in 
<br/>our case.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Professor of Economics, honourable Prasad very well understands this, but he twisted 
<br/>figures around to suit his agenda at that time. He was talking about per capita debt and now he is 
<br/>talking about debt-to-GDP ratio. I want to tell him to stop fooling people. You can fool some people 
<br/>some time but not all the people, all the time. Once again,  I stress the importance of openness in 
<br/>financial  decision-making  to  ensure  that  resources  are  distributed  efficiently  and  effectively.  The 
<br/>Government to strive to elevate accountability and build an open and honest culture by giving clear 
<br/>and easily available information about how public monies are used.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again honourable Prasad was talking about increasing minimum wage to $5 
<br/>an hour prior to the elections.  After forming the Government, he forgot about it and now after 18 
<br/>months minimum wage goes up by 50 cents from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August this year and a further 50 cents from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/></span><span>April next year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in minimum wage from $4 to $5 is totally inadequate 
<br/></span><span>compared to the enormous jump in cost of living brought about largely by imposing 15 percent VAT 
<br/>by this Government last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of incentives have been included in this Budget to better the lives of 
<br/>the civil servants, the pensioners, members of FNPF and many more but this Budget has nothing to 
<br/>meet the expectations of the ordinary Fijians for relief from the soaring cost of living. The hardship 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1087 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and suffering of ordinary Fijians will continue unabated. The decision to increase VAT to 15 percent 
<br/>in the last Budget is a burden to everyone and is especially affecting those who do not have a regular 
<br/>income. There was a lot of expectation from the people that VAT will be reduced in this Budget, but 
<br/>this did not happen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of such people are suffering in silence and are not able to 
<br/>provide decent meals for their families. I strongly urge the Government to reconsider the VAT rate 
<br/>to address the cost of living issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing new or exciting in the Budget that an ordinary person would 
<br/>be proud of. The Budget does not offer any promise to our citizens instead asking them to pay a lot 
<br/>more for the same goods and services provided in the past. The Budget fails to adequately address 
<br/>ordinary people's need for food access, healthcare and workforce. There is nothing innovative in the 
<br/>Budget to make the economy grow, instead chose heavier borrowing to cushion the shortfalls. The 
<br/>Government’s reliance on increased taxes and external borrowing is nothing but a revenue driven 
<br/>Budget thrusted on the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  refer  to  honourable  Prasad’s  2024-25  Budget  Speech,  it  is  with  great 
<br/>concern that I confront the current Minister of Finance's deceptive language on the Budget theme of 
<br/></span><span>Stability, Security and Sustainability</span><span>. While these words may seem soothing, it is critical to examine 
<br/>the  motives  underlying  such  declarations.  The  argument  focusing  on  stability,  security,  and 
<br/>sustainability eliminates the need for economic innovation, that can have an adverse effect to the 
<br/>holistic  development  of  our  nation.  The  emphasis  on  strengthening  our  economy's  fundamentals 
<br/>should not be termed "unglamorous or boring", in simple words meaning uninteresting or dull, as 
<br/>honourable Prasad's language implies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing challenges such as rising Government debt and establishing sustainable economic 
<br/>practices are critical steps towards ensuring a prosperous future for all citizens.  The statement made 
<br/>by the honourable Finance Minister that this Government is not one of "economic gimmicks" and 
<br/>emphasizes the importance of focusing on improving the fundamentals of the economy may sound 
<br/>reassuring  at  first.  However, we must not  overlook the potential disconnect  between rhetoric and 
<br/>reality and defensive rhetoric used by the Government raises valid concerns about their transparency 
<br/>and accountability to the people we serve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upholding the values of equality and unity, as championed by the FijiFirst government should 
<br/>not be reduced to mere slogans but must be reflected in concrete actions and policies that benefit all 
<br/>members  of  society.    The  2016  </span><span>TC  Winston  </span><span>and  the  COVID-19  challenges  that  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>government has encountered, not even a fraction of this Government has constructively achieved in 
<br/>the  18  months  in  power  in  comparison  to  the  accomplishment  of  the  FijiFirst  government.  For 
<br/>example,  the  social  welfare  benefits  to  a  substantial  descent  amount  have  been  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>government’s noble initiative to combat poverty that has now become a serious issue in this country.  
<br/>Contrary  to  the  professed  values  of  inclusivity  and  unity  exemplified  by  the  previous  FijiFirst 
<br/>government’s motto as in “One people, one nation,” it is disheartening to witness actions that do not 
<br/>align with these noble principles and their lack of a genuine commitment to an inclusive budget that 
<br/>benefits all citizens undermines the core foundation of equality and social cohesion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not surprised that honourable Biman Prasad is unduly critical of the FijiFirst government 
<br/></span><span>under the leadership of Mr. Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s former Prime Minister.  It is our duty as elected 
<br/></span><span>members of Parliament to demand honesty, integrity and a genuine commitment to the welfare of 
<br/>every member of our community.  Above all, to honour and consider any admirable work that past 
<br/>leaders and individuals have accomplished for the citizens of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  mention  are  few,  </span><span>TC  Winston,  </span><span>the  second  strongest  storm  on  record  hit  Fiji  on  19</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>February, 2016.  The disaster claimed 44 lives and impacted 62 percent of the population.  The total

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>damage and losses from </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>were projected to be $1.42 billion which is comparable to 31 
<br/>percent  of  GDP.    It  is  based  on  a  post–disaster  needs  assessment  done  by  the  Government  and 
<br/>development partners.  Then a worldwide epidemic strikes but, by 2022, the country was on the way 
<br/>to economic recovery and has been on track for economic growth.  The challenges and unforeseen 
<br/>circumstances were not tackled with flowery rhetorical statements, but rather through action plans, 
<br/>policies, determination, patience and being responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive 
<br/>driven by a real desire to serve the people of our great nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How can the Government see the urgency to raise VAT to 15 percent and the need to outright 
<br/>waving  the  loan  of  53,000  students.    I  refer  to  pages  47  to  48  of  the  Budget  Address  in  which 
<br/>honourable Prasad’s recent announcement regarding the waiver of loans for students enrolled in the 
<br/>Tertiary Education Loan Scheme (TELS) raises significant concerns about the economic viability 
<br/>and  long-term  sustainability  of  such  a  decision.    While  the  gesture  may  appear  generous  on  the 
<br/>surface, it is essential to critically assess the implication of this move on both the education sector 
<br/>and the economy as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While it is commendable to alleviate the financial burden on students by waiving their loans.  
<br/>It  is  crucial  to  unintended  consequences  of  such  a  policy.    By  absolving  students  of  their  loan 
<br/>obligations.  There is a risk of fostering a culture of dependency and entitlement, where individuals 
<br/>may not feel motivated to take responsibility of their education cost or contribute back to society.  
<br/>This could potentially hinder the development of a workforce that is invested in and permitted to the 
<br/>progress and prosperity of the nation.  It is reported and noted in my reply to His Excellency the 
<br/>President’s speech after the opening of Parliament this year.  That there are many recent graduates 
<br/>and skilled workers migrating to other countries without giving to their own country underscores a 
<br/>pressing issue of brain drain and talent fight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  must  implement  measures  to  encourage  students  to  remain  in  Fiji  and 
<br/>contribute their knowledge and skills to the local economy rather than seeking opportunities abroad.  
<br/>In responding to the issue of loan waivers in the upcoming Budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025, it 
<br/>is essential to strike a balance between supporting students in pursuing higher education and ensuring 
<br/>accountability  and  responsibility  in  loan  repayment.  Rather  than  outright  waiving  loans,  the 
<br/>Government could explore alternative mechanisms such as income-contingent repayment schemes, 
<br/>extended grace periods, or targeted financial assistance based on merit and need. I want honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad to realise that, together we discovered that a free market only thrives when there 
<br/>are rules to ensure competition and fair play.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the efforts have been made by Governments to enhance the quality and relevance of 
<br/>tertiary education in Fiji to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today's 
<br/>competitive  global  landscape,  the  unemployed  needs  work  to  eliminate  poverty,  and  this  could 
<br/>involve creating attractive job prospects, providing avenues for career growth and development, and 
<br/>fostering a conducive environment for innovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, what makes us exceptional - what makes us Fijian; it is our genuine love of 
<br/>our  motherland  and  its  people.  Hence,  let  us  prioritise  prudent  fiscal  management,  strategic 
<br/>investment in human capital, and effective governance and unity to steer our nation towards greater 
<br/></span><span>heights of success and prosperity and a united Fiji. May God bless Fiji.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Colleagues, the honourable Leader of  the Opposition 
<br/>and honourable Members of Parliament; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and good evening to you all.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1089 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am most humble to deliver my second Budget response as the Minister for 
<br/>Education in our Coalition Government. Firstly, I return all glory and honour to our good Lord for 
<br/>His grace and guidance over our nation and our lives allowing us to be here again and to respond to 
<br/>the Budget Address delivered by the honourable Minister for Finance a week ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  second  last  speaker  for  today,  I  would  like  to  take  this  time  to 
<br/>acknowledge the sterling effort and the work you continue to do in steering Fiji, steadily through our 
<br/>legislature in what will be remembered as a period whereby Fiji’s political landscape has undergone 
<br/>major change following a period of confusion and chaos that could be catastrophic for all as has been 
<br/>witnessed in the last few weeks and months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your able leadership has assured stability in our economic environment and has sent a strong 
<br/>message to our investors and our business community that Fiji remains a vibrant democratic nation 
<br/>that  will  survive  any  domestic  challenges  it  gets  because  it  has  a  Coalition  Government  that  is 
<br/>committed to bring about a united Fiji that engages in dialogue and peaceful development initiatives. 
<br/></span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu na rai yawa kei na loloma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must now offer my support and endorse the Budget of 2024 – 2025. This 
<br/>Budget is not just a financial document, it is a visionary blueprint that underscore our Government’s 
<br/>unwavering  commitment  to  fostering  a  brighter  future  for  our  nation  through  transformative 
<br/>investments  in  education.  In  the  2024-2025  Budget,  a  total  of  $784  million  is  allocated  to  the 
<br/>Education sector and of this $627 million is designated to the Ministry of Education which includes 
<br/>$90.7 million for the Higher Education Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is a pathway of progress and a bedrock of a thriving society.  It 
<br/>is through education that we empower our children, unlock their potential and equip them with the 
<br/>skills and knowledge needed to navigate the challenges of the ever-evolving world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  focusing  on  teaching  strategies  that  foster 
<br/>competency-based learning and skills needed for sustainable and resilient education emphasizing on 
<br/>Entrepreneurship (TVET) creative arts and physical education. The 2024-2025 Budget is a testament 
<br/>to our dedication to ensuring that every child regardless of their background has access to quality and 
<br/>inclusive education which is in line with Sustainable Development Goal 4.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise that the foundation of a strong education system begins with Early Childhood 
<br/>Education (ECE).  This Budget allocates significant resources to enhance early learning programmes, 
<br/>ensuring that our youngest children receive the best possible start in life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government, with continued recognition of the importance of early childhood 
<br/>care, has increased the allocation for ECE by $2.5 million to $22.3 million in the 2024-2025 financial 
<br/>year, which I am certain our ECE teachers will appreciate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we commence a weeklong of ECE celebration with all the schools with the theme, 
<br/>“Igniting Creativity and Innovation in the Early Years”.  Investment in ECE means that this weeklong 
<br/>celebration is a platform for the Ministry, teachers, parents and relevant stakeholders to strengthen  
<br/></span><span>collaboration in early childhood holistic education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note that there is a significant net increase of $25 million under SEG 1 for 
<br/>Teachers and under this allocation, $16.8 million has been provided for primary education, whilst 
<br/>the  secondary  school  has  received  $14  million,  while  there  is  a  decrease  of  $5.6  million  in  the 
<br/>administration cadre.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  allow  the  Coalition  Government  to  continue  the  work  of  re-
<br/>engagement of School Chaplains under the cost-sharing arrangement with faith-based organisations 
<br/>and we intend to  submit a Cabinet paper, proposing  a salary package to  be adopted and we shall 
<br/>prioritise  this  area  of  learning,  given  the  prominent  challenges  that  we  will  need  as  skillsets  as 
<br/>occurring in schools nationwide in the fight against drug use, teenage pregnancies, truancy, bullying 
<br/>and other social challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that our teachers are one of the crucial partners of 
<br/>our  education  system.    The  budget  includes  substantial  investments  in  professional  development 
<br/>programmes, providing our educators with the tools and training they need to inspire and nurture our 
<br/>students effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  create  a  learning  environment,  we  are  investing  in  the  modernisation  of  school 
<br/>infrastructure that includes upgrading facilities, integrated advanced technologies and ensuring that 
<br/>our schools are safe, disaster risk resilience, inclusive and equipped for 21</span><span>st</span><span> century learning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note that there is a significant decrease of $271,000 in established staff 
<br/>salaries  for  the  Assets  Infrastructure  Support  Department,  and  this  will  require  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education to tighten its belt with respect to monitoring and implementation of the projects underfoot 
<br/>and some of the strategies to adopt will be to revert teachers working in this section back to school 
<br/>and only use technical experts in this Department, given the responsibility of what used to be known 
<br/>as the Construction Implementation Unit in the relevant line Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  at  this  time,  I would also  like  to  convey my sincere appreciation  to  His 
<br/>Excellency  the  Australian  High  Commissioner,  Mr.  Ewen  McDonald,  and  his  team  at  the  High 
<br/>Commission,  for  their  kind  support  towards  the  education  sector  over  the  years.    I  also  take  this 
<br/>opportunity to acknowledge the New Zealand Government, the UNICEF, UNESCO, the Japanese 
<br/>Government, the World Bank and other development partners in their unwavering support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  an  allocation  of  $150.5  million  in  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loans  Service 
<br/>(TSLS) to fund 9,940 continuing students and 10,830 new students, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Most of the 
<br/>information in the additional handbook will be available in August 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I would just like to highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about the Hardship Assistance Scheme 
<br/>which was introduced in the current financial year for the first time, to support private students with 
<br/>good academic performance but facing financial hardship or on private scheme arrangements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the entry requirement for onboarding will now be changed from 65 percent 
<br/>to 50 percent pass rate for students pursuing programme degree from Year 2. This scheme will be 
<br/>extended to TVET students at Diploma level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The revised Hardship Assistance Scheme initiative to pay allowance of $2,000 per student is 
<br/>also greatly appreciated.  The application for this Scheme will be opened after the passing of the 
<br/>Budget, to provide immediate relief for the private students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we believe in the power of community and parental/guardian involvement 
<br/></span><span>in  support  for  education.  This  Budget  supports  initiatives  that  encourage  greater  collaboration 
<br/>between schools, families and communities, creating a holistic support for our students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support the call by the honourable Prime Minister for engaging with our communities 
<br/>and that we need to work together for the common good of our nation whereby we move away from 
<br/>the old mentality of operating in silo.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1091 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue investing in the intellectual and moral development of our 
<br/>children  to  allow  us  to  pursue  the  important  goal  of  building  a  more  educated,  equitable  and 
<br/>prosperous society. Let us come together to support these goals and ensure that our education system 
<br/>remains a beacon of hope and opportunity for generations to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  take  my  seat,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  thank  you  for  your  accommodation  and 
<br/>allowance of the Ministry of Education visit to your beautiful island of Taveuni, to look at the various 
<br/>needs  of  schools.  The  saying  that  Taveuni  is  the  garden  island  of  Fiji  is  definitely  true  with  its 
<br/>breathtaking environment, and for me as a first-time visitor, I was taken aback by the immense natural 
<br/>beauty of the place. On that note, I must consider that the Ministry of Education needs to build more 
<br/>secondary schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to accommodate the growing student population, for instance, 
<br/>in the </span><span>Tikina </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>Wainikeli.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was very impressed when I noted that we have, in the schools, fully enrolled with an average 
<br/>of about 200 students in these rural schools.  This is encouraging but it is a testament to the healthy 
<br/>habits of the islanders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also made a plan before our good Lord for His guidance and blessings and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wish the nation of Fiji the very best in the implementation of our 2024-2025 Budget Appropriation.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I rise to deliver my response to 
<br/>the 2024-2025 National Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to applaud the Coalition Government for its carefully articulated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and visionary Budget, which is sure to meet the needs of all who call this great land our home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to focus my statement on the forestry and fisheries resource sectors, 
<br/>which plays an essential role in rural and maritime development. The total allocated for the Ministry of 
<br/>Fisheries for 2024-2025 financial year is $25.3 million, marking an overall increase of 19.7 percent from 
<br/>the previous fiscal year. This significant increase underscores the Government’s dedication to enhancing 
<br/>the livelihoods and economic opportunities in our rural and maritime areas.  This increase is welcomed, 
<br/>as it ensures that everyone is assisted.  I note that there are plans to establish a new ice plant and station 
<br/>in Natovi and Natewa, with groundwork amounting to $100,000. This will facilitate the much-needed ice 
<br/>services for the fishermen in those areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the maritime communities, I welcome the increase of $500,000 for 
<br/>the Coastal Fisheries Development component. This project is directed to benefit the communities in our 
<br/>maritime  areas  by providing  much-needed  awareness,  upskilling,  and  equipping  our  local fishing 
<br/>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also commend the budget of $31.4 million for the Forestry Sector. I note the 
<br/>increase of $2.1 million in the Maritime Pine Programme. This assistance, pioneered by the Coalition 
<br/>Government, will directly benefit the maritime communities that have invested in pine schemes over the 
<br/></span><span>years, and have yet to receive any benefits.  These maritime pine schemes have been stagnant over the 
<br/></span><span>years, but this budget has initiated great interest in the pine maritime areas, as it has opened a pathway to 
<br/>ensure the efforts are rewarded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also note the increase in the Fiji Pine Trust budget, receiving a total of 
<br/>$1.7 million.  This will be instrumental in raising awareness of maritime pine schemes in terms of 
<br/>harvesting, replanting and the operations of the Pine Trust in various islands.

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also  note the allocation of $2.5 million for the restoration of degraded 
<br/>forests.  This budget is commendable, and I must thank the Coalition Government for redirecting the 
<br/>project initiatives to enhance the survival rates of planted trees through consistent monitoring and 
<br/>maintenance.    This  project  will  focus  on  degraded  areas  within  the  rural  and  maritime  regions, 
<br/>promoting forest restoration and sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also acknowledge the budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Disaster Management, totalling $38.69 million.  The increase of $8.8 million is directly 
<br/>aimed at self-help projects, Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridge projects and rural 
<br/>housing.  This will also help to ensure that our people in the fisheries and forestry sector, living in 
<br/>the rural and maritime communities, have the access to the necessary infrastructure for development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the people of Fiji to make use of this opportunity.  The Coalition 
<br/>Government  is  here  to  serve  you.    We  believe  that  this  Budget  reflects  our  strategic  approach  to 
<br/>bolstering  rural  and  maritime  development,  ensuring  sustainable  practices,  and  improving  the 
<br/>livelihood of those who rely on our natural resources.  The increased allocations and specific project 
<br/>funding underscore our commitment to progress and sustainability in these vital areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  all  honourable  Members  to  support  this  Budget  as  it  is  essential  for  the  continued 
<br/>growth  and  development  of  our  fisheries  and  forestry  sectors,  ensuring  that  we  meet  both,  our 
<br/>economic and environmental goals.   
<br/></span></div>
