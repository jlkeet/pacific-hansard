<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank you so sincerely for the way we handled 
<br/>ourselves during this weeklong debate, even though it became very rowdy towards the end of this 
<br/>sitting and it was always a punch up, I can understand, between the honourable Minister for Multi-
<br/>Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry, and honourable Bala. But as honourable Bala always stated, we 
<br/>need to allow this to happen, but not to that stage where, I must apologise, since I used the word 
<br/>‘bloody’ when I tried to intervene and caution you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, I will not dwell into that.  But, again, thank you so much for all the 
<br/>contribution, all the hard work during our participation and even in the passing of the 2024-2025 
<br/>National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish to  congratulate the Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics and his Team at the Ministry of Finance, and this is 
<br/>the first time I have heard the accolades being given, even to the Permanent Secretary. That never 
<br/>used to be the case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it used to happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Oh, honourable Premila Kumar is saying that it used to happen, maybe in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the few years that I was out of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, again, I am thankful for that - we acknowledging the hard work being undertaken by our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>senior civil servants and in particular, the Permanent Secretary for Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable members, lunch and morning tea is now prepared at the Big Committee Room.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament is now adjourned until Monday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024, at 9.30 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 1.17 p.m.
