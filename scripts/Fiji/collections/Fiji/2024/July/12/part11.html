<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of 2024). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we proceed with the motion, I remind honourable Members that 
<br/>pursuant to the resolution of Parliament, the time for debate will be limited, to ensure that the nine 
<br/>Consequential Bills are debated and voted upon today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker,  Sir, the nine Consequential  Bills 
<br/>give legal effect to the policies announced in the 2024-2025 Budget. Before I go into brief detail of 
<br/>each of the Bills, I just wanted to make some quick general remarks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of taxation, Sir, and customs related Bills, we have broadly kept the tax regime stable 
<br/>with  minimal  policy  changes,  apart  from  departure  taxes.  However,  there  are  a  number  of 
<br/>administrative  changes  to  strengthen  tax  compliance,  bring  clarity  to  the  law  and  streamline  tax 
<br/>administration processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have highlighted, with tax reforms in the last Budget and the growth in the economy, we 
<br/>are  on  track  to  collect  around  $3  billion  in  tax  revenue  this  year.  This  is  an  indication  and 
<br/>demonstration that our tough and decisive actions in the last Budget have worked well and yielded 
<br/>intended results in terms of the revenue. On the same note, we recognise that we must not overtax 
<br/>the economy and we want to have a tax system that is simple, efficient and fair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me highlight some of the major changes being brought into effect through 
<br/>these Consequential Bills relating to taxation and customs. In the last Budget, Sir, we introduced a 3 
<br/>percent import duty on raw materials.  Following our discussions with manufacturers and exporters, 
<br/>we are removing that 3 percent duty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the tourism industry back to normal and more than normal in terms of the record visitor 
<br/>arrivals and as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/>very well highlighted in his speech with respect to the volume of receipts and the injection from the 
<br/>tourism industry into the economy, the departure tax will increase from $140 to $170 effective from 
<br/></span><span>1st  August,  2024,  and  will  return  to  the  pre-pandemic  rate  of  $200  from  1st  August,  2025.    In 
<br/></span><span>addition, effective from 1st August, 2024, the transit hours for departure tax exemption will reduce 
<br/>from 96 hours to 48 hours - equivalent to two days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  construction  industry  has  noted  a  shift  from  conventional  building 
<br/>methods towards more modern building techniques and the use of prefabricated buildings to assist in 
<br/>the construction sector, in light of the high building and material costs.  The fiscal duty on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>
<div><span>1328 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prefabricated  buildings  consisting  of  prefabricated  buildings  of  wood,  modular  building,  units  of 
<br/>steels and other prefabricated buildings will be reduced from 32 percent to 5 percent, while fiscal 
<br/>duty  on  steel  structures  or  articles  of  iron  will  be  maintained  at  5  percent.  We  are  increasing  the 
<br/>excise  duty  on  alcohol  and  tobacco  product  by  5  percent,  while  duty  on  carbonated  or  sugar 
<br/>sweetened beverages will be maintained at 40 cents per litre per kilogramme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to June 2020, the threshold for personal imports under Code 212 was 
<br/>$400,  so  as  a  COVID  measure,  the  threshold  was  increased  to  $2,000,  to  encourage  imports  of 
<br/>personal use and assistance from families overseas.  The threshold for personal imports under Code 
<br/>212 will be reduced to $1,000 and 15 percent VAT will be applied.  We are closing this loophole, as 
<br/>some businesses had started abusing this and in a big way as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  our  hotel  incentives,  we  are  extending  the  Short  Life  Investment  Package  (SLIP)  tax 
<br/>holiday to investors who acquire existing hotels and undertake renovations and refurbishments for 
<br/>more than $50 million.  This will support major investments like Crown Plaza, Wananavu Resort, 
<br/>and in addition, the standard allowance for renovation and extension of hotels will be reduced from 
<br/>50 percent to 25 percent, similar to COVID levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  200  percent  deduction  will  be  allowable  for  donations  over  $10,000  towards  the  2030 
<br/>Pacific Games.  Similar to the tax incentive provided to Fijian Drua 13-year tax holiday, tax duty 
<br/>concessions  on  imported  sports equipment  and 200 percent  tax deduction will be extended to  the 
<br/>National Rugby League.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tax free zone incentive will be amended to allow existing </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> companies to qualify 
<br/>for the Tax Free Region (TFR) incentive in the tax free regions for new investment above $250,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also making changes to the Fiji National Provident Fund Act 2011 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to bring about the following changes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>We are restoring the tripartite spirit in the Board composition of the Fiji National Provident 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fund (FNPF) to include a worker representative and an employer representative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>We  are  making  legal  provisions  to  cater  for  minors  to  become  FNPF  members,  which 
<br/>means, there would be no age limit for children to become members of the FNPF. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>To strengthen compliance, the penalty for non-payment of contributions by an employer 
<br/>will be changed from $100 per employee per month to 10 percent of the balance of unpaid 
<br/>contributions for an employee each month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, accommodates FNPF member reaching entitlement age to be 
<br/>able to transfer sum of all the amounts withdrawn to an existing FNPF member.  At the moment, it 
<br/>is either you opt for pensions or withdrawal.   This provision allows members to give their FNPF 
<br/>balance to their loved ones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loans  Service  Budget  (Amendment)  Bill 
<br/>2024 mandates tertiary education institutions to inform Tertiary Education and Loans Service (TSLS) 
<br/>of at-risk students who are not meeting expected academic requirements.  This will ensure that we 
<br/></span><span>are able to have an early detection and thus, an early intervention to improve completion rates. With 
<br/></span><span>the write-off of the Tertiary Education Loans Schene (TELS) debt and conversion to bond, TSLS 
<br/>will now be responsible for the management of these student bonds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me quickly go through also some of the Clauses in each of the Bills.  I 
<br/>am sure that honourable Members have already gone through it, but I just wanted to, for the record, 
<br/>go through that as well very quickly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, the Bill seeks to improve tax 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>administration processes aimed at improving compliance with tax rules and regulations, as well as 
<br/>the efficiency with the day-to-day services of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title, as you can see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  2  of  the  Bill  amends  section  30  of  the  Act  to  increase  the  period  of  seizure  and 
<br/>detainment of non-perishable goods from 10 to 30 consecutive days, to assist with the handling of 
<br/>non-perishable goods in detainment.  This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will significantly assist FRCS in the 
<br/>processes involved for handling detailed goods and provides the owner of the goods more opportunity 
<br/>to collect the good before the disposal process commence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 33 of the Act, to allow any forfeited refund to be used to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offset a taxpayer’s debt and penalty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting section 36A which empowers the CEO to 
<br/>collect bulk information for the purposes of the Act, in accordance with procedures prescribed under 
<br/>regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting section 46C, which imposes a penalty equal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 200 percent of the deficient tax.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 1 of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill, as usual, provides for the short title. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  2  of  the  Bill  amends  section  25  of  the  Act  by  setting  the  rate  of  export  income 
<br/>deduction for tax year 2025. This is a continued rate of export income deduction, which is the current 
<br/>rate for the tax year 2024 - 90 percent for agriculture, fisheries and forestry industry; and 60 percent 
<br/>for other industries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends the Act by deleting section 28A in relation to the deduction for a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pandemic reserve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 78 of the Act to revise valuation amounts to Fringe Benefit 
<br/>Tax on motor vehicles.  This Clause also includes valuation amounts based on the cost of an electric 
<br/>vehicle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  5  of  the Bill  amends  section  110  of the Act  to  revert  the  rules  for  the  payment  of 
<br/>advance  taxes  that  existed  prior  to  COVID-19  pandemic  measures  that  we  have  put  in  place, 
<br/>especially at that time.  The advance tax will be paid in three instalments.  So, we are getting rid of 
<br/>some of the COVID-19 measures and putting things back to what it was before COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill amends the Act by  deleting  section 125A in  relation to deduction  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business losses of up to $20,000.  This maintains withholding tax as final tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Value Added Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 2 of 
<br/></span><span>the Bill amends section 14 of the Act which governs the application of Value Added Tax (VAT) on 
<br/>imports. Currently, certain items are exempt from VAT under section 14(4A)(a).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 14(4A)(a) of the Act by including Concession Code 201C 
<br/>(a Member of Parliament) as imported items exempt from VAT.  Deleting Concession Code 212 (a 
<br/>private individual), which currently allows for VAT exemption on personal imports. The proposed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>1330 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amendment requires individuals to pay VAT on personal imports, aligning with the standard VAT 
<br/>regime.  This  amendment  seeks  to  create  a  fair  market  environment,  as  all  commodities,  whether 
<br/>domestically purchased or imported, will be subject to the same VAT rate.  This also ensures that tax 
<br/>revenues are not lost due to imports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 32 of the Act, which sets out the taxable period application 
<br/>under the Act.  This Clause amends section 32 of the Act by deleting references to Categories C and 
<br/>D, which currently, Mr.  Speaker, Sir, provide  for taxable periods  of 12 months.  Instead,  taxable 
<br/>period will align with those in Category A - one month, or Category B - three months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the transitional provisions to facilitate the transition of new 
<br/>taxable periods.  This Clause allows registered persons who are previously in Category C or Category 
<br/>D to file their tax returns by 31st January, 2025, for the taxable period 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  4  of  the  Bill  also  seeks  to  allow  registered  persons  previously  in  Category  C  or 
<br/>Category D to be re-assigned to either Category A which is 1 month, or category B which is three 
<br/>months.  Overall, the Bill seeks to streamline and simplify the application of VAT on imports and 
<br/>taxable periods, while also ensuring a smooth transition for persons registered under the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Customs (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, section 2(1) of the 
<br/>Act  is  amended  to  redefine  definitions  -  there  was  a  lot  of  confusion  with  respect  to  “produce”, 
<br/>“producer” and “manufacturer”, to allow local producers to receive the same concessionary benefits 
<br/>as others, creating fairness and levelling the playing field for the local producers, and providing them 
<br/>with  the  same  opportunities  and  advantages  as  others,  fostering  a  more  equitable  economic 
<br/>environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 2 of the Act is also amended to insert new definitions of “mixing” and “blending”, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and “sign” or “signatures” for clarity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 32 of the Act by deleting subsection 2 to remove the time 
<br/>to pay arrangement for the payment of duty on yacht imports of up to $2 million, to ensure uniformity 
<br/>and prompt revenue collection upon importation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 66(2) of the Act is amended to increase the penalty for 
<br/>the owner of goods who fails to comply with an undertaking of furnishing the necessary entry within 
<br/>five consecutive days of the departure of goods to the Comptroller. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 92(9A) of the Act is amended to allow the Comptroller to impose a 5 percent penalty 
<br/>for  approved  petroleum  companies  that  fail  to  pay  import  duty  before  the  due  date  to  deter  non-
<br/>payment from the approved petroleum companies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 173A(8) of the Act is amended to align the objection period in the Act to the Tax 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administration Act 2009 in relation to a decision made by the Comptroller.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Customs Tariff (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024:  Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Act, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, is amended as follows.  As I have said earlier, to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> remove the 3 percent export duty on sugar.  This was never applied. It was always on the 
<br/>books. 
<br/>increase the excise duty on alcohol and tobacco by 5 percent. 
<br/>increase  the  import  fiscal  duty  on  ships,  boats  and  floating  structures  from  free  to  5 
<br/>percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reduce the import fiscal duty on prefabricated building from 32 percent to 5 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Act is amended to exempt hospital beds from fiscal duty and VAT.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The wider public can acquire beds at a lower cost and patients receiving care at home will benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Act is amended to provide the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>A new concession code to exempt duty and VAT on importation of one motor vehicle for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a Member of Parliament within their term of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>A  new  concession  code  for  the  manufacturers  and  producers,  processing  alcoholic 
<br/>beverages through the mixing and blending process.  This will fix interpretation issues at 
<br/>operational level and manufacturers who are involved in mixing and blending processes do 
<br/>not qualify to benefit from concessions for manufacturers who produce the final product 
<br/>through the fermentation and distillation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Removal  of  VAT  concession  on  personal  items,  as  I  have  said  earlier,  from  $2,000  to 
<br/>$1,000.  It used to be $400 before COVID-19, I was taken to $2,000 so we are not going 
<br/>back to $400 but we just going back to $1,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Reduction  in  fiscal  duties  associated  with  different  products  relating  to  various 
<br/>manufacturing and production purposes.  I am sure honourable Members have read all that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, section 2 of the Act is amended to provide for 
<br/>a longer duty accounting period for manufacturers of certain excisable products who were issued a 
<br/>licence on or after 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to assist new businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 28 of the Act is amended to impose a fee of $15 for each submission that is processed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by FRCS and a fine of $115 for the late payment of excise duty to discourage late payments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 81 of the Act is amended to mandate manufacturers and warehouse keepers to keep 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>electronic copies of books, documents and phones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Schedule 2 to the Act is amended to reflect the increase in the rate of excise duty on alcohol 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and tobacco by 5 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Airport Departure Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 3 of 
<br/>the Act is amended to reflect the changes from $140 to $170, and then $170 to $200, and the effective 
<br/>dates. These changes are reflective of the recovering tourism sector in the last 12 to 18 months, as I 
<br/>have said before.  We are also reducing the transit hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, as I have said, 
<br/>we  are  amending  section  7  of  the  Act  by  including  a  worker  representative  and  an  employer 
<br/>representative, as members of the FNPF Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 36 of the Act to update provisions on admitting minors, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as I have said before, on FNPF members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 37 of the Act to provide an employer up to 14 days at the 
<br/></span><span>beginning of each month, to submit a remittance back to the Board, and all the other amendments 
<br/>that I had highlighted earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loans  Service  (Budget  Amendment)  Bill  2024,  again, 
<br/>section 2 of the Act is amended, as I have said earlier, to insert the new definition of “at-risk student”, 
<br/>to identify a student who is under a bond agreement.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 5 of the Act is amended to mandate tertiary education institutions to inform TELS of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at-risk students, so that TELS can undertake actions to support their students better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generally, the amendments are made to mandate former TSLS students to clear their bond, 
<br/>to mandate tertiary education institutions to inform TELS of their at-risk students, penalise students 
<br/>who are legally bound to TSLS and have no intention of serving their bond, and reflect the initial 
<br/>arrangement on former TSLS students on their bond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bills to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I

<br/>Development and Statistics for the passing of the Budget yesterday afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The discussions that will be held today are basically consequential of the Budget that was 
<br/>already passed yesterday.  So, we are basically going to raise some issues that we think should be 
<br/>highlighted in this Parliament, but it will not make any impact on the decisions that had already been 
<br/>made yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My contribution,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be restricted to  departure tax only,  and a Bill that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covers the amendment of income tax for the export of agricultural, fisheries and forestry goods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand perfectly well the increase in departure tax.  It is a source of 
<br/>income and revenue for Government to be able to fund its operations in the financial year that has 
<br/>been earmarked (2024-2025).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government has to create avenues and look for areas that it can generate revenue.  My view 
<br/>is that airport tax is basically added on to the airline ticket which will deliver an indication of the cost 
<br/>for flying across and spending their holidays within a destination.  The increase in departure tax will 
<br/>basically mean that Fiji, as a destination, will be increasing its actual cost that the tourists will need 
<br/>to spend if they choose to come and spend their holidays here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My main concern, as I have highlighted during the Budget discussions, is the competition that 
<br/></span><span>will be provided by the destinations in South-East Asia.  Fiji had done good by rebounding well after 
<br/>COVID-19.  In that, it was one of the first destinations to be opened.  We took advantage of that 
<br/>opportunity, and we flew off our handle and we are reaping the benefits today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would have suggested in hindsight the suggestion, that may be the increase could have been 
<br/>done in two slots.  To me, the first one is to be done in this financial year because we will finish that 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1333 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>period before the next budget, and then have an increase of $200 announced during the next Budget, 
<br/>which will then give the impetus to introduce that increase in August next year, especially as we 
<br/>approach the season  of  October, November, December, January, February  and  March.   It  gives  a 
<br/>comfort to our international tourists, that it is alright for high-end spenders, which we do not have 
<br/>the comfort of always attracting. Our attraction in Fiji is the sand, sea and smile and the nice weather 
<br/>that we enjoy, and that is basically one of the major pull provided also by our workers that work in 
<br/>our hotels.  Sea and smile is the main attraction to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we consider it comfortable that the numbers are increasing, I am just concerned that 
<br/>these two increases within the Budget announcement, to me, would have been done in a softer manner 
<br/>– announce $170 now and then announce $200 in the next Budget next year.  But, anyway, that is 
<br/>water under the bridge, and we need to meet up with the expectations that this increase in departure 
<br/>tax will bring forth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the next one is the percentage on export income to be deducted on agriculture, fisheries 
<br/>and  forestry.  This  is  a  welcome  development,  and  I  thank  the  Government  for  introducing  this 
<br/>because this will help our export.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister for Agriculture had stated in his delivery, we need to also take 
<br/>care  of  our  consumption  in  these  areas,  locally.  Before  considering  export,  we  need  to  feed  our 
<br/>people, that is food security, and that is an important issue that Government needs to consider. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat, in my short contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Fisheries that I am not a technician or a technical expert in fisheries. My 
<br/>expert is very limited in handline fishing. That is the only expert I have. I do not have any degree or 
<br/>anything in  fisheries.  Whatever  I learned  was from  the last five years that  I was the Minister for 
<br/>Fisheries.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau, but you are really an expert in fishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when you are on land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now invite the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, to make his contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics 
<br/>in tabling the Consequential Bills that accompany the approval that was done yesterday.  I guess what 
<br/>the honourable Koroilavesau, perhaps, lamented that the Bills are consequential and, therefore, are 
<br/>just part of the approval process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think what we need to understand is that there are some very significant 
<br/>amendments been made today that will continue to assist us as we try and redevelop the architecture 
<br/>of the Fijian economy, Sir, and try and ensure that we diversify the Fijian economy and also ensure 
<br/></span><span>that we start achieving the aspirational 5 percent economic growth that we really need to get to, in 
<br/></span><span>order  to  try  and  address  some  of  the  challenges  regarding  debt  management  and  also  creating 
<br/>sustainability for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things, Sir, that has dawned on me in our deliberation this week is that we are 
<br/>really in a true democracy.  The conduct of consultations, the conduct of the debate in Parliament, 
<br/>Sir,  shows  that  we  are  in  a  new  environment.  We,  on  both  sides  of  Parliament,  Sir,  should 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congratulate ourselves and pat ourselves on the back in terms of what we are doing in front of the 
<br/>people of Fiji in terms of trying to progress and rebuild our nation.  The transparency that we have 
<br/>been experiencing for the first time, twice in a row now, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Opposition  Party  have  been  allowed  to  access  all  the  information, 
<br/>investment information.  It is not like a big deal.  The Chief Executive Officer of Investment Fiji just 
<br/>called, and I said, “Yes, go ahead, do it.”  Sir, this is the new Fiji that we are trying to rebuild. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition asked for access to the budgetary information, even the information that they 
<br/>were using against us in terms of utilisation.  But that is the new democracy, Sir, and we will continue 
<br/>that because we can see that it is allowing us to all work together for the betterment of our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to specifically mention some of the great initiatives that are here, and 
<br/>the first one I thought I will mention is the3 percent duty on raw materials. And if anything, Sir, this 
<br/>demonstrates that this side of the Parliament and this Government, your Government, Sir, we listen 
<br/>to the people of Fiji and we listen to everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were concerns expressed last year, we all discussed with the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and was removed.  What it has done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just to 
<br/>re-energise the private sector and make them happy that when they come forward, they can move 
<br/>forward with a lot more optimism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Departure Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do take note of honourable Koroilavesau’s comments, but 
<br/>just to allay his concerns, the first increase is actually taking effect from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024 and the 
<br/>second increase is taking effect in 2025. So, in fact, we are, sort of, spreading it over for two financial 
<br/>years and that should be fine in terms of managing expectations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, it is a good thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are flagging it in advance because for the 
<br/>tourism  industry  that the  honourable  Gavoka  and  I  know  about,  they  are  always  happy  when  we 
<br/>signal things in advance rather than, sort of, hiding and be cloak and dagger and then, all of a sudden, 
<br/>announce a change.  Again, a government that listens, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Prefabrication Buildings Concession, Sir, this is very significant because it 
<br/>will allow, firstly, to accelerate the construction of hotels in Fiji.  We have one significant hotel in 
<br/>Denarau that is seriously looking at prefab, sort of, design and they are actually now saying that they 
<br/>can condense their programme from three years possibly down to two years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from that perspective, this is a very significant initiative, and it will speed 
<br/>up the pace of construction in our country, and whilst speeding up the pace of construction, Sir, that 
<br/>just means that there are more jobs created in our country, as we all agree, is all needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The hotel incentive –SLIP, Sir, again, that is significant because there was a bit of a grey area 
<br/>in the legislation.  You could only enjoy tax concession if you build a new hotel.  As we know, Sir, 
<br/>there are now investors in the country wanting to take hold of retired, rundown properties and re-
<br/>design them, enhance them, rebrand them and, sort of, attract more visitors to our shores. This, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>will take away that mystery and will, again, make people a lot more interested, investors particularly, 
<br/></span><span>for  coming  into  Fiji,  taking  control  of  existing  properties,  and  then  enhancing  them  into  branded 
<br/>hotel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that we should celebrate is the iTaukei Incentive, Sir, and I speak certainly in 
<br/>terms of those who are on this side of Parliament that sincerely believe that we really need to unlock 
<br/>the potential in the natural resource economy which is, of course, what the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> of this country 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1335 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>own.  Sir, these concessions will ensure that we start assisting the growth in that sector and have a 
<br/>look at what the Maoris have done in New Zealand.  That is a benchmark for the rest of Fiji and this 
<br/>step, Sir, will ensure that we move in that direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Sir, I thought I will just touch on one final concession which is the Lyndhurst Limited 
<br/>Tax Free Region Concession and I do that Sir, not because I am a former employee, but I do that just 
<br/>to explain what this opportunity brings.  The honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>mentioned it yesterday but, probably, some of the honourable Members did not hear it.  This project, 
<br/>Sir, is an eight-year project, upon completion, will actually produce between 10,000 to 15,000 jobs 
<br/>in Fiji.   Let me repeat  that again, Sir,  this investment, upon completion, is just underneath half a 
<br/>billion dollars.  So, Lyndhurst, working with FNPF, will create an investment that is estimated to 
<br/>create 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in Fiji, so this is a very significant concession that we have made in the 
<br/>interest of developing this economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, with those thoughts in mind, I totally support the Consequential Bills.  They may be called 
<br/>“consequential” Sir, but I beg to  differ with  honourable Koroilavesau and say  that these are very 
<br/>significant amendments in the legislation for Fiji and for its future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today I will be speaking on Bill No. 12, but before I 
<br/>do that, I would like to congratulate honourable Bainivalu, as I forgot to mention that in my Budget 
<br/>speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support female, so I kindly request the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/>have a few more lady Ministers sitting in front, as alluded by honourable Premila Kumar.  Honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua has been here for her second term, she is good to be a full Minister.  In my knowledge, 
<br/>I humbly request the honourable Prime Minister to show the country that we have gender balance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Talking here in Parliament about democracy, democracy has come a 
<br/>long way since the 1970s.  A lot of governments have come and whatever legislations and regulations 
<br/>best suited for them, they change.  Now, you are at the steering wheel so whatever suits you, you can 
<br/>do it.  At the end of the day, we have to serve the people of our nation as Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- It will be good to see honourable Members going out into the public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and supporting the people of this nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We want them to be in the front bench? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- If they do not want,  we can come that side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have already told the honourable Prime Minister, and soon if he can offer me to be the Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has plenty avenues, his numbers are large now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>1336 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking  on  Bill  No.  12,  I  think  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  and  I  will  also  ask  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General that when the Bill was tabled in Parliament from that night, Customs 
<br/>started charging 15 percent and they said that it is in the regulation, but the Bill was only tabled at 
<br/>that stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill will be effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, so all those charges should be applied from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August.  If there is any regulation to be changed, as they have alluded, it should be changed. I request 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General to change are few of the regulations in the Customs Act where once 
<br/>the Bill is tabled, they started charging 15 percent, and whatever duty they start charging and say if 
<br/>the Bill does not go through then they will refund the money.  So, it is a double process. I think the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Finance will understand much better, he is an economist and a professor, 
<br/>and I have a lot of respect him.  I went to USP and did my Degree when he was there, so I have a lot 
<br/>of respect for him so I hope he will do the right thing for the nation because .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Oh, my Professor was Dr. Reddy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I do like him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Ministry of Finance came for a meeting with the Opposition Members, they talked 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about that regulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one, I will request the honourable Minister for Finance that it is hard on all local 
<br/>bottling companies - from1 cent, it went to 5 cents, if they can re-consider putting it at 2 cents or 3 
<br/>cents.  Do not be hard on them because maybe the local water price will go up because of 5 cents.  
<br/>The  price  of  the  water  which  we  are  buying  from  supermarkets,  the  honourable  Minister  cannot 
<br/>provide water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tacirua area is suffering, honourable Minister, so I hope you will consider that there is 
<br/>no water at times. Sometimes, they do not bath for two or three days, they have to go to the river. So, 
<br/>I just want to let you know.  There is one creek, Mr. Speaker, where they go and do their washing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking about water, 1 cent to 5 cents is big and mostly, Fijian people drink Fiji Water, as 
<br/>well as other water in Fiji.  I hope you will consider that.   With all those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>thank you for this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution in support of 
<br/>the Bills which are consequential to the Appropriation Act that we had passed last night.  I just want 
<br/>to emphasise, I suppose, a point that we probably already know.  Those who have had their first and 
<br/>second  rounds  in  Parliament  since  2014  would  understand  the  importance  of  why  these 
<br/>Consequential  Bills  ought  to  be  passed  because  on  the  balance.    They  would  support  the 
<br/></span><span>implementation of the Budget that we had overwhelmingly agreed to last night.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also important that we get these Bills through today because without them, none of the 
<br/>impositions  that  we  intend  to  carry  through  with  the  Budget  will  be  lawful  and  to  that  extent,  I 
<br/>appreciate the contribution by honourable Koroilavesau, as well as honourable Kirpal, and I am sure 
<br/>that honourable Premila Kumar will also, in the end, support the passage of these Bills so that we can 
<br/>get, not just the Budget but also the Consequential Bills through and bring this week to a high end.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  intend  to  spend  the  20  minutes  that  I  have  been  allocated  but 
<br/>collectively,  to  make  some  comments  on  the  nine  Consequential  Bills  that  accompany  the 
<br/>Appropriation which we have passed yesterday.  One of the important provisions that the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Finance had picked up was in our tax system, 
<br/>that is, in the reduction of prefabricated materials from the present 32 percent to 5 percent that we 
<br/>would  begin  to  impose  and  levy  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  August  this  year.    Building  and  construction  materials, 
<br/>honourable Members have always been an impediment to the greater construction industry in Fiji, 
<br/>but also even in the lesser but equally important construction of residences and commercial buildings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is going to bring down the cost and if we are bringing down the cost, 
<br/>we are also going to be increasing the number and the level of employment that we would create in 
<br/>the country.  I think from yesterday, we would all agree that when we went through the Budget line 
<br/>by line, we can identify that through this Budget, there is a lot for every citizen of this country.  We 
<br/>can  identify  that  in  the  Ministry  programmes,  line  by  line  that  if  we  look  at  it,  there  is  always 
<br/>something there for all Fijians.  The important part is, post-1</span><span>st</span><span> August is the implementation and the 
<br/>rush to ensure that that budgetary item is completely spent, and as the Opposition would impose on 
<br/>us, spend it well.  I am sure that we have that in our books.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SLIP provision that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics as well as the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>and Communications had spoken about is an incentive to ensure that existing hotels are upgraded.  If 
<br/>it is not upgraded by those who own it now and if there is a sale, there is always a tax concession for 
<br/>those who will come in, pick up the project and continue on with it.  We have, I think, a deficit of 
<br/>about 3,000 beds.  That, I think, is even a very moderate number.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation might 
<br/>have the accurate number, but notwithstanding, that number is still great.  So, this sort of incentive 
<br/>is  going  to  bring  that  investor  confidence  into  the  country  where  people  will  see  an  avenue  of 
<br/>investment, pour in the money, take advantage of the concession and also contribute to our national 
<br/>economy, as well as our buoyant tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  Tax  Administration  (Budget  Amendment)  Bill  2024,  one  of  the 
<br/>provisions that clearly has been highlighted by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is that we now have more 
<br/>latitude given to our businesspeople for clearance of their goods.  That is important because as we 
<br/>know, businesses in Fiji are not always flush with funds.  Sometimes, as usual, businesses run into 
<br/>some brick walls, availability of funding is not always there all the time.  So, the provision of more 
<br/>time then gives them an opportunity to clear their goods and not having  all those goods forfeited 
<br/>because time has lapsed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the great measures that we can see now, which is also an indication of our progress as 
<br/>a country economically, socially  and collectively as a people, is  that which was identified by the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in his speech on the Tax Administration 
<br/>(Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 is that all the measures that were there post-COVID-19, we are now 
<br/></span><span>returning  it  pre-COVID-19.    That  is  a  good  thing  because  it  is  indicating  to  us,  and  we  are  also 
<br/></span><span>indicating  to  the  rest  of  the  world  that  we  are  now  back  on  track.    We  are  trying,  we  have  gone 
<br/>through one of the most devastating global phenomena, and we have pushed past that that in the few 
<br/>years ago and we are now back on track, and we are now on a post-recovery pathway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the VAT on personal imports (even my wife is not in agreement with that, 
<br/>because they purchase online), I think the balance of that is, now local traders will have a very fair 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>playing field with those who trade on international online web system.  So, those in Fiji who have 
<br/>gone through the pains  and local  businesses who have gone  through the  pain  of reporting goods, 
<br/>putting them on the shelves, now have a level playing field with those that do the same or provide 
<br/>the same service online. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, is 
<br/>also important because it gives provision for hardship situations. Whilst this was not there before, it 
<br/>is now there in this Bill where TSLS is able to help students in places and in positions of hardship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  just  want  to  come  back,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  end  with  the  contribution  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau when he identified the imposition now or back to normal imposition of the departure 
<br/>tax. It has been a well thought-out process, Mr. Speaker, during the budgetary process by the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance with all honourable Ministers and the whole of Government approach, again, consistent 
<br/>with our out of the woods theme that we are now coming out of COVID, back into the global scheme 
<br/>of things, but he is right, Mr. Speaker.  I just want to add on to what the honourable Koroilavesau 
<br/>has said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourists have many destinations to go to.  They could go to South-East Asia, they could even 
<br/>fly  within  the  Australian  domain,  they  could  go  to  other  South  Pacific  Islands,  but  we  sell  sand, 
<br/>sunshine and smile, better. I think that is something that as a tourist destination, Fijians just fare much 
<br/>better in providing that level of comfort and receptivity to tourists who, over time, keep coming back 
<br/>to our shores.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But it is just not that, Mr. Speaker, and I want to end on this note - they come back because 
<br/>they understand that a heart of a Fijian is very different from every other destination in the world. 
<br/>We have them in our house. We have them in our communities. We have them together with us in 
<br/>our  backyard.  We  introduce  them  to  kava  sessions.  We  introduce  them  to  our  horsebacks.  We 
<br/>introduce them to a lot of things that our nature here in Fiji is able to offer, and that is something that 
<br/>demarcates Fiji as the destination from everywhere else in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even with this imposition, Mr. Speaker, and as  quietly rightly pointed out by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau, comes part of the ticket  quite possibly for those high-end travellers, not a problem, 
<br/>but even for those who might think, “well, that is a small pinch in our budget to travel to Fiji”, they 
<br/>will never forget the experience that they get when they come here and they return – the heart of the 
<br/>Fijians.  The heart of a Fijian, Mr. Speaker, is what we all see this Parliament is beginning to show 
<br/>and the people of Fiji is beginning to see from both sides of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with that contribution, I support the Bills  consequential to the Appropriation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I thank you for this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on two Bills and maybe a third one, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if I have time - Bill No.13 of 2024 and Bill No.15 of 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all agree with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  and,  of  course,  with  the 
<br/></span><span>Government, that revenue is very important for the Government to deliver its social obligation and it 
<br/></span><span>is important that every cent is collected. It is very crucial that we do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, one needs to be very mindful of the fact that we are at a difficult situation right 
<br/>now. Government may be collecting the revenue, but the revenue is coming from the people, as well 
<br/>as from the businesses.  Now, some of these businesses are not performing well and is causing the 
<br/>slowdown in the economy, we all know that.  And, therefore, when businesses are not doing well, it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1339 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is not appropriate to put in certain changes in the legislation which is going to increase the burden, 
<br/>and I would like to draw everyone’s attention to Clause 3 of the Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 
<br/>2024 that amends section 28 of the Act.  What it does is, it imposes a fee of $15 for each submission 
<br/>that is processed by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) and a late penalty fee of $115, 
<br/>and the time that is given for the businesses to clear their duty is just three working days.  And it is 
<br/>also subject to the Comptroller, whichever time he or she approves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have two issues here.  The first issue is for the Comptroller to make that 
<br/>decision, which is actually subjective in nature, and we should not allow subjective decision-making 
<br/>to be allowed in any legislation because that opens up abuse, it opens up favouritism, et cetera.  To 
<br/>address that, the best solution would have been to give businesses, at least, seven working days or 14 
<br/>working days because within a month, the money will be paid, and the government can collect that 
<br/>money.  But just making the period short, like three working days, obviously, would mean more and 
<br/>more businesses will go up to FRCS saying, “we cannot make this payment.  Paperwork will increase 
<br/>at FRCS.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Comptroller has to write letters to businesses and say, “Alright, I have heard your case, 
<br/>I  will  give  you  more  time.”    So,  why  take  that  administrative  process  when  you  can  amend  the 
<br/>legislation and allow reasonable time for businesses to clear their duties or whatever taxes they owe?  
<br/>That will allow businesses to have that confidence in the system as well.  When businesses are not 
<br/>doing well, at least, the Government is listening, and they are considerate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am urging the Government to, please, consider that because really, businesses are facing 
<br/>a lot of difficulties at a time like this, with a global slowdown as well so in that case we should give 
<br/>some leeway to businesses.  I am not saying that they should not be paying the duty, of course, they 
<br/>will, and they must, and they should. But just giving them ample time to clear their duty within the 
<br/>month, and having this subjective decision to be part of the law is not a very good idea.  So, that was 
<br/>my first point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second point is on the Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill 
<br/>No. 15/2024) and it is to do with the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) members’ nominee.  So, 
<br/>it simply says, that the FNPF member can nominate whoever he or she likes, that when he or she is 
<br/>not there anymore, that amount can be passed on.  So, if it is existing FNPF member and it says that 
<br/>it can be passed on to the existing FNPF member, or to another member who is not part of FNPF. So, 
<br/>my question here is, say someone who is over 65 years and is not an FNPF member, can that be 
<br/>passed on?  That needs to be clarified and it is not clarified here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, that clarification is required.  Age needs to be specified so that it is clear to 
<br/>the FNPF member that when he or she is going to pass on, whatever money he or she has accumulated 
<br/>in FNPF goes to the member who can join FNPF because I think the whole idea is to retain money 
<br/>within FNPF and grow FNPF money.  So, if that is the intent of this particular Clause, then maybe 
<br/>we need to consider that aspect, that if the money is passed on to someone who is over 65 years and 
<br/>a good example would be a young son who decides to pass on that money to his parents, if he passes 
<br/>away or is still working, then obviously it cannot happen.  So, I am not clear about this particular 
<br/>Clause.  Maybe, some more clarification is required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third one that I would like to speak on is the Water Resource Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Last 
<br/>year, Government introduced Water Resource Tax and we know that a seven-year tax holiday was 
<br/>given to companies and this year, the seven-year tax holiday remains.  Unfortunately, Government 
<br/>is  trying  to  punish  the  local  companies  who  produce  smaller  amounts  and  are,  obviously,  not 
<br/>extracting large quantity of water from the ground where 19.5 percent will apply to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>1340 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  Government  certainly  realises  that  the  decision  they  made  last  year  is  not 
<br/>bringing them revenue as they anticipated. So, what they did this year, they have increased the Water 
<br/>Resource Tax from 1 cent to 5 cents and, definitely, that affects our local producers.  I feel this is not 
<br/>fair to our local producers because we are bending backwards to accommodate Fiji Water, and we 
<br/>are  ignoring  our  own  producers.    Therefore,  I  am  urging  Government  to  reconsider  this  Water 
<br/>Resource  Tax.  From  1  cent  to  5  cents  is  definitely  a  100  percent  increase,  and  that  will  affect 
<br/>businesses because every cent counts, at a time like this when our economy is slowing down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for bringing in this 5 percent 
<br/>duty reduction from 32 percent to 5 percent on prefabricated building. This is definitely needed in 
<br/>our economy; we want to grow our economy and by doing that, we are dealing with two things; one 
<br/>is of course the cost component, and the other one is the labour component. Of course, we will need 
<br/>specialized people to do that but that will shorten the time for the construction and is going to be a 
<br/>gain for everyone. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a short contribution in 
<br/>supporting  the  motion  before  Parliament  relating  to  the  Consequential  Bills,  and  I  would  like  to 
<br/>specifically focus on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/>(Bill No. 16/2024).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the Act basically covers the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shifting  of  the  bond  monitoring  and  travel  clearance  from  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs 
<br/>Service (FRCS) to now Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS); 
<br/>50 percent penalty for non-serve bond; 
<br/>obtaining student employment records or data; 
<br/>addition of new programmes for funding; and  
<br/>reporting at risk for academically non-performing students who are being sponsored and 
<br/>providing false scholarship information to students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just let me elaborate on some of these provisions. The rationale regarding 
<br/>the justification of shifting the functions from FRCS to TSLS, before it used to be the responsibility 
<br/>of TSLS and in 2017, this was shifted to FRCS, which created a lot of concerns and inquiries from 
<br/>students who are covered under the TSLS bond system when they intend or wish to go overseas.  
<br/>Sometimes they are being directed, after going to TSLS, to go to FRCS to get their related necessary 
<br/>clearance.  So, this is bringing the functions back to TSLS to make it a one-stop place and allow 
<br/>efficient services to the students.  This is included in sections 5, 6, 16, 17 and 25 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reinstatement of penalty, I think the whole rationale behind this is to 
<br/>ensure that those who have been sponsored by taxpayers’ funds needed to spend time and work in 
<br/>Fiji through Government Ministries, or through institutions that are operating in Fiji.  There have 
<br/>been instances where students, halfway into their bond, are being offered to go abroad, so they have 
<br/>to pay off the remaining balance, so this is like a deterrent to keep them here to serve their full bond 
<br/>period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the taxpayers are not investing graduates to work in overseas 
<br/>countries but in our local workforce.  Any graduate seeking to migrate or go for overseas employment 
<br/>will be required to first serve their full bond, and should graduates opt not to fully serve, then they 
<br/>should  pay  the  remaining  balance  with  50  percent  penalty  before  travel  release  is  granted  to  go 
<br/></span><span>overseas and this will be through discussions and review by TSLS and the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The collection of data, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from graduates who have studied on Government 
<br/>scholarship is also very, very important for future scholarship planning, especially in the areas of 
<br/>need, and investment for bond monitoring purposes and the data will be used in other Government 
<br/>planning system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the tertiary education institutions sometimes provide incorrect information to students for 
<br/>the purpose of increasing their enrolment numbers and the students are charged fees for programmes 
<br/>which are not funded through scholarships.  There have been many cases where students were given 
<br/>offer letters by tertiary education institutions and advised that scholarships will be given when the 
<br/>student did not meet the scholarship eligibility criteria.  So, TSLS is running workshops for tertiary 
<br/>education institutions on the scholarship eligibility criteria and every year publishes a scholarship 
<br/>handbook. This will be given out at the beginning of next month.  Government only fund scholarships 
<br/>in  national  priority  areas.  With this  inclusion in  the Act, TSLS can take  actions on the  intuitions 
<br/>providing  false  information.  Government  welcomes  competition  between  tertiary  education 
<br/>institutions, and we all have experienced mass marketing before the semester starts.  This inclusion 
<br/>is included in section 18 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  at-risk  students,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  who  start  to  fail  assignments  and 
<br/>assessments from the beginning are called academically-risk students.  This will ensure that tertiary 
<br/>education institutions have learning support and remedial programmes to provide scaffolding support 
<br/>to students.  This will, hopefully, reduce failure and non-completion rate of students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been reported that $160 million has been wasted by 21,685 students, 
<br/>who  did  not  complete  their  programmes.    This  results  to  squandering  of  State  resources  and  the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  wants  to  stop  this  immediately  by  having  new  inclusion  in  the  Act.    The 
<br/>current tertiary education institutions provide their results to TSLS at the end of the semester, and 
<br/>they will make sure that information that is provided is accurate information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The adding of new programmes to be funded by TSLS carries out resources and employment 
<br/>checks with institutions and potential employers.  This is due diligence before taxpayers’ funds is 
<br/>used,  to  provide  scholarships  for  new  programmes.  The  Coalition  Government  is  conscious  that 
<br/>taxpayers’ money should be used where employment is available for graduates.  Furthermore, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this will avoid lawsuits from graduates who are not be able to find jobs and TSLS has 
<br/>been sued recently by graduates who could not find employment after four years of study under the 
<br/>TSLS programme.  This new inclusion is outlined in Section 25 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I render my full  support to  the motion  before Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regarding the Consequential Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all the honourable Members 
<br/>for their contributions which are very helpful. It provides clarity and allows me to also clarify some 
<br/>of the questions that have been raised, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the departure tax, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-
<br/>operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications quite rightly pointed out, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, we deliberately announced in the two phases from $140 to $170 and then to $200 and 
<br/></span><span>he is absolutely right that we wanted to provide this certainty well in advance for the tourism industry 
<br/>players to adjust and we have had some discussion with them.   They are all very supportive of this 
<br/>phased announcement, even though it will be implemented on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August when we get to $200. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I wanted to make, honourable Koroilavesau is, we have said very clearly 
<br/>before the tourism industry was hit by 10 percent ECAL, 6 percent STT, we are saying that we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>1342 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not going to ever bring those as long as we are in government so we have signalled to the tourism 
<br/>industry very clearly that these taxes are not going to come back and that departure tax is something 
<br/>that we feel could go back to what it was before COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the point that was raised about how it might affect the tourism industry, in fact, in the last 
<br/>eight months, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil  Aviation has already 
<br/>said, visitor arrivals have actually increased by 8 percent in the last five months. Since we have come 
<br/>into Government, we have also increased the Tourism Marketing grant from $20 million to now $35 
<br/>million, so marketing will also be very aggressive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airways always offer very competitive fares, some of them have spare capacity, I think 
<br/>their prices are very competitive.  Airline and hotel prices are determined in a similar fashion.  Hotels, 
<br/>as soon as they are 60 percent or 70 percent, the last 30 percent, they go very high. So, those rooms 
<br/>is there, Mr Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  point  that  honourable  Kirpal  raised  about  immediate  effect,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is 
<br/>always by Customs law that as soon as duty increases, et cetera, is announced, the effect is immediate 
<br/>soon  after  the  announcement  of  the  Budget,  because  if  that  does  not  happen,  for  example,  we 
<br/>announced 5 percent increase in duty on alcohol and cigarette.  If it is not implemented straightaway, 
<br/>businesses could stock large amounts of cigarette and alcohol to be sold at a higher price but paying 
<br/>a lower duty.  So, in the unlikely event that the Budget fails, that that duty is refundable. So, it is by 
<br/>Customs law that when duty and other things are announced in the Budget, the effect is immediate.  
<br/>And as I have said, in the event that the Budget is not passed, that duty is always refunded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the point on the personal items, the amount was $400.  During COVID-19, 
<br/>it was increased to $2,000.  So, what we have done, we have not gone back to pre-COVID, we have 
<br/>not gone back to $400, we have just gone back to $1,000, and as the honourable Minister for Lands 
<br/>quite rightly pointed out, I am sorry your wife might not be very happy honourable Minister, but the 
<br/>point is that it brings a level playing field and also close that loophole where it was being misused.  
<br/>Sir, in many countries that have seen the rise of online shopping have put in measures to ensure that 
<br/>there is a level playing field.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to the water resource tax, it is not part of any consequential legislation, it is by 
<br/>regulation,  and  we  have  had  discussions  with  the  water  bottlers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  we  have 
<br/>decided that we will stick to 1 cent, in the meantime, instead of 5 cents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue about FNPF, honourable Premila Kumar, your earlier point about the Comptroller, 
<br/>that $15 was already in place, it is just a realignment of the law. What is there was already there, so 
<br/>we are not changing anything in terms of bringing the law in line with what was happening because 
<br/>there was a loophole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Change it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  We  are  changing  it,  we  are  closing  the  legal  loophole, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Premila Kumar, and that is what we have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the point raised, that is to allow an additional option for those 
<br/>at the retirement age. Right now, they have an option of going into pension or withdrawing the full 
<br/>amount.  With this amendment, they will have an option of transferring some of their balances to an 
<br/>existing member whether it is their son or daughter, so that is the interpretation of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my opening remarks, we want to have a tax system that is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1343 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>administratively simple, transparent, efficient and fair.  At the same time, we want to  ensure that 
<br/>Government is well funded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tax, Sir, is something which will always have gainers and losers, so it is quite natural that 
<br/>any  tax  that  you  put  in,  any  increase  or  decrease,  will  always  invite  winners  and  losers.    As  a 
<br/>government, we have listened very carefully and we want to provide that balance, that transparency 
<br/>and  that  forward  looking  warning  and  certainty  with  respect  to  what  our  businesses  and  our 
<br/>consumers expect. But, at the same time, constantly making sure that we amend our laws to ensure 
<br/>that there is compliance; compliance is a big issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that honourable Premila Kumar kept making that the economy is slowing down, 
<br/>the economy is not contracting, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We have said that the economy is still growing 
<br/>and, for the first time, we are going to collect on target $3 billion revenue by the end of this month 
<br/>which is going to be the highest ever collected even pre-COVID, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Listen to the Professor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  We  provide  proper  estimates  and,  for  the  first  time,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, after many years that I have looked at the data, that what we projected in the last Budget 
<br/>is something that we are going to achieve.  Sir, that is what you call a very transparent, open system 
<br/>of putting our tax policies, tax laws, and the point I want to make too .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are telling them that we are going to collect the highest 
<br/>ever capital revenue of $3 billion by the end of this month, and it shows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that what 
<br/>we did in the last Budget and what we are doing in this Budget is actually working for our businesses, 
<br/>working for our people, and working for our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is absolutely no hogwash!  That always 
<br/>comes from the other side.  I want to thank the honourable Members for their contributions, and I 
<br/>commend the Bills and I ask all honourable Members to, please, support them.
