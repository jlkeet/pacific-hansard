<div><span>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please kindly note that there will be five Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports for tabling today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Agriculture 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- </span><span>Malo e lelei tamasi!</span><span> As Chair of Standing Committee on Natural 
<br/>Resources, I am pleased to present the Committee’s Consolidated Report on the three Annual Reports 
<br/>from the Ministry of Forestry that covered the periods from 2019 to 2022.  Through these Annual 
<br/>Reports, we gained invaluable insights into the various activities and achievements of the Ministry 
<br/>during the review period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has noted with concern the overreliance on imported forest products and the 
<br/>decreasing  export  of  such  forest  products.    Amidst  global  concern  about  climate  change  and 
<br/>environment  degradation,  Fiji  has  continued  to  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  responsible  forest 
<br/>management and conservation. The Ministry of Forestry has been at the forefront of these efforts, 
<br/>implementing policies and initiatives aimed at preserving our rich biodiversity, mitigating climate 
<br/>change and fostering socio-economic development.

<div><span> Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the face of evolving threats, it is essential that the Ministry remains vigilant and proactive 
<br/>in  its  efforts  to  safeguard  our  natural  resources  for  future  generations.  It  is  imperative  that  we 
<br/>acknowledge the work that lies ahead. The sustainability of our forests is not merely a goal, but a 
<br/>shared responsibility that requires ongoing commitment and innovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted  the importance of collaboration and partnerships, both  domestically 
<br/>and  internationally,  in  addressing  the  complex  challenges  facing  our  forests  that  cannot  be 
<br/>understated.    From  reforestation,  sustainable  logging  practices  and  community  engagement  to 
<br/>capacity  building,  the  Reports  provide  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the  Ministry's  multifaceted 
<br/>approach in forest management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee acknowledges the staff of the Ministry of Forestry and stakeholders for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dedication and support during the site visit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this opportunity to thank honourable Jone Usamate (Deputy Chairperson); honourable 
<br/>Isikeli Tuiwailevu; honourable Iliesa Vanawalu and honourable Joseph Nand, for the compilation of 
<br/>this bipartisan Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Orders 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move a motion without notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That a debate on the contents of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited 2020-2023 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  The  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  hereby  submits  to 
<br/>Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports.  The 
<br/>Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited (FSC) was incorporated in Fiji by an Act of Parliament in 1972, to 
<br/>take over the milling activities with effect from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 1973. It is the successor to South Pacific 
<br/>Sugar Mill Limited and Colonial Sugar Refining Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Industry is crucial to Fiji’s economy, contributing approximately 0.9 percent of 
<br/>the GDP, and generating about 5.7 percent of domestic exports in 2022, according to the provisional 
<br/>data from the Reserve Bank of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  four  years  under  review,  the  Committee  noted  a  significant  decline  in  cane 
<br/>production from 2020 to 2021, followed by a 16 percent increase from 2021 to 2022. Despite this 
<br/></span><span>improvement, cane production remains below the desired level of 2.5 million tonnes and continues 
<br/></span><span>to show a declining trend.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  identified  several  factors  contributing  to  the  decline  in  sugar  production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These include the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lack of interest by the farmers who perceive cane farming as unprofitable;

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inconsistent cane supply to the mill, resulting in underutilization of mill capacity; 
<br/>decline in cane quality; 
<br/>non-existence of KPIs; and  
<br/>non-renewal and absence of strategic plans to forecast the Corporation’s future targets and 
<br/>outputs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted FSC's reliance on Government grants for its operation, given its debt 
<br/>levels and recurring losses. However, the Committee strongly suggest that the Corporation develops 
<br/>proper KPIs for all sugar related sectors to ensure the economic viability of the sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Members who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were part of the team that produced this Report:

<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Sugar Cane Growers Council 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby 
<br/>submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Council 2019, 
<br/>2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) is the only grower representative organisation that 
<br/>is  committed  to  provide  service  delivery,  representation  and  leadership,  to  ensure  a  long  term 
<br/>viability of growers in the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware that in 2021, SCGC recorded 18 percent reduction in cane 
<br/>production, compared to 2020 season. The decline in production was mainly due to the destruction 
<br/>by  </span><span>Tropical  Cyclone  Yasa</span><span>  in  December  2020,  which  affected  farms  to  progress  in  subsequent 
<br/>harvesting season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, SCGC introduced Fiji’s Micro Insurance Product for our cane growers in assisting 
<br/>the growers to recover quickly following a disaster. Such initiative was deemed a game changer for

<div><span>most vulnerable farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, it is vital to identify important policy and practical measures to reform the sugar 
<br/>industry  in  Fiji  to  boost  farmer’s  confidence  and  motivation  as  critical  ingredients  for  increasing 
<br/>sugarcane crop cultivation, production, yield, and farmers to continue in sugarcane farming business.

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee on Economic Affairs to table once more one of his Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Sugar Industry Tribunal 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.–Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby 
<br/>submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry Tribunal’s 2016, 2017,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018, 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Industry Tribunal was established under the Sugar Industry Act (Cap 206) in 1984.  
<br/>The  functions  of  the  Tribunal  and  its  Accountant  and  Industrial  Commissioner  are  described  in 
<br/>sections 21, 22 and 26 of the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Industry Tribunal serves several crucial purposes within the Fiji Sugar Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These include, dispute resolution, setting standards, efficiency promotion and conciliation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the pertinent findings emanating from the scrutiny of the Sugar Industry Tribunal’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2016-2020 Annual Reports are as follows:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Failure to submit Annual Report on time. 
<br/>The Master Award is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. 
<br/>The absence of centralised database accessible to all institutions within the Sugar Sector is 
<br/>creating confusion. Currently, each institution is maintaining its own database.  Establishing 
<br/>a single database would streamline data management, enhance collaboration and improve 
<br/>sector performance. 
<br/>Non-compliance with accounting standards has led to the issuance of qualified opinion by 
<br/>the Auditor-General, highlighting issues with financial reporting.  
<br/>The  Sugar  Industry  Tribunal  is  a  remnant  of  the  colonial  era,  established  before  other 
<br/>institutions were in place.  Appointment of the Tribunal can be carried out by the Ministry 
<br/>of Sugar so that the Tribunal can remain an effective body for arbitration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team

<div><span>The Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) was established in 2006 as the premier provider 
<br/>of research, development and extension services in the sugar industry.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF has 
<br/>the national mandate for the development and dissemination of technology and information needed 
<br/>for increased productivity, profitability and sustainability of the sugar industry in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  scrutiny  of  the  Annual  Reports,  extensive  communication  was  made  with  the 
<br/>Officials from SRIF through public hearing and site visit. This Review Report highlights some of the
