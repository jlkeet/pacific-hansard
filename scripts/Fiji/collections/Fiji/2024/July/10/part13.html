<h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 7.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me just explain, there is a net increase and it is due to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following. I will give the details so that honourable Premila Kumar does not come back again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decrease in the implementation of the new Budget System…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are you following, honourable Premila Kumar? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am sorry, Sir, my question is on SEG 7 and not SEG 9 - Activity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2(7). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, that is what I am trying to explain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- She is seeking more clarification on that one, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am sorry, once again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 - National Asset Management 
<br/>Framework. Is this Framework completed?  Is this money going to be used for implementation? So, 
<br/>basically, how are you going to use it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Implementation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just a question again on this Framework. If you can elaborate a little 
<br/>bit  more,  how  do  you  implement  this  Framework?  I  mean,  is  $40,000  really  sufficient  to  do  this 
<br/>work? What does the work entail? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I could go into great details about National 
<br/>Asset Management Framework. Essentially what we found out what was that this was all over the 
<br/>place.  So, this Framework is actually going to bring things together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The actual allocation this year compared to last year is a decrease of about $10,000. What we 
<br/>are planning to do in terms of the upgrade of the Framework, the Framework is approved and now,  
<br/>it is about implementation and getting it done.  It is also updating the Fixed Register and all the other 
<br/></span><span>things that are part of the Asset Management Framework.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We shall move on.  Programme 1-3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  1-3(7)  –  Implementation  of  New 
<br/>Budget System ($2,700,000).  I noticed that in last year’s budget, you had a budget of $2 million and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now, there is $2.7 million.  Does that mean that  it is the end of the implementation?  Is it a $4.7 
<br/>million in total or is this part of the money that was budgeted last year which was not being used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The increase in expenditure is really aligned to the payment 
<br/>schedule.  We continue to invest in the modernisation of the Financial Administrative Systems.  As 
<br/>I  have  said,  when  we  provided  an  update  in  my  Ministerial  Statement  to  improve  efficiency, 
<br/>effectiveness  and  accountability,  we  are  basically  moving  away  from  the  manual  system  of 
<br/>formulating  the  National  Budget.    So,  the  Government  has  actually  engaged  the  services  of  a 
<br/>Canadian company – Questica Software Inc, for the supply and implementation of the new Budget 
<br/>software system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these years, even until now in this age of technology and IT system, everything was done 
<br/>manually.  Staff would actually feed into the Excel Sheet and look at the numbers.  This is going to 
<br/>be a great improvement and innovation.  It will make it more transparent and efficient.  We have had 
<br/>errors in the Budget in the past, in the Budget Estimates, and it was partly arising out of a manual 
<br/>system.  So, this is a very, very timely investment that we have made, as a government, to improve 
<br/>the budget system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Was the $2.7 million the end of that process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, it will be the end of the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  I still have a question, Sir. My question is on Programme 1-4(7) – 
<br/>Gender Responsive Budgeting Programme ($50,000).  If the honourable Minister can elaborate on 
<br/>the programme - on this particular subject?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Which programme, is it the same Activity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We are on Programme 1-3(7). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Give me a second, I think you are talking about the Gender 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Responsive Budgeting Programme (GRBP), is that right?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  What  we  have  done,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  like  the  citizen’s 
<br/>budget.    This  allocation  is  to  make  sure  that  across  all  different  Ministries,  this  framework,  this 
<br/>understanding is included.  There are different Ministries which will have allocations for budget to 
<br/>promote gender sensitivity, gender-based activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- If I may ask a supplementary question, it talks about a programme.  Is 
<br/>it a separate reporting of gender-based activities?  Is it a programme that you put it out to the public 
<br/>to understand what kind of budget is given to the public?  I do not understand, can you explain? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The programme is essentially training as well.  So, you have 
<br/></span><span>to  continue  training  and  making  sure  that  there  is  understanding  of  gender-based  budgeting  and 
<br/></span><span>understanding of the budget.  So, that allocation is also part of the training that will be provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-7(7) – Vehicle Management System 
<br/>($50,000).    Can  we  have  some  bit  of  clarification  on  that?    Is  this  for  the  whole  fleet  across 
<br/>Government?  I think it is a new expenditure, I did not see it in previous years. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1199 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are right, it is a new expenditure allocation.  Really, the 
<br/>funding  is  to  cater  for  the  procurement  of  the  vehicle  management  system  for  the  Whole  of 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, there is no online database and no vehicle software to manage both, leased and 
<br/>State-owned vehicles.  Hence, this software will be used to manage both, leased and State-owned 
<br/>vehicles, and we are, sort of, moving towards a paperless system, as well as the provision of advice 
<br/>to executive management in a timely manner. It is also partly to cut down on wastages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The system will be used by Government Fleet Management Unit to manage all Government 
<br/>vehicles.  So, the timely reports on where the vehicles are, who is using it, et cetera, so that we have 
<br/>a  much  better  handle  on  the  use  of  Government  vehicles  both,  leased  and  Government-owned 
<br/>vehicles.  Currently, everything is manual. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-8? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on Programme 1-8(7) - Policy Advisors ($270,000).  
<br/>If the honourable Minister can tell us who these Policy Advisors are, and how many of them will be 
<br/>recruited or used?  Was this provision there in the last Budget, et cetera?  I need more details on this 
<br/>particular expenditure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, when we started with the formulation of 
<br/>the  National  Development  Plan,  we  got  a  Consultant  Policy  Advisor  from  the  World  Bank  -  a 
<br/>Malaysian national.  We did not want one consultant to just come and do the plan, so we hired two 
<br/>local consultants - two Economists who are both Academics.  One was a senior government official 
<br/>before, very experienced in the planning office and was at the Fiji National University (FNU), and 
<br/>the  other  one  was  at  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP).    We  hired  them  temporarily  as 
<br/>Consultants and Policy Advisors through proper expression of interest and procurement.  Both have 
<br/>done a fantastic job in getting the plan ready.  The plan is near finalisation, as I have said already.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once it is done, they will spend, at least, another year to help in the operationalisation of the 
<br/>plan - the implementation, monitoring, and as you know, we have a three-year, five-year and 20-year 
<br/>plan.    So,  in  the  first  three  years,  we  have  said  publicly  that  we  will  be  addressing  the  basics, 
<br/>fundamentally going through, and part of the job would be to also look at how budgets are used, the 
<br/>utilisation and whether these things align with the plans.  It was a very helpful step that we took to 
<br/>get the plan ready. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question on that; these Policy Advisors, do you have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a plan for how long you will need them?  Is it for three years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have said another year.  They were hired for two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  a  supplementary  question  on  the  same  SEG  -
<br/>Programme 1-8(7) – Policy Advisors.  We also give funding to Fiji National University and other 
<br/>universities.  Do you think it will be appropriate, honourable Minister, that we use some of those 
<br/></span><span>Academics who are already part of the university agreement with the Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If you had listened to me carefully, I had precisely said that 
<br/>they are both University Academics, one from FNU and one from USP.  We do not ask Universities 
<br/>to do things free for Government, we hire consultants and invariably in most of the time, Sir, we hire 
<br/>consultants from within local universities as much as possible and sometimes in very rare cases.  I 
<br/>do not know about the previous government but so far, we have not hired any foreign consultant,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unless otherwise it is provided for by development partners to help us and in this particular case, that 
<br/>is what we have done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Sir,  under  Programme  1-8(7),  this  allocation  used  to  be  here  on 
<br/>apprenticeship funds, but it is not here now.  Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics  assure us that if it is not 
<br/>here, then apprenticeship funding is moved to another SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  It  is  moved  to  another  Ministry.  What  we  have  done,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, we did not do much in the last Budget, we kept a lot of ‘R’s, we kept a lot of funding 
<br/>within the Ministry of Finance.  In this Budget, we tried to move as much funding as possible, directly 
<br/>into the Ministries, instead of Ministry of Finance keeping it under ‘R’.  So, as much as possible, we 
<br/>have tried to move it directly to the Ministers so that they can get on  with the job straight away.  
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is still on Progamme 1-8(7) - National 
<br/>Economic Summit.  I see the amount allocated is $50,000, does that mean that you will be having 
<br/>this Summit in one of the schools or community halls? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I think this is a silly question.  We have not 
<br/>decided on the date, otherwise we will be here for three days, asking Government specific operational 
<br/>things, things that we have not actually decided yet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think we will move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-8(7) - National Development Plan ($50,000).  
<br/>Can the honourable Minister elaborate, is this the same national plan which you have failed to launch 
<br/>which you mentioned earlier? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Again,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  mean,  the  pigeon  season  is  over, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>otherwise I would have told them, but you are shooting from the wrong angle, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have said very clearly in the Budget Address and today, in the Right of Reply, that the 
<br/>plan is ready, every Minister has been consulted, it is getting ready to be printed and the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister will launch the plan very soon.   We will invite honourable Nath to be part of that, 
<br/>thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  under  Programme  2-1(7)  -  Employment  and 
<br/>Unemployment Survey.  In the last year’s Budget, you had $2.44 million but this year, there is another 
<br/>$606,597.  Is this just the completion of that or is just the reflection of work that was not done last 
<br/>year. The second question, when can we expect the results of the survey? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Usamate as  a statistician would 
<br/></span><span>understand  that  these  surveys  occur  each  financial  year,  especially  the  Household  Income  and 
<br/></span><span>Expenditure Survey, as well as the Employment and Unemployment Survey, and that is all being 
<br/>done at the moment.  That is why there is an additional allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me, Mr. Chairman, just say that we have empowered the Fiji Bureau of Statistics now to 
<br/>be  an  independent  organisation,  to  be  able  to  do  these  things  timely  and  appropriate  budget  is 
<br/>provided.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1201 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  have  a  question.    It  is  on  Programme  2-1(7)  - 
<br/>Household Income and Expenditure Survey ($2,454,935).  Is it just a one year programme, or you 
<br/>think it is going to spill over to next year?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, as I have said, from all the Household Income 
<br/>and Expenditure Surveys we have had and you would probably know this well, it does not just finish 
<br/>in one year.  It is like over a period of time.  It, sort of, overlaps into the next year, and that is how 
<br/>this will done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am sure, as part of your planning process, you may have budgeted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the total sum that will be used.  So how much are you looking at as a total for this project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Yes,  I  can  give  you  some  details  but  not everything.    The 
<br/>Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  and  the  Employment  and  Unemployment  Survey  are 
<br/>national surveys.  The Employment and Unemployment Survey data is based on 6,000 households 
<br/>from  600  enumeration  areas  from  all  the  four  Divisions.    The  Employment  and  Unemployment 
<br/>Survey is conducted in four rounds in a period of 12 months.  In the same way, the Household Income 
<br/>and Expenditure Survey takes a while.  So, it is not something that you do it in one month or two 
<br/>months.  The sampling process takes time, the actual conduct of the survey, takes time, and you know 
<br/>this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 4  – Ministry of Finance, Strategic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Planning, National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 4 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 5- Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(6)  -  Turaga-ni-Koro  Allowance 
<br/>(2,845,000).  I notice that there is an increase of around $60,000 from the amount that was there last 
<br/>year.  Can this be clarified, what is the reason for that increase and whether all the Turaga-ni-Koro 
<br/>have been paid?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase is because of the additional responsibilities that 
<br/>will be given to the Turaga-ni-Koro.  With the economic empowerment of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, more reporting 
<br/>is going to come from the Turaga-ni-Koro.  With the current allowance that they are given, it is really 
<br/>not enough when you look at the cost of living.  So, we have increased it by $50, so from $150 to 
<br/>$200.  Realistically, on the ground, it is still not enough.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to the payment of Turaga-ni-Koro, we try and get reports from them and that is the 
<br/>cause of the delay because the Turaga-ni-Koro is only nominated by the community. We make sure 
<br/></span><span>that they perform the duty that is given to them before we pay them because it is public funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  on  the  same  SEG,  we  have  the  Centre  for 
<br/>Appropriate Technology and Development (CATD) in Nadave which is a place where a lot of people 
<br/>have undertaken their training over the years.  But I notice that there has been quite a significant drop 
<br/>in their budget of around $300,000. Can we just have some clarification on that?

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- In that allocation, we have allocated $370,000 for their capital projects at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadave.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, it is due to the movement of maintenance and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>special expenditure to SEG 10 also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It moved to a different SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) – Review of Centre for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Appropriate Technology and Development By-Laws ($100,000).  Can I be clarified on this issue?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want the clarification on the bylaws that should be undertaken at
