<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Alvick Maharaj. Oh, he still has not come 
<br/>back from his leave or sick leave, but we bear with him in the struggles that he is undergoing.  I think 
<br/>that is his first child.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Baby girl, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Come again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Baby girl last night.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Oh, baby girl last night.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has a fantastic history. He got married a bit late, that is why.  I am just joking, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament and my fellow Fijians; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and his dedicated staff for the delivery 
<br/>of the Budget for all Fijians. It is a ‘here and now’ budget with an eye for the immediate future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the increase in the budget for the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Arts from $38.7 million to $39.4 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  While the Government considers options for the 2013 Constitution, the UN Declaration on 
<br/>the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) which Fiji now supports, is our framework for action.  It 
<br/>is complemented by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and we are aligning our objectives to 
<br/>it. We want to thrive in this modern world. If the budget trend for our Ministry continues by the end of 
<br/>our current term, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> will be better off than they were when we came into office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Assistant Minister has highlighted the increase in the budget for 
<br/>the  culture  sector. We  are  already  seeing  the  reason  why  it  was  placed  under  our  Ministry. We  will 
<br/>develop Fiji's first National Art Gallery. We will restore the Levuka World Heritage Property. We will 
<br/>recognise the contribution of every ethnic group in Fiji through arts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I will outline some other key programmes in our budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been resourced to implement the GCC Review Report.  This includes a standalone legislation.  The GCC 
<br/>will continue to lead the iTaukei Administration.  With its revamped focus, it will enhance and strengthen 
<br/>the development of the iTaukei economy. We must quantify our contribution to the economy, and we 
<br/>will approach this with lessons learnt from past mistakes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, earlier, I had touched on UNDRIP.  We have developed a National Action Plan 
<br/>which Provincial Council Meetings have overwhelmingly endorsed.  Several legislations could be 
<br/>reviewed to localise UNDRIP. This important work is recognised in our budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last year, the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) and Cabinet endorsed a framework 
<br/>to improve the livelihoods of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Rotumans through economic empowerment. As part of the 
<br/>framework, support will be provided to Provincial Council companies and resource owners.  I am 
<br/>pleased to announce that Provincial Council companies and resource owners will be assisted under 
<br/>the $3 million allocation - </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Resource Owners Support and Development Fund.  This is an 
<br/>interest subsidy allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, funding has been provided for Provincial Economic Units.  The purpose of these 
<br/>Units is to drive economic activities and enhance market access. Market access is the issue for our 
<br/>community.  To assist our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community, we will, again, convene the iTaukei Resource Owners 
<br/>Forum this year, which has been funded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  must  not  underestimate  the  ability  of  the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>  to  resolve  the  pressing 
<br/>problems  upon  us  -  the  invasion  of  hard  drugs.  If  we  strengthen  </span><span>vanua</span><span>  governance,  it  could 
<br/>significantly address the problems that now confront us.  To assist in this regard, the iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Lands 
<br/>and Fisheries Commission’s budget has been increased by $1 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  a  good  education  is  the  shortest  way  out  of  poverty  and  our  latest  village 
<br/>profiling data confirms this. Education is a pillar of poverty alleviation. This year, we convened the 
<br/>first ever Provincial Education Forum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provincial Council Chairpersons and Chairpersons of Education Committees met to discuss 
<br/>the status of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> education and map a way forward. An outcome of that forum was to further 
<br/>investigate the cause of primary and high school dropouts and how they can be better supported. We 
<br/>will do that through the 2024-2025 Budget with an allocation of $300,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Village Improvement Scheme will continue with another allocation of $2 
<br/>million. Our focus will be on sanitation and village beautification.  We have also seen the need to 
<br/>transform two villages as a modern tourist villages. We will work on this in coordination with the 
<br/>Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we will continue to implement the National Action Plan on reducing violence 
<br/>against women and girls. Breaking through the traditional setting is not easy but we want a fair deal 
<br/>for our women, and we will ensure that the message of reducing violence is conveyed appropriately.  
<br/>The allocation for this has been provided in the budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  our  budgetary  allocations  and  initiatives  are  geared  towards  driving 
<br/></span><span>transformative change within our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities through economic empowerment, preserving 
<br/>culture  and  heritage,  promoting  education  and  holistic  wellbeing,  empowering  villages  and 
<br/>developing visionary youth leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increased funding for the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission, iTaukei Affairs Board, 
<br/>the  Department  of  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  the  establishment  of  the  Provincial  Economic

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development  Unit will  significantly  support  sustainable  economic  development  and  enhance  the 
<br/>welfare and prosperity of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei Resource Owners Forum will facilitate access to natural resources, while the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resource  Owners  Support  and  Development  Fund  will  provide  a  vital  injection  of  interest 
<br/>subsidy. Coupled with  measures  enabling sustainable development  of  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land and resources, 
<br/>these initiatives unlock unprecedented economic opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  preserving  our  culture  and  heritage  is  a  cornerstone  of  our  agenda. Our 
<br/>experience with the Melanesian Arts and Culture Festival last year and the Festival of Pacific Arts 
<br/>and Culture this year has heightened the importance of this agenda.  Efforts by the iTaukei Lands 
<br/>and Fisheries Commission to safeguard ancestral land and waters, the revitalization of customs and 
<br/>leadership  roles  through  the  confirmation  of  traditional  titles, and  the  promotion  of  language, 
<br/>traditions and identity via cultural programmes will ensure our rich legacy endures for generations 
<br/>to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, initiatives aimed at promoting education and holistic wellbeing are equally 
<br/>vital. Bridging  educational  gaps  will  be  addressed  through  village-level  awareness  campaigns  on 
<br/>integrating  formal  and  informal  learning  pathways. Furthermore,  the  exploration  of  sustainable 
<br/>indigenous  tourism opportunities  will  showcase  the  unique  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  culture  to  the  world  while 
<br/>creating economic prospects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the story of the iTaukei is more than a tale of challenges we 
<br/>have endured, and in our future, we must strive for more than just making do. Our budget reflects 
<br/>our highest aspirations - it continues our step in the right direction which is to develop the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>economy and make the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> primary beneficiaries in their natural resources.  We will forge a new 
<br/>economy and a new generation of prosperity to make the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> prosperous and equipped to take 
<br/>on the challenges of the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 2024-2025 Budget. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  my  fellow  Fijians;  thank  you,  Sir,  for  the 
<br/>opportunity to be able to contribute to this debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to start off, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by thanking you also for your leadership and decision 
<br/>that has allowed me to be here today as an Independent Member of Parliament. I assure you, Sir, that 
<br/>I do not take this privilege of continuing to serve in Parliament lightly and will perform it to the very 
<br/>best of my ability and my convictions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  putting  together  a  budget  is  a  massive  and  a  critical  undertaking,  so  I 
<br/>congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics for the second budget which he has been responsible for. I also 
<br/>congratulate the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his staff for their hard work, and their very 
<br/></span><span>useful presentation and interactions they had with us in Opposition Chambers last week. I also want 
<br/></span><span>you to know, honourable Minister and the staff, that I appreciate the additional parts of the Budget 
<br/>Supplement Booklet that we had this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also would like to congratulate the new Attorney-General, honourable Graham Leung on 
<br/>his appointment. I have appreciated the tenor of his maiden address, it has been a breath of fresh air, a 
<br/>fragrant aroma.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1163 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also congratulate my Nakasi neighbour, honourable Alitia Bainivalu, for her appointment 
<br/>as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, and wish her well in the enormous responsibility accorded to 
<br/>her.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many things to be thankful for in this Budget, and I would like to 
<br/>highlight a few of these.  The people of Fiji are battling high inflation that has been bought about 
<br/>initially by the global forces, but which were then fanned into a frenzy, became a ferocious hurricane 
<br/>by the decision of this Government to raise VAT by 66 percent last year.  The impact on our people 
<br/>has been catastrophic, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For that reason, I am glad to see that the raising of the National Minimum Wage to $4.50, and 
<br/>then to $5 an hour, and I also understand that the Sectoral Minimum Wage will also be increased by 
<br/>the same quantum, and civil servants pay will also increase.  All of these will help people to ride the 
<br/>waves with the high cost of living that this Government is largely responsible for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the decision by Government to set aside up to $52 million for the FNPF 
<br/>Pensioners, whose pensions were reduced, has been applauded widely. This is welcomed, respite for 
<br/>the pensioners who receive their payments, and I am glad for them and their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the payment is being made by Government out of taxpayers’ funds, and not 
<br/>out of FNPF funds.  This validates that initial decision taken to amend the FNPF pension levels, to 
<br/>ensure the sustainability of FNPF.  Without that reform, FNPF would be in a dire situation right now 
<br/>and would go head over heels by the year 2050, meaning that future pensioners would not benefit 
<br/>from it. The decision by the then Government took guts and gumption. This Government must be 
<br/>willing to do the same when it is required to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- A tough decision! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- For Vatukoula, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Government will provide payments 
<br/>to the Vatukoula Gold Miners who had been strike for 30 years. This payment is substantive and is 
<br/>also being paid from taxpayers’ funds.  I am sure it will come in very handy for the gold miners and 
<br/>their families.  There is a danger, however, Sir, that others will use this as a precedence for future 
<br/>unresolved industrial disputes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is your mess, that is why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is yours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  glad  to  see  that  all  the  measures  that  were 
<br/>innovatively  implemented  by  then  FijiFirst  Government,  continued  to  be  implemented.    These 
<br/>include all the social wages, despite with some minor tweaking by this Government.  This includes 
<br/></span><span>the  Free  Education,  the  enhanced  Social  Welfare  payments,  free  water,  electricity  for  the  needy, 
<br/></span><span>school bus fares, back to school assistance, et cetera.  So, thank you for continuing to do what was 
<br/>started from the people from this side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for reducing fiscal duty on prefabricated 
<br/>buildings to  5 percent  and for reinstating zero duty  on materials,  and committing to  establish the

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Services Ombudsman, a great move. I also appreciate the allocation for constructing gas 
<br/>crematoriums in major districts around Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budgetary Concerns:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst in Opposition, the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics was 
<br/>forever deriding the then Government about the nominal debt values.  As soon as he got into office, 
<br/>he increased those debt levels to record levels.  The honourable Leader of the Opposition has itemised 
<br/>in detail the Debt to GDP ratios that we have had in Fiji from 2006 to 2019, clearly showing that we 
<br/>kept it to below 50 percent in the immediate period before COVID-19 struck. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reduction in post-COVID-19 Debt to GDP ratio has been far too slow.  
<br/>Why?  Because of Government’s poor choices.  They could have helped to reduce it further by getting 
<br/>rid of highly bloated operating expenditure.  One example, every person on that side, including two 
<br/>on this side, is either a Minister or Assistant Minister (including honourable Ravu), with vehicles, 
<br/>staff, offices, bloated travel expenses, bloated expenditure everywhere, hugely bloated operational 
<br/>expenditure, unheard of in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- If they had been able to control that, they could have helped push the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget deficit remains alarmingly high, posing significant risks to our economy stability. 
<br/>While the Government  has made lofty promises,  it has not  presented a viable plan to  reduce this 
<br/>deficit.  Borrowing to finance current expenditures without a clear repayment strategy will only lead 
<br/>to further financial strain on future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics said he had to raise VAT in order to pay for 
<br/>the debts.  In other words, that he had to raise the cost of living so that Government debts could be 
<br/>paid.  Guess what, Sir, no debts have been paid off.  The stock of debt continues to increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inflation has been at the record level.  It hit 7.1 percent in April - a 10-year record. Now, they 
<br/>are talking about 5.7 percent, but there are others who are arguing about the high cost of living which 
<br/>is being felt hardest by the worse off in our society.  That is who you are attacking – the worse off in 
<br/>our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs growth, and good effective investment in infrastructure helps to 
<br/>build that growth.  Government is providing very little or no expenditure on new infrastructure in 
<br/>this Budget.  Government is only and largely providing funding to preserve what is already in place.  
<br/>The  new  infrastructure  is  coming  through  our  development  partners  and  I  thank  them  for  their 
<br/></span><span>assistance in that area.  They are funding new infrastructure that will contribute to GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, slow implementation of projects by some Ministries and Departments that 
<br/>are part of the Executive – meaning you are supposed to execute and do or deliver things, has led to 
<br/>underspent  budgets.    This  inefficiency  not  only  hampers  economic  growth,  but  also  undermines 
<br/>public trust in Government.  When allocated funds are not utilised effectively, essential services and 
<br/>infrastructure projects are delayed, directly impacting the quality of life of the citizens of this country.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1165 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics replied to Written Question No. 74/2024 on the status of budget usage at 
<br/>the end of Parliament, which is posted on the Parliament website and reported that $42 million was 
<br/>vired out of capital expenditure.  Why?  Lack of execution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government’s total execution was at 40 percent at the end of June, 
<br/>according to his report.  For the Rice Development Project of $600,000, there was zero utilisation, 
<br/>according to his report.  For the $2.5 million budgetted for jetty infrastructure, only 37 percent was 
<br/>used - very, very poor execution.  Executives are supposed to execute, that is what you are there for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics did his job by allocating funds, the question 
<br/>is, did the Ministers and their executive team led by the Permanent Secretaries effectively deliver 
<br/>these  commitments?    This  is  the  result  you  get  when  merit-based  appointments  are  replaced  by 
<br/>political  appointments, rewarding those who helped them in  their  campaign.    It  is  the public that 
<br/>bears the brunt of the Government’s failure to implement the Budget and deliver the outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism has been doing well this year.  However, there is a significant drop 
<br/>in forward bookings till the end of the year, when compared to last year.  This is a concern.  Are we 
<br/>outpricing ourselves for our key Australian market – mum, dad and the children? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism arrivals from Australia – our main source of tourists, has been flat, and now tourism 
<br/>levels have been sustained by other source markets.  It is possible that increasing the departure tax to 
<br/>$200, coupled with a relative high cost of Food and Beverage and accommodation, will reduce our 
<br/>tourism arrivals, especially from the more budget conscious markets.  We need to protect and nurture 
<br/>tourism, and not stop the flow of the economic lifeblood it has provided us with in these past three 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of talk about diversification, but we are not seeing a targetted 
<br/>approach to achieving that.  Investment Fiji reports that there are 39 projects at construction stage in 
<br/>Fiji worth $1.2 billion.  Sir, 34 of those projects, worth $1.22 billion, are in tourism services and real 
<br/>estate. The remaining six projects are in wholesale, retail and manufacturing.  There is very little 
<br/>investment in other sectors that we need to diversify to.  Why?  Because there is no focussed approach 
<br/>to develop diversification into other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Private sector improvement and value addition is critical and is generally lacking, Sir.  The 
<br/>Government’s decision to  write off student debts  in  the last Budget has cost  over $600 million  – 
<br/>directly equating the current budget deficit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Converting the Student Loan Scheme to Scholarship is not sustainable for a small economy 
<br/>like ours.  Even larger  economies, like Australia, continue to  maintain a loan scheme  for  tertiary 
<br/>education.  The reality is that many graduates are now sitting at home without jobs and many more 
<br/>will join them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Budget, the Government has imposed penalties for forfeiting bonds, if they wish to 
<br/></span><span>seek opportunities offshore.  How does this help our graduates, or the economy?  It creates a burden 
<br/></span><span>on the very individuals whom we should be supporting to drive our nation forward.  We give them 
<br/>scholarships, they graduate in numbers, but there is no demand for jobs, as the private sector, which 
<br/>we refer to as the engine for economic growth, is not creating enough employment opportunities, 
<br/>resulting in high unemployment.  So, in fact, these students get frustrated and look at opportunities 
<br/>abroad.  It is ironic that we bond them, but we cannot assure jobs for them, Sir.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in the labour market, we have a very tight labour market with shortage of skilled workers 
<br/>and professionals. At the same time, the Reserve Bank of Fiji has noted that there is decline in job 
<br/>advertisements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, I am very happy to see that there is a lot of focus on apprenticeship and 
<br/>skill development, I am very glad for that.  But what worries me is why this Government has decided 
<br/>to reduce its grant to the Fiji National University (FNU), our very own University. Government has 
<br/>been ready to dish out grants to the University of the South Pacific (USP), even though I understand 
<br/>that USP has more than  $150 million  cash sitting in  its coffers.  And on top of that, it decides to 
<br/>increase the grant to Pacific Polytech to $5 million.  There is nothing that Pacific Polytech does that 
<br/>is not done by FNU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU has graduated more than 45,000 people from 2010 to 2023.  It provides 
<br/>vocational education and skills training.  It has been conducting training in rural remote areas since 
<br/>2012, and in the year 2023 alone, the National Training and Productivity Centre issued more than 
<br/>14,000 certificates for short courses.  They graduated more than 2,500 people with degrees and 1,300 
<br/>through Technical and Vocational Education and Training programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU is our own institution, a key player in Fiji’s development with a long-
<br/>proven record.  It has received growing records internationally for its own contribution to SDG, yet 
<br/>Government is giving FNU short shrift, and has leaned over backwards for Pacific Polytech right 
<br/>from day one, even before the 2023-2024 budget was put to them.  What is going on? The FNU is 
<br/>delivering, so why are you diverting funds from USP into a private institution?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are no initiatives to stop the exodus of skills and professionals.  We 
<br/>are  resigned  to  the  fact  that  these  gaps  will  be  fulfilled  by  Bangladesh,  Indonesia  and  Philippine 
<br/>nationals, but applications to get them here takes time.  In the meantime, our private sectors suffers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our brightest minds are leaving the country in search for better opportunities abroad.  This 
<br/>braindrain  is  detrimental  to  our  development.    We  need  policies  that  retain  talent,  that  provide 
<br/>adequate remuneration and create that conducive environment for professions to thrive in our own 
<br/>country.    For  this  to  happen,  we  need  a  vibrant  private  sector  and  a  conducive  investment 
<br/>environment, and that is what this Government needs to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, Fiji needs Government to do well.  I need Government to do 
<br/>well.  Everyone on this side needs Government to do well.  We all need it.  We want you to do well.  
<br/>You determine the way forward, and in my current capacity as an independent Member of Parliament, 
<br/>I am prepared to support the honourable Prime Minister and support the Government on issues that 
<br/>are being brought up by Government that I believe are in the best interests of this country.  But I will 
<br/>fight against and oppose anything that I believe does not address our needs as against the best interests 
<br/>of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While this Budget has a lot of very good aspects, there are also many underlying weaknesses, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and it is for that reason that I cannot fully support this Budget.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, I also acknowledge those who are sitting in 
<br/>the gallery and those watching through livestream from the comforts of their homes;  I rise today in 
<br/>this august Parliament to lend my full support to the 2024-2025 National Budget.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1167 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  begin  by  congratulating  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, and 
<br/>his team for their outstanding work in stabilising Government debt and prudent financial, fiscal and 
<br/>economic management after inheriting a debt of 90 percent of GDP from the previous Government 
<br/>or the previous Administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can note here the distinction between someone 
<br/>who is a professor in economics preparing a national budget for a government, and someone who 
<br/>does not possess these attributes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is commendable that Fiji’s debt has now fallen to less than 80 percent, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with a targetted projection to reach 78 percent of the GDP at the end of July 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year’s Budget Address is not merely a financial plan but a roadmap that 
<br/>aligns our aspirations with the global mandate of sustainable development and resilience.  Through 
<br/>the  foresight  of  the  current  Coalition  Government  under  the  steadfast,  sound  and  consultative 
<br/>leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, together, we can embark on a journey to ensure that our 
<br/>rural and maritime communities thrive, and our disaster management efforts set benchmarks for local 
<br/>and regional excellence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the global level, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a 
<br/>universal call for action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all the people enjoy peace 
<br/>and prosperity by 2030.  As signatory to this ambitious agenda, our commitment resonates across 
<br/>borders, emphasising our role in achieving sustainable development both, locally and as part of the 
<br/>regional and global community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regionally,  our  priorities  are  shaped  by  the  unique  challenges  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunities presented by our geographical context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the announced 2024-2025 Budget is also a roadmap that aligns our national 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment priorities to the collective regional strategic pathways to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthen governance which will, in turn, improve economic viability for all Government 
<br/>initiatives, targeting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and promote peace 
<br/>and security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Promote  inclusion  and  equity  by  investing  in  the  empowerment  of  women  and  the 
<br/>promotion of women’s rights and promoting the anticipation of women in leadership. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Enhance  data-informed  decision-making  through  education,  research  and  technology  to 
<br/>revitalise  our  MSMEs  sector,  strengthen  tourism,  empower  Fiji  citizens  and  guide 
<br/>Government policy work to better address poverty and the high cost of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through partnership and collaboration, the Coalition Government, in their 
<br/>wisdom, have empowered us with the resources to leverage regional strengths to address common 
<br/></span><span>challenges, such as climate change, natural disasters and economic disparities.  By working together, 
<br/></span><span>we create synergies that amplify the impact of our efforts and contribute to regional stability and 
<br/>prosperity and, consequently, better secure our own national security and stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the foresight of the Coalition Government in producing a 
<br/>budget that also actualises our beloved nation’s commitment to the regional priorities outlined in the 
<br/>2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.  This will, in turn, enhance the faith of our development

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partners, in the capacity of our beloved nation, to deliver as the regional  hub, to take lead on the 
<br/>achievement of the SDGs in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  national  level,  the  2024-2025  Budget  reflects  the  Government’s 
<br/>commitment to a transformative change in rural and maritime development and disaster management.  
<br/>I must acknowledge, Sir, that this Budget is more than a fiscal plan - it is a blueprint for building 
<br/>resilient communities, enhancing infrastructure and promoting economic opportunities in our rural 
<br/>and maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  capacity  as  the  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and the Coalition 
<br/>Government, for prioritising some areas that I would like to highlight: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Allocation of $2 million to the Ministry for our Community Access Roads, Footpaths and 
<br/>Footbridges  (CARFF),  to  continue  to  help  our  rural  communities’  infrastructure 
<br/>development to improve connectivity and accessibility, and ensure our contribution to SDG 
<br/>9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Assisting our communities in sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and small businesses, to 
<br/>stimulate local economies and create sustainable livelihoods through the $1 million budget 
<br/>for the Ministry’s Self-Help Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these priorities are integral to our vision of a prosperous and resilient nation 
<br/>where every citizen can thrive.  The honourable Minister for Finance rightly stated that the 2024-
<br/>2025  Budget  is  centred  around  the  vision  of  “security,  stability  and  sustainability”,  focusing  on 
<br/>improving the fundamentals of our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increased  investment  to  improve  our  health  infrastructure,  increased 
<br/>funding to reshape our education sector, decisive investment incentives to encourage investors and 
<br/>improve efficiency, and increased public private partnerships, is noteworthy.  The Ministry has been 
<br/>liaising with development partners, such as the Pacific Centre for Peacebuilding, who are actively 
<br/>enlightening  our  communities  and  institutions  with  upskilling  in  conflict  resolution  to  improve 
<br/>governance.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through the Governance for 
<br/>Resilient Development in the Pacific (Gove4Res) initiative and the United Nations Population Fund 
<br/>(UNFPA), through their exemplary support in the Northern Division are, but a few of the partnerships 
<br/>that this Coalition Government has supported to-date with a centred vision on improving livelihoods 
<br/>and empowering our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, no man is an island and the announcement that the Government will 
<br/>continue to fund our District Advisory Councillors proves just that.  The Government cannot work 
<br/>independently  and  needs  the  support  and  trust  of  the  people  of  Fiji  for  holistic  economic 
<br/>development.  As alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, “We must hear all views, this is the way 
<br/>for true nation building and inclusive development, to build consensus on sustainable progress and 
<br/>unity.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the setting up of a Pilot Tourism MSME fund of $15,000 will empower our 
<br/>rural  communities  to  innovate  their  natural  resource  environment  for  job  creation  and  income 
<br/>generation to  not  only  enable sustainable management of their natural  resources, but  that of their 
<br/>rural  livelihoods  as  well.    People  in  the  rural  areas  very  much  appreciate  the  effort  by  the 
<br/>Government, especially the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Finance for 
<br/>their support to the sugar industry which the rural areas are very much dependent on.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Permanent  Secretary  and  Management  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development for the work undertaken this financial year.  A special 
<br/>acknowledgement  to  the  four  Divisional  Commissioners  for  their  active  roles  in  spearheading 
<br/>development in the Divisions through the Integrated Rural Development Framework.  This year, we 
<br/>received  $3  million  in  our  budget  for  our  Rural  and  Outer  Island  (ROI)  programme.    Of  that 
<br/>allocation, we managed to complete 22 projects.  One of the projects, is the road that links the interior 
<br/>of Saqani from Nasasa to Nadogo, Valevoni, Nacula and Lakeba, which was undertaken through this 
<br/>budgetary provision.  I only hope that we were in Government for the last 16 years, we would have 
<br/>opened up all the areas that are still to be developed.  I hope that this budget will continue to be given 
<br/>to the Ministry and we will continue to build more roads for our people in our rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to render my full support to the National Budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen in the public gallery and to all those who are watching 
<br/>this proceedings on live platform; firstly, I would like to congratulate honourable Bainivalu in her 
<br/>appointment as Minister for Fisheries and Forests, and I thank our colleague, honourable Ravu, for 
<br/>his service as Minister. Of course, he will continue to serve the people of Fiji with his know-how and 
<br/>skillset, and unwavering commitment to  the Coalition Government.   Secondly,  I congratulate the 
<br/>Attorney-General,  honourable  Graham  Leung,  in  his  appointment  as  the  Chief  Legal  Adviser  to 
<br/>Government and Cabinet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, every once in a while, a generation of people and, for our purpose, a group 
<br/>of leaders, would be called upon to a time of nation rebuilding, resetting and revisioning.  They would 
<br/>be called upon to congregate around a fresh new vision for a better country.  They would be required 
<br/>to rally around a new set of ideals that would have an impact on the lives of our nation’s citizens now 
<br/>and, most importantly, in the future.  That future already has a mortgage on it in our children’s name.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is upon us now.  In saying that, I salute the nine Independent 
<br/>Members who have shown support to the honourable Prime Minister.  When I say anything about 
<br/>the Opposition in this contribution, it excludes the nine Members who are, for all intents and purpose 
<br/>of this speech, a part of Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is time to rebuild the political, economic and social landscapes of our nation 
<br/>for  those  who  will  come  after  us.  It  is  time  to  rehash,  rethink  together  as  leaders,  collectively  as 
<br/>representatives of voters, who thought it prudent to put us here in the first place.  Let us validate their 
<br/>hope and aspirations, and hand them a Fiji that they can enjoy and continue to call home, and God 
<br/>willing, for many generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The statement of the honorable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Finance 
<br/>cannot be clearer for the future. We need a budget that speaks truth to the citizens of our nation now 
<br/>and sets a stage for growth, bringing equity into the economy that we can all participate in into the 
<br/>future. Some critics on the other side (excluding the nine), claim that it lacks glamour, colour and 
<br/></span><span>high ending statements.  Whilst they are entitled to such opinions, Mr. Speaker, this year’s Budget, 
<br/></span><span>in my view, seeks to do a few things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  it  seeks  to  salvage  the  nation  from  a  one  and  a  half  decade  long  of  poor  fiscal 
<br/>management and its impacts, bloated economic numbers, fragile investment environment, targeted 
<br/>persecutions  and  unsustainable  programmes,  that  has  created  an  extremely  unhealthy  economic 
<br/>environment,  unconducive  for  future  growth.    Empowerment  programmes  for  self-sufficiency, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monitoring of the Government expenditure to gauge efficacy of the public dollar, encouragement to 
<br/>entice new industries and innovation to bring employment were all drawn downwards in favor of the 
<br/>much easier but much costlier hand-to-mouth policies of the previous Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, it realises that the GDP-to-debt ratio must come down and must continue to come 
<br/>down for the next decade for stability, provide more latitude for Government to spend on growth 
<br/>areas that will energise the economic environment for contextual investment, targeted assistance and 
<br/>making Fiji a country that can attract large investments of the world.  Much of the noise from the 
<br/>loyalists  have  been  in  no  programmes,  no  incentives,  no  new  infrastructure,  et  cetera.  As  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications said to me in passing yesterday, “they spent 
<br/>like a wounded bull in the last decade that resulted in very limited fiscal space to move post-election.”  
<br/>That is true.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, </span><span>Google </span><span>is here, large BPOs are coming, large farming companies are now doing 
<br/>their due diligence before they put shovel to ground, new hotel ventures are in the horizon, and as 
<br/>announced  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications on Monday, 8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024, $6.25 billion of investment is 
<br/>in the immediate forecast.  This is what economic prudence and discipline in governance does in only 
<br/>18 months.  It brings investor confidence back to the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  employment  that  will  be  generated  by  these  investments.    The 
<br/>Lyndhurst Kalabu Project, for example, will alone bring about 10,000 to 15,000 direct employment 
<br/>when  all  the  project  phases  are  completed.    That  is  a  Government  that  is  giving  confidence  to 
<br/>investment. That is a Government that is giving confidence to young Fijians, a job launching pad to 
<br/>begin a career, get married, raise a family and prosper right here at home.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It must not be forgotten, Mr. Speaker, that this Government is 18 months old, and we are 
<br/>doing the best we can within means.  The previous government and its founding platform ruled Fiji 
<br/>for 16 years. We are just at the surface level of repairing our economy and reigniting Fiji that was 
<br/>built by our founding fathers pre- and post-independence democracy.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst much has been accomplished, Mr. Speaker, much more needs to be done. We are not 
<br/>flushed with funds as a nation so we all must work within our means. Working within means was 
<br/>something  that  the  Bainimarama  Government  did  not  have  in  its  dictionary  for  the  last  16  years.  
<br/>They overspent easily between $1 billion to $2 billion during their tenure in office, and that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is irresponsible governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition have talked about natural disasters and global pandemic as the shocks in our 
<br/>progress as a nation.  Let me remind them of the most devastating disaster and a phenomenon more 
<br/>damaging  than  COVID-19  that  was  pushed  on  the  people  of  Fiji  as  early  as  2006  -    a  two-men 
<br/>government  and their much-proclaimed leaders.   That  two-men government  gave  Fiji  the highest 
<br/>debt a single government has given us since all the governments put together post-Independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- They gave Fiji a warped political party registration law that 
<br/>they are now paying for it.  In 2014, they cooked the economic books, they realigned the statistician 
<br/>to change the baseline and therefore change the numbers.  No wonder, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that by 2018, 
<br/>there  was  a  huge  confusion  between  the  GDP  and  the  </span><span>dinau</span><span>  by  the  previous  Prime  Minister.   
<br/>Speaking of </span><span>dinau, </span><span>a few hundreds of thousands of dollars is still yet to be paid by the de-registered

<br/>enough.

<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Prove it here, prove it here! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  We  are  doing  everything  a  responsible  government  will  do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within its means.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps on the other side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the honourable Members may not have 
<br/>maths as their best subject.  In this year’s Budget, $410 million is in direct assistance.  In addition to 
<br/>that, we have also included the 22 zero-rated items on VAT and, of course, the prescribed medicine. 
<br/>We have increased salaries for the civil servants, as well as upping the minimum wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the sugar industry this year, the last payment was $101.08, the largest ever in the history 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the sugar industry in Fiji; the largest ever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this year been allocated $36.5 million; that is an increase of $6.4 million from the previous year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  The  budget  increase  will  continue  to  allow  the  Ministry  to 
<br/>enhance its commitment and fulfil its roles to effectively and efficiently administer and regulate land 
<br/>and the mineral resources sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Ministry of Lands, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also I may have to say this before my time is up, 
<br/>to the people   who may not have had a good run with my Ministry and the staff of the Ministry this 
<br/>year, I stand here as the responsible Minister to ask for your forgiveness. We will work towards our 
<br/>collective effort to make sure that our service delivery in the next financial year is better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I hope so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government’s Budget may not be filled 
<br/>with fancy words of the previous government’s budget, but we know is that it is attending to the 
<br/>everyday-need of Fijians, especially those who live farther away from the main urban centres and the 
<br/>peri–urban centres of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  run  out  of  time,  I  fully  support  the  Budget  presented  by  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Finance.   I thank his  team  at  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  of  Finance  -  the  Permanent  Secretary,  Director  Budget  and  the  entire  budget  team.  </span><span>Me

<div><span>The first one is that when we resume, I will be calling upon the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to make 
<br/>his Right of Reply, that is, the reply to all that have been raised in the debate that you have participated 
<br/>in,  honourable  Members.    It  will  be  an  uninterrupted  speech  as  is  the  tradition  and  this  has  been 
<br/>approved by the Business Standing Committee as well, so he can speak for as long as he likes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one is that the Secretariat would like to inform you, honourable Members, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Medical Team is at Level 2 in Parliament precincts, willing to undertake checkup, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Blood pressure! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Well, it is bound to affect a lot of pressure because of the Budget.  You will 
<br/>gain some, you will lose some, that is the way it goes.  Those are the two announcements that I would 
<br/>like to make from the Chair and enjoy your tea.  We will resume when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.12 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  Assistant  Ministers  and 
<br/>Members of Parliament; I rise to provide my Right of Reply to the 2024-2025 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two days, I have listened carefully, I did not try to interject as 
<br/>much as I wanted to, but I have listened carefully to all the contributions coming from both sides of 
<br/>Parliament,  and  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  all  my  colleagues  on  the 
<br/>Government  side  for  their  contributions.    I  also  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  and  all  the  Independent  Members,  who  came  out  in  support  of  the  Budget  and  many 
<br/>others who were more balanced, showed some creativity, and I cannot say the same about few of the 
<br/>loyalists on the other side, but it does so, Mr. Speaker, that when we have the freedom to speak, we 
<br/>unleash creativity thinking and we do things in a more honest way, if there is no compulsion and 
<br/>there is no fear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is very welcomed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as a government, we are very proud that we 
<br/>have provided that environment in the country, the confidence for our people, for investors and for 
<br/>everyone to speak their mind, to criticise the Government and to move the country forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was an interesting observation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, made by honourable Kirpal  in  his 
<br/>contribution.  He said to the fact that in the previous government, Cabinet Ministers would get to see 
<br/>the budget an hour before the Budget Address.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, as a Government and, again, I 
<br/>want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership, where our budget formulation, as I 
<br/>have said, takes a very thorough process at the Permanent Secretary level, at individual ministerial 
<br/>level, with the Minister for Finance, the Cabinet Sub-Committee, culminating in the whole budget 
<br/>being approved by Cabinet before the Budget Address in Parliament.  That, Sir, is a very transparent 
<br/>open engaging process that we have formulated in both, our first and second Budget, and I have no 
<br/>doubt that, that will be the case as we move into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, formulating a national budget is not an easy task, especially in the midst of 
<br/>a large public debt which constraints your ability to fix infrastructure and public services that had 
<br/>been neglected for many years.  The gaps are even tougher, if you also inherit an economy that is 
<br/>recovering from a major economic setback, not only because of poor management, but because of 
<br/>events, like COVID-19, with the need for fiscal support to protect the fragile economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, governments, as you know very well, can only spend what they collect from 
<br/>taxes and other forms of revenue, as well as what they can borrow. Both taxes and borrowed money 
<br/>do not come cheap.  Therefore, it is important that governments make the best use of these taxpayer 
<br/>resources  where  it  gives  the  highest  return,  and  that  involves  making  tough  decisions  and  policy 
<br/>trade-offs, and at most times, choosing what is economically correct and physically responsible rather 
<br/>than for short-term political survival.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, giving the critical role of government to provide essential services, it is 
<br/>important that the government is well funded.  Otherwise, we have seen over several years that the 
<br/></span><span>Government actually did not have enough money to fix our hospitals, improve our roads, solve our 
<br/></span><span>water woes, clean our drainages, rescue our deteriorating public assets and pay our civil  servants 
<br/>well.  We may well have this situation for the future, until we fix and until we have growth, that we 
<br/>are able to build more fiscal spaces.  That is exactly what we have done in the last two Budgets, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we ensured that Government is well funded to not only fix public infrastructure and 
<br/>services, but to contain our fiscal deficit and put our public debt on a downward trajectory.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know a lot has been said about Government debt and I know the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition tried to weave and find his own explanation and put a positive picture of what might have 
<br/>happened before, but the reality of the matter as they say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have earlier said, 
<br/>Fiji’s debt to GDP ratio peaked  at around 90 percent of GDP in July 2022, rising from 53 percent in 
<br/>2006.  By the end of July 2024, we would have brought down the debt to GDP ratio to 78 percent - 
<br/>a reduction of 12 percentage point in just 18 months, and they have talked about how we have done 
<br/>in 18 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, in his very 
<br/>excellent contribution, said that in 18 months, we can only do so much, and he said how much we 
<br/>have done in 18 months.  This was not an easy feat but a great achievement for us, as a nation, putting 
<br/>a path or foundation for a downward trajectory into our debt to GDP ratio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even more importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the fiscal reforms in the last Budget, we have 
<br/>fixed  our  revenue  problem  and  brought  fiscal  deficits  under  control  from  the  double-digit  levels, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, prior to us getting into Government.  This means that as the 
<br/>economy grows, our debt to GDP ratio will continue on a downward path.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to continue on this course, and this is not a problem 
<br/>that can be fixed in a year or two.  We need to be committed to a fiscal plan for, at least, the next 
<br/>decade.  So, what we are doing, Sir, we are not thinking that we are going to be in the Government 
<br/>for the next one decade or two decades as some used to think, we are setting honestly and clearly the 
<br/>path for the next decade whoever is in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The political will and national commitment to get our debt problem under control has been 
<br/>commended,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  international  agencies,  financial  institutions,  like  the  IMF  and 
<br/>World Bank, credit rating agencies and all our development partners.  So, we have a very good tick, 
<br/>and that provides the confidence to our investors, foreign investors and everyone else that is looking 
<br/>at Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been talked about on VAT.  I have heard some of the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition Members and most of the loyalists, asking why we are not reducing VAT...   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The real Opposition, not the loyalists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …that reducing VAT is not an option.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That will become very clear in the passage of time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  worried  when  honourable  Opposition  Members,  like 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar, honourable Chand, honourable Ketan Lal and others, are proposing that 
<br/>we reduce VAT from 15 percent to 9 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are forgetting conveniently that they were part of a leadership when 
<br/></span><span>the VAT rate was 15 percent with no exemption.  It was the push by the Opposition which is now in 
<br/>Government, that we forced them after the 2014 General Election to reduce the VAT.  They reduced 
<br/>the VAT, but they did not have zero VAT on basic food items.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they changed it to three rates - they had 15 percent, 9 percent and 
<br/>zero percent, and none of them in their contribution on VAT talked about what was there before.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1175 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plus, Sir, none of them mentioned that this Government kept the zero rate on VAT and on food items, 
<br/>and we added prescribed medicine with 22 items VAT free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  tell  honourable  Premila  Kumar  that  if  we  reduce  VAT  from  15 
<br/>percent to 9 percent, we will lose $600 million in revenue.  For every 1 percent reduction in VAT, 
<br/>we lose about $100 million in tax revenue.  The question is, how are you going to compensate for 
<br/>this, honourable Kumar?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You did not collect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Are you going to increase the fiscal deficit to double digit and 
<br/>add additional $600 million in loan?  But technically, you cannot borrow this additional $600 million, 
<br/>given the availability of financing.  Are you going to reduce expenditure by $600 million, of which, 
<br/>none of you talked about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that when we were in Opposition, they were asking, “Where 
<br/>is the Opposition’s alternative budget?”  For eight years, they hounded me and said, “Where is your 
<br/>alternative budget?”.  I kept telling them that it is not easy for an Opposition to bring an alternative 
<br/>budget, given the difficulty that we had to get information. Now, they are free, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>What is your alternative budget?  Where is it now?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  public  should  note  that  a  lot  of  the 
<br/>information  that  came  from  some  of  the  Opposition  Members  was  half  information,  and  half 
<br/>information can be dangerous and misleading.  It is easy for some of them to come here and say that 
<br/>we should reduce VAT, without saying how we would fix the revenue gap.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reiterate that when we increased the VAT rate from 9 percent 
<br/>to 15 percent in the last Budget, we had done a thorough analysis, explore different options, consulted 
<br/>with  various  experts,  discussed  with  our  multilateral  lenders,  and  even  brought  it  for  public 
<br/>discussion. We did not hide it.  We knew it was not an easy call, so we had to make sure that we get 
<br/>it right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we just did not pluck out the 15 percent from thin air, but it was based on a 
<br/>thorough analysis and what was there already, as put forth by the previous government.  Then we 
<br/>looked at our revenue needs and worked out what will ensure that government is adequately funded.  
<br/>We were also able to put our debt to GDP ratio on a downward path.  If we had not done that, Sir, 
<br/>we would have been in a major debt distress by now, and most of our lenders would have stopped 
<br/>lending to the Government. I will talk more about VAT when I talk about the cost of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  that  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  did,  Mr.  Speaker,  was 
<br/>comparison of per capita debt, and that is a right thing to do. I am not saying that the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition was not right.  But let me shed some light on the nominal debt and debt per 
<br/>capita per person, which a number of people have talked about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, inherited a total debt of around $9.5 billion at 
<br/>the end of 2022.  In terms of debt per capita, look at the total debt, divide by the total population, that 
<br/>is the debt per capita, Sir. This was around $10,700.  By the end of this Budget in July 2025, our total 
<br/>debt is projected to be $10.9 billion, or $12,300 per person. This means that in terms of debt per 
<br/>capita, the Coalition Government in three years, would have added about $1,600 debt per person.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the contrary, the previous government inherited a total debt of $2.9 billion in 2006, or 
<br/>$3,400 per person.  During their term, they increased the debt level to $9.5 billion, or $10,700 per 
<br/>person. This is an additional debt of $6.6 billion, or in per capita terms, an additional per capita debt 
<br/>of $7,300 per person.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Compare apples with apples.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  So,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable 
<br/>Sachida Nand who also talked about it, this is the reality when we talk about debt per capita. By July 
<br/>2025, we would have added $1,600 in additional debt per person, which they would have added about 
<br/>$7,300 additional debt to every person. So, that is just an explanation on debt per capita.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, get to the cost of living because that is another issue that everyone 
<br/>is concerned about, and we all ought to be concerned about. Let me provide some clarification and 
<br/>explanation so that some of them do not go out and lie to the people about what the Government is 
<br/>doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a sensitive issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is always subject to political point-scoring, 
<br/>but let me put through some basic economic facts.  First, prices are generally set through market 
<br/>forces in most cases, based on demand and supply.  Sellers or producers decide the price of … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Which you never understood when you were in Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …their  product  based  on  the  cost  of  production,  including 
<br/>labour, raw materials, transportation, storage, taxes and associated costs.  And based on the level of 
<br/>demand and competition from other suppliers, they decide to put up whatever mark up and the final 
<br/>price on the product, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But the basic principle remains that no one will ever sell their 
<br/>product at the price below their cost of production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly and more importantly, governments can influence the price of any product only to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a certain extent, and it can do so in three ways –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we can put price controls; 
<br/>changing the level of taxes it applies on these products by producing the product itself; or  
<br/>selling it at a loss, like Government services, including water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, even with price controls and changing the level of taxes, there is only so much that can be done, 
<br/>and there are trade-offs for these decisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a government, we have looked at all these options and the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>and Communications which the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) comes under 
<br/>his Ministry, is constantly looking at how we can use some of these tools and policies to provide 
<br/>relief to our people, and that is being done.  I am sure the honourable Deputy Prime Minister will be 
<br/>making at some of those decisions soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are always trade-offs in terms of whatever policies you choose. So, 
<br/>the  point  that  I  am  trying  to  make  is  that  it  is  not  easy  to  bring  down  prices,  and  it  is  critical  to 
<br/>understand what the Government can do which they did, which they do not admit what we have done. 
<br/>So, even for some zero rate on VAT items and quite conveniently, none of them talked about the fact 
<br/>that 22 items still has zero VAT - 21 basic food items and prescribed medicine.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Microwaving, that is what you always say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Despite the fact that there is no VAT on these items, the price 
<br/>had  increased  due  to  increase  in  either  production  cost  or  other  associated  costs,  like  freight, 
<br/>insurance, storage, et cetera, which is completely beyond our control, and they know that. It happened 
<br/>during COVID. The freight cost went up three or four times and some of it stayed for a long time. 
<br/>So, even when you reduce the duty, even when you have zero VAT, the prices, Mr. Speaker, Sir, still 
<br/>went up, and other reasons.  I know, honourable Usamate, in the last session of Parliament, may be 
<br/>a better way to describe him is honourable hogwash, talked about cassava.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order, Sir. The honourable Member should refer to other 
<br/>honourable Members as “honourable Member”, not as “hogwash”. Hogwash is a general term. He 
<br/>needs to withdraw that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- You may carry on, Deputy Prime Minister, and be mindful of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we are trying to say is that for most of 
<br/>the products that we consume in Fiji, as such, it is difficult to control the import prices which are 
<br/>determined  in  the  global  markets.  Our  major  trading  partners,  including  Australia,  New  Zealand, 
<br/>United States of America, have all been experiencing very, very high inflation rates due to global 
<br/>supply chain disruptions associated with the pandemic. Australia’s inflation was 6.6 percent in 2022, 
<br/>highest in 31 years, while New Zealand was 7.2 percent in 34 years, the US was 8 percent highest in 
<br/>40 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  given  trade  links  with  these  countries,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  natural  that  the  price  of 
<br/>imports from these countries would be higher and have a bigger impact, since around 50 percent of 
<br/>our consumption basket is made up of imported items. So, I am trying to explain this, Sir, because 
<br/>our people need to  understand and many of them do.  It  also,  I think, nullifies the lies that some 
<br/>honourable Members on the other side have been telling our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at comparable countries, such as Mauritius, its inflation was 10.8 
<br/>percent in 2022, 7 percent in 2023 and 5.9 percent in 2024. In our neighbouring Pacific countries, 
<br/>Vanuatu recorded inflation of 6.7 percent in 2022, 12 percent in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2024, while 
<br/>Tonga noted an inflation of 8.5 percent in 2022, 10.2 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent is expected in 
<br/>2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our inflation  rate in  Fiji  stood at  5.1 percent  at  the end of last year, 7.1 
<br/>percent in April this year, but that is just in April.  Our current inflation rate in June 2024 stood at 
<br/>6.7 percent and is projected (this is from the Fiji Bureau of Statistics) to stabilise around 3 percent to 
<br/>4 percent by the end of the year.
