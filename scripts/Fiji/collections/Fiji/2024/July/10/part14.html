<h3>CATD?</h3>
<div><span>CATD? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  that  is  to  support  the  Ministry’s  effort  to 
<br/>undertake an institutional review of the CATD because the legislation is very archaic, so there needs 
<br/>to be a review and that funding is provided for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 10 - Village Transformation 
<br/>Initiative ($2,000,000) -  R.  If the honourable Minister can elaborate on the criteria as to how he 
<br/>selects the village and what kind of transformative initiatives are being looked at? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, this programme is targeting villages that are really not up to 
<br/>par  with  regard  to  their  development.  For  villages  out  there  in  the  interior,  it  is  especially  for 
<br/>sanitation and village improvement, as well as for those that are close to the hotels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have already mentioned in my speech, it is a new programme for us. We started it last 
<br/>year and this is the second year.  We have been informing all our Roko and Provincial Councils about 
<br/>the projects that is available for that, which is mostly on sanitation and beautification.   How do they 
<br/>apply?  They have the forms  there in  the Provincial Council  Office with  the Roko. They have to 
<br/>arrange it with them, and it comes through the normal process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7, there is $100,000 allocated for Feasibility 
<br/>Study  for  Inter-island  Trading  Vessels.  I  am  interested  in  this  because  we  have  a  Department  of 
<br/>Transport that is housed in the Ministry of Public Works. I was wondering, why is it that the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs is doing the feasibility study rather than the Department of Transport? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- For this one, Mr. Chairman, there are lots of concerns from the community, 
<br/>especially for maritime movement in regards to shipping. So, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs is taking 
<br/></span><span>interest in trying to make a proper study of what is really needed out there, especially for Lau and 
<br/></span><span>Kadavu. I understand that the private companies are doing the work now, but there are still complaints 
<br/>from the community. So, we have decided to make a feasibility study so that we can really see what 
<br/>is  best  for  the  communities  out  there,  on  understanding  the  type  of  vessel  that  will  suit  them, 
<br/>especially for Lau where there are a lot of concerns.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1203 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have received concerns from people coming back to Suva because of the service out there 
<br/>in the community which has not been properly provided and which is why the Ministry of iTaukei is 
<br/>looking at ways to assist maritime communities who have been complaining in regard to shipping.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – I hope you will liaise with the Department of Transport because they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do a lot of those studies and they have done them in the past. It is just a suggestion. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN. – Is that a question or a point of clarification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU. – Noted, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN. – Honourable Kumar? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.–  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  SEG  7  –  Education  Awareness. 
<br/>There  is  $300,000  allocated  for  this  programme  and  I  also  see  some  awareness  programmes  on 
<br/>Programme 2-1. If the honourable Minister can explain to us why you have an education awareness 
<br/>programme  under  this  particular  Programme  1,  as  well  as  another  programme,  particularly  for 
<br/>Leadership in Programme 2 on the next page? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.  – If I can respond to that, those are two different activities.  
<br/>What  the  study  shows  and  the  presentation  from  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  and  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education is particularly for educational awareness.  If you notice, it is about collaborating with the 
<br/>Ministry of Education on TELS, on TVET and higher educational institutions to provide tailor-made 
<br/>educational courses for schools.  I do not want to use the word, ‘dropouts’, but for people who have 
<br/>fallen from the track after Form 4, 5 and 6 and a big chunk of them are iTaukei students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, the discussion was that we should try and get them in the net so that we are able 
<br/>to  train  them.  Contrary  to  what  we  have  heard,  a  lot  of  those  people  are  ending  up  with  Pacific 
<br/>Polytech and other institutions.  We need a much bigger awareness to get them.  It is not a big amount 
<br/>of money, but I think the benefit would be quite a big windfall. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN. –Programme 2-3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.  –  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-3(10)  –  Survey  of  Mahogany 
<br/>Plantation in the Northern Division. I am very interested because this is a function that is normally 
<br/>carried out by the Ministry of Lands.  When we have the periphery boundary surveys already done, 
<br/>there is the survey of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> allotments inside. So, I am interested, because this would then be 
<br/>a duplication of what normally happens under the Ministry of Lands and what the Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs is proposing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.  -  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  to  assist  the  Ministry  of  Lands  on  the  survey  of 
<br/>boundaries,  especially  the  disputed  ones  for  the  mahogany.    For  mahogany,  survey  should  be 
<br/>completed by 2029.  Now, the survey is still within Viti Levu so we (Ministry of iTaukei Affairs) 
<br/>have decided to help the Ministry of Lands with the survey in Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Partly just for honourable Usamate, it is a collaborative effort 
<br/></span><span>between the Ministry of Lands and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs because there are a lot of disputes 
<br/>with the land and surveying and getting the boundaries and everything workout, so it is better that 
<br/>the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the Ministry of Lands work together.  That is why the budget is 
<br/>with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, through you, just a clarification on $950,000 here at the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and there is another $738,000 for Mahogany Survey in the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I have said, they are working together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, the Ministry for Lands will take care of Viti Levu and we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will take care of Vanua Levu in the survey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think honourable Kirpal knows very well that surveying is really an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expensive exercise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 4-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  Preservation  of  Historical 
<br/>Monuments whereby $150,000 was allocated in last year’s budget and in this year’s budget, I do not 
<br/>see that any amount is allocated for it.  My question is, are the monuments all fixed?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is completed now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Alright, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, this is to do with Programme 4-1(10) – Rehabilitation of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka World Heritage Structure ($1,500,000), which specific structure is this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, this is to refurbish the Levuka Community Centre, the last 
<br/>one was just on the structure and the second one is for St. Johns Catholic Church in Cawaci. They 
<br/>will cover that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 5 – Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Culture, Heritage and Arts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 5 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, I kind of heard some sighs when I awarded the 
<br/>acclamation vote to those who said “no”.  Remember in the past, it is the same thing.  We yelled from 
<br/>the top of our voices in the Opposition, but it always fell on those that were more in numbers. Even 
<br/>if your voice is bigger, I am kidding, I will play it by ear.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 6 – Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(7)  –  National  Security  Defence 
<br/>Review.  This  has  been  going  on,  I  believe,  for  some  time.  I  am  just  wondering,  is  this  now  the 
<br/></span><span>completion of the exercise, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- The short answer is ‘yes’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 2-1(5) – Completion of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>IBMS Project.  If the honourable Minister can tell us a little bit about this IBMS Project. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- The IBMS is the maintenance programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No, she only wants some explanation.  Is it still ongoing?. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I can just help; the IBMS annual fee maintenance, that is 
<br/>$155,000 out of that, and the IBMS e-Passport contractual payment and oracle support for the IBMS 
<br/>hardware upgrade, makes up a total of $400,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the only amount left is now $21,000? In 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other words, are all the upgrades completed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  I  have  noticed,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  there  has  been  a  substantiative 
<br/>increase in the amount of money set aside for passports - an increase of $2.5 million up to $4 million 
<br/>in this Budget.  Can the honourable Minister explain, why the huge increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Which SEG are you referring to? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Programme 2-1(5) – Passports ($4 million).  Last year, it was $1.5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  For  e-passports,  blank  books  per  year,  five  years  contract  in 
<br/>Germany that produces the books, 40 percent at once or $707,329 and 60 percent after delivery which 
<br/>is a million dollars, a total of FJ$2 million.  Then you have the shipment, which is $2 million, service 
<br/>support is around €69,850.  That is for yearly contract with the company for their services.  Service 
<br/>support next year by the same company will cost us approximately $200,000, the passport printer 
<br/>and enrolment kits for the new financial year is $1.3 million and Disaster Recovery Support is $3.5 
<br/>million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The passport number is about 100,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is it that we are completely changing our passport system or what is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the big jump for?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  No,  there  has  been  a  remarkable  increase  that  we  will  want 
<br/>because of the current passport numbers that we have  - 40,000.  So, we are going to increase the 
<br/>numbers next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- From 40,000 to 100,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister 
<br/>on Programme 2-1(9) - Disaster Recovery Support ($2 million).  If you can just explain what disaster 
<br/></span><span>recovery is this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  that  is  to  do  with  passports  in  case  something 
<br/>happens and the system that prints passports collapses, or there is a malware through cybercrime.  
<br/>That is the amount we use for the recovery of the data that we have.

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  SEG  7  -  Digitisation  and 
<br/>Modernisation of Fiji Immigration Systems and Processes ($383,198).  I believe DFAT is involved, 
<br/>are they assisting you with money or also with people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Both. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, what changes are you trying to bring about in this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, this might be a question for Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, given the threats that we face in terms of what we 
<br/>encounter at the border, this becomes more complicated all the time.  There are ways now where we 
<br/>can use technology that enhances the way we safeguard the country, particularly from people that we 
<br/>do not need to come through here.  So, we know what people are about and if people are sick.  If you 
<br/>go to other airports, you are looking at where you have these cameras that detect if people are sick 
<br/>from sea, but these are for the added security measures that we will have at the airport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 9 - e-Passport Enrolment Kit – 
<br/>Immigration Offices and Overseas Missions.  I know over the years, e-passport is being introduced 
<br/>in various Missions, and I can see $300,000 is allocated for that activity.  Is it for any specific Mission 
<br/>that you are targeting, and if, yes, which ones are those? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, that includes e-passport kits for Suva, Lautoka 
<br/>and Nadi.  This is, in particular, to take the kit out to those who cannot come, particularly for disabled 
<br/>or sick people.  We have right now in Missions, like Canberra, Wellington and Washington DC, the 
<br/>enrolment kits that our local people in those countries go to, to try and enrol to get their passports 
<br/>printed there locally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The proposed Missions for these passport kits right now are 
<br/>Fiji  High  Commission  in  Beijing  and  Fiji  High  Commission  in  New  Delhi.    We  already  have  e-
<br/>passport kits at Fiji High Commission in Wellington, Consulate in Sydney, Canberra, Washington, 
<br/>Geneva, Abu Dhabi, London and Tokyo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-  Parliament will now vote on Head 6  - Ministry of Home Affairs  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 6 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 7 – Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  Programme  1-3(10)  -  Workers 
<br/>Compensation ($6 million).  Can the honourable Minister clarify the $6 million allocated, will it deal 
<br/>with all the pending cases that you have in the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, yes, for the current and pending.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, just a question on the same issue; I assume that this will also take 
<br/>up the cases from the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF). Traditionally, Government 
<br/>has  been  responsible  for  paying  compensation  for  Government  workers.  Will  this  just  cover 
<br/>Government workers or both - workers from the Government and the private sector?  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1207 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They only cover the State employees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Since you are taking over the cases from ACCF, how will the ones for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the private sector be covered? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-    Even  with  the  existence  of  ACCF,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Employment is still doing a lot of the work, assessments, et cetera.  The whole thing is in transition 
<br/>now. The State employees already handled by the Ministry will now be directly handled in terms of 
<br/>their compensation. So, this increase in budget is to provide for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The ACCF will still process that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7 - Foreign Employment Mobility Services. 
<br/>Can we have a clarification on the reason for the increase of $50,000?. Is that for the Liaison Officers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes, that is to assist with the Country Liaison Officers (CLOs) and other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Programme  1-4(7)  -  Pacific  Labour  Scheme  ($400,000).  Can  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister clarify this allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- On page 55, Programme 1-4(7) - Pacific Labour Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, it is essentially to meet the expenses of the Pacific Labour 
<br/>Scheme. The demand for Fijian workers under the Programme has been growing. As the honourable 
<br/>Minister  explained,  there  are  two  Country  Liaison  Officers  to  closely  provide  the  support  on  the 
<br/>ground. The Ministry intends to establish a toll-free line in Australia to help the workers who were 
<br/>sent by the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This allocation is for the appointment of a Country Liaison Officer and other operational costs 
<br/>in  Australia,  considering  there  are  over  5,000  workers.  Basically,  the  Liaison  Officer  as  the 
<br/>honourable Minister had explained in Parliament, will be responsible for pastoral care and welfare 
<br/>support for workers on the ground, and also promoting Fiji to the approved employers in Australia 
<br/>when necessary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Just a clarification, we had earlier on heard that those Liaison Officers’ 
<br/>allocation are in the Foreign Employment Mobility Services which is allocated $280,000. I am asking 
<br/>about the Pacific Labour Scheme ($400,000), what is that allocation for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, if I may, the $50,000 increase was the allocation that 
<br/>includes operational logistics, cost for mobilising workers including cost of hiring, training venues, 
<br/></span><span>medical costs for pre-departure, et cetera, and transportation sometimes needed from here to Nadi, 
<br/></span><span>and includes cost of planned visits to New Zealand and Australia on bilateral meetings.  Then the 
<br/>Pacific  Labour  Scheme  which  is  $400,000,  is  for  the  appointment  of  additional  Country  Liaison 
<br/>Officers, one in New Zealand and three in Australia, because there are 5,000 plus Fijian workers now 
<br/>and the Country Liaison Officers will be responsible for pastoral  care and everything. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Programme  1-6(7)  -  Asia  Productivity  Organization  Training 
<br/>Allowance, I noticed that there has been a significant increase in the budget from $40,000 to $100,000 
<br/>- a jump of more than 100 percent. Can you just give some clarification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increase in allocation is to host the World Social 
<br/>Marketing Conference, which I have alluded to in my presentation, from 22</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 to 25</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>October, 2024 at the Sofitel.  We have 21 countries attending the Asia Productivity Organization 
<br/>(APO) Conference here and there will be 72 participants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There will be a traditional welcome, purchase of tokens and gifts, there will be travel and 
<br/>accommodation expenses for our people, as well as catering for the cost of APO trainings due to the 
<br/>increase in face-to-face APO trainings.  So, that is the increased allocation there. I also said in my 
<br/>presentation, Sir, that we are now the Chair of APO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- One more question, Mr. Chairman, under the same SEG 7, you have 
<br/>a  National  Productivity  Master  Plan.    A  few  years  ago,  we  signed  the  Productivity  Roundtable 
<br/>Charter that was signed by Tripartite, and I do not think we have had another National Productivity 
<br/>Master Plan other than studies. So, I am very interested to know how this $50,000 will be used.  How 
<br/>will it be operated?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  Mr. Chairman, Sir, this is the cost  of the review of the Productivity 
<br/>Charter  Plan  and  the  implementation  of  the  Master  Plan,  stakeholders  engagement,  national 
<br/>awareness  on  productivity  movement,  house  productivity  talks,  symposiums  and  workshops  and 
<br/>appointment of Productivity Champions in the public and private sector, as well as printing materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Parliament  will  now  vote  on  Head  7  –  Ministry  of  Employment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Productivity and Workplace Relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 7 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 8 – Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  my  question  is  on  SEG  8  -  Upgrade  and 
<br/>Enhancement - Building (Overseas Missions) - $1,000,000, if details of those Missions can be given.  
<br/>Which Missions are we talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  to  accommodate  refurbishment  works.    The  Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mission priority is Fiji-owned properties - London, Canberra and Wellington. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-1(7) – Special Administrator (480,000), 
<br/>can the honourable Assistant Minister briefly explain how are the Special Administrators appointed 
<br/></span><span>and who are these four? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Before I allow the questions to be responded to, we have been having 
<br/>this topic in Parliament for quite some time.  You still want clarification on this, even though you 
<br/>know it?

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1209 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is essentially the deployment of a Senior Military Officer 
<br/>to the Permanent Representative’s Office to the United Nations (UN) in New York to handle any 
<br/>issues arising out of peacekeeping deployments with the UN and caters for the salary of the Officer 
<br/>and operational expenses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- If I may just carry on from there, Mr. Chairman, to answer 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal’s question, yes, there is no change from the last allocation of $480,000 and as 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Finance has already alluded to, it is to cater for all the operational costs 
<br/>of the Military and Police Advisor for the Fiji Mission and the current post holder is Colonel Siliva 
<br/>Raradoka Vananalagi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And it is no longer Administrator, it is Military Advisor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, just a curiosity because I have very little knowledge in 
<br/>this area, so the Special Administrator is now going to be the Military Advisor.  My question is, why 
<br/>is it in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ budgeting and not RFMF budgeting? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  It  is  simply  because it is  going  to  be based at  the UN and 
<br/>peacekeeping is coordinated by the UN.  It is a UN operation so, obviously, it makes sense to have 
<br/>that within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I hear that the peacekeeping budget has now been moved into RFMF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- On the same argument, why is this still here and not there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have just said, Mr. Chairman, that it is a UN….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I can answer that.  The Military Advisor is located in the Office 
<br/>of  our  Permanent  Representative  to  the  United  Nations  (PRUN)  under  the  Ministry  of  Foreign 
<br/>Affairs.  That person is a Senior Military Officer who gets her salary here, but because of her position 
<br/>within PRUN, there are other things, including her accommodation, and the whole range of her work 
<br/>requires her to be subjected to the leadership of our Permanent Representative to the UN.  That is 
<br/>why  it  is  under  this  allocation  and  not  with  the  peacekeeping.    Peacekeeping  is  for  the  Fijian 
<br/>peacekeeping missions overseas, not including the one in New York. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do you understand the meaning of PRUN?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Parliament will now vote on Head 8  – Ministry of Foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I apologise, Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 9 – Independent Bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 9 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 10 – Ministry of Environment and Climate Change 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have  a motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 10-1-3(4) – Implementation and Enforcement of the Environment Management 
<br/>Act ($30,000), I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase the allocation by another $20,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this allocation is on the enforcement of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment Management Act and I have two other motions later as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have very good laws, but we are quite weak in the enforcement.  Having served in the 
<br/>Division and, of course, as Permanent Secretary, a lot of times we are not able to effectively enforce 
<br/>the laws that we have simply just because of lack of resources.  That is why I am recommending that 
<br/>the allocation under SEG 4 on the implementation and enforcement of the Environment Management 
<br/>Act be increased by another $20,000.  We need to look after our environment for sustainability in the 
<br/>long term and that is why I am moving this motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, I think the current allocation is sufficient to cover the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>existing work that the Ministry is undertaking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will put that to the vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Particularly, to enhance the Eastern  Division and maritime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>islands, so this is kind of a new allocation, but there are other allocations in other Ministries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- If you have nothing further to add,  we will put it to the vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme1-3(8) – Naboro Landfill – Phase 
<br/></span><span>2 (Cell 4), the same allocation was provided for in last year’s budget but was not utilised at all.  So, 
<br/>can we have some explanation from the Ministry as to why that allocation last year was not utilised 
<br/>and  what  are  the  chances  of  this  allocation  being  utilised  this  year?  Has  any  preparatory  work 
<br/>undertaken already so that we can be assured that this allocation will be fully utilised for that purpose?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1211 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  yes,  I  think  there  has  been  substantial  work  already 
<br/>undertaken and we have provided some provisions for that work, particularly in ensuring that stage 
<br/>2 of the work is completed.  There are some provisions that will be fully utilised in the next financial 
<br/>year, and we have provided another contract for the current company for the next four years so that 
<br/>they can undertake the landfill at Naboro.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, just to add to that, the agreement is already 
<br/>signed and $2.8 million will be paid in this financial year.  The total cost is $7.8 million, so $2.7 
<br/>million is allocated for next year’s budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  Head  10-1-3(7),  Consultancy  - 
<br/>Development of Fiji’s Container Deposit Regulations ($45,000).  The same amount and same activity 
<br/>was mentioned last year and this consultancy work seems to be forever.  So, I would like to know or 
<br/>if you can tell us whether it is still in the pipeline or is it going to end this year?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, the Ministry has been allocated $45,000 to undertake 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the consultancy work for the development of the Container Deposit Regulations.  The Cabinet paper 
<br/>is currently being formulated by the Ministry, to seek Cabinet’s endorsement to continue the work, 
<br/>and then the engagement of the consultant.  So, hopefully, this will be the end of this this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-5? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  need  some  clarifications  on  Programme  1-5(4)  - 
<br/>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) - $30,000.  Thereafter, in SEG 5, 
<br/>again,  there  is  another  provision  and  I  am  assuming  that  that  particular  provision  is  for  annual 
<br/>contribution of $400 to CITES.  Can the honourable Minister, please, specify what is the allocation 
<br/>of $30,000 for?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  essentially  to  support  the  administration  of  the 
<br/>Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species  Act  2002,  and  provide  support  to  the 
<br/>Management Committee and the Scientific Council established under that Act, as well as meeting 
<br/>expenses, et cetera.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question; what about the enforcement, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is that included in it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the Committee and the Council will also have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that mandate - to look at how this provision in the Act is enforced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 5 - Stockholm Convention on 
<br/>the Management of Persistent Organic Pollutants and I see an allocation of $1,500 only.  I would like 
<br/>to ask the honourable Minister, how will this $1,500 be used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is an annual contribution to the Persistent Organic Pollutants 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Subscription.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  We  have  a  motion  from  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 10-1-6.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- On SEG 4 - Environment Compliance North and West ($8,000), 
<br/>I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the allocation be increased by $12,000, to bring the allocation to $20,000 for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the activities in the North and the West. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Again, similar to my previous motion, we need to arm our people 
<br/>in the various Divisions so that they can do their work effectively. I am very familiar with the work 
<br/>in the Northern Division because I served there as Commissioner Northern, dealing with extractive 
<br/>industries, particularly logging in Vanua Levu, a lot of fisheries activities as well, industrial waste, I 
<br/>know that we used to have a lot of issues with Fiji Sugar Corporation on their disposal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You would recall, Mr. Chairman, Sir, that in one of the recent sittings of Parliament, I was 
<br/>asking the honourable Minister for Local Government about solid and liquid wastes.  There are a lot 
<br/>of environmental issues and, again, we just need to give resources to the people on the ground so that 
<br/>they can do their work more effectively.  That is why I have moved this slight increase, but it will 
<br/>mean a lot in the execution of duties at divisional level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  The  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  understands  that  all  the 
<br/>other  Departments  and  Ministries  contribute  to  this  one,  that  is  the  budgeted  amount  from  the 
<br/>Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. There is nothing stopping the Ministry of Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Ministry of Local Government in contributing towards the total cost of 
<br/>that function.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Again, if I may be of help to the honourable Leader, as I have 
<br/>said earlier, this is a new allocation and specifically target the Eastern Division and Maritime Islands. 
<br/>This is the first allocation and if there is a need to increase it next year, we will do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Premila Kumar, do you want to speak on the motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, Sir.  I just want to simply say that when it comes to environment 
<br/>management, we tend to believe that all other Ministries are really looking after the environment. If 
<br/>you  look  around  us,  simple  issues,  like  litter.  The  Litter  Decree  is  there  but  littering  continues, 
<br/>although we say that there are a number of Ministries involved in looking after that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I strongly believe honourable Prime Minister, Sir, that you need to allocate resources to the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Environment,  a  dedicated  agency,  so  that  they  can  deal  with  environmental  issues. 
<br/>Normally, when it comes to Ministry of Local Government, they are too busy with their own mandate 
<br/>and other agencies as well tend to forget environment. We sit here and assume that other agencies 
<br/>will be also assisting, but it is an issue that we need to look at in depth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.- That  is  the response from  the Government.  We have heard from the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister that it is a multi-pronged approach from the various Ministries concerned.  
<br/></span><span>But, again, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we will put your motion to vote.  Head 10-6(4) be 
<br/></span><span>increased by $12,000 to make it $20,000. So far, they have $8,000. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1213 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG 7 - Implementation of Climate Change Act 
<br/>($500,000).  In the last financial year, $5 million was allocated for the implementation of the Climate 
<br/>Change  Act.    I  would  like  to  know  how  this  money  was  used,  and  to  see  whether  $500,000  is 
<br/>sufficient to take this programme further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- She is just seeking clarification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  reduction  is  essentially  due  to  the 
<br/>completion of the project and the total for this budget support is approximately about $30 million.  
<br/>This year, the allocation was not used, so that is why there is reduction and there is no allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I apologise, Mr. Chairman, I am really confused here.  If that can be 
<br/>explained again in terms of the figures because what I am saying is that last year, $5 million was 
<br/>allocated.  How was that used for the implementation of the Climate Change Act?  Now, it has been 
<br/>reduced to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is why I said it was not used and we are getting budget 
<br/>support  from  the  European  Union  (EU).    Whatever  is  allocated  is  distributed  across  different 
<br/>activities, so that is why we have not allocated anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I seek clarification, does that mean that this Climate Change Act will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not be implemented? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, it will be implemented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- But you are not spending the money on it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This year, it was not used, and we are getting budget support 
<br/>from the EU, which will be spread across different activities. We do not need to allocate that this 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Last year, there was $5 million allocated by the EU.  Of course, 
<br/>DFAT allocated  $1.5 million  as  well to  the Climate  Change  Unit.    Given what  is  in  SEG  7,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, I would like to know if there are other avenues in which Government is going to source 
<br/>funds from because we all know that this is the biggest existential threat that we face as a country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my reply to your Speech, honourable Minister for Finance, I did state that Parliaments are 
<br/>responsible to ensure that we align to the global, the regional and even local issues and the honourable 
<br/>Speaker will be answerable at the IPU Meetings about what Fiji Parliament is doing.  So, are there 
<br/>any other funding elsewhere to give assurance to our people that we are taking this issue seriously?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A very good question, honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>you are right and I agree with you.  If you look at the whole budget of the Ministry of Environment 
<br/>and Climate Change and all the other funding support that we are getting in terms of budget support, 
<br/>I think there will be more than enough to support any of those activities, advocacy, representation of 
<br/></span><span>Fiji in these international climate change forums, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  said,  yes,  we  want  to  make  sure  that  environment  and  climate  change  is 
<br/>mainstreamed. It is a cutting theme across all the different Ministries and a lot of the climate financing 
<br/>strategies  now  have  to  be  linked  in  terms  of  collaboration  of  key  ministries  -  Ministry  of 
<br/>Infrastructure,  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Education,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of 
<br/>Climate Change.  We are putting those strategies together, so the funding allocation is appropriate.

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Apart from the European Union, are there any other? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, there are various projects, as well as budget support that 
<br/>we can direct to specific activities and most of the infrastructure support that we are getting is culled 
<br/>in  terms  of  climate  resilient  infrastructure  or  climate  resilient  activities,  so  as  I  have  said,  it  is 
<br/>mainstreamed now and that is how we would like to support it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, can I ask one final question because we have started with the 
<br/>relocation of Nabavatu Village.  Please, bear with me if I have not gone through the others, so how 
<br/>are we going to continue with the relocation of Nabavatu Village that we have already started? Is that 
<br/>already allocated to a Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I have said, honourable Leader of the Opposition, most of 
<br/>the projects, loans, grants and budget support that we are negotiating that we receive, climate change, 
<br/>climate  resilient  infrastructure,  climate  change  activities  is  embedded  into  those  mainstreamed 
<br/>programmes.  It is working very well because a lot of the funding agencies also want to see those 
<br/>activities embedded into the funding model that they provide for projects, so most projects would 
<br/>have that.  The Nabavatu project is funded from the Climate Change Relocation Trust Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 10 – Ministry of Environment and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate Change.

<div><span>Head 10 agreed to.

<div><span>Head 13 – Independent Commissions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  1-1(6)  –  Fijian  Competition  and 
<br/>Consumer Commission  ($5,526,760).   I do see  an increase in  their budget.   Is this increase for a 
<br/>specific activity, and if so, what is it for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The increase is essentially due to the following - the increase 
<br/>by $275,000 to accommodate one Legal Officer, one Customer Service Officer and one Financial 
<br/>Analyst, three Environmental Officers, one Senior Human Resource Training Officer and one Team 
<br/>Leader Advocacy.  Maintenance and operations have increased and $645,000 is to cater for all that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, last year, I did raise an issue regarding the regulators 
<br/>for  Energy  Fiji  Limited  (EFL)  were  based  in  EFL  and  not  at  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer 
<br/>Commission (FCCC).  So, my question is whether that issue has been addressed or not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, EFL determines independently the tariff rates for EFL as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I do understand that but if you look  at the recent  amendments that 
<br/>were made to the law, the regulator for wire man, electrical, et cetera, was moved to FCCC. In the 
<br/>last  Standing  Committee  meeting,  they  did  mention  that  they  do  not  have  the  resources  and  the 
<br/>regulators are still with EFL and not with FCCC.  I had raised it last time and this is a bit of an issue 
<br/>because people want a transparent system and not the regulator to be sitting with the main player.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the transition is necessary. You are right.  When EFL 
<br/>was 100 percent government owned, all that was seen as a Government agency.  So that is the point 
<br/>that needs to be taken into account. As I have said, the tariff rate is already independently decided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Just to add on, Sir, in terms of FCCC’s current role, they set 
<br/>the  tariff  on  electricity  pricing  which  is  probably  what  honourable  Premila  Kumar  is  alluding  to. 
<br/>They actually have the power to determine the Independent Power Producer (IPP) pricing.  There is 
<br/>a regulatory arm in there that looks after the wiring and that bit of it.  I think that bit is still with EFL, 
<br/>and we probably need to understand that a bit more because I am not sure whether FCCC is the right 
<br/>house for it because it is a technical certification. It is almost like Civil Aviation Authority type of 
<br/>setup, so it might be something we have to look at. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, just to add to that, the Department of Energy 
<br/>together  with  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency  (IRENA),  is  currently  conducting  a 
<br/>regulatory framework diagnostic. It is looking at the generation, transmission, and all those elements, 
<br/>and the regulatory.  The outcome is envisaged to separate those functions and where they would lie, 
<br/>and also the current regulations - the legal side.  That should be completed soon, and workshops with 
<br/>the stakeholders in order to move that forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Additionally,  they  are  also  setting  up  a  new  regulatory 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mechanism for Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am pleased with the information given by the honourable Ministers 
<br/>because  this  is  a  very  critical  issue.    Sometimes,  we  tend  to  say,  “Alright,  these  are  wiring  and 
<br/>electrical people coming and doing wiring, or electrical goods coming into the country”, which has 
<br/>a lot of significance in terms of the number of fires we have in the country. These are all shoddy jobs 
<br/>being done by some of these electrical companies, who are not regulated properly and that is creating 
<br/>a bit of a problem  in  households.  Then what  happens?  The Government  has to  allocate money.  
<br/>When houses go up in flames, we pay some money to the family. We need to nip that in the bud, so 
<br/>I am very pleased with the honourable Ministers for their responses. I look forward to the work that 
<br/>will be completed and how you are going to make the regulation rather strong so that we do not have 
<br/>this problem in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on. Parliament will now vote on Head 13 – Independent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 13 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 14 – Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since there are no comments, Parliament will now vote on Head 14 - Fiji Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 14 agreed to.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15- Ministry of Justice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 1-1(5) - E-Transaction 
<br/>Cost  ($30,000).    Can  the  honourable  Minister  explain  the  transaction  that  has  taken  place  in  the 
<br/>Ministry using this $30,000, which was given previously, and it is being given now?  Is it an ongoing 
<br/>cost, or is it for hardware, or what is it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, it is an ongoing exercise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just to add to what the honourable Minister said, it is the fees 
<br/>to banks for any transaction carried out on EFTOS machines for printing birth, death and marriage 
<br/>certificates by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) - Refunds ($20,000).  Can I have a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarification on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, it deals with funds associated to paying back 
<br/>to the public or parties that actually withdraw the paid legislative fees from getting the service.  They 
<br/>pay for it, and then they withdraw without asking for the service, so they get refunded.  I think that 
<br/>is the right thing to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Minister on SEG 7 - Digitisation Programme  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>($100,000), is that specifically for the Companies Office or the Ministry as a whole? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, it could be for ROT.  There is also an exercise with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Official Receivers Office.  Last year, it was $100,000, and this year, again, it is $100,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Could you be more clearer than that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  undertaking  an  exercise  throughout  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry.  The chief one is the ROT, but also with the Official Receivers Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question; the digitisation of the ROT, is 
<br/>it  expected  to  be  completed  this  year?    I  am  sure  there  is  quite  a  few  other  people  here  who  are 
<br/>interested more than I? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, we are meeting with the consultant next week, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am hopeful it will be completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Apart from that, the allocation is for the whole digitisation, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well as for everything that the Ministry does.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  the  same  Digitisation  Programme  for  which 
<br/>$100,000 is given this year, last year $50,000 was given, so I am a bit confused if you are saying that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1217 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the consultant will come and do the job.  Does that mean that we did not use $50,000 last year?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is ongoing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  It  was  used,  in  fact,  it  was  almost  completed.  I  think  this 
<br/>additional $50,000 is really for planning, scoping for the digitisation and the additional funding is 
<br/>provided for the implementation phase.  I think the honourable Minister did say that, so  this is just 
<br/>carrying it forward for implementation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also about preservation of records.  You are not only putting new stuff into it, you are 
<br/>actually  going  back,  bringing  it,  digitising  it  and  preserving  it  so  it  is  not  just  that  the  project  is 
<br/>completed. Now, it is implementation and also going back and digitising some of the records. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is, is it the digitisation of records for what because it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry of Justice?  Is it the court orders or what? I do not know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Well,  I  can  give  you  a  general  answer.  The  record  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>digitisation of Government in the past for so many years, was extremely poor, honestly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, this is what we are trying to do now,  going into different 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministries and really … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- There is no hogwash here, honourable Usamate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, it is not hogwash. It is washing the mess.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We are asking specific questions and we need specific answers, not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>‘that could be general’ or ‘may be’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are giving you specific answers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not that general. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, it is not general. We said it has been done, it is now being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented with additional funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Chairman, if  I may enlighten this Parliament, there were two 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>failed projects undertaken by the previous Government which cost $300,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You want to know that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- So, the projects were preserved, in the end, nothing turned out. Then 
<br/>they did a study, and it was paid in US$2.5 million, but nothing came out of it. So, we are actually 
<br/></span><span>doing what you should have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the question is on digitisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, the programme that you are talking about, the previous projects, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were these projects on digitisation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I notice in SEG 6, there is an allowance of Justice of Peace - $30,000. 
<br/>I do not see such allowance in the budget for last year. I thought Justices of the Peace give their time 
<br/>freely. So, if you can just elaborate, what is this because I think it is a completely new expenditure?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- We undertake orientation. Our officers travel around the country, in 
<br/>fact. Last week, they just returned from the Northern Division. It is free, honourable Usamate, but it 
<br/>is for the administration cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- But it is called Justice of Peace Allowance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I can confirm there is no allowance paid to the Justices of Peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- But that is the name here, ‘Justice of Peace Allowance’. Is the name 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wrong? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  No,  the  name  is  right.  It  is  just  the  spending  of  the  money.  It  is  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>administrative cost, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  name  here,  Sir,  is  Justice  of  Peace  Allowance.  What  he  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explaining is something else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I will look into it, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 15 - Ministry of Justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 17 - Ministry of Civil Service and Public Enterprises 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1, we have a motion from honourable Koroilavesau. Could 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you introduce your motion, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the allocation for Programme 1-1(8) - Upgrade and Enhancement of Quarters be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1219 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I want to declare my interest, I live in a 
<br/>Government Quarters and have been for the last 14 years. I have raised this issue with the highest 
<br/>level of government, even with the honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics. The only office that I have not been to is the Office of the Prime Minister.   
<br/>I do not really want to bother him with my accommodation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am sleeping in my sitting room now.  The bedrooms are vacant.  The 
<br/>sitting room that I am sleeping in has got a big hole on one of the boards and the ply that covers the 
<br/>ceiling is totally gone.  I have been asking this for one year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three weeks ago when I called the Ministry of Finance, they told me, ‘we run short of money’ 
<br/>so I am asking an increase.  I am paying monthly rental which the Government still demands for my 
<br/>quarters, even though I am sleeping in this condition.  I have been sleeping like this for the last one 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not want to complain because I have already complained to the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics.    He  has  tried  to  encourage 
<br/>people  to  repair  it  but  I  cannot  complain  any  more.    Why  should  I  bother  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister  who  is  the  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change,  Environment,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to come and repair my house?  He has got no 
<br/>business of how I sleep or how I wake up in the morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Does that include your Sitting Allowance here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- But I am sleeping at home, Sir, I am not sleeping here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I am addressing your letter of complaint that I have just received as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Through the honourable Prime Minister, this is exactly why 
<br/>we are bringing back the Public Works Department which the last government did away with and 
<br/>also in terms of the property management of government assets, including housing. That will come 
<br/>up in the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport budget.  Part of that is 
<br/>also allocated there in terms of the upkeep of Government properties.  I have heard the honourable 
<br/>Minister and have noted that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-  Thank you for your response, honourable Minister for Public Works, 
<br/>Meteorological Services and  Transport.  I am concerned that this is the plight of a Member of this 
<br/>august Parliament and he has been complaining. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  am  sure  the  honourable  Member  would 
<br/>remember the story about the soldier that turned up, did not shave.  His Officer asked him, “Did you 
<br/>shave this morning?”  The soldier said, “Yes, Sir.” Did you use the mirror?  He said, “Yes, Sir.”  Try 
<br/>using a razor because your problem would have been easily resolved if you had asked me and the 
<br/>Minister responsible for quarters.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That means, Sir, it is alright now for immediate repairs to the roof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I am grateful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do you wish to withdraw your motion or shall we continue?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  I  withdraw  my  motion  and  I  will  come  and  see  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Thank  you.    You  just  made  a  statement  that  is  enough  there,  not  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>someone else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 3-1?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 3-1-(10) – Shipbuilding Revival 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Project with an allocation of $10 million, can this be clarified, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, we asked for that to be put into the budget because 
<br/>we are having the development of the shipbuilding and ship repair facilities being now understudy 
<br/>with the help of Australia.  We have asked for this $10 million to go towards that and even if we have 
<br/>to venture out and buy an amphibious vessel to help with the regional development and maritime, as 
<br/>well as disaster relief work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  3-3(7),  I  seek  some  clarification  on  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultancy Fees, that is, $400,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, that is a very complicated exercise being taken 
<br/>there as part of the whole of Savusavu Blue Town Concept, taking into account the development of 
<br/>the roads, so we need that consultancy fee available for our part of the development of Savusavu and 
<br/>surrounding areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, can I go back to SEG 10 on Fiji Rice Limited with 
<br/>an allocation of $1.4 million and Food Processors with an allocation of $1 million.  You know how 
<br/>important these entities are.  I just seek clarification from Government on what specific areas are we 
<br/>targeting in this year’s allocation because this is important as well in terms of linkage to our rural 
<br/>farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, the Fiji Rice Limited has been allocated $1.1 million for 
<br/>the purchase of paddy.  Government is also subsidizing the price of rice paddy so the price of paddy 
<br/>ranges from $750 per tonne to $850, based on the moisture content.  So, it is also for the subsidy and, 
<br/>of course, $287,000 is provided to farmers for fertilizer and weedicide subsidy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just to add a little bit on that, for the fertilizer and weedicide 
<br/>subsidy, last year it was allocated for all the non-sugar crops under the Ministry of Agriculture.  This 
<br/>year, we have moved the rice part of it to Fiji Rice Limited because Fiji Rice Limited is the one 
<br/>dealing with the farmers and we find that this would be a much better and efficient way to help the 
<br/>farmers.  That is why an additional $287,000 from that budget is put under Fiji Rice Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The second question is on Food Processors Fiji Limited (FPFL). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- The $1 million being allocated to Food Processors Fiji Limited is for 
<br/></span><span>agriculture and marine buying subsidy. The FPFL source their agriculture and marine products for 
<br/></span><span>both, seasonal and non-seasonal, from rural and maritime areas.  The products are canned, they are 
<br/>frozen and sold locally and exported to the United States of America, New Zealand, Australia, United 
<br/>Kingdom, Canada and the Pacific Island countries.  The provision of this subsidy will support the 
<br/>company by procuring high quantity of agriculture produce to meet the demand of its products and 
<br/>markets.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1221 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Sir, my question is also on Food Processors. Last year, $2 million was 
<br/>given to that company and this year it is reduced to $1 million. Can you explain why, if it is to do 
<br/>with subsidy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The reduction is really aligned to the expenditure trend and 
<br/>the  Ministry  has  done  some  realignment  of  funds  to  the  allocation  of  so-called  vulnerable  being 
<br/>overspent at the end of the financial year.  I think we looked at the expenditure trend and we said that 
<br/>whatever  is  allocated  instead  of  $2  million,  $1  million  is  sufficient  for  this  budget.    Part  of  the 
<br/>expenditure control. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote of Head 17 – Ministry of Civil Service and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 17 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 18 – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Sir,  before  I  raise  my  question,  I  just  wish  to  acknowledge 
<br/>Government for the increase from $29 million last year to around $37 million this year, but at the 
<br/>same  time  in  the  implementation  that  was  given  to  us  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Sir,  the 
<br/>implementation rate is quite low (64.55 percent) and I hope that the Ministry can look into that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is on Programme 1-1(7) - Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific 
<br/>(Gov4Res) Project (UNDP).  This is a very important project that was started together with UNDP 
<br/>and  if  the  honourable  Minister  can  just  clarify  on  this  allocation.  Which  specific  areas  are  they 
<br/>targeting in terms of the assistance that is provided? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Sorry,  if  you  can  repeat  that,  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Programme 1-1(7) - Governance for Resilient Development in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific (Gov4Res) Project (UNDP) the allocation of $1.5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a new expenditure allocation, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition.    This  is  part  of  the  UNDP  Governance  for  Resilient  Development  in  the  Pacific 
<br/>Project and is to cover risk informed rural development work in Fiji for the period August 2024 to 
<br/>July 2025.  If you look at the details of the agreement as stipulated in amendment 4 and amendment 
<br/>5 of the Letter Agreement of the UNDP and the Ministry signed on 24</span><span>th</span><span> May, the schedule of payment 
<br/>for this agreement is listed as Quarter 3 - $136,000; Quarter 4 - $577,000; Quarter 1 - $10,000 and 
<br/>Quarter 2 - $26,000.  It is a new expenditure allocation for this year’s Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is,  which  specific  areas  are  they 
<br/>targeting?  This is not new, we have started this programme way back in 2020 with the UNDP.  I am 
<br/></span><span>familiar with it, but my question is which specific area? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Essentially  it  is  for  rural  development  works,  like,  access 
<br/>roads, footpaths, water tanks, including desalination plants and in some cases ecological purification 
<br/>systems.  So, there are a range of activities as part of that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, as you well know honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>the development of minimum designs for demonstration projects on community access roads, as the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Finance has shared, footpaths, footbridges, desalination plants, bore holes, 
<br/>concrete  water  tanks,  rain  water  harvesting,  EPS  systems,  risk  informing  and  retrofitting  for  Vio 
<br/>Integrated Rural Electrification Project, the review of the Ministry’s strategic plan and procurement 
<br/>of national rural development database server and software.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  glad  to  see  on  SEG  8,  the  Upgrade  and 
<br/>Enhancement  of  Quarters  ($1.5  million).    I  know  this  has  always  been  a  challenge  for  our  civil 
<br/>servants who live in rural areas.  Is this targeting particular areas, or is it just shared amongst the 
<br/>Divisions, or is there a particular focus on which quarters would be targeted in this budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, it is a general upgrade for all our existing quarters on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a priority basis on the ones that need the attention at the earliest.  So, it is on a priority basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 10 - Project Preparatory Works 
<br/>($100,000).  I would like to know which projects are in the preparatory phase for which $100,000 
<br/>has been allocated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, I will just go through what we have used at the moment, 
<br/>$29,290  has  been  released,  of  which,  $26,826,  which  is  91.6  percent,  has  been  used  for  the 
<br/>construction of a new Government Station at Wainua in Naitasiri.  Preparatory works undertaken 
<br/>include, securing of land for the development of the Government Station at the site, completion of 
<br/>water  reticulation  system  by  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji,  completion  of  partial  site  levelling 
<br/>earthworks, road access and completion of the EFL grid extension at the site.  For the preparatory 
<br/>works, I am sure this is what you are asking for, the construction and upgrade of Government Stations 
<br/>and Quarters planned in the upcoming years, based on the level of preparedness, so full funding will 
<br/>be considered in the following financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, just a clarification  on SEG 8 - Construction of Evacuation 
<br/>Centres ($1 million).  That is a very critical project.  During disasters, it is very important to have 
<br/>evacuation centres as Category 5.  In my last speech, we requested, and preparatory work was already 
<br/>done for Maumi and other evacuation centres. Would the honourable Minister be able to tell us which 
<br/>particular evacuation centre are you targeting next?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  The  evacuation  centres  that  we  will  target  this  year  are  Maumi, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Matacula and one in Ra - the ones that had been approved during your time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Those are two different areas - Rokovuaka and Luvunavuaka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, Rokovuaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Is  that  money  sufficient,  honourable  Minister,  because  this  is  a  very 
<br/>important project? We have seen a number of times during disasters, it is very difficult to get people 
<br/>together. We always have adverse weather conditions here in Fiji. Is that money sufficient for the 
<br/></span><span>three projects you have just mentioned? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Nath, you will notice that this $1 million  is a new 
<br/>allocation. In the 2024-2025 Budget, we have put in request for the completion of 13 new evacuation 
<br/>centres. You will appreciate that not everything will be done in one year, so it is a new allocation. 
<br/>What  you  are  saying  is,  in  the  past  I  mean  a  lot of  the  evacuation  centres  are  existing  buildings, 
<br/>schools, et cetera , owned by communities so there is really a plan to build new ones.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1223 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.-  Just to add that,  Mr. Chairman, IOM is giving us $6 million for this 
<br/>financial year. It is not reflected in this Budget, $1 million is from Government and $6 million is 
<br/>from IOM. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, why I am very concerned because you are the only Ministry 
<br/>that  completed  the  100  percent  of  your  projects.    The  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  has  just 
<br/>mentioned a number of projects. Can he confirm to Parliament that all the projects will be completed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think that is a silly question, Mr. Chairman. I am telling the 
<br/>honourable  Member,  we  have  started  a  programme,  it  is  a  new  allocation  for  13  projects  in  the 
<br/>Central, Western and Northern Divisions, we think that this is an important start.    As I have said, 
<br/>there are lots of evacuation centres, schools, halls that are already there. The Government’s effort to 
<br/>support some of those through the Ministry of Education through other Ministries is also happening.  
<br/>I cannot give you a specific answer to say this will be completed in the next two to three months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I thank the honourable Minister for clarifying the IOM allocation 
<br/>because that was KOICA funded that was supposed to fund those four projects - Maumi, Rokovuaka, 
<br/>Narikoso and Matacula. So, this allocation probably will cater for the other 13.  My question is on 
<br/>the Kadavu allocation on SEG 8 - Government Station $500,000. Can the honourable Minister, just 
<br/>clarify this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is in relation to the quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.-  Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Government station.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- This is for the 2023-2024 update, to-date $999,000 has been released 
<br/>of which $435,828 has been utilised to meet the upgrade and renovation of 17 existing government 
<br/>quarters of which seven quarters are 100 percent completed while 10 are still in their last phase. The 
<br/>remaining  funds  is  committed  to  be  used  by  the  end  of  this  financial  year,  delay  in  project 
<br/>implementation is due to the long rainy weather the country experienced during the cyclone period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1.5 million is allocated to continue with maintenance of quarters in 2024-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2025 and this is to be phased out over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is for 2024-2025 honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You went back again to 2023, 2024? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I started the update from there then I came up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir my question is on SEG 8 and it is to do with the 
<br/>Saliadrau Suspension Bridge for which $300,000 was given last year and again same amount is given 
<br/>this  year.    So,  if  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management can explain to us whether that money was used last year, or the work was not completed 
<br/>and it has been carried forward this year? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- To-date, $70,000 has been released to undertake the Construction of 
<br/>Access Roads as the Government component of the project. The construction cost of the bridge was 
<br/>funded by the Japanese Government, totalling $250,000, for which the aid money was received by 
<br/>the Ministry in March 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initially,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  was  assigned  to  undertake  the  Construction  of  the 
<br/>Suspension Bridge in the financial year 2023-2024 with the support of $250,000 from the Japanese 
<br/>Government  Grassroots  Aid  Programme.  Later  in  the  year,  costing  by  Public  Works  Department 
<br/>increased to close to $700,000 due to escalating price of stainless-steel components.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management decided to take 
<br/>another alternative approach which resulted in the re-advertisement of tender in June 2024 which 
<br/>closes on the third week of July 2024 and with this funding of $300,000 plus the contribution from 
<br/>Japan  of  $250,000,  the  Ministry  will  be  able  to  proceed  with  the  construction  works  in  the  new 
<br/>financial year.  The Ministry was able to construct the Access Road to the new Suspension Bridge 
<br/>site from the $70,000 allocated in the 2023-2024 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 3-1(10) on the allocation on Rural 
<br/>High Risk Water Sanitation Project.  I see a significant increase and we thank the Government for 
<br/>that because the initial allocation was around $500,000 and then it went up to $750,000, now it has 
<br/>gone up to $1 million.  If the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/>Management can just clarify specific geographical regions because of the various needs in those areas 
<br/>and what sort of projects are they targeting as well, Ecological Purification System or Construction 
<br/>of New Water Projects altogether?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, what I can provide is just the project brief is every 
<br/>Fijian has Access to Clean and Safe Water in adequate quantities.  In addition, this is also to ensure 
<br/>that every Fijian has that right.  Just an update to date $723,555 or 90.4 percent of the total funding 
<br/>has been utilised to undertake the construction of 469 Sanitation Projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management will continue 
<br/>with the Construction Installation of Ecological Purification System and Sanitation facilities and the 
<br/>increase is just due to the increase in requests from around Fiji that we have received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, it is a supplementary question related to the same.  My 
<br/>question  is,  just  a  while  ago,  the  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  mentioned  that  under  Village 
<br/>Transformation,  they  are  taking  sanitation  projects.    Now,  we  hear  that  the  Minister  for  Rural 
<br/>Development is also doing some sanitation projects.  Why is it not placed in one place for sanitation-
<br/>related matters, if the honourable Minister for Finance can clarify that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think it is a very good question.  What we are moving away 
<br/>from is centralising everything which used to be kind of a </span><span>modus operandi</span><span> in some sense.  So, the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Rural  Development  undertakes  rural  housing  projects  as  well.    The  village  setup  is 
<br/>different to settlements, so I think the Ministry of Rural Development is also well placed to do some 
<br/>of these as well in terms of the other projects, particularly the rural housing projects, and we do not 
<br/></span><span>want to just burden one Ministry to do everything in every setting and every circumstances and the 
<br/></span><span>requirements are also very different.  It just helps to allocate this in different Ministries.  Sanitation 
<br/>is like a mainstream issue, so every Ministry in the whole of Government is concerned about proper 
<br/>sanitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Just to add to that, Mr. Chairman, because of the nature of the Ministry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we look after all rural communities, not only just the iTaukei communities. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1225 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I also wish to clarify on that allocation because 
<br/>health is a big player in this particularly because of typhoid areas.  That is why I asked about the 
<br/>geographic region because health has what they call the “red zones”, and that should always be the 
<br/>priority because we had the outbreak in Ra and other places.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On SEG-10, Seafearing Entrepreneur Assistance Subsidy, I know that this is beneficial to the 
<br/>maritime islands particularly.  If the honourable Minister can just give an outline of how this was 
<br/>taken up by the four geographic Divisions last year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- It was rolled out to the areas mostly around the coastlines of Fiji in 
<br/>Viti  Levu,  Vanua  Levu  and  the  maritime  islands.    The  initiative  now  is  known  as  the  Seafarers 
<br/>Entrepreneur Assistance or SEA Subsidy, which furthers our longstanding commitment to the self-
<br/>studying culture in our maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Around 90.4 percent  of  the total  funding has been utilised.  We see that  most of this was 
<br/>utilised in the Northern and Western Divisions, the Eastern Division as well, so the Central Division 
<br/>is slow on the uptake in the last financial year.  We will look at updating that and see how we can 
<br/>increase our commitment to the Central Division in this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I was basically looking at the Rural and Outer 
<br/>Island Programme on SEG10 at a sum of $3 million.  Firstly, I would like to ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister, there does not seem to be any project that is under this heading.  Basically, it is a wider 
<br/>heading on Rural and Outer Island Programme (ROI) but it does not indicate what programme it is.  
<br/>If he clarifies that, then I would be able to raise my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  out  of  the  $2.5  million  provided  under  ROI  in  the 
<br/>financial year 2023-2024, the Ministry was able to expend $1.72 million or 78 percent of the total 
<br/>funding allocated.  More than 103 kilometres of rural farm roads were constructed - 75.5 kilometres 
<br/>of rural farm roads were constructed in the Northen Division, connecting the interior of Macuata and 
<br/>Cakaudrove  Provinces.    The  road  construction  cut  across  three  different  major  routes,  including 
<br/>Nakedra/Sese Road, Nasasa to Valevoni Road and connecting access to Nabuasoqosoqo.  More than 
<br/>77,000 families were directly assisted under this new rural farm road in the North. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Western  Division  a  total  of  16.9  kilometres  of  new  farm  roads  were  constructed, 
<br/>covering the highlands of Ba, spreading across Nadala, Vatalevu, Nadrau, Natawa, Navunitawa and 
<br/>Nausocoko.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Central  Division,  a  total  of  5.9  kilometres  of  farm  roads  were  constructed  in  the 
<br/>Province of Namosi, including the villages of Mau, Nakavika and Vunidavo.  The Ministry was also 
<br/>able to upgrade five kilometres of farm roads in Navuloa, Nasaumatua and Vunivunisa in Levuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance  were  also  geared  towards  the  fisheries  and  forestry  sector  with  a  total  of  48 
<br/>projects which includes seven in the Central Division, 17 in the Eastern Division, 12 in the Northern 
<br/></span><span>Division and 12 in the Western Division, and are earmarked to be completed in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has  also  obtained tender approval  in  March 2024 for three years which  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support land preparation for agriculture, complementing the existing interventions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the 2024-2025 budget of $3 million is allocated to continue with the implementation of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Programme.  It will be phased out over the years.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  since  the  ROI  Programme  is  being 
<br/>mentioned here, I was wondering if I could put a motion to increase the allocation.  I am just thinking 
<br/>of the maritime islands such as Matuku and Moala.  Those two islands have constructed their roads 
<br/>but basically it is overgrown, and it is not being used for the last four years or so.  Also, the South 
<br/>end of Kadavu from Nabukelevu where there is a farm access roads are nearly required to be built. I 
<br/>thought if there is no sufficient fund to cover those maritime islands, I would ask for a raise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, when we were discussing this with the Ministry 
<br/>and the Permanent Secretary, we were mindful of all other allocations within the Ministry and the 
<br/>capacity to actually execute and do all these.  We think that we are actually increasing the budget 
<br/>from $2.5 million to $3 million, and given all the other activities within the Ministry, we think that 
<br/>the increase for this year is a right allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, more could be considered, and I am sure there are other programmes for the maritime 
<br/>islands that the Ministry is also looking at, so I think it will be like farm roads, et cetera.  That is all 
<br/>ongoing  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  has  a  number  of  programmes.    FRA  has  a  number  of 
<br/>programmes, so I think there is enough money allocated so I would say to the honourable Member, 
<br/>we can look at some of things next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Sir, is there is allocation and I just feel guilty because every 
<br/>time I go out to these two islands of Moala and Matuku, I forgot the other islands.  They request for 
<br/>the upgrade of this road because it has already been built and is overgrown because the roads are not 
<br/>being used.  So, if the allocation is there, then I will withdraw my motion to increase the allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, $3 million is sufficient for us to cover all these works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You withdraw your motion honourable Member.  We have a motion on 
<br/>Programme 5-1 by honourable Koroilevasu.  Before I offer the floor to the honourable Koroilavesau 
<br/>to elaborate on his motion, I will offer the floor first to you, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, you have gone past Programme 4-1, so we will just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>flow with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, this is another area of neglect, especially in 
<br/>the maritime isolated communities, not only in Lau, Lomaiviti and Kadavu, but also in the Western 
<br/>and the Northern maritime islands, Cikobia and the islands close to Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  my  visit  to  these  islands,  I  have  seen  the  struggles  that  they  have  gone  through, 
<br/>especially, the damages that they had gone through the cyclones.  They basically just put roofing 
<br/>irons together and are living under those conditions.  If there is an allocation for the rural housing, if 
<br/>that does not include that, then I will propose to put a motion to increase the allocation to look after 
<br/>those isolated communities in the islands around Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister, there is an allocation of $3 million here, with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>same as the other one we have just addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  $3  million  budgetary  allocation,  we  believe,  is 
<br/>sufficient to cover all the requests that will be coming this year.  It depends also on the capability and 
<br/>the capacity that we have within the Ministry to handle this work.  That is why we have limited it at 
<br/>$3 million,  and it  is  done according  to  the applications  that  we receive  from  the members  of  the 
<br/>public, because this is done on the one-third and two-third model.

<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, if it is my thinking that these communities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be assisted through whatever is being allocated here, then I do not need to move a motion again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I can discuss that with you later and see how many of those are there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  wanted  to  ask  the  honourable  Minister, 
<br/>because the design probably has changed from the previous one, so with the new design what is the 
<br/>one-third?  People  will  be  listening  now,  for  those  who  will  be  interested  to  be  included  in  this 
<br/>programme?  What is the one-third contribution now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, the design you are talking about honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition is the 24 by 16 design that I believe has started in the past and that is what we are 
<br/>continuing with at the moment.  It has its own ablution facilities just beside it, and we are continuing 
<br/>to work on seeing the needs of the people, as people start travelling overseas and come back, their 
<br/>needs start to change.  So, we are trying to take that into consideration as well to see how we can do 
<br/>some other designs and may be they can afford it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also working and exploring with FNPF, if we can get the one-third contribution from 
<br/>them.  The Scheme 3 using the wood timber,  they have pine or mahogany as their contribution and 
<br/>that  is  also  part  of  this  model  that  we  are  using.  You  are  asking  how  much  is  the  one-third 
<br/>contribution? I think at the moment it is about $12,000 and above, looking at the kind of designs that 
<br/>we are working on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also working on termite free kind of designs require retarded and CAT 5 certified design as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 18 agreed to.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 1-3(5).  Just a clarification from the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  on  the  Rapid  Response  Infantry  Combat  Group.  I  think  this  is  a  new  group 
<br/>within the 3FIR. Just seek some clarification on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  This  is  a  3  FIR  company  within  the  3</span><span>rd</span><span>  battalion,  specifically  
<br/>readiness  for  HADR  Deployment  in  particular,  and  special  capability  in  other  areas,  counter-
<br/>terrorism and other special requirements that Fiji Police do not have that the Military needs to build 
<br/>capability for, so counter-terrorism is one of those.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Sir, that $300,000, I think it is for their .. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is actually for the sustainment of the company. It is part of 
<br/></span><span>the battalion but to keep that company going and their training for their rapid response course would 
<br/>require that kind of funds to keep them going, especially the training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I recall that in one of my private visits to Sinai, the honourable Leader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Opposition was in charge of this Rapid Response Unit.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, if I may also add, you are right to suggest that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also to procure special equipment for them for the role that they are needed for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-5? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- If the honourable Minister can give a clarification. It does 
<br/>not really have a number on Programme 1-5 but it just says, Aid-in-Kind - Procurement of Patrol 
<br/>Boats (Japan) - $6 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Japan is donating patrol boats. It is not anything 
<br/>close to the old TTBs or the current Guardian-class, these are exactly the same type of boats that the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force have - the small coastal boats, and also the rubber dinghies. That is what Japan is 
<br/>providing for us next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am satisfied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.  The much smaller ones I suppose, not from the ones that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you are used to captaining.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- These are for coastal waters only.  These are the small boats that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the police have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The police have it, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is a grant from Japan, Sir, it is free. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think they have just come out of that situation, they are now building 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aircraft carriers, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I apologise, I think the use of the words “patrol boat” will give 
<br/>the technical experts a little bit of, they will be querying but they are not patrol boats that we would 
<br/>normally have here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG 8 it is very interesting for me that we have 
<br/>HADR Storage with the Territorial  Force $100,000.  Can you please elaborate what that is about 
<br/>because I do not see it in last year’s Budget too? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, HADR is one of the functions in peace time of 
<br/>the RFMF in assisting the State.  The TF is one big aspect of that, the units have their own special 
<br/>areas where they store their HADR equipment and with the Territorial Force in Nasinu, they need to 
<br/>have a HADR facility also constructed for their benefit for that are currently manning the TF unit 
<br/>and also for the Territorial Forces that will be deployed if there is a need to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is on Programme 2-2(5).  I see that 
<br/>there is $50,000 for Official Passports for 2 FIR for Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) but I 
<br/></span><span>looked at the next one which is 1 FIR, those that are serving in Golan and Iraq. there is no facility 
<br/></span><span>there for Official Passport even though they need it also.  My question is whether that $50,000 for 
<br/>the Official Passports that is under the 2 FIR MFO covers also the other two mission areas where 
<br/>they will need passports also? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question and it is exactly correct.  That is the passport that is kept by RFMF or other missions it is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>included in this case under 2 FIR MFO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- For the whole lot? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, for the whole lot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I would just like to ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister on SEG 5 under the heading of “Purchase - Personal Equipment”.  It is just that there is 
<br/>Stores and Service for $200,000 and there is another heading of Purchase - Personal Equipment at 
<br/>$1 million.  I just want a clarification of what is that Personal Equipment is? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  This  is  the  procurement  of  Personal  Equipment  for  support 
<br/>services staff deployed to Golan and Iraq.  This includes cover rolls, long johns, winter gloves, winter 
<br/>socks, summer socks, boot calf black, boot scarf, tactical gloves, elbow pads, knee pads, ballistic 
<br/>glasses,  survival  kits,  first  aid  kits, camel pack, runaway pack, fleece jackets,  desert scarf, towel, 
<br/>towel green and uniform green.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now move on.  Parliament will now vote on Head 19 – Republic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fiji Military Forces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 19 approved to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 20 - Fiji Police Force 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is actually related to SEG1 on Personal 
<br/>Emoluments.  I understand the Minister was having some discussions prior to Budget to get the police 
<br/>salary increased.  Did it eventuate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Member for the question, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not in this particular budget this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- For the RFMF and Fiji Police, the Job Evaluation Exercises 
<br/>had already been done and salary progression was given.  The Fiji Corrections Service did not have 
<br/>that,  so  we  provided  these  additional  $12  million  and  in  this  budget,  their  salary  progression  is 
<br/>provided, just like those 5,000 civil servants that had already had a step up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Sorry Sir, but we have passed that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Maybe I went too fast and I did not see you waving your hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on Programme 1-2(7) - Transnational Crime Unit. I 
<br/>see very little money set aside for Transnational Crime Unit which is just around $4,000, so if the 
<br/>honourable Minister can explain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,    the  Transnational  Crime  Unit  is  only  one  set 
<br/>segment of the Transnational Crime Unit that is available in the other border agencies that I know.  
<br/>Sir, FRCS has got one, but these fundings that we have is primarily for the Police and the Unit.  It is 
<br/>actually quite a small unit and they work very closely with FRCS and also other border agencies 
<br/>including Customs and Airports Fiji Limited.

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Programme 1-6 (5) - Search and Rescue Services which is only $5,000.  
<br/>Can the honourable Minister elaborate on it because I feel it is less compared to the money given to 
<br/>the Pacific Institute, this should increase because I have seen Police Officers during rescues where 
<br/>they work overtime and get wet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- He seeks clarification on the figure, honourable Minister. It is too low 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>according to him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is already increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Honourable Minister was talking about Programme 1-6(5). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is actually an increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- It is only $5,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I think it is sufficient for this financial year, $5,000 for Search 
<br/>and Rescue Services.  Not only the Police that is responsible for it but the Navy takes the lead role 
<br/>in search and rescue operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, through you, last time I was fishing in Vatu-i-Ra passage 
<br/>and I have seen people have lost. Unfortunately, I think they were crossing to one of the islands and 
<br/>the engine went off.  There were about eight people in one boat, a 21 footer Fibre and lucky we were 
<br/>there  fishing  around  Vatu-i-Ra  Island  and  we  managed  to  hold  them.  They  did  call  the  relevant 
<br/>officers in Western side but unfortunately nothing was done.  So, what I thought if funds are available 
<br/>or made available, to increase there would definitely be more assistance to the Police officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I think we have increased the allocation this time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and it should be okay for now as far as we are concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think what he means this is just for coordination but there is 
<br/>another $250,000 in the Ministry of Home Affair’s budget. So search and rescue does not just mean 
<br/>that it is only for people there but there are various other allocations within the Ministry to support 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Thank  you,  but  for  that  particular  incident,  honourable  Nath,  any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister could have been the first respondent to that case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman very well said.  But, unfortunately, the network 
<br/>in that areas is zero. It is a black spot, they could not connect.  When they drifted a little bit further, 
<br/>they could not connect to anyone.  They drifted off the Vatu-i-Ra passage alongside Yadua closer to 
<br/>Natovi.  They could not connect to anyone. We had to go for miles to assist them.  If the honourable 
<br/>Minister said it is okay then no problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, observation and a question to the honourable Minister. I 
<br/></span><span>was looking at the other programmes previously, I know we cannot go back but just an observation. 
<br/></span><span>I have seen in the previous programmes and activities you have Dog Handlers Allowance and in the 
<br/>Northern Division there  is no Dog Handlers Allowance.  We do not have a Dog Unit in Northern 
<br/>Division?  There  are  plenty  dogs  there  I  am  sure  the  Police  trained  dogs.  Vanua  Levu  is  a  very 
<br/>important section of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- What dogs are you referring to?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1231 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member is right, we do not have 
<br/>one in the North but plans are there to also reintroduce the dogs in Taveuni that is where we had 
<br/>them, not in Labasa but in Taveuni.  Not the tracker dogs but the sniffer dogs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- So these are the drug sniffing dogs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, that is part of their job, including sniffing money as well, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but they sniff people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I thought you had another question too? Observation and question, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was what you mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- The question was to introduce the Dog Unit in the  Northern Division or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- The short answer is, yes, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I do not have a SEG to mention, but the discussion is 
<br/>so interesting that I wanted to ask the honourable Minister, last year you introduced a new programme 
<br/>called Beat Patrol.  Is that programme still continuing?  Over the year, did you find that programme 
<br/>effective? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Beat  Patrol is the normal work of the police.  We 
<br/>allocated a special amount last year of $700,000 to help the police.  The responses I am getting right 
<br/>now is that there is a much greater and a bigger presence of the police out there.  That does not mean 
<br/>that the issues have stopped, the issues are still there, but there is a greater presence out there.  Much 
<br/>of that is to do with the new recruits, I think the 400 police men and women that we have just churned 
<br/>out.  We have reallocated resources as well from staff and allow more police beat on the street.  I 
<br/>think it is effective, we have just signed an agreement with the Government of China for the supply 
<br/>of  around  100  Caravans.    This  is  for  police  presence  everywhere;  for  permanent  and  short  term 
<br/>deployment so to speak.  Temporary presence of the police in the six locations with communications, 
<br/>et cetera.  I think that is going to help the police beat in a big way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-9(4),  Minor  Improvements  -  
<br/>Building ($1 million).  Just a question on this, is this targeting the police quarters or office buildings 
<br/>because  one  of  the  things  that  they  have  always  been  crying  for,  for  quite  a  long  time,  just  like 
<br/>Government quarters is the state of the police quarters as well?  I just wanted clarification of this.  
<br/>What are the plans too in terms of looking at their request for the state of their quarters? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, this $1 million is not for the quarters, this is really 
<br/>for work places.  I know that when there are minor plumbing works or minor repair works that are 
<br/>required  in  the  quarters,  as  they  do  everywhere,  they  would  go  and  respond  to  it.    But,  for  this 
<br/>particular  one,  once  we  facilitate  urgent  minor  repairs  that  is  required  at  the  Police  Stations  or 
<br/>Community Posts, office partition and works to be undertaken by police building and maintenance 
<br/>unit.    So,  the  funding  for    accommodation  or  police  barracks  has  to  come  through  a  different 
<br/></span><span>allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-   Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-9(5) – Standard Forms  and Registers 
<br/>($470,000).  I understand there may be some registers that we require but one part of the Government 
<br/>or the Ministry is moving towards digitalisation, will your Ministry also move towards that direction?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, the short answer is, yes.  That is one of the big 
<br/>areas under the police reset.  One of the advantages is that through our partnership, particularly with 
<br/>the AFP and the embedding of their officers to help ours, comes along with it a line of resources that 
<br/>would take forever for us to acquire for our police.  We are talking about things like camera jackets 
<br/>for police and other special equipment that we are unable to cater for, but we would like to have them 
<br/>quickly.  Yes, we are going down that path, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sir, there have been a lot of complaints where certain Police Stations that 
<br/>have  police  patrol  cars,  at  certain  times  they  broke  down  and  they  were  given  one  replacement 
<br/>vehicle. For example, the interior division where Muaniweni is, will your Ministry be looking into 
<br/>the matter of trying to get additional vehicles for other Police Stations like in the interior and not big 
<br/>vehicles from other stations and relocate them to where it is needed?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  those  concerns.  I  think, 
<br/>previously in our  discussions, we talked about  particularly Police Posts that do not have vehicles. 
<br/>This is something that we are trying to address.  Well, I have addressed that with the Commissioner 
<br/>of Police because it would appear that the allocation of vehicle is one of the areas that the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force can improve on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things, particularly, for Police mobility, in this same study, we want to ensure that 
<br/>our vehicles that are allocated to Police are given to the right place and the right number of vehicles 
<br/>and the kind of vehicles. I am not sure how much study has been done in the past but this is definitely 
<br/>one area in terms of the reset that we want to do.  Yes, definitely, we will make sure that the allocation 
<br/>of vehicles are effective for services to the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, again, this is to  do with SEG 4 about  the issue 
<br/>raised earlier  about the minor improvements and there being a million dollar available for building. 
<br/>My question relates to the Central Police Station (CPS) at Totogo. From what I understand, subject 
<br/>to correction from you, is that there is a particular portion of that building that is a heritage building. 
<br/>The rehabilitation or reconstruction of that, is it included in that million dollars? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  This  fund  is  allocated  for  the  maintenance  and  improvement 
<br/>sector of the Fiji Police to look at repairs in Police Stations and Police Posts, as I had alluded to 
<br/>earlier.  It would include CPS as well but CPS, as you know, is something that Government would 
<br/>have to consider into the future. I think there is  always been some debate about the useful use of that 
<br/>area. There are plans at the moment but the location of CPS is actually now best use of that particular 
<br/>piece of real estate. So, in terms of the maintenance you have asked if they require repairs, for CPS, 
<br/>that is why this fund is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Supplementary question, Sir. I do understand there is a building in there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that has heritage status.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It was relative to that. So, Totogo has a building in there that has heritage 
<br/></span><span>status. Is there any funding available in this budget to ensure that that heritage status can get repaired? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Not specifically as a matter of heritage but because it is a building 
<br/>that is there in the Police Station, if it erodes, then this sum can also be used by the maintenance 
<br/>section to go and repair it.  I know, like the Police Officers Mess, is one of those that is actually on 
<br/>one of the heritage sites. If it needs maintenance, it is small, then it can be taken care of with this sum 
<br/>of money.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments.  Programmes 1-1.

<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG3 – Travel.  Can the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education explain the sudden increase in Travel Budget from $250,000 given last year, to $450,000 
<br/>this year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  increase  includes  local  and  overseas 
<br/>travels for the Minister and the Assistant Minister, as well as the Permanent Secretary and other staff 
<br/>local travel.  It also includes those that attend workshops and meetings abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG7 - Workshop/Consultation/Conference, can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we use universities and also schools that are already available for that instead of using $90,000?

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Minister, if I can help on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Can you just clarify the question again? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  So,  it  is  on  Programme  1-1-(7)  -  Workshop/Consultation/Conference 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>costing $90,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this allocation is a decrease from last year 
<br/>and it is a workshop that is done, together with the other agencies, like the United Nations and this is 
<br/>the contribution from the Ministry of Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it includes other things like workshops, 
<br/>seminars, training  for integrated FEMIS, data analysis interpretation,  OMRS, HR procedures  and 
<br/>Procurement. So, a lot of internal training also happens with the Ministry of Finance as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have two questions.  First on SEG6 and SEG7.  I 
<br/>will start with SEG6 - Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Grant increased from $2.6 million to 
<br/>$4.2 million.  If the honourable Minister for Education can explain how this additional grant will be 
<br/>utilised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increase is intended for the Commission 
<br/>to carryout intensive survey to identify and register all non-registered higher education institutions 
<br/>operating in Fiji and the survey includes a nation-wide campaign and other related works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question  on  that,  I  am  a  bit 
<br/>confused because my question is on TSLS - SEG6 - Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service ($4.2 
<br/></span><span>million). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increased budget is to cater for the salary 
<br/>increase,  increase  in  building  rent.    They  are  moving  to  a  new  location,  HR  Development  Plan, 
<br/>Website upgrade and Mobile Apps.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you.   My last question is on SEG7 - Implementation of National 
<br/>Action Plan - Gender Based Violence Against Women and Girls where $50,000 is allocated.  My 
<br/>question to you is, how were these grants used last year and how will it be used this year? What 
<br/>outcomes are you trying to achieve from this funding? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, the utilisation rate for last year was around 90 
<br/>percent, basically, on awareness and education campaign that is provided to teachers and stakeholders 
<br/>of the school.  So, this is what we will continue to do in terms of women in leadership and other 
<br/>similar training programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programmes 1-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman on SEG5, I have noticed an increase of $244,000 for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>library services.  How will this money be utilised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Library Software. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Library Services on Activity 2(5)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You mean National Library Week? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- No, Library Services.  I have seen an increase of around $244,000.  It is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special School Library Scheme ($50,000)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- This allocation will be used to purchase resources such as books, 
<br/>tables, chairs, shelves, rugs for the school library setup and we will work within this approved budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, there is a motion here by honourable Ketan Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is to do with Programme 2-1(6).  Would you mind elaborating on your motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 21-2-1(6) - Free Education - Government Primary Schools: Year 1 - 8 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>($260,000) be increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  The  current  funding  jeopardises  our  commitment  in  providing  quality 
<br/>education  for  all  children,  particularly  those  from  lower  income  families.  Adequate  funding  is 
<br/>essential for ensuring that primary schools have necessary resources, so these are teaching materials, 
<br/>infrastructure and support services to deliver a high standard of education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, by increasing this budget, we can enhance the learning environment, produce 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>various education and promote equal opportunities for all children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, while the Honourable Minister for Education 
<br/></span><span>is looking at that, I am not sure what he means by that motion.  I mean, the overall budget has been 
<br/>determined based on proper statistics - how many students are there, how many classrooms are there, 
<br/>so the general statement about improving quality, et cetera, that is whole of Government approach 
<br/>for honourable Minister for Education’s effort.  So, I think the allocation is adequate, as the Minister 
<br/>will tell himself.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1235 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The allocation is adequate Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  The  allocation  is  adequate,  honourable  Ketan  Lal.  So,  are  you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdrawing your motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- No, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.  So, we will put that to the vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on Programme 2-3(7) - Verification for Students’ with 
<br/>Disability, a new budget item. My question to the honourable Minister is, how do you intend to use 
<br/>this data? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Sir,  these  are  most  of  the  mainstream  schools  that  we  have 
<br/>currently that have students with the special needs.  Sometimes, they are not being probably identified 
<br/>and this is a programme that is used to identify through the assistance of the respective schools, Heads 
<br/>of School and allow them to be classified not only in the mainstream school but become a special 
<br/>inclusive school as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is, on Programme 3-1(1) – Personal Emoluments.  I see 
<br/>that this has been reduced from last year’s budget to $50,358. So, if the honourable Minister can 
<br/>explain this reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, in Programme 3-1(1), there is an overall increase 
<br/>to address the increase in teachers that are eligible for the increase.  The separation in terms of the 
<br/>respective call centres, they may have some showing a decrease but overall, there is an increase in 
<br/>SEG 1 allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Perhaps,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finance can explain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Minister is right but I can just give you the 
<br/>details.  This  budget  was  increased  to  $1.8  million  in  the  current  financial  year  to  cater  for  the 
<br/>recruitment of 84 teaching positions. So, these teachers will now be paid from Programme 3-2 and 
<br/>Programme 3-3 so that is why it shows the reduction on the budget this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have a motion here from honourable Premila Kumar.  Would you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduce your motion, Madam? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my motion is to decrease SEG 5 which is rations  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$1.4 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>
<div><span>1236 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Would you elaborate on your motion, Madam? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  each  year,  the  Government  allocates  around  $2.8 
<br/>million  in  ration  support  to  Government  schools.    However,  no  such  support  is  extended  to  non-
<br/>Government schools that offer boarding services.  For instance, boarders at Natabua High School 
<br/>pay $70 per term, ACS pays $50 per term, which includes food.  However, boarders at schools like 
<br/>Ballantine Memorial School, just an example, and there are many others, are charged $300 per term 
<br/>plus $100 PTA levy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now there are children from extremely poor families travelling as far as Rakiraki to enrol in 
<br/>these schools.  These are non-Government  schools.   Typically, we have found children attending 
<br/>Government schools funded by taxpayers’ money, they come from families of ex-students, doctors, 
<br/>lawyers, teachers, civil servants, army officials, and people who are in the executive positions, even 
<br/>politicians.  These are the leads of our society and these families can pay for their children’s boarding 
<br/>fee.  That is my argument.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  means  test  is  the  best  way  to  address  this  disparity.    As  highlighted  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Women and Children, as she said welfare must start with the families, there is no better 
<br/>place to begin that by making well-to do parents pay for the food rations or pay a slightly higher 
<br/>boarding  fee.    Additionally,  students  studying  in  non-Government  schools  who  come  from  poor 
<br/>families, actually they do deserve a level playing field.  Why cannot the taxpayer’s money allocated 
<br/>to  these  schools  be  redirected  to  schools  like  Ballantine  Memorial  School  just  to  help  the  poor 
<br/>families  who  are  trying  to  send  their  children  to  get  the  education?    So  that  is  my  proposal,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I find the logic a bit hard to understand from 
<br/>honourable  Kumar.    Every  school  has  all  kinds  of  students.    It  is  not  quite  true  for  her  to  say, 
<br/>Government schools have invariably, there might be.  I went to a Government school and 90 percent 
<br/>or  at  least  70  percent  to  80  percent  of  us  at  that  time  came  from  rural  backgrounds,  farming 
<br/>backgrounds  and  poor  households,  subsidised  by  the  Government.    So,  I  think  that  is  a  bit  of  a 
<br/>generalisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even in non-Government schools, you have a mixed group.  I was surprised that you want a 
<br/>reduction.  I think what you should have suggested, in fact the per capita grant to all the other schools 
<br/>are there, it would be better.  I think this is something that we can look at in the future, but to suggest 
<br/>a reduction in this, might be a bit illogical, because I suspect that a lot of students in these Government 
<br/>schools also come from very poor families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I do not agree with the motion that has been put 
<br/>to  reduce  the  boarding  school  and  food  supplies.    I  think  the  amount  that  has  been  provided  is 
<br/>sufficient, maybe not enough in terms of the number of students that are attending the schools. We 
<br/>also trying to encourage the schools through the provision of tractor that was made to assist in the 
<br/>provision of their food supplies. We are also looking after non-Government Schools as a boarding 
<br/>school per-capita too has also been given for Non-Government Boarding Schools. I think that is the 
<br/>responsibility of a government being the manager of Government schools that we need to look after 
<br/></span><span>the students that are in schools in a manner that they can be able to provide good results in terms of 
<br/></span><span>their education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I just want to say to the honourable Minister first that here we are not 
<br/>talking  about  per-capita  grant.  Every  school  gets  per-capita  grant.  I  am  specifically  talking  about 
<br/>boarding schools and not every school is a boarding school.  So, what I have seen that when it comes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1237 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the Government boarding schools, the ration is provided. It is a itemised where is when it comes 
<br/>to the Non-Government boarding schools, it is not there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am trying to say is this that if we really want to create a level playing field, we should 
<br/>do a means test; that is all. Any school whether Government or Non-Government, if the parents can 
<br/>afford,  we  should  increase  the  boarding  fee  for  them.  And  any  child,  no  matter  which  school  or 
<br/>boarding school they go to, if the parents are not earning enough they cannot support that assistance, 
<br/>that is where we should assist them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Given  that  the  explanation  has  been  provided  by  the  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and as well as the honourable Minister for Education, we will now 
<br/>put this to the vote.  The motion is to decrease the rations by $1.4 million that is for Programmes 3-
<br/>2(5).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I just wanted to make a comment, if I can, Sir?  I would 
<br/>suggest that the defeated motion, I ask Government to look at all boarding schools and see if they 
<br/>could be assisted in the same way that the Government Schools are assisted in provision of funding 
<br/>for rations.  Why I am saying that, Sir, I was educated at Lelean Memorial School and the same this 
<br/>happens. We eat what we call </span><span>tavioka kadrala</span><span>, tinned fish with curry cassava.  So, basically because 
<br/>we have to pay our school fees to be able to survive. The school fees that we pay, we go and buy 
<br/>cartons of tinned fish and we ration it.  We eat dhal and rice.  All I am suggesting is Government 
<br/>could consider assisting rations for Non-Government Boarding Schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  my  question  is  on  Programme  4-1-(5),  if  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education can explain there is no allocation for Development and Rollout 
<br/>of Moral and Civic Education?  If he can give us some information in relation to how this money 
<br/>was used last year and whether this activity has been completed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- What SEG is that, Madam? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 5 on Civic and Moral Education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  It  is  not  in the Budget  book. I can get  back to  you to  get  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update on something that is not in the Budget book for this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It used to be there but it is taken out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was a one-off programme and it has been completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  So,  because  that  programme  was  rolled  out  when  I  was  there,  the 
<br/>whole idea was  to  continue with  Civic and Moral  Education not  only  up to  Class 3 but it should 
<br/></span><span>continue till Class 8 and then Life Skills will come in at secondary level.  The fact that I see there is 
<br/></span><span>no more funding, so I am sort of a bit concerned whether there is a continuity of that programme for 
<br/>the whole of the primary school or because we have reached Year 3 and that is it.  We are not going 
<br/>to go forward, so maybe the honourable Minister for Education will clarify that to me later on. That 
<br/>is fine.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 6-1(8) as far as Upgrade and Enhancement 
<br/>is concerned, I cannot see Vatuwaqa Primary School on the list because for this particular school, 
<br/>some  rooms  were  damaged  and  destroyed  and  that  was  way  back  in  December  2022.    Can  the 
<br/>honourable Minister explain, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman,  the Vatuwaqa Primary School as we know the 
<br/>history was burnt down in 2022 and later last year we had requested for the Fire Report which took 
<br/>time to be submitted to the Ministry of Education and it came after the Budget submission.  This used 
<br/>to be a Government school but is now being operated by Trustees as honourable Hem Chand would 
<br/>be aware. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The need for the school is well noted and this is something that would be considered in the 
<br/>Social  Infrastructure  Programme  of  the  Vuvale  Partnership  that  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance we were part of the launching last week.  However, we are still 
<br/>awaiting the suggestions and the request from the Trustees of the school which we are trying very 
<br/>hard to find and locate where they are right now.  So, that is why it has been missing because they 
<br/>need to initiate the request because it is under their guidance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  if  I  can  just  add,  I  had  spoken  on  this  when  I 
<br/>responded to the Budget Address and I know the honourable Prime Minister was not here.  I appeal 
<br/>to him again if maybe we just go and find a way to build it quickly otherwise the very good buildings 
<br/>that are standing now will just keep on deteriorating.  I appeal to you Sir, that we can go and do this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just an addition to that, the current students 
<br/>that used to school in that school are in the other schools nearby whilst the discussions are ongoing 
<br/>regarding the rebuilding of the school.  Going forward, we would like to see whether that school is 
<br/>enough  for  just  a  primary  school  or  if  it  can  also  accommodate  primary,  secondary  and  possibly 
<br/>TVET or whatever can be allowable in that limited space that is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 8-1? Honourable Usamate has got three motions, all to do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with Programme 8. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I actually put in three motions that are all related, so I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can just refer to them altogether, if that will be okay? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Is it of the same too?  Programme 8? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, Mr. Chairman - same Programme and same Activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Okay, I will allow that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My motion  is  in  relation  to  first  of all 
<br/>reduce the grant to Pacific Polytech by $3 million because I believe that, that money is better utilised 
<br/>elsewhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other part of my motion is to take out the $5 million USP Outstanding Grant from the 
<br/></span><span>University of the South Pacific and both of these funds ($5 million plus $3 million) to be added on 
<br/>to the Fiji National University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe that this is the way that we can try to address the skill shortages that we have.  The 
<br/>reason that we are trying to provide money for Pacific Polytech was because they provide TVET 
<br/>short term training programmes.  Those short term training programmes have been done by FNU for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ages for a long time all over Fiji.  The programmes at FNU lead to formal qualifications.  A lot of 
<br/>the  one-day  programme,  two-day  programmes  are  done  by  smaller  institutions.    They  do  not 
<br/>accumulate  into  a  formal  qualification.    When  you  carry  out  training,  there  are  various  levels  of 
<br/>competency at which trainings undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you carry a one-day training, the only thing that you can get out of it is knowledge which 
<br/>is the recall, which is the lowest form of knowledge.  If you want to have training programmes that 
<br/>lead to someone becoming employable, you need to do that in a more systematic manner and that is 
<br/>what we have at FNU.  You have the NTPC, you have all their various programmes that provide their 
<br/>training programme.   So that is the gist of my motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To reduce the money from Pacific Polytech ($3 million), remove the outstanding grant for $5 
<br/>million going to USP, that $8 million to give it to FNU so that they deliver the kind of service that 
<br/>this country needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Ketan Lal has withdrawn his motion as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, you have any comments to make on these three motions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, on the motion by honourable Usamate, I strongly 
<br/>oppose the motion to reduce the Pacific Polytech basically because that is all the funding for higher 
<br/>institutions are being monitored and managed by Higher Education Commission and in this particular 
<br/>instance, the number of students that have graduated from Pacific Polytech in the last year is over 
<br/>1,200. I think that is quite a big number for an institution that has recently been started.  But even the 
<br/>funding that has been given, it is not a handout to all these institutions. There are proper mechanisms 
<br/>in  place by the Higher  Education Commission  to  ensure there is  the  real  purpose in  terms of the 
<br/>achievement of this funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Higher Education Institute is part of the criteria for handing out this funding is for them 
<br/>to provide a destination survey to ensure that those graduates from Pacific Polytech inclusive, FNU, 
<br/>need to highlight whether graduates that come out from institutions are actually employed in the job 
<br/>market, Mr. Chairman.  So, I do not agree with the motion by the honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD- Sir, this is one of the most ridiculous motions that I have ever 
<br/>had to speak on this Parliament. I mean, this is coming from an honourable Member who was part of 
<br/>a government that terrorises Higher Education Institutions in this country. They completely restricted 
<br/>academic freedom, they interfered in the governance structure of tertiary institutions, including the 
<br/>University of the South Pacific.  They did not pay the grant, they did so many damage to Fiji and the 
<br/>region as a result of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are issues at FNU during their time, their interference and today with this motion, they 
<br/>want  the  Government  to  interfere  in  the  independent  process  for  determining  funding  for  Higher 
<br/>Education Institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a Higher Education Commission there which monitors, registers, which looks at the 
<br/>number of student qualifications.  There is a qualification framework, so I do not know what is wrong 
<br/>with these people.  I just cannot understand what is wrong with them in trying to attack institutions 
<br/>which are providing qualifications

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  not  know  where  they  get  this  rubbish  from.    The  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission monitors the qualification.  They have so many steps of qualification where people have. 
<br/>The honourable Minister for Education is right when he says that the Higher Education Commission 
<br/>determines this  and if they have  any big  issues, they should look  go and  get  the details  from  the 
<br/>Higher Education Commission on how these institutions are registered, how they are monitored, how 
<br/>they are reviewed and how the funding model works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, this is really a silly motion and we do not support it.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want to speak on the motion too, honourable Ketan Lal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sir, my motion was the same, maybe if I can contribute something.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No, no, we handle these three first. These three here have been put into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one.  Honourable Members,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for Education for his contribution and 
<br/>the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. I think we need to be reminded that I am a 
<br/>Member  of  Parliament.    I  sit  here,  I  represent  people  just  because  we  have  an  institute  and 
<br/>organisation that says this needs to be done.  As a Member of the Parliament, I have the right to say 
<br/>what I want to say. I do not need the Deputy Prime Minister or anyone else to tell me I did not answer 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also a person that contributed to the development of the Higher Education Commission.  
<br/>It is the organisation that was under me that developed the first National Qualifications Framework.  
<br/>I was fundamental, I know it through and through.  That is an area that I understand, Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance, you need to understand that.  I have the right as the Member of 
<br/>Parliament to say what I want to say, and I know that business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I believe that what has been happened, the decision is wrong.  I believe that decision is wrong 
<br/>and I do not need you to question my intelligence and my authority to say what I want to say in this 
<br/>Parliament.  I do not like the fact that you belittle people who go against what you say.  You have to 
<br/>learn to respect others in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, I believe that my motion will help to alleviate the struggles that we have in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this country, to develop competent people and that is why I stand by that motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, I will now put that to vote.  The motions are three 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being motions put into one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, honourable Ketan Lal?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, I have a question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-  We have finished with this.  I am sorry.  When I raised the question for 
<br/>you to reply, you said you have finished.  That is being handled by honourable Usamate.  I am sorry 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I will have to go and resume my Speaker’s Chair in order to adjourn 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  that brings  us to  the end of the sitting today and 
<br/>thank you so much for all your contributions.  I thought it was a smooth one until what erupted during 
<br/>the very tail end of our sitting today.
