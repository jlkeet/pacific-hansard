<h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- 4.4.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- 4.4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And honourable Usamate said, never in the history we have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had this high inflation rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, 4.4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If you look at the inflation rate during their time and he was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>part of that government.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No, I was not! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, you joined after that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In 2009, it was 6.8 percent; in 2011, it was 7.7 percent; and  
<br/>in 2008, it was 6.6 percent.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two Budgets, to help our people and to 
<br/>address the cost of living challenges, we maintained zero percent VAT on 21 items and also added 
<br/>prescribed medicines to make it 22 items.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have sugar, flour, rice, dhal, tea, potatoes, onions, garlic, canned fish, cooking oil, 
<br/>salt, liquid milk, powered milk, baby milk, sanitary pads, soap, soap powder, toilet paper, toothpaste, 
<br/>cooking  gas,  kerosene  and  prescribed medicine  all on zero VAT and these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are 
<br/>basically the first things that people buy in their baskets.  In fact, this list was what we had proposed 
<br/>before the 2018 Elections, and they just copied the same list and included that.  We are very happy 
<br/>that they did that.  This is just ahead of the 2022 Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  So,  they  talk  about  microwave,  but  that  was  the  real 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  In  the  last  Budget,  we  also  increased  the  Social  Welfare 
<br/>Allowances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by 25 percent for those above the age of 70 years and 15 percent for 
<br/>those  below  70  years.    We  increased  the  Government  Pension  and  Aftercare  Allowances  by  15 
<br/>percent.  We had increased the allowances for all our </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> (Village Headmen), </span><span>Mata ni 
<br/>Tikina</span><span>  (iTaukei  District  Representatives)</span><span>,  Turaga  ni  Yavusa</span><span>  (Tribe  Leaders),  Provincial 
<br/>Administrators and District Advisory Councillors. We introduced the $200 per child Back-to-School 
<br/>Support for all families below an income of $50,000, assisting over 200,000 students. Honourable 
<br/>Hem Chand and others were actually lying when they said, “this was a FijiFirst initiative.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Of course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Of course, it was!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What FijiFirst had, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was inflation mitigation 
<br/>measures from August 2022 up to January 2023, and it was $1 a day for six months, so $180.  Sir, 
<br/>that was an election gimmick, before the Elections.  A $1 a day for six months to give $180 and it 
<br/></span><span>was paid through the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are lying and saying, “Back-to-School Support”.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1179 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  announced  that,  he  was  not  thinking  about  the  next 
<br/>Election last year.  As soon as we came into Government, we realised that our students, our rural 
<br/>children, needed this support and that is why we did that.  It was not an election gimmick, and it was 
<br/>a new measure, a flagship measure by the People’s Coalition Government to help our students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Flagship? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, it is a flagship initiative by this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We wrote-off $650 million in TELS debt for 53,000 students, freeing them from the shackles 
<br/>of debt when they started working so that they can use that repayment money to support them.  This 
<br/>was a deliberate policy by the Coalition Government and that idea, thankfully, was mooted by our 
<br/>Coalition partner, the SODELPA Party, before the Elections and we are happy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>we did that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Budget, we are providing over $85 million in pay increases for 38,000 civil servants, 
<br/>who were deprived of salary increase since 2017.  We have taken a bold step to increase the minimum 
<br/>wage rate to $5 an hour, an increase of 25 percent, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Honourable Bala and others 
<br/>claimed that the minimum wage increase is too slow. They should go and look at themselves in the 
<br/>mirror. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they were in government, it took them almost eight long years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to just 
<br/>introduce the minimum wage rate in 2014.  Eight years to just introduce!  That too at only $2 an hour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Then they increased it to $2.32, and later to $2.68 an hour in 
<br/>September 2017, only before the Elections.  We did not do it before the Elections.  Only before the 
<br/>Elections did they announce a four-phase increase from $2.68 to $4 an hour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are talking about why we phased it.   In the 2018, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the Elections, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we were campaigning for $5 an hour and some of them were there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  They  went  around  threatening  garment  factory  workers, 
<br/>saying that Government cannot afford, when the economy at that time was better.  That was the time 
<br/>to raise minimum wages, but they did not.  So, we are increasing the minimum wage rate to $5 based 
<br/>on a comprehensive consultation review by panel of experts, who had undertaken a thorough analysis 
<br/>and consultation with employers, unions and other stakeholders, and we are doing it in two phases 
<br/>as we need also to be mindful of some of the employers who need time to adjust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, Mr. Speaker, and you can see it is happening in the last 18 months already, 
<br/>that unions are negotiating for better conditions and internationally, Sir, including organisations, like 
<br/>IMF.  All evidences show that in  countries  where you suppress unions, where you suppress their 
<br/>leaders and where you restrict employees, the workers of that country would suffer in terms of their 
<br/>pay, et cetera, and this is exactly what happened in this country for the last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  If,  Mr.  Speaker,  workers  were  allowed  over  the  years,  we 
<br/>would not have seen this problem that we are seeing today, and that is what this Government is trying 
<br/>to correct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry and others, talked 
<br/>about the highest cane price for our sugarcane farmers, adding income to our rural communities.  We 
<br/>are paying our rice farmers $1,000 per tonne of rice paddy.  All our cash crop non-sugar farmers are 
<br/>receiving much higher prices for their crops, as well as subsidies, for the first time, unlike when they 
<br/>were only getting it for sugar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, for the first time in the last Budget, we had provided subsidies for weedicide and 
<br/>fertilizer to non-sugar crop sectors, we are extending that list in this Budget and we are continuing 
<br/>with our social support measures, like free education, transport assistance, subsidised electricity for 
<br/>households earning less than $30,000, free medical service through private General Practitioners, et 
<br/>cetera.  So, all those services are being provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me also tell this fact, Mr. Speaker, which will help our honourable Members on the other 
<br/>side to better explain these things to our people. All the support that we are talking about is going to 
<br/>cost the Government about $750 million alone this year.  This is going directly to supporting our 
<br/>people.  Whether you talk about zero VAT on the 22 items, the Government would be putting in 
<br/>about  $250 million  that  we could collect in  taxes into the pockets  of  our people, Back-to-School 
<br/>Support  -  $40  million;  Social  Pension  -  $78  million;  Family  Assistance  -  $44  million;  Disability 
<br/>Allowance  -  $17  million;  Child  Protection  Allowance  -  $17  million;  Electricity  Subsidy  -  $10 
<br/>million;  Water  Subsidy;  Transport  Subsidy;  Scholarships  -  $150  million,  Free  Health  Scheme, 
<br/>Kidney Dialysis, First Home Buyers;  if you put all these together, apart from all the other benefits 
<br/>that people are getting, it is $750 million.  So, all the additional revenue that we have collected from 
<br/>the tax reform, whether it is increasing Corporate Tax, none of them talked about that, that we are 
<br/>not only just burdening the people, but we are being fair and equitable in terms of our tax policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The $100 million additional revenue that we are collecting is all going to look after our people 
<br/>because we realized that before COVID and post-COVID, our people are still transitioning into more 
<br/>income,  better  jobs  and,  therefore,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Government.    We  are  doing  it 
<br/>responsibly, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Honourable Virendra Lal said that this  Budget has nothing for the 
<br/>ordinary people for which they can be proud of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The people are listening, Mr. Speaker.  He does not want the 
<br/>children to get $200.  Let me say this to him, very few supporters who voted for him would not be 
<br/>feeling very proud of him today when they know that this is what he is opposing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me talk about the economy because a lot of comments were made that 
<br/></span><span>the economy is slowing down, there is no confidence and investment is not taking place.  Sir, the 
<br/>economy is not declining, let that be made clear.  The economy is growing, and it is still growing, 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar.  You are an economist, or have you become a bit of an economist now?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have revised the growth forecast from 3.4 percent to 3.8 percent, but it is still growing 
<br/>and there are other commentators who are saying that we may end up with a higher growth than what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1181 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are.  We are not doing it like the cooking that they used to do when they were in Government.  
<br/>We are being very honest because we want people to trust the Government in terms of what we say, 
<br/>so we are not exaggerating and saying that we are going to get 3.5 percent or 3.6 percent. When we 
<br/>know that we are facing headwinds from the slowdown in Australia and New Zealand, the challenges 
<br/>with  our  declining  labour  force  and  challenges  in  other  areas,  we  have  revised  growth  forecast 
<br/>downwards, but the economy is still growing, it is not contracting as misunderstood by some of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the fiscal stimulus and economic optimism provided in this Budget, there is a likelihood 
<br/>that this growth, as I have said, would be revised upwards.  We do not worry about what ANZ and 
<br/>others are saying, we are saying from our assessment that we have revised it downwards, but that 
<br/>there are these other variables that have realised that the growth could be much higher. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are, obviously, taking into account the positive impact of the Budget on some of the areas 
<br/>which will spur private sector investment and as both my Deputy Prime Minister colleagues have 
<br/>said, whether it is tourism or other sectors – agriculture or commercial agriculture - there are a lot of 
<br/>investments almost to the tune of $2 billion in private sector investments.  As I have said, we are 
<br/>making sure that the ease of doing business is improved.  We are fixing our Immigration and all the 
<br/>other bottlenecks that might be there for investment to pick up in a much bigger way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  seeing  some  major  investments  moving  forward  -  new  private  sector  interests  in 
<br/>commercial agriculture, as I have said, outsourcing, ICT, and other new industries that will help grow 
<br/>the economy.  Our efforts, as a whole of Government level, is aimed at raising our growth rate from 
<br/>the current trend of 3 percent to 4 percent or 5 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  big  issue  that  has  been  made  by  some  is  the  expenditure  utilisation.    Again,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we are very honest here.  We provide quarterly updates, and we are not hiding any of 
<br/>these from the Government or from the public.  So, the big hoo-hah about the expenditure utilisation 
<br/>of the Coalition Government and the execution of capital projects, let me put that in context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we might have been slow in the last few months, but we have caught up 
<br/>with quite a bit of it.  We are now projecting that our overall expenditure utilisation to be about 94 
<br/>percent by the time we close this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What about the virement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This includes a 97 percent utilisation of the operating budget, 
<br/>which is understandable, and 85 percent implementation of the capital projects.  I agree that we can 
<br/>further improve on the execution of the capital projects, and we do not make any bones about that 
<br/>when we discuss these things within our own Government. The honourable Prime Minister knows it, 
<br/>everyone knows that execution is very, very important.  But let me share the expenditure utilisation 
<br/>during their time in government, to put matters into context, because it is important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Why didn’t you show us the change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what I want to show, the difference that we are making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2016-2017 Budget, capital budget utilisation, honourable Premila Kumar, was only 
<br/>70.5  percent,  while  the  total  expenditure  utilisation  was  84  percent.    For  the  2017-2018  Budget, 
<br/>capital budget utilisation was only 77.7 percent, while total expenditure utilised was 85.9 percent.  
<br/>For  the  2018-2019  Budget,  Sir,  budget  capital  utilisation  was  only  61.2  percent,  while  total

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure was 74.7 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me bring this very important point, it was not the 
<br/>ineffectiveness or the inefficiency of people executing the project at that time, it was because the 
<br/>government was running into cashflow problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know that, I know that.  This is the briefing I got from my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Before the 2018 Elections, they were running into cashflow 
<br/>problems and that is why before the 2018 Elections, they announced so many things and the execution 
<br/>capital was 62 percent and 74 percent overall.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, they had a 
<br/>negative growth.  The economy contracted because they lied before the Budget.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Anyway,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wanted  to  put  this  into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>context.  We are not trying to justify our execution rate, as I have said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You have just done that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Figures are stuck. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But it is important for our Opposition colleagues to understand what was happening during 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Tell us about virement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Operating capital mix.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You’re just avoiding!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Premila Kumar is just getting too irritating, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I will be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because she cannot take what has been said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Because you’re lying! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You just carry on, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the operational mix, some also claimed 
<br/></span><span>that our  operating to capital mix is 73:27 is low because governments are major providers of social 
<br/>services, like education, health, security, judicial services which are labour intensive, such as Police 
<br/>and  the  Military.    You  generally  require  around  70  percent  expenditures  towards  operational 
<br/>spending.  Similarly, capital expenditure mix is around 30 percent – 70:30, as we can only budget 
<br/>what we can execute which is based on the absorption capacity of the government and that is true for 
<br/>any government.  But we agree that we can do more to beef up on our spending on capital projects. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1183 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  revenue  projection,  this  is  another  area  where  some  of  the  Opposition  Members  were 
<br/>doubting whether our revenue projections are correct.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify that 
<br/>the revenue projection for 2024-2025 is not too optimistic or is not simplistic. I would like to assure 
<br/>everyone that the revenue numbers that are being set are realistic as possible as we can.  No good 
<br/>thinking government would want to overstate revenue for any reason because if we do that, we will 
<br/>get  caught and struggle  with  cashflow problems, so we do not  want  to  do that.  That  is  why our 
<br/>projection is based on very clear analysis and figures and the policies that we have.  As I have said, 
<br/>Government did run into cashflow problems in 2018 and 2019, so there is no real incentive for us to 
<br/>be too optimistic with our revenue numbers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given our successful revenue reforms in the last Budget, we are projecting a total revenue of 
<br/>$3.9  billion,  of  which  $3.3  billion  is  tax  collection,  $0.6  billion  will  be  collected  from  non-tax 
<br/>revenues.  So, we are not making any major changes to the tax, as I have said in my Budget Speech, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I can assure the honourable Members of the Opposition that this revenue forecast is very 
<br/>realistic.  We have worked out very clearly the non-tax revenues, particularly those that come from 
<br/>Government entities, like the Reserve Bank of Fiji and other agencies.  These are already, kind of, 
<br/>determined for this Budget, so there is no dispute and worry about the level of revenue that we are 
<br/>likely to collect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, lack of consultations on the Budget came out as a theme and honourable 
<br/>Ketan Lal made a big deal about it.  This is a government which has had probably one of the most 
<br/>thorough, open, and transparent consultation process on everything that we have done so far in just 
<br/>18 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, contrary to the lies that honourable Ketan Lal was trying to tell, we have 
<br/>done  consultations  during  the  National  Development  Plan,  starting  from  the  Economic  Summit, 
<br/>Fiscal  Review  Committee  Decisions,  multiple  meetings  with  private  sector  institutions,  industry 
<br/>groups, civil society organisations, academia, students, faith-based organisations, Disciplined Forces, 
<br/>and targeted focus group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-We  invited  you,  and  your  former  General-Secretary  (I  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come to him in a minute), refused to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In February 2024, we concluded the nationwide consultation on the National Development 
<br/>Plan, and this was where more than 22,000 people came from all four Divisions.  Many of them came 
<br/>not only to talk about the plan, but we were also told what they wanted in the Budget.   
<br/>  So,  there  was  a  thorough  Budget  consultation  done  as  part  of  the  National  Development  Plan 
<br/>because as I have said, the National Development Plan will be launched in August, and the process 
<br/>has been undertaken thoroughly within the Government.  For any Budget, never before has this kind 
<br/>of consultation done.  I think they should stop lying about no consultation being done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am confident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a lot of what has come out from these consultations 
<br/></span><span>have been reflected in the Budget.  For example, the 1,700 boreholes that we are going to put out in 
<br/>the next one year or two years, came from the people.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are examples, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that came out from the consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  an  issue  about  the  taxing  of  property  income  on  non-profit 
<br/>organisations.      I  wish  to  clarify  the  issue  around  the  taxing  of  business  income  for  non-profit 
<br/>organisations. Firstly, all donations and fundraising activities for charitable organisations are exempt 
<br/>from tax.  Apart from this, business making cash donations to any registered charitable organisation 
<br/>can claim if it has a deductible expense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following the amendment to the Income Tax Act in 2016, non-profit organisations that were 
<br/>engaged in profit-oriented activities were subject to tax only for their business income component.  
<br/>This  policy  ensures  fairness  with  the  tax  system,  as  individuals  or  business  conducting  similar 
<br/>businesses activities were also subjected to taxes.  Otherwise, we would create a difficult playing 
<br/>field for everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a number of non-profit organisations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we picked up, who were 
<br/>starting their commercial arms, some with good intentions and some as a means of tax evasion.  This 
<br/>amendment was to close those loopholes where commercial organisations were setting up non-profit 
<br/>organisations and using that as a way to avoid taxes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another important factor influencing this change was the formation of, as I have said, not 
<br/>only by commercial entities, but other businesses as well.  So, this loophole is going to be closed and 
<br/>that there would be a much better transparency in the way that is applied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ministers have talked about it. We have had 
<br/>some  good  contributions  from  honourable  Opposition  Members  on  drug  and  crime,  but  as  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Home Affairs pointed out quite rightly and emotionally, that if we had dealt 
<br/>with this some years back, we would not be in the situation where we are in now. But I am glad that 
<br/>we now have an environment in this country, the political environment not only in this Parliament 
<br/>but outside of this Parliament where we can all work together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Propaganda! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is not propaganda, look around yourselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  taken  decisive  action,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  respect  to  setting  up  the  Narcotics 
<br/>Bureau and making sure that we put  in  additional money into the activities of the Police and the 
<br/>honourable Minister talked about the major reset of our Police Force and closer collaboration and 
<br/>intelligence sharing with our key security partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of other quick points that I want to respond to, and I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>try and finish as soon as I can after that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the point raised by When the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism 
<br/>and  Civil  Aviation  was  talking  about  the  tourism  receipts,  honourable  Sachida  Nand  confused 
<br/>himself, and he was talking about the figure of $2.9 billion.  The honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>was talking about the tourism receipts, and the honourable Member said, “Oh, because it is only $2.9 
<br/></span><span>billion or something, the contribution of tourism to GDP is much lower.” That is not true.  That is 
<br/>bad economics.  I think you should keep away from trying to understand that because receipts is just 
<br/>one  part  of  the  tourism  industry.  There  are  a  lot  of  spin-offs  -  hotels,  transport,  and  so  the  total 
<br/>contribution of the tourism industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is close to 40 percent of GDP.  Again, I would 
<br/>urge the honourable Member to refrain from talking because when you come here as a Member of 
<br/>Parliament, you have to make sure that what you say is correct.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1185 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Sachida Nand talked about revaluation and, Mr.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, when you talk about revaluation and devaluation, it is a very, very sensitive issue because 
<br/>you do not want to …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Standing Order 18 - Misquoting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Hold on, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I apologise, Standing Order 81(1) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  you  seem  to  be  changing  every  now  and  again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, resume your seat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you may continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I was saying is that he talked about revaluation. This is a very sensitive matter.  When 
<br/>you talk about  revaluation or  devaluation because it can trigger even a discussion of revaluation, or 
<br/>a suggestion of a revaluation or devaluation can  ignite a lot of activities which can be very, very 
<br/>damaging to the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, already, our dollar has appreciated against some of our trading partners and 
<br/>it would be silly to suggest any kind of revaluation of a dollar and also about devaluation. I mean, 
<br/>when we had the devaluation in 2009, there was a major increase in prices in 2000, and it sets a trend 
<br/>of activities for years for us to deal with. So, I would urge him, without understanding the impact of 
<br/>the idea of revaluation and devaluation, he should refrain from talking about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reference by honourable Bala about the EXIM Bank loan, I thought it was unbecoming 
<br/>of the honourable Member.   In fact, it was an insult to our honourable Prime Minister and to the 
<br/>Indian  Prime  Minister  because  that  decision  of  a  100-bed  super  speciality  was  announced  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister of India, together with the honourable Prime Minister of Fiji, and as a 
<br/>grant to build a 100-bed super speciality hospital in this country. And for him to come out and say, 
<br/>“Oh, this might have been traded with the EXIM Bank loan”, I think honourable Bala should correct 
<br/>that, even outside of Parliament, that his information  was wrong, Mr. Speaker, because it is  very 
<br/>important for us to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that honourable Usamate made, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, he made 
<br/>some very good contribution in the last 18 months, but he then traded it off by a little bit of hogwash, 
<br/>by talking about FNPF and the Vatukoula Gold Mine settlement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had promised in 2015 and someone said that they wanted millions of 
<br/>dollars. I do not think so, they were negotiating with the unions in a good faith. This is a government 
<br/>that  has  solved  that  problem  because  we  provided  that  platform  for  our  unions  to  talk  to  the 
<br/>Government to understand the imperatives of resolving that, Mr. Speaker, and that is the leadership 
<br/></span><span>that the honourable Prime Minister has provided on that issue because he visited them before the 
<br/></span><span>Election. This is a promise that we made to them before we came into Government, and we have 
<br/>been able to settle that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we trusted the union leaders.  If you look at the history of unionism in this 
<br/>country,  they  have  been  responsible  leaders.  We  have  not  had  that  kind  of  disruptions  they  were 
<br/>thinking  about  when  they  brought  those  draconian  laws.    We  have  taken  all  that  away,  we  have 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provided a platform and I do not think this will be used as a pretext or as a platform to settle other 
<br/>disputes. I think honourable Usamate is  worried about  dealing with  the  unions.   If he ends up in 
<br/>Government the next time around, I do not know, but you will be very happy if you ever get into 
<br/>Government with the environment that we have created, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to respond to what honourable Usamate said. All 
<br/>I  want  to  say  is  that  some  of  the  things  that  the  Military  Government  did,  without  consultation, 
<br/>without any empathy, without explaining to the people why it was going to do that, caused a lot of 
<br/>pain to a lot of people in the last 16 years in this country. This is a government that is not promising 
<br/>to write every wrong that was done but where it has the means, where it can show leadership, we are 
<br/>correcting that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is not just one issue. I think this is the message that our 
<br/>investors and our people in this country are getting, that this is a government which is not vindictive, 
<br/>which is not creating fear, which is determined to resolve issues that have been pending for years and 
<br/>we are demonstrating that.  The Vatukoula Gold Mine and FNPF is a very clear indication of what 
<br/>we want to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contribution from, should I say, the leader of the loyalist group on the 
<br/>other side, honourable Koya, we can accept  criticism when the intention is  secure or sincere and 
<br/>when there are clean hands - the criticism coming from people who might have some clean hands, 
<br/>but not from someone who happens to be a Member of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am not getting personal. He talked about us not having any 
<br/>creativity,  not  having  any  innovation  in  the  formulation  of  the  Budget.  That  is  laughable,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  That was what he said.  People have said that, honourable Bulitavu said that, but we, 
<br/>as a government, do not want to get into that.  But when the people of this country listen to comments 
<br/>like that, they are jogging their memory, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the last 16 years and saying, “What was 
<br/>there that we had to live with, that we have now got ourselves out of it”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is why this side is the largest Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Premila Kumar can continue to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bask in that glory of being the largest party, but  is for the people to judge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a comment made about the quality of education by honourable Naupoto, I agree 
<br/>with him that the quality of education is very important but what he was insinuating was that the new 
<br/>scholarship  scheme,  based  on  merit  was  going  to  deprive  students  with  lower  marks.    As  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education explained, this is in the interest of all our students and those who 
<br/>may feel that, that information is correct, it is not correct, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  talk  about  quality  of  education,  we  are  talking  about  improving  the  quality  of 
<br/></span><span>learning  and  teaching  environment.    For  the  last  16  years,  in  the  Suva-Nausori  area,  and  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education knows this very well because as soon as he came into Government 
<br/>in his portfolio, he realised that and he picked that up - our quality of teaching.  Honourable Premila 
<br/>Kumar knows this, they know this, that the staff to student ratio in our primary and secondary schools 
<br/>in this area is overflowing.  In some cases, there are 50 students to 60 students in primary school 
<br/>classrooms.  So, as a government, we are working with the Australian Government.  We have signed

<div><span>an agreement already, there is an audit being done in terms of the number of classrooms and schools 
<br/>that we need in the Suva-Nausori area, and that is a very, very clear target for us in the next one or 
<br/>two years to build more classrooms so that we reduce and improve the…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Pipeline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is not pipeline, honourable Usamate, it is happening already.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure all the students who are coming out of Form 6 or Form 7 
<br/>that  the  current  scholarship  scheme  has  a  place  for  each  one  of  them.  If  they  cannot  get  to  the 
<br/>university, if they cannot get to medicine, engineering or a degree, there are things that they can do, 
<br/>qualifications that they can get, and that they will get a scholarship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me now come to my friend and those who talked about Pacific Polytech. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the way they are talking about it, as if Biman Prasad has something to do with Polytech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Of course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Chand was in the Ministry of 
<br/>Education and he knows the process. All higher education institutions are registered and approved 
<br/>by an independent body, the Fiji Higher Education Commission.  They registered Pacific Polytech 
<br/>in 2021 and they are doing a good job by replacing the defunct technical colleges that they set up and 
<br/>wasted $30 million that went down the drain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate talked about the funding for FNU, so let me just explain how funding 
<br/>is  determined  for  all  Higher  Education  Institutions,  including  the  smaller  ones,  Sangam  Nursing 
<br/>School, et cetera.  The submissions by these institutions do not come to the Ministry of Finance, it 
<br/>goes  to  the  Ministry  of  Education,  through  the  Minister  for  Education  to  the  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission. The Higher Education Commission does its analysis, they make a recommendation, 
<br/>they have a formula and then it comes to the Ministry of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance can only (in a limited space), we cannot even increase it, we can 
<br/>only reduce it.  We reduce the funding allocation, the recovery, the amount that they did not pay to 
<br/>USP.  So, we paid $10 million last year and $20 million in the last budget.  This budget they wanted 
<br/>a recovery a bit more, we have reduced it to $5 million only.  Polytech wanted $9 million, that was 
<br/>reduced to $5 million and the Higher Education Commission and all the Ministers who know about 
<br/>Pacific Polytech, who have gone there, and I thank the honourable Tubuna and honourable Tabuya 
<br/>for explaining this to them that somehow there is some conspiracy somewhere.  They are training, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They invited you, go and find out from them during the Open 
<br/>Day.  If you have that thing, go there, but do not ask me that silly question, I am explaining to you.  
<br/>They invited you, they sent you a letter to go there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Higher  Education  Funding  Model,  honourable  Usamate  talked  about 
<br/>reduction in funding for FNU.  There has been a reduction in funding in the past, increase in funding

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>– it does not mean that next year FNU is not going to get more or Polytech is not going to have its 
<br/>budget increased or reduced, just like for Sangam Nursing School, they did not ask for more last year 
<br/>but we as a Government gave them more because we wanted them to train more nurses and because 
<br/>the number was there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is the kind of conspiracy that they come up with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  a  lot  of  talk  about  investment  environment  -  confidence.    Let  me  just  mention 
<br/>before I conclude Mr. Speaker, for the first time, I think after so many years that the confidence of 
<br/>the investors, even if some of them have it in the pipeline, but the confidence that is coming through 
<br/>from the investors, from the people who want to invest is unprecedented (to use their word).  Let me 
<br/>just say this, there is a leading global commercial real estate and investment company (JLL).  This is 
<br/>what  they  said,  “when  compared  with  most  other  markets,  Fiji  investment  fundamentals  have 
<br/>remained and are growing strong and highly attractive in the current environment.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- One last point before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, they made this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>big deal about, 18 months – what have you done?  Sir, 18 months is a long time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You have done nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister  during  the  campaign,  I 
<br/>remember, and he stated this again that there is no way, Mr. Speaker, he did not use that word but I 
<br/>am going to use that, “you cannot Mr. Speaker, Sir, no government in 18 months can deal with every 
<br/>mess that was left to them to deal with.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a fact, Mr. Speaker.  The honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was being very polite, I am not going to be that polite that in 18 months... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Still microwaving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.B.C. PRASAD.- All my colleagues this side pointed out very clearly what  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government has done in 18 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have set this country on a path to stability, security and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with our policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by first of all thanking all the honourable Members and 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Ministers  on  the  Government  side  for  their  very  strong  involved,  participation  in  the 
<br/></span><span>formulation of the Budget.  I know we have had some very good interrogative discussions during the 
<br/>conversation about where and how we need to do things.  I would like to say thank you to all of them 
<br/>including  the  honourable  Assistant  Ministers  for  their  support  and  their  contributions  in  the 
<br/>formulation of the Budget.  I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership, trust 
<br/>and confidence that he has in me and his Cabinet colleagues in putting out this Budget through a 
<br/>process that is open, transparent and accountable.

<div><span>I want to thank my Permanent Secretary and all the senior staff, I asked them for their names, 
<br/>they did not want to give a list of all the names that I wanted to take but I have a great team. They 
<br/>actually feel the freedom, they feel comfortable, they are happy with the way in which we conduct 
<br/>ourselves within the Ministry as opposed to what some of them were going through in the past.  I 
<br/>want to thank each one of them but my special thanks also to Assistant Minister for Finance who is 
<br/>also the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for his contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his openness, for his willingness 
<br/>to  participate  in  forums  with  the  Government.  We  had  a  great  session  at  the  Fiji  Institute  of 
<br/>Accountants Conference and the and the contributions that he made on behalf of the Opposition was 
<br/>quite exemplary.  We appreciate that.  We want to thank all the Independent Members including the 
<br/>loyalists for their contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the concurrence of the Cabinet and on behalf of the Prime 
<br/>Minister, I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to support this Budget and let us move ahead 
<br/>for the good of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to Standing Order 99 (3), the 2024-2025 
<br/>Appropriation Bill of 2024 which is known as the Bill No. 7 of 2024 has been read a second time. 
<br/>Without any questions being put, the Bill and the Estimates now stand referred to the Committee of 
<br/>Supply.  Before I ask the Secretary-General for the next item on the agenda, just let me as a word of 
<br/>caution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please read carefully the directive given by the Supervisor of Elections 
<br/>when the deregistration has occurred for the FijiFirst Party.  She is very clear into what we should 
<br/>refrain ourselves from echoing again.  I understand it is bit difficult to shed that identity of you being 
<br/>a  former  FijiFirst  parliamentarian,  but  again,  by  operation  of  law,  you  are  all  now  deemed  to  be 
<br/>independent, subject to the expiry of the appeal period on 15</span><span>th</span><span> of this month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immediately  after  that,  then  we  should  be  able  to  understand  better  where  we  stand.    But 
<br/>again,  in  between  time,  we  would  like  to  caution  the  26  honourable  Members,  please  refrain 
<br/>yourselves  from  further  identifying  yourselves  with  something  that  has  been  deregistered  by 
<br/>operation of law.  Again, everything is still open for redress, should you seek redress, you have every 
<br/>right to do that, even the appeal period that we are now respecting.  So, when that time comes on 
<br/>15</span><span>th</span><span>, then you would be able to know better where we stand now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  Parliament  will  now  resolve  into  Committee  of  Supply  to  consider 
<br/>each Head in the Budget Estimates.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed on Thursday 
<br/>evening  after which the Committee of Supply will then vote on the Schedules and clauses of the 
<br/>2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, we will attempt to complete the debate and votes 
<br/>on Heads 1 to 21 before we adjourn this evening.  I hope you will bear with us on that.  For the 
<br/>information of all honourable Members, please take note that for the Committee stage, I will sit at 
<br/>the table with the Secretary-General and Members will refer to me as “Mr. Chairman”.  The mace 
<br/></span><span>will be placed on the lower bracket, and that signifies that the Parliament is in Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please take further note that the Secretary-General will announce each 
<br/>Head separately, Members may then speak on the Head, and you may speak more than once on each 
<br/>Head.  Please take note that in some of the Heads there will be several Programmes and Activities 
<br/>listed.  Let me remind you honourable Members, that we will deal with these progressively, this is 
<br/>very important, and we will not regress or go back every now and again, trying to take us back when

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have already moved on.  Activities that have been earlier discussed, that is the one I was referring 
<br/>to, we will not revisit them again should you be late or you have been elsewhere when the progress 
<br/>in the Committee of Supply stage has continued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you may also move amendments to the Estimates under the respective 
<br/>Heads.  If a Member moves an amendment, I will call for a seconder and then debate will ensue and 
<br/>at the end of the debate, the mover will have a right to reply, and this will be followed by the vote on 
<br/>the  amendment.    All  the  votes  on  the  amendment  will  be  taken,  please  be  reminded,  through 
<br/>acclamation.    The  final  vote  on  the  Head,  that  will  be  taken  electronically.    So,  when  you  are 
<br/>proposing amendments, doing explanations on amendments, when that is being put to vote, it will be 
<br/>done by acclamation.  At the end when we finish going through the various SEGs, etcetera, we will 
<br/>then go back to the Head and that will be put to the vote and the vote will be done electronically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For further information of honourable Members, amendments are limited to those permitted 
<br/>under Standing Order 100(2) and these are an increase or decrease, removal of the item or subhead 
<br/>from the Head being debated. In the past, you may know some of you sitting in the Chambers now 
<br/>fully understand that it was the late Speaker Luveni that use to demand that you give an explanation 
<br/>where will you bring the fund from, where will the fund to address the increase come from. I will not 
<br/>be  asking  you  to  do  that  because  I  treat  each  and  every  one  of  you  as  being  adult  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and ensure that common sense prevails here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When there are no further amendments and debates, we will proceed to the vote on the Head 
<br/>and then we will continue to the next Head. Sometimes it moves very fast.  Honourable Koroilavesau 
<br/>is  renowned  for  moving  these  kinds  of  situations  at  a  very  fast  pace.    Please,  take  note  that  the 
<br/>amendment slips and copies of Standing Order 100 have been placed on your tables to assist you 
<br/>during  the  Committee  of  Supply  stage.  Altogether  there  are  about  34  Heads  but  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>numbers and how it is being numbered, there are Heads 1 to 50 which we need to get through today 
<br/>and tomorrow and therefore I humbly seek your full co-operation during this crucial process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  just  going  to  prepare  for  the  Committee  of  Supply  stage  and  I  intend  to  adjourn 
<br/>Parliament at 1.00 p.m. and when we resume, we will go straight into the Committee of Supply. I 
<br/>hope you can all understand that and bear with me.

<div><span>Head 1 – Office of the President 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for any comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  1-1(8)  -  Construction  –  Executive 
<br/>Office and the Administration Block.  I have noticed that last year there was a budget of $1.5 million 
<br/>and this is down to $1 million. If we can just have an update on this and just an update if this is the 
<br/>end of it or will it continue to go on.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is a question regarding clarification to SEG 8. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Executive Office and Administration Block.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is the Construction of the Executive Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the reduction is based on the implementation 
<br/>capacity of the agency and the current expenditure performance. So funding is allocated based on the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>performance and this is in discussion with the President’s Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,    last  year  there  was  $1.5  million.  There  is  now  $1 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million, is this the end of it or is this something that will be continued?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We think this will be continued. It was not used this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It was not used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 1 - Office of the President. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 1 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 2 -  Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  any  comments  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarifications, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have a few, Mr. Chairman, Sir, on Head 2.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  I  just  wish  to  bring  to  your  attention,  Sir,  that  the 
<br/>implementation rate in the last financial year for the 11 months was around 63.65 percent, according 
<br/>to the report that we had received. I hope that this is something that can be addressed for this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Programme 1-1, I see this consistent too with a few other activities, particularly on SEG 
<br/>4 - Power Supply ($460,000) and it is quite consistent right throughout the other activities in SEG 4. 
<br/>I just wanted to seek clarification on this allocation, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do apologise, because I have seen this in other Programmes and Activities – Programme 1-
<br/>2(4),  Programme  3-1(4)  and  Programme  4-1(4).    I  just  want  to  seek  some  clarification  on  that 
<br/>allocation, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition. First of all, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members, we are now in Programme 1-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, it is because that allocation is also in the other ones, but the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>huge amount is on Programme 1-1(4) which I have just raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The honourable Leader of the Opposition is seeking clarification on that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$460,000. Is there a reply? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In Programme 1 - Maintenance and Operation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Programme 1-1(4) Power Supply ($460,000). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am not sure what you are looking at on Page 17?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, honourable Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Power supply covers electricity bills for the office, particularly for the 
<br/>whole of the New Wing of  Government Buildings and, of course, our office at Carnarvon Street. 
<br/>This allocation has decreased by $50,000 and is not sufficient to cover for all the power throughout 
<br/>the year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  still  on  Programme  1-1(4),  I  just  want  a 
<br/>clarification on Security Expenses with an allocation of $45,000.  Is this for the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister’s close protection detail or this is security to do with the residence or with the office? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  think  the  security  covers  the  whole  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Buildings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  That  includes  the  Parliament  precincts,  that  is  covered  by  the  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister’s security? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, that also includes the training in security detail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Lastly,  Sir,  on  Programme  1-1(7)  –  Secretariat  to  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission ($200,000).  Has the secretariat already been appointed, Sir, or with the 
<br/>allocation, this is going to be the funding for that purpose? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  for  the  establishment  of  the  secretariat,  the  initial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- On that same SEG, is that entirely just for the setup? There is nothing 
<br/>there for programmes or activities for the Commission to be undertaken this year or that will take 
<br/>place in the next one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are we going back or going forward? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Still on Activity 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  I,  kind  of,  listen  to  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned Activity 2 now.  Can we be consistent here? Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, Programme 1-2(6) – Rabi Island Council with an allocation 
<br/>of $200,000.  I know that something that was pending for Rabi was the Council election.  Is this just 
<br/>the support to the normal administration or does it cover the Rabi Council Election as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the funding is to be used for the operational and 
<br/>development grants to the Rabi Island Council and also for development and operational cost.  The 
<br/></span><span>allocation has been increased by $95,000 which will assist the leaders to meet the administrative and 
<br/></span><span>operational  cost  of  the  Council,  such  as  the  Judiciary  services  on  the  island,  local  Police,  Lands 
<br/>Office, health workers.  The major expenditure will be the renovation of the Council Office and the 
<br/>Banaban House in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on that same SEG 6 in terms of the Rotuma Island 
<br/>Council, I noticed that last  year, they had a budget of $500,000 and this year it is down to $300,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1193 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can an explanation be given on what is the reason for the drastic drop of $200,000 for the Rotuma 
<br/>Island Council? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the funding is used for operational and development 
<br/>grants to the Rotuman Island Council and it is released as per MOA which has been signed.  The 
<br/>budget has decreased by $200,000 based on the needs of the Council as most of their requests have 
<br/>been facilitated in the current financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Can I also explain why there was an increase in allocation last 
<br/>year?  It is because in the previous year, the Rotuma Island Council had great difficulty in getting the 
<br/>funds released, a lot of the activities were not incomplete.  So, when we came into the last Budget, 
<br/>we provided this additional funding for them to  complete some of those, and then this is back to 
<br/>normal funding now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.  I have a question here.  Honourable Ketan Lal, you want to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase the fund again?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, unfortunately, the question was already answered so I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdraw my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You do not want an increase or you have withdrawn? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Minister has already provided sufficient explanation, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The discussions going on here does not match what you are proposing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in your slip. You wanted an increase in the budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to grant to Melanesian </span><span>Vasu-i-
<br/>Taukei</span><span>.  I recalled in the last session, the discussion was whether they have a council, just like all 
<br/>other communities, and we were told that the council will be formed.  I just wanted to know whether 
<br/>the council has been formed or not – for accountability purposes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- They have an administrator at the moment, not the council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My other question is on SEG 10 - Small Grants Project ($2,0000,000).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is to the honourable Prime Minister, if he can give us a breakdown on how this fund 
<br/>was used for us to gauge whether the allocated amount is sufficient or not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- That fund is allocated, Mr. Chairman, to those that come directly to 
<br/>the Prime Minister’s Office, not through various Ministries, et cetera.  Some schools come straight 
<br/>to the Prime Minister’s Office, some villagers for their water supply, community contribution - those 
<br/>ones come directly and they are funded or assisted by that small grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  If I can just add, Mr. Chairman, this allocation has always 
<br/>been in the Prime Minister’s Office since I know and all prime ministers have this and the discretion 
<br/></span><span>is  on  the  honourable  Prime  Minister.    Sometimes  when  we  go  visit  communities,  they  make 
<br/></span><span>commitments and this these are part of that allocation.  Looking at what was disbursed last year, I 
<br/>think this is sufficient for this budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just a supplementary question to the Prime Minister, was $2 million 
<br/>completely used or there is some money saved?  Just to understand whether that amount was used up 
<br/>or still left to be used? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- More than $2 million was used. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Then my next question is, where did you get the extra money if $2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million was allocated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- There are some grants that are not allocated directly to the Ministries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they come and they are held in the small grants projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I note with appreciation the increase in the budget for the Melanesian 
<br/></span><span>Vasu-i-Taukei, </span><span>I think it has increased by $30,000 and together with the special week that they will 
<br/>have it in November this year, it is a good recognition of their contribution.  I am just wanting to 
<br/>know that increase of $30,000, what exactly is it supposed to be for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, the funding is used to cater for operational development 
<br/>grants  for  the  Melanesian  and  </span><span>Vasu-i-Taukei  </span><span>communities  -  the  68  communities  in  Fiji.    The 
<br/>allocation has increased by $30,000 based on the demands that are there.  There has been increase 
<br/>demands from the communities and they might require more funds for next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- There is also more awareness on the existence and the needs of the 
<br/>Melanesian and </span><span>Vasu-i-Taukei </span><span>since we revived the Girmit Day. I believe we owe it to them to have 
<br/>that raised profile. </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Apart from that they are scrattered all over Fiji and they have contributed 
<br/>a lot to the welfare of our country  in times of need, war and everything right until now.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-1.  Just seeking clarification through you, Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, on Programme 3. I was just trying to look for the allocation of the PSB Grant.  I believe  
<br/>that last year, $10.4 million was allocated in which only $6.2 million was used by FBC. But just 
<br/>seeking clarification, may be there is a name change, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, honourable Bia.  Have you found it? You stated that you are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>still looking for it in this Activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  It  is  not  included  in  this  one,  that  is  why  I  am  seeking  clarification,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman,  whether  the  name  has  been  changed  in  terms  of  the  allocation  or  is  it  in  the 
<br/>Communication’s Head? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, it is under Head 50 - because we are going to have a new 
<br/>policy on public service grant, therefore, it is put under Head 50, so if you look at Head 50 it is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Thank you, Sir, that is why I was seeking clarification. </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Please, just confine yourselves to what is there right in front of you.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have moved to the end of the Committee of Supply right up to Head 50, honourable Bia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Programme 4-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, some clarification on the new IT infrastructure and I 
<br/>think  it  is  fairly  new.    What  is  actually  covered  in  this  allocation  in  SEG  9  –  Purchase  –  IT 
<br/>Infrastructure ($234,635)?

<br/>the cost upgrade has increased to $234,635, inclusive of 15 percent withholding tax.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments on Programme 1-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to Programme 1-1(7) – Fiji Law 
<br/>Reform Commission.  I can see a huge increase in budget as compared to the last financial year by 
<br/>$200,000.  My  question is,  how do you intend to use the additional sum  of $200,000 in  the next 
<br/>financial year?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG.- Mr. Chairman, as you know, the Fiji Law Reform Commission was 
<br/>moribund for a couple of years, and this Government has decided to re-establish the Fiji Law Reform 
<br/>Commission.  The majority of that money will be expended towards operations and the hiring of new 
<br/>staff.    The  Government  has  a  very  busy  legislative  agenda,  and  the  recruitment  of  Senior  Legal 
<br/>Officers will enable the Commission to carry out its work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just a supplementary question, Mr. Chairman.  In the last financial 
<br/>year,  around  $400,000  was  given  for  the  Fiji  Law  Reform  Commission.    How  was  that  money 
<br/>utilised, now that you are given additional $200,000, and what kind of number are you looking at 
<br/>that will be mending the Fiji Law Reform Commission?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG.- Mr. Chairman, the majority of that money was expended on operations, 
<br/>as  well  as  the  hiring  of  staff.    The  majority  of  the  staff  are  professional  lawyers,  and  they  are 
<br/>expensive to hire.  Of course, law reform is a complex exercise.  As I said, the Commission was dis-
<br/>established some years ago, and the start up operations are very expensive.  But I can assure this 
<br/>honourable Parliament, that the money had been well spent and will continue to be accounted for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman,  I think my question was not fully answered.  What is 
<br/>the number of staff you are going to put in the Fiji Law Reform Commission and what is your budget 
<br/>like?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the budget is for salaries and allowances for 
<br/>12 positions, which are the Chairman, Director, one Senior Legal Officer, four Legal Officers, one 
<br/>Senior Secretary,  Executive Officer, Clerical Officer, typist and two drivers/messengers.  Let me say 
<br/>that, this was de-established and …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We have heard it three times, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, but you have to understand that we are re-establishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this.  This is what you do not understand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, we did understand.  Thank you, honourable Attorney-General for

<br/>positions are being created, do you think 12 positions are enough for the amount of work that you 
<br/>have to do, or you feel that you need additional funding? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG.- Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the honourable Member concerned for 
<br/>her interest in the work of the Commission.  It has a challenging role because at the risk of repetition, 
<br/>it was dis-established, but the needs of the Commission will continue to grow as the demands on 
<br/>legislative reform increase.  The honourable Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Pharmaceutical 
<br/>Bill and I have extended an invitation to the honourable Leader of the Opposition to work across 
<br/>Parliament on laws that require reform.  So, not just on the Government side, there is an ambitious 
<br/>law reform agenda and we welcome your participation in this exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I personally want to thank him for his response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I just have one more question on that issue.  I am just 
<br/>thinking that if all the salaries are covered by this $1 million from $400,000 last year and $600,000?  
<br/>Will they stay as project positions or will they gradually graduate to SEG1 to Personal Emoluments, 
<br/>these positions that you have in the Commission? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is an independent Commission as you will understand.  All 
<br/>independent  Commissions  are  not  part  of  the  establishment,  as  I  said,  it  is  separate.    These  12 
<br/>additional  staff  are  from  zero.    As  we  move  on,  as  the  honourable  Attorney-General  said,  the 
<br/>Commission will be allocated a budget every year and they decide how many people, and it is their 
<br/>request for these positions that we are funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  a  quick  clarification  on  Head  3-1-1(5),  there  is  a 
<br/>provision there for Drafting of Laws at $30,000.  Is that for outsourcing, or what is that specifically 
<br/>for?  I understand you would have a Unit doing the drafting within the Chambers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG. Mr. Chairman, from time to, there are urgent Bills that require extra 
<br/>assistance  and  occasionally  consultants  and  technical  advisors  are  engaged  for  this  purpose.    In 
<br/>addition, the allocation also includes printing of laws and draft laws.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 3 - Office of the Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 3 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I am happy that we have begun on this journey and it is now 1 o’clock 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch now.   We will resume at 2.30 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 1.01 p.m.

<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is  on 
<br/>Programme  1-2(7)  -  National  Asset  Management  Framework  ($40,000).  Is  this  Framework 
<br/>complete?  Is it for implementation?  How is this money used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Are you asking for Special Expenditure?
