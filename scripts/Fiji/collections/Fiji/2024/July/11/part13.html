<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- SEG 9? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes, SEG 9, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the Department of Mineral Resources’ research 
<br/>vessel,  the  drawings  are  presently  being  vetted  by  MSAF.  It  is  being  constructed  in  Australia. 
<br/></span><span>Payments have already been made. Sir, $97,000 is the retention fee. We are hoping that the vessel is 
<br/></span><span>going to be handed over to us between September and October and if it sails well in the retention 
<br/>period, then we will make the final payment of $97,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question; honourable Minister, if 
<br/>you can just be more specific on the technical work that will be undertaken by this vessel because I

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know  previously  there  has  been  some  discussions  too  with  the  Ministry  for  Defence  with  the 
<br/>capability in the Naval Division.  So, this is where my supplementary question is coming from. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  that  query.  The  Mineral 
<br/>Resources  Department  used  to  have  a  research  vessel,  that  has  now  been  boarded,  so  this  is  the 
<br/>replacement for that vessel. It is mostly used for mineral exploration, geological mapping within the 
<br/>Fiji Waters. The vessel will also supplement the works of the Divisions in environmental monitoring, 
<br/>groundwater assessment, seismic monitoring, earthquakes and tsunami awareness outreach to rural 
<br/>and maritime islands.  It will also be used to assist the Marine Geology Section to undertake coastal 
<br/>assessments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Your first boat was the </span><span>Tovuto</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- The first boat was the </span><span>Tovuto</span><span> and still working.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Minister, in SEG 8 – Ground Assistance Programme – 
<br/>Small  Islands, there has  been a substantive drop  of $250,000 whereas for the large islands, a big 
<br/>increase of around $2.5 million.  Can you please give us some more information on the reasons for 
<br/>that and what that will cover, especially from the large islands?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, that is to coincide with target of 18 boreholes 
<br/>that have previously been targeted that had already been assessed in the previous year and that we 
<br/>are intending to provide for them in this coming financial year.  But this is also in addition  to the 
<br/>special provision that we have built in for what we have announced in the budget, which is an addition 
<br/>of $5 million for the development of 1,700 boreholes throughout Fiji in the next few years. So, the 
<br/>target is 200 for the small islands, 500 for Vanua Levu and 1,000 for Viti Levu.  So, this one that you 
<br/>see on SEG 8 is really to accommodate.  For the ones that had already been assessed and which they 
<br/>have identified that they are capable of developing that Ground Water System in the next financial 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just one final question on Programme 2-1(8) - 
<br/>Upgrade  and  Enhancement  -  National  Tsunami  Warning  Centre  ($300,000).    I  see  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources that this is probably a new allocation on the upgrade and 
<br/>enhancement of the National Tsunami Warning Centre. If the honourable Minister can just elaborate 
<br/></span><span>on this project and what impact this will bring because I know that we already have a Disaster Risk 
<br/></span><span>Reduction  (DRR)  Policy  and  early  warning  systems  is  part  of  our  commitment  to  the  Sendai 
<br/>Framework.    So,  I  acknowledge  the  Government  for  this  initiative,  and  it  would  be  good  if  the 
<br/>Parliament can be enlightened on this project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the $300,000 is to cater for the construction 
<br/>or the extension of the existing building where the Seismology Section is at Delainabua.  The place 
<br/>where it is at the moment is quite restricted.  The demand and the volume of work that is required of 
<br/>the section, of course. of its importance requires a further extension to the current building but the 
<br/></span><span>$300,000 is simply for the building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources with South Pacific Commission (SPC) through 
<br/>UNESCO is going to outfit. When the building is finished, they are going to outfit it with equipment 
<br/>that is necessary to compliment the equipment that we presently have at the Seismology Section.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1291 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Just a supplementary question, honourable Minister for Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources, I know probably there has always been issues too about our buoys that are placed 
<br/>in  the  various  locations.    Probably  this  is  something,  I  know  that  Fiji  has  been  in  the  past  also 
<br/>requested if they can start looking at additional so that we can cover most of the approaches.  I just 
<br/>wanted to raise this with you and maybe if it is already in the plans of the Ministry as well.  It is still 
<br/>related to tsunami. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, with these areas of technicalities, of course, 
<br/>as you would understand, we have a very close collaboration with SPC and UNESCO. These are the 
<br/>two partners that we look to, to develop for us and also train for us personnels and also to maintain 
<br/>and expand equipment that we have on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I see that under SEG 7 there is public consultation review of the mining 
<br/>law.  I believe that is in relation to the Mining Act which has been under review for two to three years 
<br/>now.  Is this now the final round of review or is it an interim part of the process to coming out with 
<br/>the amended Mining Act.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, we would have a preference that this would 
<br/>be the final phase of it before it is brought to Cabinet.  I think we will make an effort to make sure 
<br/>that this is brought to Cabinet and ultimately brought to Parliament within the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The review of the lands legislation began in Qarase’s government’s time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 3-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir on SEG 8 in relation to the Geodetic Datum, I know 
<br/>this has been underway for a considerable amount of time now and I think a lot of work has been 
<br/>done and I congratulate the Ministry for doing that.  Now that we have this upgrade and enhancement 
<br/>of the datum of $161,000, is this also going to lead to the conclusion of this exercise or this is also 
<br/>just part of the process towards the eventual completion later on? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, this allocation is going to cover 
<br/>for the maintenance of the eight existing core stations that we have.  They are in need of upgrading 
<br/>and maintenance, so with this allocation of $161,290, we hope that these eight core stations are going 
<br/></span><span>to  be  maintained  and  kept  in  conditions  that  would  continue  to  feed  us  with  strong  and  reliable 
<br/></span><span>cadastral survey and network mapping coordinates that can be used by all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- These geodetic datum act as survey control as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Indeed, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-2(8), I note that you also have a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>similar allocation to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs on the Survey of Mahogany Plantations?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.-  Mr. Chairman, this is  just to  also  bring some clarity on the 
<br/>division of funding that you would have seen in honourable Vasu’s Ministry funding yesterday and 
<br/>the one today. So, you will see that the concentration of the $382,000 for this year is to attempt to 
<br/>put a closure on Nukurua and Sawakasa woodlots.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have completed Galoa and Naboutini and we have aging mahogany woodlots in Fiji.  So, 
<br/>with the limited number of surveyors and survey teams that we have, the big task that we also have, 
<br/>we have agreed that the surveyors from Ministry of iTaukei and Fisheries Commission are going to 
<br/>be also useful to us in attempting to start with the woodlots that are at Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is all with the intent to ensuring that we can round up and put this in our knapsack as 
<br/>having these woodlots surveyed so that Fiji Hardwood can then go on and take proper leases on all 
<br/>of these woodlots with all of the survey boundaries demarcated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I am thankful for the centralisation and to speed up this work but 
<br/>I think the frustrations that usually come from the landowners is which one is official when it comes 
<br/>to the co-ordination after the work has been done?  Probably the agencies can just work on these and 
<br/>maybe the Ministry of Lands becomes the official whatever because these are the issues on the ground 
<br/>when trying to settle these disputes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- We understand Mr. Chairman the ground difficulties that are 
<br/>faced with all of the surveys.  We have surveyors up in the Northern Division who are also going to 
<br/>be assisting the iTLFC surveyors when they are up in Vanua Levu. Ultimately, all of these comes 
<br/>back to the Survey General’s Office who will do the verification before everything is finalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I would be interest to see the work done in Naboutini as you mentioned 
<br/>honourable  Minister  because  that  particular  </span><span>Tikina</span><span>  of  Nuku  has  not  been  surveyed  by  the  Native 
<br/>Lands  Commission  as  yet.    Now,  I  just  heard  the  survey  for  the  mahogany  plantations  has  been 
<br/>undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- In Naboutini, Mr. Chairman, there are nine leased lots with 
<br/>4,921 hectares and six of their plans were submitted for checking and approval and they have been 
<br/>with the Survey-General’s Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  On  SEG  4  –  Lease  and  Rent  (Renewals)  -  iTaukei  Lands  ($3.845 
<br/>million), an increase of $300,000.  Can the honourable Minister just provide some information on 
<br/>that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, yes, there is a market increase.  We are looking 
<br/></span><span>at some 537 active leases of iTaukei leased to the State.  We have been going between the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Lands and iTLTB in trying to make sure that we are crunch down on the right number.  So, over 
<br/>the years we have had discussions with iTLTB and also this honourable Member also takes care of 
<br/>the rental increases that do happen every five years. So, when those five years fall, we also have to 
<br/>make sure that the increase that needs to be paid is factored into the budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just a follow-up question, Mr. Chairman.  On the next one, the Lease 
<br/>and Rent (Renewals) which has also increased by around $60,000, will that explanation be the same 
<br/>for this increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- This is for the renewal of leases that are up for renewal. Those 
<br/>ones are for the active leases, this one is  for the renewal  of any of the ones that we are going  to 
<br/>negotiate with iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, can I just ask a general question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>through you and may be you can help in this as well, although it is not in any of the SEGs, this is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1293 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the work of the Valuation Board. I know that we have had a lot of difficulty in the past because 
<br/>of the membership because it is related to ALTA as well, Sir, when it comes to non-active agriculture 
<br/>leases.  I just want to raise a general question to the honourable Minister because in the previous 
<br/>sitting of Parliament we have talked about ALTA. I have gone to CEO iTLTB and I think they are 
<br/>bringing that up to Cabinet.  This is why I just wanted to ask the question on the Valuation Board 
<br/>and the role that they play.  How is it being handled now in the Ministry because it will be important 
<br/>for the primary industry stakeholders?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the Board is now properly constituted as well 
<br/>as the ALTA Valuation Board.  Those Board members have been appointed and they are continuing 
<br/>on with the work that is required of them in examining and also passing valuers who have applied to 
<br/>be registered.  So, they have been continuing on with the work that they have been asked to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is a bit long explanation, Sir, given the way the Valuation Board has 
<br/>been subjected to other, like this real estate people, coming in by virtue of them doing real estate 
<br/>sales,  automatically  they  become  part  of  this  valuation  institute  without  really  undergoing  the 
<br/>necessary studies.  So that was something that we experienced for some time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- I must also mention, Mr. Chairman, that the Evaluation Act is 
<br/>also presently being consulted and reviewed.  We are anticipating that the new Act will be prompt to 
<br/>time and address the concerns that we now have as opposed to the archaic concerns that the present 
<br/>Evaluation Act has. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG 8 – Upgrade and Enhancement  - Subdivisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to ask the honourable Minister which divisions will be upgraded? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  in  the  Central/Eastern,  we  are 
<br/>going  to  work  at  the  Cautata  Agricultural  Subdivisions,  Muanaweni  Agricultural  Subdivision  on 
<br/>drainage and road maintenance.  In the North also $100,000 allocation for demolishing of existing 
<br/>footpaths and v-drains, construction of new footpaths that were constructed on a plan M2O09 and 
<br/>also $100,000 in the Western Division and that is going to be for the construction of a retaining wall 
<br/>on the transmitter road in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Through  you,  Sir,  honourable  Minister,    SEG  10  -  Land    Bank 
<br/>Investment.  I  see  this  is  an  increase  of  around  $123,000,  can  you  just  give  us  an  idea  of  what  is 
<br/>entailed in that budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr Chairman, this is to complete the compensation payment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for road access to designated land in </span><span>Mataqali </span><span>Koronikula which had been pending from 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 33 – Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Head  34  -  Ministry  of  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communications  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now for any comments and will go straight into the items - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 1-1.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG 8 -  Standardised Roadside Stalls.  Last year 
<br/>$100,000 was allocated and only $13,000 was used. So, honourable Minister if you can explain why 
<br/>the full sum was not used and this year, we are allocating another $80,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  basically  what  we  have 
<br/>subsequentially found with regard to the roadside stalls is, we have a bit of an issue with the roadside 
<br/>stalls. Just by way of update, there is a lot of stalls that are actually vacant.  For example, out of the 
<br/>90-plus stalls that were inspected in 2022, about 30-plus are vacant, so we have decided to slow down 
<br/>the spend just to try and understand what we can do to redeploy. So, this year, we will try and move 
<br/>the stalls around and just try and understand why the request comes for stalls we try and assist and 
<br/>then they did not use the stalls. So, that is really the reason why we had to slow down, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 4-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 4-1(10) - Co-operative Development Grant. I 
<br/>will be grateful if the honourable Minister could elaborate more on this - what this grant is for and 
<br/>its availability? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  the  grant  is  actually  a  new 
<br/>grant, Sir, and it is really driven by, if you like, a better understanding of how we can continue to 
<br/>assist particularly in terms of economic empowerment. I have discovered that in other countries, they 
<br/>have actually used co-operatives as a major weapon to drive SDG initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is our first attempt to actually try and boost the funding to co-operatives and, hopefully, 
<br/>over  the  next  few  years,  we  will  actually  increase  the  funding  because  we  are  now  actively 
<br/>encouraging across all the Ministries a creation of co-operative and so the funding is really to try and 
<br/>assist.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initial plan is to try and assist co-operatives that request for assistance, and it leads up to 
<br/>a maximum of $100,000, but it will just depend on the quantum of requests that come in, in terms of 
<br/></span><span>assistance, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is quite a good initiative but the only concern is, if it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is at the Ministry’s disposal for funding co-operatives, why is it under ‘R’? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, from our perspective, like even last year, we 
<br/>had  $40  million  under  ‘R’  for  the  rebates,  but  we  utilise  all  of  it.  So,  it  is  really  just  a  matter of 
<br/>applying one’s self properly in terms of the Ministry to ensure the funds come, so a bit of pre-planning 
<br/>is involved.  I suppose because it is new as well, may be the Ministry of Finance wants to make sure 
<br/></span><span>the  money  goes  to  the  right  place,  but  that  is  alright.  It  certainly  will  not  be  in  slowdown  in  the 
<br/></span><span>spending of the grant. Requests are coming in already.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we have all done now across the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture, Ministry of iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs, we are all saying and encouraging the creation of co-
<br/>operatives across all like-minded industry. I think that will be the way forward in terms of trying to 
<br/>develop the sector, particularly agriculture.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Probably, it acts as   a kind of control on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, it is a new grant, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 5-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, Programme 5-1(10), across the board with respect 
<br/>to the YES, IHRDP, NDP, the National Export Strategy and the TEP, there has pretty much been an 
<br/>increase for all of them, which is commendable, but I see that there is a substantial decrease with 
<br/>respect  to  the  Northern  Development  Programme  (NDP).  Is  there  any  specific  reason  behind  the 
<br/>decrease  for  the  NDP,  considering  we  are  trying  to  encourage  more  and  more  in  terms  of 
<br/>diversification and also in terms of the North? You can give us a reason as to why there is a substantial 
<br/>decrease on NDP? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, in terms of the overall utilisation of the 
<br/>grant last year, I think it was a bit of a slowdown in the grant so we have tried to apply the grant in 
<br/>other areas where there has been over utilisation and so that is, I think, the main driver, but overall, 
<br/>we have gone from $2.6 million to $4 million.  So, there is enough money in there to cover for other 
<br/>purposes.  I think overall, we are pretty good in terms of the money.  Like I have mentioned, there is 
<br/>$120 million circulating in the whole SME space between all the Ministries, including the Ministry 
<br/>of Sugar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, while still on Programme 5-1(10) - National 
<br/>Export Strategy.  Honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications, I noted the slight increase in National Export Strategy. I did discuss this with you 
<br/>after last year’s Budget and you have increased it by only $200,000. My question is, how flexible are 
<br/>we in terms of assisting others who have been assisted previously?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have visited a few lately in my tours around Fiji and they want to expand so that we can 
<br/>facilitate more, particularly the exporters, but they are saying, “I went to the Ministry and they said, 
<br/>‘you have been assisted before.’  How flexible is this honourable Minister?  Because these are the 
<br/>people that can create the impact as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I guess as a Government because there 
<br/>are a lot of requests so once a request is done, we have given them a couple of years before they get 
<br/>back in the queue.  So, what I suggest is you refer them to me because sometimes normally, they tend 
<br/></span><span>to ready for other forms of assistance through FDB or other things.  So, they may not need another 
<br/></span><span>grant but they can certainly get concessionary loans or that kind of thing.  So, it is double the amount, 
<br/>so it is very healthy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Sir.  It is still not enough the amount that he has given.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 6-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  through  you,  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, I stand to be corrected on SEG7 - 
<br/>Digital Fiji.  I believe that is a new allocation of $1,000,000.  Please, elaborate more on the work that 
<br/>will be carried out under this allocation.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  two  components  to  the  funding, 
<br/>because  we  are  building  out  the  new  ease  of  doing  business  platform  so  there  will  be  annual 
<br/>subscription fees paid for the licensing.  So that is one component.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second component is because of the high turnover. We are not paying enough to our IT 
<br/>guys so there is a bit of a risk with the high turnover.  So, what we have tried to do is actually get 
<br/>some coverage from offshore, from the vendor, just to make sure that we do have adequate coverage, 
<br/>so that we do not put our information systems at risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 34 – Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 34 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 35 – Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Programme  1-1(  10)  –  Sugarcane  Development  and  Farmers 
<br/>Assistance  ($4,000,000).    Again,  this  is  welcomed  but  it  is  time  that  we  look  at  the  return  in 
<br/>investment, particularly on production levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noted in the last Annual Report Sir, particularly for Vanua Levu, they are still hitting around 
<br/>600,000 tonnes.  Vanua Levu used to produce almost triple that amount during the good days, so 
<br/>honourable Minister, what assurance can you give us in terms of improved productivity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, there is a saying that if a lion is sleeping, let him sleep.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you wake the lion up, you are in trouble. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Who is the lion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am the lion Sir.  It is called Singh is lion.  Anyway, it is most humorous 
<br/>here now because you are too serious.  The Budget will be passed anyway, so let us laugh about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Listen, support… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are wasting our time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No, you are wasting my time.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to say, before 
<br/>I answer to  the honourable Leader of the  Opposition,  this morning I had two documents in  hand 
<br/>which  came  to  me  as  the  Minister.    One  was  a  document  that  money  was  paid  to  Abdul  Khan’s 
<br/></span><span>friend… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No, let me complete, $100,000 just for a change of a logo of FSC.  After I am done with the 
<br/>abuse then I will come to the use.  Number two, Graham Clarke’s brother was paid $8,000 business 
<br/>class ticket on FSC’s expenses.  These are the misuse, now I will come to the use of it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  I  will  tell  you,  yes,  the  production  of  sugar  has 
<br/>decreased since 2006.  There were some issues of land leases, there were some issues otherwise, but 
<br/>collectively, as the Opposition usually alluded in their speech, we want to increase the production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua Levu, at one good time had 1.2 million tonnes of cane, today it now stands at 600,000 
<br/>tonnes.  We have this programme in hand and together with the Opposition and bipartisan, we would 
<br/>like to see that we all work together to increase the production in the next 10 years and that is why 
<br/>we have this plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(10)  -  Cane  Access  Roads  with  an 
<br/>allocation of $4 million.  I would just like the honourable Minister to clarify because along these cane 
<br/>access  roads,  we  have  some  small  crossings  or  low-lying  crossings  that  also  need  repair  and 
<br/>maintenance.  Are those also included in that allocation of $4 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, through you, last year, we had $2 million and now, it 
<br/>increased to $4 million. That just shows that we are very serious about getting the cane access roads 
<br/>done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one comment in regards to the Sugar 
<br/>Industry.  After looking at both programmes, I do not see there is any allocation for the rebuilding of 
<br/>the Penang Sugar Mill.  We all know very well that a number of times, this Minister has repeatedly 
<br/>said in this Parliament that come this time next year, the Mill will be ready.  So, since there is no 
<br/>allocation, what does he have to say on this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the honourable Member, during tea break  
<br/>asked me why there was no allocation. I told him that this programme has an operational budget and 
<br/>we are looking at donor funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  not  a  management  project,  it  is  a  $150  million  project.    Your  Government  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>destroyed the Mill.  You destroyed the Mill and now we are going to bring it back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Chairman,  that  means  the  honourable  Minister  can  come  and  say 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anything in Parliament and later on shy away from it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  No  shame!    You  had  asked  me  a  question  in  the  Tea  Room,  and  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answered you.  Rakiraki Mill will be done, it will be done, and that is it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, before I get into the question, I have  an observation.  Until 
<br/>now, discussions have been very cordial, and all of a sudden comes a Minister who absolutely has 
<br/>no idea on how to behave in this Parliament, and  starts shouting.  It disrupts the entire Parliamentary 
<br/>process.  Why can he not start behaving for a change?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- It is the  way I speak, Mate! It is called criticism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- He probably needs a couple of doses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, in Programme 1-1(10) – Cage Bins ($1 million). Is this facility available to 
<br/>private contractors who cart cane so that they can have better cage bins, or is it for FSC? I just need 
<br/>an explanation, Mr. Chairman.  If the facility is available to private contractors, how can they access 
<br/>this facility? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, this is only for FSC’s tramline facility. .

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I still have honourable Bala and the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>with their questions.  I have a motion here from honourable Koroilavesau. Please, introduce your 
<br/>motion, honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, I understand, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That SEG 10 be reduced by $11 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, you may elaborate on your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs 
<br/>have made a lengthy deliberation on FSC.  I think during my Budget Speech, I had stated that we 
<br/>need a whole workout on the sugar industry in Fiji, carrying on as we have been carrying on as we 
<br/>have been carrying on since the Colonial days.  We will never be able to reach the effort that we want 
<br/>to take sugar to, so that it will be self-sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the huge issues that is causing a lot of cost to Fiji is the transportation of cane from 
<br/>cane farms to the mill.  Not only the cost in fuel and the expenses in the carrying in trucks, the damage 
<br/>that it does on our roads is huge and substantial.  My view is that instead of allocating all these funds 
<br/>to the various headings here, we should start.  There was a study that was made that it will cost $30 
<br/>million to revamp our rail system that will carry sugar cane to our mills.  We should start, we should 
<br/>make an initiative to put it into the programme and initiate this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, $30 million is nothing if we think about the damages that are happening on 
<br/>our roads, the rubbish that is created by all the cane that is carried on the road, I think it is about time 
<br/>that we re-dedicate the funding that we have to make sure there is a long term solution to the sugar 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is reduce the budget by $11 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  been  talking  to  this  company  called  Rites 
<br/>Limited in India recently.  They are the experts in the railway system and they are coming back to 
<br/></span><span>Fiji to assist us in assessing the railway system.  Once they give us a report and the costing, then we 
<br/></span><span>will come back to the Cabinet and the Government for assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I do not think we support that motion.  What 
<br/>it simply means is, I think the rail issue, honourable Koroilavesau is 100 percent correct.  The rail 
<br/>system  was  built  over  many  years,  it  should  never  have  been  allowed  to  be  destroyed.    It  was 
<br/>destroyed in the last 10 years or 15 years.  Now we are in a situation where the cost of cartage and 
<br/>the cost addition to the farmers is a single biggest contributor, which has drained away their income.  
<br/>If  you  reduce  the  $11  million,  you  are  essentially  saying,  reduce  subsidy,  reduce  cane  planting 
<br/></span><span>programmes and reduce all the cane access roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The FSC is another entity; this is not funding FSC.  This is 
<br/>looking at farm level production.  While we consider options, funding, studies on drain and I think 
<br/>that  is  a  good  suggestion,  we  cannot  allow  the  farmers  to  get  out  of  the  industry  now.    This

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme really is in SEG10 is to keep the farmers.  If we had not lost the European Union funding 
<br/>in  2006, there were three components; milling,  farm level and  alternative livelihood.  So we lost 
<br/>about $300 million to $400 million and the decline on the industry was just certain.  I think we looked 
<br/>at it very carefully when we were discussing with the Ministry that this funding is required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the two honourable Ministers for their 
<br/>explanations.  I think I just add on, the future cost of keeping the trucks, maintained and the diesel 
<br/>that is being spent on it, the rail can be used during off season and during season to carry containers 
<br/>between our destinations on top of carrying cane during the cane season.  It can be a double edge 
<br/>effort in creating and reducing traffic within our roads and damage to the infrastructure.  In that case, 
<br/>Mr. Chairman, I would like to withdraw my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. You still want to raise your question? The motion has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdrawn.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Not on the motion.  I have a question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Question from honourable Sachida Nand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  again  going  back  to  the  cage  bins,  thank  you  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for explaining but cage bins are for collecting canes from mechanical harvesters. 
<br/>So, is the honourable Minister telling us that mechanical harvested canes will be collected in rail carts 
<br/>and carried to the mill, is that what his trying to tell us? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, yes cage bins as you know are very secured, it does not 
<br/>spill out the canes when it goes on the tracks. We are trying to bring in more cage bins now so that 
<br/>the farmers do not get there, canes off track and offloaded on the way. We are totally concentrating 
<br/>on giving more cage bins rather than the open carts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Will that be for carrying mechanical harvested cane?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You are correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG10 - FSC Working Capital 
<br/>Support ($15 million), if the honourable Minister can elaborate what FSC is going to do with this 
<br/>money. Is it cooperation or some other activities. What is the intent of this fund? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- He does not know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I know, I know, I will need to explain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is the repayment for the EXIM Bank.  You know the history 
<br/>of Exim Bank and how we have come to that.  Through the Indian Government we were able to 
<br/>negotiate a deal where the interest that was due and future interest is being taken care of by the Indian 
<br/>Government, and so the payment schedule for the next three years, and obviously FSC does not have 
<br/></span><span>the funding to do that, so we are allocating that to clear off the Exim Bank loan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- For how many more years are we going to pay this amount to the Exim 
<br/>Bank? I mean I know this year we are putting in $15 million and what are your plans for the future? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is one-of allocation and we are hoping that FSC itself 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will take care of whatever is left over.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, may I just refer to the honourable Minister’s 
<br/>initial statement in responding to my first question. Talking about the sleeping lion, he is admitting 
<br/>that he was sleeping on the job, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  I  will  ask  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  through  you  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  to  sack  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sleeping Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, I was referring to the sleeping Minister then but I am a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sleeping lion. There is a difference between a Minister and a sleeping lion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  my  question  is  on  SEG  10.    I  note  the 
<br/>significant increase, almost doubled on the cane access road. This is welcomed because they need it, 
<br/>Mr. Chairman, Sir, and increase of $2 million.  Does this mean that there are new farmers, new areas 
<br/>that we are getting into because it is quiet a significant increase and, of course, I know that there 
<br/>needs  to  be  maintenance  as  well  in  the  existing  farms.  And  still the  question  on  railways,  that  is 
<br/>critical to the farmers?  Will part of this allocation go towards improvement in the rails?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation  for last year, we gave $2 million, we found 
<br/>out that it is was very less for the cane access roads, the contractors, the prices of machines and hiring 
<br/>of plants were very excessive. So that is how we managed to convince the Ministry of Finance to 
<br/>increase the budget to $4 million but that does not include any existing railway system.  That is going 
<br/>to be taken care of as soon as we get a report, we find out what is the cost of repairing and putting 
<br/>new rails. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I will start from SEG 1 on Personal Emoluments.  
<br/>Last year it was $533,000, this year we can see a huge jump and that is $742,713.  Can the honourable 
<br/>Minister justify this increase and please behave when answering?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, look I do not control the emoluments.  There is a 
<br/>Ministry, and appointments are there.  There were a lot of vacancies that has now been filled and this 
<br/>is because your government did not fill them.  We have to bring this sugar industry back to its feet 
<br/>and this is why we need workers, we do not need statues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am quite sure this industry is going to collapse under this Minister.  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chairman, how many more staff they have got in this financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITON MEMBER.- He does not know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Who does not know?  You do not know your job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is dependent  on my Permanent  Secretary, and he tells me.   I do not 
<br/></span><span>control the number of staff in the Ministry, but I want to control them to do work, that is all.  Whoever 
<br/></span><span>comes in, they have to perform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I can answer the question for the honourable Member.  The 
<br/>increase honourable Member is  additional salary for the honourable Minister, the re-alignment in 
<br/>salary of the multi-ethnic component about $231,000, additional FNPF, overtime plus also the salary

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1301 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of 14 established staff.  So, because of the Multi-Ethnic part of the Ministry, fully established that is 
<br/>an additional staff and the increase in salaries is catered for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, I think what the honourable Minister for Finance has just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said, that is also being allocated under the Multi-Ethnic Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going to SEG 7, last year $187,000 was given for the Sugar Cane Growers Council Election.  
<br/>I would like to ask the honourable Minister what that money was used for and now we see another 
<br/>$200,000 allocated for that?  So are we going to have elections or what are these funds for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, last  year we announced that the elections is going to 
<br/>take place therefore we had budgeted $187,000 but there was this submission to the Elections Office, 
<br/>Solicitor-General’s Office for approval and to get a new regulation and laws changed; it took time. 
<br/>We could not utilise the $187,000 then.  Now because the elections is going to happen this year, we 
<br/>have made this new provision.  So, that $187,000 was never used because we are still going through 
<br/>the process, the process that your government had delayed during your time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, can you ask him to stop referring to what we did, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what we .… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No, I want to remind you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- If I am going to start, he will be a sorry man.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You can start. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Honestly, Mr. Chairman, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Because you are going to jail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Please, he needs to behave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- If I start, you are going to jail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- This is not his supermarket, this is Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I have a right to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- SEG 10, Mr. Chairman, so in other words he has confirmed that they are 
<br/>going to conduct the Sugar Cane Growers Elections; that is fine. SEG 10 - Sugar Cane Development 
<br/>and Farmers Assistance has been reduced to $1 million.  Can the honourable Minister explain the 
<br/>reason for the reduction?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- There has been an assessment done by the FSC and they have said that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this money is sufficient, so be it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Programme 1-1(10) New Farmers and Lease Premium Assistance last 
<br/>year,  the  allocation  was  $2  million  and  in  this  fiscal  year,  it  is  $1  million.    Can  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister advise us on how many leases were issued last year amounting to $2 million and how many 
<br/>leases will be issued this year amounting to $1 million?

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, we have renewed 300 leases last year and based on the 
<br/>figures given to me, we only have about 150 leases, so that will probably take care of with the $1 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted a clarification from the Minister 
<br/>on  Cane Harvest and the Utilisation of Corrections Service personnel as highlighted in SEG 7 costing 
<br/>$320,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, there is an ongoing programme by the Ministry to re-
<br/>engage the prisoners to come and harvest and that is the amount that was basically being told by the 
<br/>Corrections Service that they will require so that is the amount that we allocated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have one question, Sir, on Programme 2-1(7).  There is a new 
<br/>allocation of $500,000 for Special Advisory Committee. I note the District Advisory Councillors in 
<br/>Head 18 with an allocation of $767,960.  Can the honourable Minister elaborate more on this Special 
<br/>Advisory  Committee?    What  will  be  their  role  and  what  is  the  component  as  well  because  the 
<br/>Advisory Councillors are already in Head 18?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, I had discussed with the honourable Prime Minister about 
<br/>transferring the Advisory Councillors under my Ministry which he has endorsed and it will come 
<br/>through  Cabinet,  so  once  that  has  happened,  then  obviously  we  will  take  care  of  paying  these 
<br/>Advisory Councillors through our Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  these  are  two  different  issues.  The  District 
<br/>Advisory Councillors are already in Head 18 and if they are transferred to your Ministry, that will 
<br/>come  with  the  allocation,  but  you  have  this  $500,000.  I  am  asking  about  this  new  allocation  of 
<br/>$500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  can  clarify  that.    I  think  the  Minister  was  partly  right.  
<br/>Because you asked the question about advisory, he answered the advisory question but this advisory 
<br/>committee, this is the discussion that we had when the Ministry requested this allocation.  It is a new 
<br/>allocation,  it  is  supposed  to  be  a  Special  Committee  consisting  of  inter-agency  representatives, 
<br/></span><span>government  ministries,  religious  leaders  who  will  meet  every  month  to  identify  issues  within  the 
<br/></span><span>communities, particularly land and other issues, conflicts, tolerance.  This Committee is supposed to 
<br/>then advise the Minister.  It was part of the recommendation of the review and the recommendation 
<br/>from the Committee that was supported by the New Zealand Government.  So, this is an initiative 
<br/>out of those recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a new allocation.  It could be one-off allocation, depending on what the Committee does 
<br/>in this financial year.  So, this is separate from the Advisory Councillors, whose purpose is for rural 
<br/>development and other activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  now,  it  has  been  clarified  that  Special    Advisory 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee is not the Advisory Councillors allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So, it is not partly right, it is fully wrong.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1303 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Chairman, Sir, going back to SEG 7 – Language, Culture and Arts ($2.2 million), who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are the beneficiaries of this allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- First of all, through you, Mr. Chairman, I want him to learn about culture 
<br/>and arts as a member of Sangam.  This allocation will help and teach you the culture and arts in this 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I take those comments as offence.  As I have said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>earlier on, he needs to behave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are becoming like a bloody market now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Come on, let us behave like adults here.  We do not want to go into this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kind of exchanges.  Hold on, honourable Minister. I hope you understand that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will now vote on Head 35 – Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 35 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 37- Ministry of Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is open for any comments.  Programme 1-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  SEG  7  –  Special  Administrators.  Are  we  going  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue paying the illegally appointed Special Administrators? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, can I ask the honourable Member to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rephrase and repeat his question, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, you all will recall that I mentioned in this Parliament few 
<br/></span><span>things  that  some  of  the  Administrators  that  have  been  appointed  is  illegal  and  here  there  is  an 
<br/></span><span>allocation to pay them. What I am saying is, are we going to continue to pay the taxpayers’ money 
<br/>pay to these illegal appointment of the Special Administrators? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Before  I  respond,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  he  needs  to  look  at 
<br/>himself in the mirror first before he asks this question.  This allocation is amounted to $7,000 and 
<br/>$4,000  will  continue  because  we  have  appointed  these  Special  Administrators  in  all  the  13 
<br/>Municipalities in Fiji.  We have gone through the consultative process before they were appointed 
<br/>and the Ministry will continue to pay them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, at least, I have heard this respond for the first time.  On 
<br/>SEG  10  -  Completion  of  Govind  Park,  Ba  ($2,000,000).    Some  months  ago,  Mr.  Chairman,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister was in Ba and he has signed an agreement of around $8 million.  It was also 
<br/>mentioned that those two projects will be completed by the end of December.  What I am wondering 
<br/>is, the cost is around $8 million, the allocation here is $2 million, so where is the honourable Minister 
<br/>is going to get the balance of the money from?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA..-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  the  honourable  Member  is  right, 
<br/>there was a contract signed for  Phase 2 of the Govind Park project to a tune of $8 million and the 
<br/>timeline, according to the work schedule, as well as the contractor is around February of next year.  
<br/>That is just the timeline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  allocation  that  we  have  here  is  because  after  a  lapse  of  two  years,  then  we  have  this 
<br/>project again and the view of the Ministry of Finance is that allocation should be enough.  That will 
<br/>be based on some of the projects that have been undertaken because that has not been completed to 
<br/>whatever it was projected for.  Even it was going to be done according to the phases, the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance is looking forward also into assisting the Ministry in paying out whatever amount will be 
<br/>needed to complete the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  SEG  7  -  Special  Administrators 
<br/>($764,000).   I note that the allowance of Special Administrators has increased from $392,000 to 
<br/>$764,000, which is 100 percent.  Can the honourable Minister explain this increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation for Special Administrators is based 
<br/>on the numbers that we have.  That is worked up to the end of the next financial year, and even before 
<br/>the determination of the Local Government Election date.  As I have said, it is based on the numbers 
<br/>that  we  have  already  appointed.  Some  have  already  been  terminated  because  of  their  inability  to 
<br/>attend meetings.  So, the full amount will not be utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, the Special Administrator cost has really gone up and the taxpayers 
<br/>are paying for it.  I am saying it has increased by 100 percent, but it has doubled.  Instead of cutting 
<br/>cost, we are increasing costs, and this is one area where we could have cut costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My next question is on SEG 10 - Completion of Lautoka Swimming Pool ($1,500,000).  Last 
<br/>year, $4 million was allocated to this particular project.  If you can tell us whether that money was 
<br/>used? If it was, great, but if it was not, then I can see, only $1.5 million is allocated for this year.  
<br/>What do you intent to do with $1.5 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, before I answer the second part of the question on 
<br/>swimming  pool,  the  reason  why  there  is  also  my  explanation  earlier  on,  on  the  increase  in  the 
<br/>budgetary allocation for Special Administrators is, I think everyone needs to understand that we have 
<br/>appointed Special Administrators for all the 13 Municipalities around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the previous Administration, they have clustered some of the Councils but here, we have 
<br/></span><span>appointed  Special  Administrators  for  all  the  13  Municipalities.  So,  there  is  a  reason  why  the 
<br/>allocation increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  moving  to  the  Swimming  Pool,  there  were  lot  of  misunderstanding  on  why  the 
<br/>swimming pool was never completed. The Lautoka City Council has that contractual arrangement 
<br/>with the contractors so they were in a position to work on that particular project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first six months of this financial year, the Ministry through the Lautoka City Council, 
<br/></span><span>was just trying to finalise some of the legal issues regarding the works that were not completed by 
<br/></span><span>the two contractors, as well as the Project Managers. So, that has already been taken care of.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  the  amount  allocated  for  this  financial  year  is  to  assist  the  Ministry,  as  well  as  the 
<br/>Council, in looking at the project together after the appointment of the Project Manager, which he 
<br/>has already been through the tender evaluation process.  So, once that is finalised, then it will be up 
<br/>to the Project Manager to review the whole project again. So, based on whatever amount that we 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have, we are confident that there will be some rescoping of the whole project, so they will be able to 
<br/>maintain and complete the project at a very minimal cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, I thought I was given   a chance to ask a question  after 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Bala for Activity 2.  Are you still giving me that or you have passed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I will allow that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Thank you for giving me the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.  Sir, SEG 10 - 
<br/>National Fire Authority Capital Grant of $6.1 million, can the honourable Minister elaborate on this, 
<br/>knowing that in the 2023-2024 Budget, it was allocated $2.5 million but there was zero utilisation, 
<br/>nothing was done.  How will the honourable Minister react on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, let me clarify first the $6.1 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that was allocated to the National Fire Authority through the capital grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, this $6.1 million allocation is the Government’s 25 percent contribution towards the 
<br/>National  Fire  Authority’s  Annual  Budget,  as  clearly  stipulated  in  the  National  Fire  Services  Act.  
<br/>This  will  be  release  to  the  Authority  in  the  normal  quarterly  instalments  for  the  financial  year.  
<br/>Rightfully this $6.1 million should be part of the operational expenditure for National Fire Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Supplementary question, Mr. Chairman; it is written here ‘capital grant’, 
<br/>but the honourable Minister is saying it is operational as well, so I feel that, that needs to be corrected. 
<br/>The second part which I asked was that in the 2023-2024 budget, they were given $2.1 million, there 
<br/>was zero utilization, why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA. – On that $2.25 million that was allocated for this current financial 
<br/>year, the first project is for the construction of the new Navua Fire Station of $1.3 million and the 
<br/>work  that  has  been  completed  is  physical  progress,  civil  works  and  fencing  which  has  been  100 
<br/>percent completed.  Phase II which is the construction of the project itself is 52 percent completion 
<br/>rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  next  one  is  on  the  purchase  of  replacement  of  fire  trucks  and  ambulances  of  around 
<br/>$800,000.  The procurement contract  has been  signed and the relevant  procurement  process  is  in 
<br/>progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one is on the maintenance, as well as repair and upgrading of Levuka Fire Station 
<br/>($400,000) and for that one, it is 89 percent completed.  The project should be completed by 21</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>July, 2024, which is the current month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN. – Thank you. We will now move on. Programme 2 – 1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. –Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG7 – Urban Policy Action 
<br/>Plan Implementation. As far as I am aware of for this particular Action Plan, it has expired. So, I do 
<br/></span><span>not  understand  what  is  the  implementation,  is  it  the  implementation  of  the  old  plan  or  are  you 
<br/></span><span>reviewing or developing a new plan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- We are developing a new plan, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-– Thank you.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My next question is related to the Town Planning Law Review - $10,000 is allocated to that.  
<br/>The Town Planning Act was already reviewed, along with the Subdivision Act. If you can tell us 
<br/>how this money will be utilized in that context? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, when I took office, I think  this was 
<br/>something  that I strongly believe needs to be reviewed - the Town Country Planning Act.  There 
<br/>was also a paper that was submitted to Cabinet, I think around 2021, and  I am told that we need 
<br/>things with SG’s Office, something that we need to review again.  I had a meeting with the Town 
<br/>Country Planning Advisory Committee and they still feel that there is a need for us to review and go 
<br/>through  the  papers  again.    And  if  there  is  a  need  for  us  to  review,  then  we  need  to  do  more 
<br/>consultations before we can come up with the final review of that Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. – Thank you, honourable Minister, much appreciated. Can you assure 
<br/>us whether these two legislations will come to Parliament this year because the work was done, as I 
<br/>said, and it was done through a very wide consultation.  Even all the past Directors were called to 
<br/>give their views on that particular piece of legislation. In fact, even an expert from Australia gave her 
<br/>opinion on the legislation. So, I think the consultation was very widely done and maybe just about 
<br/>10 percent or 5 percent of the work is done. Can you please bring that legislation to this Parliament, 
<br/>thank you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Thank  you.  I  caution  you  to  be  careful  with  those  kinds  of  leading 
<br/>questions. If you are so sure that you can bring the two legislations as stated by honourable Premila 
<br/>Kumar, then I urge you to answer. Otherwise, you just take that as kind of a statement coming from 
<br/>her to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, I need to first take it through Cabinet before I can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confirm the dates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 37 – Ministry of Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 37 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 38 – Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.  Programme 1-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  to  do  with  Programme  1-1(10)  Tourism  Fiji  - 
<br/>Marketing Grant.    In light of the fact that we may face some lesser activity in the tourism industry, 
<br/>which is being predicted, is this a sufficient marketing grant to cover not just our traditional areas 
<br/>like Australia and New Zealand or are we looking at some other places in and around Asia like in 
<br/>China, India, et cetera.  Is that sufficient to cover that also?  Are we doing that to ensure that we do 
<br/>not lose out because they are our higher spending tourists?  Will that cover it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, the tourism industry up to the end of June is 8 percent 
<br/></span><span>ahead of last year; last year was a record year.  In tourism, if make the first six months comfortably, 
<br/>the next six months should be, normal the high seasons, so we  are riding comfortably now going 
<br/>forward.  Indeed, the way we are going, there is no more low season or high season in tourism.  It is 
<br/>only  high-end  soldier.    One  of  the  honourable  Members  had  expressed  that  the  forwards  are 
<br/>weakening.  This is driven largely by, that the inventory in the country is maxed.  They can no longer 
<br/>find rooms, hence the low pickup going forward. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1307 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It behoves to build rooms in the country.  I think ANZ was also saying this lately that the 
<br/>growth over the next two years will very much be dictated by the lack of inventory on the ground.  
<br/>In terms of developing market stalls out of the traditional markets, Asia in particular, India, Japan, 
<br/>yes  indeed  there  are  provisions  for  marketing  in  those  areas  within  this  allocation.  I  have  the 
<br/>undertaking from the honourable Minister for Finance that if the need arises they can always secure 
<br/>more funding into those non-traditional markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  in  all,  we  are  quite  comfortable  with  the  way  we  are  tracking  tourism  right  now, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There is an increase of $5 million from last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, it is very welcomed.  The $30 million last year was used quite 
<br/>effectively,  hence  the  way  we  are  growing  now.    The  advantage  with  tourism  is  the  sense  of 
<br/>partnership,  that  a  $35  million  that  we  contribute  as  the  Government  is  one-third  of  the  overall 
<br/>marketing for the country; the airlines pitch in and the operators also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Fiji  to  be  enjoying  these  kind  of  numbers  is  really  is  the  35  million  three  times  over 
<br/>because  of  the  partnership,  that  is,  the  normal  structure,  how  you  market  in  partnership  with  the 
<br/>operators.  As you know, we have a big billboards in Time Square in New York. That is unheard of 
<br/>in  the  past,  we  even  took  eggs  on  CNN,  it  was  never  heard  of  in  the  past.  It  is  because      of  the 
<br/>partnership that is there between the government, airlines and the operators.  That is where we always 
<br/>make sure that we drive this partnership by committing sufficient allocation for tourism marketing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  really  was  trying  to  ask  whether  we  actually 
<br/>concentrating on getting the non-traditional markets with more advertisements because there is a high 
<br/>yield  that  comes  out  of  those  non-traditional  markets,  but  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  has 
<br/>answered what I asked for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on SEG 6 – South Pacific Tourism Organisation -  Rent ($142,000), what does that mean? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO) made 
<br/>up of the 12 or 14 countries of the Pacific.  We host them in Fiji, the office is here in Fiji and we are 
<br/>responsible for the rent.  We are renting FNPF for them.  In the same way that we host other regional 
<br/>bodies, we also host SPTO in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 38 – Ministry of Tourism and Civil 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR .CHAIRMAN.- Floor is now open for comments, shall we begin with Programme 1-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 10 – Capital Grants: Fiji Roads Authority there is 
<br/>quite a substantative drop here of around $40 million, if I am correct, and I do realise that there is $5 
<br/>million set aside for rural roads with PWD later on in this Budget.   Can the honourable Minister 
<br/>enlighten us on the reasoning behind the big drop in the capital gratnt for FRA?

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, may I answer that? The decrease is essentially 
<br/>due  the  completion  of  some  of  the  big  capital  projects  including  the  loan  funded  Transport 
<br/>Infrastructure Investment Project which is likely to end in July 2025.  We took that into account and 
<br/>looked at what FRA would be able to deliver, given that some of the work would also be done by the 
<br/>Public Works Department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Another  question,  Sir.  Request  the  honourable  Minister  to  give  us 
<br/>some details with your permission, Sir, the two projects under direct payments which is the Urban 
<br/>Water Supply  and Wastewater Management  Project  by ADB for $2.35  million  and the Transport 
<br/>Infrastructure Investment Sector Project (TIISP) ADB, I think it is a new one, of $12.84 by ADB and 
<br/>the World Bank, a component of $14.1 million. Can you just give us a brief highlight on that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, that is a direct payment allocation in terms of 
<br/>$2.35 million financed through the loan grant facility at ADB, handled directly by the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance  to  the  contactors  for  the  implementation  of  clean  water  programmes,  in  particular  the 
<br/>completion  of  the  Viria  project  and  retention  claims  for  the  relevant  contractors,  Sinohydro 
<br/>Corporation and sub-contractors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- For Viria? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, for Viria.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is ADB $12.8 million and World Bank - $14.7 million.  
<br/>This is a direct payment allocation, financed through the loan grant facility at ADB, handled also by 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance directly to the contractors for the implementation of key roads and bridges.  
<br/>The $12.8 million is to cater for the King’s Road upgrade, and the design and investigation works 
<br/>for the identified 40 affected bridges around the country.  This has been earmarked for replacement 
<br/>in the next financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The continuation of the work around Viti Levu or is it for other  areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is correct.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  SEG  10,  Capital  Grant:  Water  Authority  of  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>($135,820,924)  Viria Project.  We had some discussions on compensation.  Honourable Minister, is 
<br/></span><span>the Government paying that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman.  There were some discussions on that in 
<br/>terms of the legality of it.  Looking at the legality of it, the land in question is freehold, but what was 
<br/>in question was the compensation for the fisheries.  That again is subject to the legal assessment, and 
<br/>the first assessment is that the fisheries compensation is applicable to foreshore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  were  other  claims  too  regarding  water  royalty  which  is  not  in  the  current  legal 
<br/></span><span>frameworks plus other issues which were based, I think, $10 million was bended around, but the legal 
<br/></span><span>basis for that is not there.  Of course, there were other issues regarding development which we are 
<br/>also  including  in  our  budget  for  the  rural  roads  which  is  the  development  of  the  roads  and  the 
<br/>connection of water, which we have also discussed with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.-  Mr. Chairman, so the sum which I just mentioned is basically only for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>project, we are not talking about the other components which you have just mentioned?   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What component? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Which  I  mentioned,  the  compensation.    I  am  asking  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He just said that there is no legal basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I am just asking, this amount which is written there $135,820,924, that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>basically the whole payment for the project?  Is that right? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- No, that is for the total capital grant for the capital works for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Authority of Fiji, for everything in the capital works programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  on  direct 
<br/>payment.    We  have  talked  about  Viria  Water  Project.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  tell  us  the 
<br/>anticipated date by when this project will be completed, because people are waiting for this project 
<br/>to be completed and some relief in terms of getting water in their taps? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, the project is already on line.  You would have, 
<br/>I suppose noticed from the public the improved water services, the pressure, et cetera from the Suva-
<br/>Nausori  corridor.  But  the  major  construction  works  have  been  completed;  main  gravity,  line  on 
<br/>November 2023 designed building operate issues 23 but at the moment the Water Authority of Fiji 
<br/>is looking at the commissioning certificates and the closure of the design and build phase after the 
<br/>contractors submitted various documents which are required.  At the end of July, it is expected that 
<br/>we will 90 percent complete the WAF quarters, landscaping works and the rural works at the Waitolu 
<br/>Reservoir, the road works and the reinstatement of footpaths along the pipe route.  The last part is 
<br/>the design and build phase contractor to submit the compliance documents which is expected at the 
<br/>end of this month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Honourable  Minister  on  SEG  4  -  Repair  and  maintenance, 
<br/>hydrologically equipment ($130,000).  Two issues here that I just wanted to ask in terms of the MET.  
<br/>One  of  the  most  important  things  that  we  have  now  is  in  relation  to  floods.  I  am  looking  at  this 
<br/>expenditure on repair and maintenance of hydrological equipment.  It has a budget now of $130,000 
<br/>and is a reduction of $20,000 from last year.  My concern in this particular area is about the flood 
<br/></span><span>gauges because the biggest disaster that we have in this country in flood gauges, sometimes we have 
<br/></span><span>them but they are not sending information or the gauges are out of kilter or something like that. So, 
<br/>with all these equipment in place, will it make sure that all those flood gauges  are up and running, 
<br/>not only working but transmitting information down to Nadi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, that is for funding to procure the hydrological 
<br/>equipment including the spare parts which some will need to be procured  from overseas which is 
<br/>$100,000 and $41,000 from local materials. So, this is envisaged to complete the project or the task 
<br/>which is identified there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  I  just  hope  that  all  those  flood  gauges    will  be  up  in  running  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transmitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman with your permission in terms of the Radar Operational 
<br/>Expenses ($15,000); the three radars that we have around the country.  It decreased from $7,000. 
<br/>This year there is a decrease of $7,000. The reason for the decrease in that same SEG 4?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This is to cater for the radar bi-annual servicing and cleaning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was the amount used in the previous year, which is why the reduction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The reduction is $7,000 from last budget to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- But perhaps the reason because you have just changed that other radar, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is now fully complete, you have a new one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  last  question  on  SEG  9,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  this  is  new,  Disaster  Recovery 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure ($190,000). I think this looks new to me. Can you just explain what it is all about?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  So,  basically  it  is  one  of  the  components  of  the  Disaster 
<br/>Recovery Plan with Meteorological Services, given the critical nature of its services and it is to do 
<br/>with the ITC, the backup services renewal of the main production services and the backup services.  
<br/>So, that is the $190,000 which is allocated there and also the CIS093 system cut-off and handover.  
<br/>So, it is basically the IT backup for the whole six services systems.  One of the main concerns from 
<br/>the Meteorological Services over the last 24 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3- 1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Programme  3-1(8)  -  Rural  Roads  with  an 
<br/>allocation of $5 million which is appreciated.  My question, Sir, is, will this work be outsourced, or 
<br/>will this be carried out by the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Simply  because  looking  at  other  activities,  we  have  the  Mechanical  Unit,  Building  Unit, 
<br/>Electrical Unit, Joinery and Plumbing, Energy, but there is no unit where you have the Department 
<br/>of National Roads that has the heavy plant component that does this. The honourable Minister before 
<br/>taking up the job, has always been saying about getting rid of FRA and bringing back PWD.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How will this allocation be handled, given that we do not have the Department of National 
<br/></span><span>Roads with the necessary machines that are supposed to be purchased?  As the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and  Transport  had  alluded  to  earlier  in  most  of  his 
<br/>speeches. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In the last Budget, we had allocated funds for the acquisition 
<br/>of machines and that is currently in progress but for this one, we are looking at various components 
<br/>regarding the Rural Roads. If we are not using those then we will also be utilising or outsourcing.  In 
<br/>terms of whether we have allocated that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just roughly  with  Divisional  Engineer Central  Eastern  -  $1.3 million,  Divisional  Engineer 
<br/></span><span>West - $2.3 million, Divisional Engineer North - around $1.5 million. So, this is distributed according 
<br/>to the need there and this has also been coordinated with FRA.  So, whatever they are not covering, 
<br/>we will complement it with this.  It is not only for roads but it is also foot-crossings, the drainage 
<br/>works and also initiating gravel stockpiles in key areas, those are the main components of that.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1311 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is a general question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport, I have noted from the question that I had 
<br/>asked earlier on.  It was a written question and we have got the response from the Ministry of Finance, 
<br/>that quite a number of projects were not completed, and it was all related to Public Works Department 
<br/>carrying out those works, simple things like walkways for CWM Hospital was not done and I am 
<br/>sure  most  of  the  Ministers  sitting  around  the  room  cannot  move  forward.    We  just  wanted  to 
<br/>understand  some  of  the  difficulties  you  are  facing  in  terms  of  setting  up  this  Public  Works 
<br/>Department, or you may have other strategies to move this work forward because when the work is 
<br/>not completed, it is not realised on the ground and the benefits are not accrued. So, just from that 
<br/>perspective. Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO.F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman,  I think what needs to be clearly understood is 
<br/>the  situation  which  we  are  in  or  were  in,  in  terms  of  the  resources  both,  human  resources  and 
<br/>equipment.  In order to rebuild that, I think the equipment part is simple, it is just the human resources, 
<br/>as we understand the lack of skills in specific areas, particularly for operators’ trade skills and that is 
<br/>one of the main challenges we are facing. Not only that, we have to build that up, so in this budget, 
<br/>we have included that in terms of human resources but will continue to build that up in order to cater 
<br/>for the increased demand from the Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the delays was that we were working at the human resources level which was geared 
<br/>towards what was there before.  But as we increase the demand, we need to increase the work and 
<br/>this year, we have budgeted for an increase in project staff which will also cater for the increased 
<br/>work. For example, for the key institutions - CWMH, some of the Government Quarters and for the 
<br/>Department of Works, we have increased the budget for the Government Quarters, as mentioned in 
<br/>the various Divisions, and prioritised according to those which have really deteriorated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have started on some, but as we discussed, the resources are limited from the last budget, 
<br/>but with the increase with the PWD in terms of the upgrade and enhancement of Quarters, that will 
<br/>be included there - the increased number of Project staff. Thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just in relation to the establishment of PWD, I am glad honourable 
<br/>Minister that when you were initially talking about this, you were talking about replacing FRA with 
<br/>PWD. I am glad that you have now seen the light and… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- … decided to keep FRA.  But last year, we did have $5 million for 
<br/></span><span>PWD.  What exactly was it that we have achieved, because if you see the way you have structured it 
<br/>now, you have put $5 million last year and this year, you are putting aside $5million, plus $6 million 
<br/>to actually do work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From what you are saying so far, it looks like that $5 million that you had last year did not 
<br/>really put in your place to get PWD going.  The $11 million this year looks to be $11 million to get 
<br/>things done for the $5 million that you had last year has put you in a stage to get PWD doing things, 
<br/>because this $11 million instigate is about getting things done. So, did that $5 million put you into 
<br/></span><span>that space to start moving things forward or is it still delaying or is it still in the preparatory phase to 
<br/></span><span>develop PWD? Where are we? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- No, the $5 million last year some have been expended and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Not  all?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Oh, very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Because we had some issues again, as mentioned, regarding 
<br/>the  tenders,  et  cetera,  and  of  course  the  capacity  within,  which  we  have  rectified  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>capacity.  We have mentioned project management, tenders, accessing tenders those technical side.  
<br/>We have procured and I think some equipment have arrived.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this additional $6 million here, this includes the various the upgrading of Quarters not 
<br/>only  that but  even the facilities under the Ministry. We  are looking at  Kadavu, Tuvuca, Rotuma, 
<br/>some of the Quarters, the Boiler Shops, the Divisional Engineers Workshops, so these all needs to be 
<br/>brought up to par because they have not been operational for some time.  With this budget, we will 
<br/>run definitely and with the Projects staff which have been included to really get into the business of 
<br/>addressing the deteriorated properties, including staff quarters in Divisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I have noticed you have talked about the shortage of 
<br/>skilled workers and I totally agree with you.  I am just thinking - one of the greatest sources of skill 
<br/>tradespeople in this country in the past used to be from PWD through the Apprenticeship Scheme.  
<br/>Is that something you are considering, although you get the fruits of it in three, four and five years 
<br/>time? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is included in the budget but not really on a wide 
<br/>scale because they need to come in under Supervisors.  So, we need to build them in phases, have the 
<br/>experience and qualified staff there and the apprentices need to  come under those, then we move 
<br/>forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can include them as part of the Project staff.  I do not want to say labour but as part of the 
<br/>learning environment.  I just want to say that I never said that we will throw out FRA.  I said that we 
<br/>will  move  forward  in  a  responsible  and  careful  manner  so  that  nothing  is  duplicated  but  in  a 
<br/>complementary manner.  </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, through you, honourable Minister, in relation to SEG 
<br/>8 – Extension of Grid Power – Rotuma and Lakeba Government Power Stations ($960,000), can you 
<br/></span><span>just elaborate a bit on that?  The other question is, why is Kadavu not included?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason I ask is because the capacity of these generators is such is to get the maximum out 
<br/>of it, you need more customers online. So, it is just the phases, you start with Lakeba and Rotuma 
<br/>first, then Kadavu later because they are the three major stations that we have, apart from Nabouwalu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, $960,000, honourable Member, is allocated as you quite 
<br/>rightly  pointed  out  for  Rotuma  and  Lakeba.    Lakeba  is  to  extend  the  grid  from  Bau  Village  to 
<br/>Waciwaci  Village to  Waitabu Village for a distance of  about  5 kilometers, connecting  about  115 
<br/></span><span>households who are maintaining the existing 313   customers.  Rotuma will connect about 80,000 
<br/></span><span>households, while maintaining existing 1,198 customers, so that is the allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Are there any plans for Kadavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Next year.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1313 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, Kadavu is not mentioned in this.  Programme 4-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  SEG  10  –  Housewiring  for 
<br/>Completed Grid Extension Projects ($2 million).  Again, $2 million is given this year.  Last year, $2 
<br/>million was given and this money was not used at all.  So, if the honourable Minister can tell us what 
<br/>kind of hurdles he faced and why that project was not completed?  What guarantee is there that we 
<br/>are all going to support and this $2 million will be able to complete this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I can, $1.6 million was utilised for the 2023-2024 Budget.  
<br/>So far, that is the latest that I am giving you.  Sir, $2 million is, of course, provided for the ongoing 
<br/>wiring contracts, and the project houses have been identified.  Just to give you comfort, I think the 
<br/>Ministry is much better prepared now for the execution of the next budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, for the decrease, there are two components of 
<br/>that - the decrease in budget consideration for EFL Rural Grid Extension.  This project consists of 
<br/>the rural grid extension and house wiring where the grant is transferred to EFL to implement these 
<br/>projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has recently released $4.1 million allocation for the 2023-2024 Financial Year.  
<br/>This can enable the EFL to complete the pending grid extension and house wiring.  This will further 
<br/>increase the grant disbursed to EFL.  So, the utilisation rate of the $16 million provided from the past 
<br/>year, is around 70 percent to-date which has assisted 1,545 villages and rural settlements.  But the 
<br/>crux of the matter is that the implementation or the rollout has been a problem.  So, that is why we 
<br/>did not allocate for the funds because the funds are already there, and we need to utilise that this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, some of the challenges include the limited number of companies that are able 
<br/>to do this work because these are outsourced.  It is very technical work and they also face serious 
<br/>staffing issues - retention of staff, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one is the sourcing of materials regarding this work from overseas and the increased 
<br/>cost.   I think there was an issue with some of the suppliers.  Of course, we will need to work with 
<br/>EFL  on  how  to  improve  the  implementation  and  whether  the  fund  should  be  sitting  there  in  the 
<br/>Department of Energy, which is something that we will need to discuss, given the ongoing challenges 
<br/>in rolling this out.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  included  in  that  was  the  Climate  Change  Resilient  Renewable  Energy  Development 
<br/></span><span>Project in Taveuni where $350,000 had been allocated before but this is nearing completion.  I think 
<br/></span><span>it is ready for commissioning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, just a question on house wiring.  There may be some 
<br/>other projects but there is a project with the Department of Energy that assists communities living in 
<br/>informal settlements in getting their house connected to electricity - wiring et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know of a community just residing at the back of Caubati Road, that is Cunningham Road.  
<br/>The electricity is there and the line is there, but that community is not able to access electricity.  I 
<br/></span><span>contacted the Director of Energy, he sent someone over to that community, but nothing has really 
<br/></span><span>progressed.  So, I feel that the functions, et cetera, of the Department of Energy needs to be relooked 
<br/>at and how we can make them more responsible for some of the projects which the Government tries 
<br/>to deliver to the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- As I have mentioned, we will need to, at some point in time,

<div><span>who can roll it out, or are we going to keep on relying on the private sector, given these challenges.  
<br/>So, that is where the human resource plan comes in, in terms of apprentices and all that kind of HR 
<br/>planning which needs to come into play.  It is not an overnight thing, it is something that we need to 
<br/>plan properly for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 8 - Replacement of Muana Hydro Turbine 
<br/>($356,522) and the Upgrade of  Buca Hydro and Tiliva Solar Micro Grid  (173,913).  I thank the 
<br/>Government for this, knowing that Buca Hydro is initially a Turkish Government assistance and, of 
<br/>course, the one in Muana has been a lot of problems for quite a long time as well. My question to the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  is,  with  this  upgrade,  I  am  not  sure  about  Muana  whether  that  will  mean 
<br/>extending to a few nearby villages within the Natewa area but, of course, in Buca initially when it 
<br/>was commissioned we were told that the source is sufficient with the right to supply energy to the 
<br/>nearby villages as well apart from Buca alone. So, you have Loa, Tukavesi, I know the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands has forgotten Loa.  This upgrade means extending to these nearby villages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Just brief on those two the replacement of Muana Hydro Plant. 
<br/>This was damaged in February 2024 details of the components, bearing casing was burnt given the 
<br/>high  speed  rotations,  broken  pool,  et  cetera.  The  experts  in  Renewable  Energy  Solutions  have 
<br/>provided an estimate of the works which is around $409,000. This will progress that. In terms of the 
<br/>grid from that and the extent of the coverage, I do not have those details but I can provide it later.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Buca, the $173,000, Fiji Government and ADBF signed an agreement for funding support 
<br/>from the Japan fund for prosperous and resilience Asia and the Pacific for the rehabilitation of Buca 
<br/>Hydro  Plant  and  Tiliva  Solar  Micro  Grid.  So,  total  funding  of  $3.4  million  where  the  Japanese 
<br/>organisation  will  contribute  US$3  million  and  Fiji  Government  the  amount  stated  there.    As  I 
<br/>mentioned, it is something that we need to implement. It is funded there. There are agreements in 
<br/>place and we need to move forward on that.  So, the coverage again, I can advise later as I get the 
<br/>detail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 10 - Housewiring for Completed Grid 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extension.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are the villages in Ra and Tailevu North  also included in this housewiring grid extension 
<br/>villages  like  Sawanivo  Village,  Namara  Village,  Rokovuaka  Village  and  Colata  Settlement  in 
<br/>Wainibuka. Can the honourable Minister give a clarification on that, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I will provide that to him, I do not have the full list with me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- He has been raising this for quite some time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I have to search from the long list which is here but  I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>share it with you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- l hope it is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Also, honourable Bulitavu is telling me to include him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, in relation to SEG 8, I just go back a bit. Last year we 
<br/>had  $50,000  for  Kadavu  koro  but  I  went  there  this  year  and  it  is  still  not  working.  Just  for  your 
<br/>information, honourable Minister, that is a hydro in Kadavu koro.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1315 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the replacement of Muana Hydro, that hydro was working. The problem was negligence 
<br/>by the people that run it. So, hopefully as part of this, we will make sure that we address that particular 
<br/>issue. In Buca, is this about fixing the hydro or road access to fix it before you can start fixing the 
<br/>turbines. The money that is set aside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is the rehabilitation of the hydro plant and the micro-grid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And the access road.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I will have to confirm that. I do not have that details. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- On the Solar Hybrid Rehabilitation LAKARO.  LAKARO stands for 
<br/>Lakeba, Kadavu and Rotuma; all the solars are not working.  So, this LAKARO is it for all three or 
<br/>is it just for one of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  This  funding  is  to  cover  all  three  which  is  under  that  one 
<br/>project with the UAE and we have discussed with them regarding the rehabilitation of this and this 
<br/>funding  is  for  that.    We  have  had  issues  with  this,  with  the  contractor  who  put  that  up,  so  it  is 
<br/>something we need to really decide but it is really for the rehabilitation of those three. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So, with this rehabilitation, they will be running by the end of next 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  I  cannot  give  any  assurance  on  that.    That  is  what  we  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hoping for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 6, Activity 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,    I  noted  that  there  is  an  increase  in  the  LTA 
<br/>Capital Grant by almost $6 million and I am thankful to Government for that.  That it is going to 
<br/>boost our road or safety activities.  Honourable Minister, can you just clarify on this increase in terms 
<br/>of the projects to be undertaken that is covered in the $10 million capital grant for this year please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- For the LTA Capital Budget, the main components would be 
<br/>the LTA integrated IT system - $3.5 billion.  This is an ongoing project which also involves the re-
<br/>engineering of the business processes from the start right up to the completion, the seamless type of 
<br/></span><span>operations.  To streamline all that.  The other one was the Labasa LTA Office, $1.5 million so that 
<br/></span><span>we can have a fully-fledged office there with weigh-bridge, et cetera.  I think a few years ago one of 
<br/>the Ministers planted a coconut tree there to commission the new office, so the coconut tree is now 
<br/>bearing a lot of fruits.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The $2.7 million Supply and Implementation of Hyper Converge Infrastructure with Backup 
<br/>Solution, do not ask me about this, I am not really an IT person.  It is to create a robust, scaleable, 
<br/>secure infrastructure that will ensure business continuity and data integrity and security.  I think those 
<br/>are the main ones, the other one, a $1 million is for installation of red lights speed camera and back 
<br/></span><span>office soft hardware.  Also, it can increase revenue and instantly transfer TINs to an automated system 
<br/></span><span>and Portable Speed Camera - $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  just  to  provide  some  colour  to  the 
<br/>explanation by the honourable Minister.  Basically, what LTA is doing will actually transform the 
<br/>whole  operations  of  LTA  because  they  are  going  through  a  comprehensive,  firstly  review  of  the 
<br/>existing processes and then they will overlay it with an actual ITC system that automates a lot of the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processes.  So, potentially, I suspect what will happen is, all the queuing that happens in LTA will 
<br/>be a thing of the past, that is the whole objective.  They can pay online, renew licenses online all 
<br/>those things will come to bear.  We all know it takes us a day to go and renew our registration, so 
<br/>hopefully that will be gone.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG 5, I am still on Transport Activity 1, I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been given permission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I did not hear him give permission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Okay, we are reaching that stage now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Nath, you say this, this.  You what, you are flipping out now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  did  indicate  with  Madam,  I  had  one  question  for 
<br/>Programme 6-1(6) which is a valid question, that is, the Shipping Services Subsidy from Vatulele 
<br/>and Beqa.  I do remember a few years ago with the Department of Transport… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Which Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Programme 6-1.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- He has given me permission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No, no, no.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was wondering whether you were keeping in line with where we are up to? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- No really, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  am  on  Programme  6-1(6)  –  Shipping  Services  Subsidy.    Thank  you  for  giving  me 
<br/>permission, Mr. Chairman.  Just one question to the honourable Minister, I do remember a few years 
<br/>ago,  the  Department  of  Transport  did  a  household  survey  and  a  passenger  movement  survey  for 
<br/>Vatulele and Beqa to Suva.  Is this programme included honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The Shipping Services Subsidy ($3.4 million).  I wanted to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explain the whole thing, but what was the question again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Vatulele, Beqa, Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It covers 174 trips annually across 10 specific routes.  The 
<br/>breakdown of the allocation includes varying amounts for each ranging from 5,812 for Beqa, Vatulele 
<br/>and Yanuca. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Parliament  will  now  vote  on  Head  40  –  Ministry  of  Public  Works, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meteorological Services and Transport.  . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 40 agreed to.

<div><span>Head 50 – Miscellaneous Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments. SEG1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I have seen that the salary contingency has increased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from $1.5 million to $5 million.  Can the Minister explain the change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Essentially, as the name suggests, this Contingency Funding 
<br/>is set aside to meet any unbudgeted salary commitment that may arise during the year.  Sometimes it 
<br/>is  a  result  of  a  Job  Evaluation  Exercise  and  sometimes  shortfalls  in  the  budget  that  needs  to  be 
<br/>corrected for ministries and departments.  We had a similar allocation in 2023  – 2024 Budget, so 
<br/>there was no utilisation.  Given that we had 5,000 civil servants already receiving a salary increase 
<br/>and the  remaining  will be paid  from  this Financial  Year (1</span><span>st</span><span>  August) so  if there is  any mismatch 
<br/>somewhere, we can just fund it.  That is why we increased by $3.5 million.
