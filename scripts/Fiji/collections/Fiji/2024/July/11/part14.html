<h3>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 3?</h3>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I have a question on SEG 3(3) on Official Overseas Travel Cost.  Just 
<br/>a question whether this  is  the only  cost  or some amounts are also  in  different  ministries for their 
<br/>ministerial travel? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a pool allocation which caters for air fare cost and per 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>diem allowances for Ministers and Assistant Ministers travelling abroad for official duties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question is not answered.  Is this the only amount or travel is also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>included in each Ministry head? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There is travel in ministry head but for overseas travel, it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from Head 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Why  I  am  asking  because  I  recall  asking  this  question  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education when the travel vote increased by $450,000 and he also said that 
<br/>it was for the overseas visits by the honourable Minister as well as by the officials.  So, I just wanted 
<br/>that clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is overseas travel for Ministers.
