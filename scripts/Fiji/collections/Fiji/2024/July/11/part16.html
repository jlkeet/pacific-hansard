<h3>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 6.</h3>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 6. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, a question on number 6  - Grant to Professional 
<br/>Bodies.   There is grants to the Fiji Indigenous Business Council, Fiji Architects Association and Fiji 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Institute of Chartered Accountants.  Is this based on application or is this based on some sort of plan 
<br/>by Government of whom to assist? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is based on submissions by these professional bodies and 
<br/>we have considered this carefully.  We feel that the Indigenous Business Council, for example, was 
<br/>defunct  for  many  years  and  they  have  regrouped,  had  a  very  successful  conference  where  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Ministers and all the Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers were there.  We really 
<br/>wanted to  support the secretariat,  grant  to  professional bodies such as Fiji  Architects  Association 
<br/>again was defunct.  They do, as a professional body contribute towards a lot of the activities that the 
<br/>Government wants to do in terms of improving legislations, policies and so we felt that we should 
<br/>provide this additional funding to them.  Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants in the past have been 
<br/>helping governments to go a lot of things, so we considered that and that is why that allocation is 
<br/>there, based on their submission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 6(2) – Provision of banking 
<br/>services for non-economical rural areas ($700,000) is allocated for that.  I am just wondering which 
<br/>banks are receiving or will receive, how is this money given out to the banks and which banks were 
<br/>given money last year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, really this allocation, honourable Kumar is for subsidy to 
<br/>the  Bank  of  the  South  Pacific  for  the  provision  of  rural  banking  services,  and  BSP  has  been  in 
<br/>partnership  with  Post  Fiji.    Essentially  it  ensures  the  rural  communities  have  access  to  banking 
<br/>services.  The Government pays a subsidy of $3.52 on every transaction that is processed by BSP, 
<br/>by Post Offices and postal agencies, including electronic withdrawals and deposits.  So, with the new 
<br/>tender, the price may change and other service providers may come on board with effect from 1st 
<br/>October, 2024, depending on what the tender Board decides.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you for your response, honourable Minister.  Mr. Chairman, a 
<br/>bit of a concern, considering the banks that we have in our country and the amount of profits they are 
<br/>making with just less than a million people in this country, it is exorbitant and we do expect some 
<br/>level of social responsibility from the banks as well.  I just wanted to make this comment.  Thank 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, I think you have a point and we have said to the banks, 
<br/>for example, the banks wanted to move very quickly on phasing out cheques, we have said that they 
<br/>should hold on to it, and they have agreed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I announced in the Budget Address, for the first time, people like yourselves in the past as 
<br/>Consumer Council Head, have been calling for the appointment of a Banking Ombudsman and that 
<br/>is something we, as a Government, are going to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, on average, just to go back on this, 200,000 transactions are processed, including about 
<br/>99 percent for electronic transactions and 1 percent manual transactions for our rural communities.  
<br/>It is an important service, but you are right, the banks ought to have some social responsibility as 
<br/>well in delivering some of these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  SEG  7,  Activity  9  -  Fiji  Cyclone  Recovery 
<br/>Programme (DFAT) ($15,000,000), there was a similar allocation last year, but more than this, it was 
<br/>$30  million.        I  also  noted  very  lately  that  honourable  Minister  and  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education were part of the ceremony on a new social infrastructure programme.  My question is, 
<br/>whether this $15 million is a separate allocation from the new social infrastructure programme?  If it 
<br/>is a cyclone recovery allocation, is it meant as a sort of stand by for future cyclones, or is it for </span><span>TC 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1319 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yasa</span><span> recovery and rehabilitation that is also continuing, particularly in the schools in Vanua Levu?  
<br/>If the honourable Minister can clarify, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are right, honourable Leader of the Opposition, recovery 
<br/>means recovery after  cyclone.  This  is  direct  funding  agreement with  the Australian Government 
<br/>which  is  fully  funded.    Through  this  arrangement,  the  Australian  Government  has  provided 
<br/>AU$37.38 million, which is equivalent to about FJ$57 million for the programme, through which, a 
<br/>sum of $52.54 million has been received in RBF Consolidated Fund Account.  So, the programme 
<br/>actually includes the rehabilitation of nine schools namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lekutu Secondary School; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lekutu District School; 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Nukubolu Primary School; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Maramarua District School; 
<br/>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Dreketi District School; 
<br/>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Bua District School; 
<br/>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Dama District School; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Wailevu West District School; 
<br/>(9)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(10)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratu Luke Memorial School; and  
<br/>two health facilities, namely, Taveuni and Kadavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, to date, seven of the nine schools have been completed with the final two schools, both Lekutu 
<br/>Primary and Secondary Schools, is due to be finished probably by the end of this month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next phase of the programme is delivering infrastructure upgrades at Taveuni Hospital 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Kadavu Hospital.  That is the description of the projects so far.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  a  supplementary  question,  please.    I  know  that 
<br/>Nukubolu was not initially in the list, but they approached.  When we went through the list of schools, 
<br/>if I may just say, Sir, that Muanidevo Primary School had their two school blocks destroyed, but it 
<br/>was not in that list as well.  There were discussions between the AMU of the Ministry of Education.  
<br/>If there is funding, if Muanidevo School can be considered? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think people have already got there so Muanidevo Primary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>School would be included. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Nukubolu, I was there at the opening of the facilities, it is a fantastic facility. 
<br/></span><span>The  people  were  really  grateful  that  they  now  have  all  new  classrooms  and  all  other  facilities 
<br/>including washrooms, et cetera.  This has been a very good project, very well received by schools 
<br/>and communities around those areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Public  Private  Partnership  for  Health  -  $90  million.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suppose this is the payment to ASPEN.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you. So, during the Budget Speech the honourable Minister said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that Government is paying $10 million per month.  So, there is $30 million less.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are right, as I have said very clearly and that is why I 
<br/>spent a bit of time in the Budget Speech to put on record what happened with respect to the Public 
<br/>Private  Partnership.    When  the  hospital  both,  Ba  and  Lautoka  Hospitals  were  handed  before  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>
<div><span>1320 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>conditions, were met by the concessionaire.     So, the cost was never a factor in the handing over of 
<br/>the Hospitals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have found is that the cost just escalated, the services have escalated and the estimate 
<br/>now is about $10 million per month. On a positive note, we have already started negotiations with 
<br/>the  help  of  IFC,  FNPF  which  was  forced  into  the  project  under  HCF  which  is  the  company  that 
<br/>manages, in which FNPF has 80 percent share and ASPEN Medical which run the hospital has 20 
<br/>percent. We are hoping that in the next three months to six months, we will have a new agreement 
<br/>and we are expecting the cost to come down. So, that is the expectation in terms of the allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, we move on.  SEG 10? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, SEG 10 - Northern Division Projects, can you elaborate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on that, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There are quite a few items so let me just go to it.  You are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going very fast, honourable Lal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Your horse is too fast. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am coming to that. You went right to the end. So, that is $1.9 
<br/>million and, Mr. Chairman, Sir, can we go on to the rest and I will come back to answer honourable 
<br/>Ketan Lal’s question.  In the meantime, you can go on with your second question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Activity  4  –  Graduate  Business  Start  Up  Grant  - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$300,000.  Can you elaborate on that, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is a new allocation and it will be distributed through the 
<br/>FCEF and students who come out from universities in their final year would be able to apply for this 
<br/>$10,000 grant to be able to start.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Northern Development Programme is actually FDB subsidy for projects there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on the Graduate Business Start Up Grant again, so this 
<br/>will apply to current students who are in the university or it can go back to the previous years as 
<br/>well?.  Just like how the TELS was wiped out? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is for new graduates, those coming out of the university.  
<br/>The idea is that they can choose whether they want to go into employment or they could go straight 
<br/>into a business  enterprise and become self-employed and do other things.  And $300,000 will be 
<br/>distributed through the TELS programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG10 - Item 4 and I have two 
<br/>questions  related  to  this.    The  first  question  is  on  Merit  Based  Skills  Qualification.    What  is  the 
<br/>rationale  for  increasing  the  budget  from  $5.4  million  to  $7  million  when  only  $3.3  million  was 
<br/></span><span>utilised in the last 11 months? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The expectation is that some of the new students, for example, 
<br/>before,  those  who  paid  themselves  to  do  Foundation  Studies  at  universities  privately,  were  not 
<br/>eligible for scholarships.  So, we are still not funding Foundation because we do not want people to 
<br/>just go to universities and universities would try and attract them, but if they finish Foundation by 
<br/>paying themselves they would be eligible for TELS scholarships as well. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1321 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  So,  honourable  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Planning and Development, you still have not answered my question.  You are just anticipating that 
<br/>the number will go up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- But my concern is the amount that was allocated was not used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is true, so the assessment that TELS does is that, “Alright, 
<br/>we are allocating this much for this many students in this particular category”, but every year, and it 
<br/>has happened in the past even with loan schemes where you have certain allocations but not all of it 
<br/>is used if the students choose to go into something else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, I do not agree with you but I will go along with that.  Why I do 
<br/>not agree with you, normally, when you do your budgeting if someone is not using the money, you 
<br/>try and reduce as we have heard from other Ministers, but here, utilisation is low but still the money 
<br/>is allocated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, my second question is on the Hardship Assistance allocation which is $7.7 million for 
<br/>the next financial year.  Again, it was not used at all in the last 11 months, and we can see that $5.9 
<br/>million is allocated.  If you can explain to us, what could have been the reasons  that this money was 
<br/>not used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can see that there is a decrease in the allocation from last 
<br/>year.  It is possible that a lot of students who had already been in the programme continued with the 
<br/>programme, paying themselves without utilising the Hardship allocation.  This scheme really is to 
<br/>assist  private  students  doing  degree  programmes,  from  second  year  onwards,  with  an  academic 
<br/>achievement of about 65 percent GPA.  Obviously, they will be bonded and students who do not 
<br/>have a combined parental income and business network of more than $100,000 unless allowed by 
<br/>means testing, so the scheme is expected to assist filling in gaps in the labour market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The scheme will have about 2,600 awards and 250 is, kind of, ring-fenced for MBBS because 
<br/>sometimes students meet the mark criteria and because the number allocated for MBBS, because of 
<br/>the capacity in the institution themselves, they are not able to get so.  You come from the top then 
<br/>there is a cut-off mark, but some also get an entry; although they do not get a scholarship.  And they 
<br/>go pay themselves, and then second year they can apply for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister, I understood the bit you have said 
<br/>but my question was simply on the basis that this money was not utilised and yet, substantial amount 
<br/>has been allocated. That is all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can argue until the crows come home about why we are 
<br/>allocating this.  It is not like in other Ministries where you see the capacity, if they are not utilised, 
<br/>but this is the allocation based on the number of students who would come out of Form 7, Form 6, 
<br/>who would go into foundation and if you do not allocate it, if you do not use it, then it is alright, but  
<br/></span><span>the allocation is there if these students come up, so it is a budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, SEG-10 on item 10 as well just on the Nadi River 
<br/>Flood  Alleviation  Project.    I  am  sorry,  honourable  Minister,  I  missed  this  last  year  in  the  budget 
<br/>discussion.  There was an allocation of $3 million and you have another allocation of $1 million.  My 
<br/>simple question is this the continuation of the flood alleviation which involves the construction of 
<br/>retention dams in the tributaries that is in Nadi or are we using this as part of our contribution in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>
<div><span>1322 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work that JICA is also looking at in terms of the Nadi River Realignment.  I just wanted clarification 
<br/>on that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  you  are 
<br/>right, it is part of that big project - the Nadi River Basin Project.  It has not moved too much over the 
<br/>years.  The Australian Government and the Japanese Government are now pushing ahead, despite 
<br/>some delays and we are funding that effort through a renewed mix of funding commitments from the 
<br/>Japanese and the Australian Governments, along with $5 million Government funding. Discussions 
<br/>will  also  be  held  with  the  World  Bank  to  gauge  their  interest  in  the  project  funding.    So,  flood 
<br/>mitigation in the Nadi River Basin is really essential to the tourism sector and this is something that 
<br/>has been there for many years. The proposed structural measures are to provide protection to the Nadi 
<br/>River Basin area against one in a fifty-year flood event kind of thinking.  The Ministry of Finance 
<br/>will be working closely with all stakeholders to finalise the components and solutions for Part B of 
<br/>the Nadi River Project. This allocation is really to provide Government the resources and the ability 
<br/>to move ahead with negotiations and get the project going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 10 No. 4 – Apprenticeship - $1 million.  What is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that thing for?  It is for wages or fees and how do employers access that money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  There  will  be  a  number  of  components  with  the 
<br/>Apprenticeship Programme.  Essentially as you said earlier in your contribution that to revamp and 
<br/>incentivise the whole Apprenticeship Scheme, we are going to allocate 400 awards to pay 50 percent 
<br/>tuition fees or add $2 an hour as a top-up to the Minimum Wage rate paid by employers under the 
<br/>scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of awards in this financial year has been increased from 400 to 500 given more 
<br/>interest for employers and students.  This is a very targeted attempt towards our unemployed youths, 
<br/>adults, early school leavers, those who fall by the side, for 150 hours to 160 hours of competency-
<br/>based  training  after  which  they  can  obtain  some  form  of  employment.  Again,  TELS  will  pay  50 
<br/>percent  of  the  tuition  fees  to  encourage  employers  to  pay  the  Apprenticeship  students  attractive 
<br/>wages, to offset expenses or add $2 an hour to their Apprenticeship wages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, in addition to that, there will be a phase out of industrial attachment allowance. This 
<br/>scheme was for providing allowance of $100 per month for maximum of six months for students. 
<br/>We are either doing industrial attachments or clinical attachments. Majority in the attachment are 
<br/>now  part  of  the  programme  and  essentially  coded  uni  such  as  students  who  receive  the  normal 
<br/></span><span>allowance except for a few programmes which require books to be filled for eligible graduation. So, 
<br/></span><span>a sum of $330,000 has been utilised in the current year as of 11th July.  People are beginning to 
<br/>understand the Apprenticeship Scheme again. There is much more knowledge and advocacy now 
<br/>from the employers themselves or the value of this programme and Government is putting or playing 
<br/>its part by including this as part of our scholarship programme.   
<br/></span></div>
