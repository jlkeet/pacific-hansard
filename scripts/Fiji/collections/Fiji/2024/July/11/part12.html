<h3>HON. P.K. BALA.- SEG 8.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- SEG 8.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So, that will be the total cost for the renovation of the building, around 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$600,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- One allocation to the renovation of the Matanakilagi House so that 
<br/>our residents can be moved to that location.  The other allocation is to the renovation of the current 
<br/>which is no longer because when they move it will be vacant, but as I mentioned, there is the option 
<br/>of actually relocating that particular Golden Age Home altogether because of the current space that 
<br/>is located at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  located  near  a  very  busy  intersection  and  for  future  growth,  we  should  consider 
<br/>perhaps moving it to another location within Lautoka that has more acreage, there is more opportunity 
<br/>to  have  a  senior  citizens  park,  for  more  recreational  activities,  so  that  is  what  we  are  currently 
<br/>considering  but  we  need  to  move  our  current  residents  first  which  is  why  Matanakilagi  House  is 
<br/>being renovated. So, that is a different allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, it is a humble request for the Ministry or the Government 
<br/>to reconsider the location that you want to take those senior citizens to. I will give you the reason. It 
<br/>is just next to the highway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That building is facing two main roads. You can imagine the noise and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the environment that is going to happen there. So, it is our plea if you can look into that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.    A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  just  seeking  clarification  on  Programme  1-1(8)  - 
<br/></span><span>Upgrade of Child Wellbeing Centre ($230,000).  I do understand that late last month and early this 
<br/></span><span>month, you did mention that you are wanting to set up the first ever Child Wellbeing Centre which I 
<br/>am thankful for because it caters for all the children that are roaming around our cities and towns. 
<br/>You are saying here that it is upgraded. So, you already have an existing building? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, I had indicated in my Budget Response 
<br/>Speech that we have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Methodist Church of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1265 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have donated their Vunirewa Bible School for us to use. So, yes, there is a current location and 
<br/>it does need renovation to be fit for purpose. So, that is what is being allocated in the current budget 
<br/>before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have also mentioned, it is still subject to Cabinet approval, as well as the consultation 
<br/>with line Ministries. It will have a clinical component which will need consultation with the Ministry 
<br/>of Health.  It may also require consultation with the Ministry of Defence as the focal point, as well 
<br/>as possible, the review of police powers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know we continue to state this to the media and those that ask that we do not have the 
<br/>power to just grab children off the streets or adults, unless there is a commission of a crime and when 
<br/>we do take them to return them to their homes, they come back to the streets.  It is just for their safety 
<br/>to remove them off the street but not to confine them in such a centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That will also require the review of police laws for that purpose because as you know, if you 
<br/>are to commit anyone currently to St. Giles hospital, you need the consent of the family, a very close 
<br/>relative in order to that.  So, there are different line Ministries that will be involved in this, so the 
<br/>consultation  needs  to  take  place.    It  is  still  subject  to  Cabinet  approval,  there  is  a  programme 
<br/>component  of  it  that  also  requires  funding,  but  it  is  not  contained  in  this  budget  because  we  are 
<br/>seeking donor funding for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  my  question  is  on  SEG8  –  Renovation  of 
<br/>Temporary Lautoka Aged Care Home ($344,900), and I understand that is the Matanakilagi House.  
<br/>If that is the one, then I recall the Oral Question that I asked, you have said that this house will be 
<br/>renovated in eight months and the residents will move in.  So, it means it is not done yet and the 
<br/>money was not utilised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-It has been done.  We are still in the process of scoping before we can 
<br/>actually do the renovations, as you would understand as a former Minister, there are processes to 
<br/>follow.  That is being undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social 
<br/>Protection, yes, definitely we know.  This fund was given to the Ministry of Women for the whole 
<br/>of last year.  This  work  was not  done and now, this  budget  has come back in  this  year’s  Budget 
<br/>Estimate. We just hope that this work is completed.  That is all I would like to say because this money 
<br/>is not spent and I recall, when you responded to that question, you said it in this Parliament, it is in 
<br/></span><span>the </span><span>Daily Hansard, </span><span>in eight weeks it will be renovated but it is not renovated.  That is the point that 
<br/></span><span>I want to make. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member, that is noted.  The fact that it has 
<br/>not been used last year, I had explained in my response to that question, was that we had the funds 
<br/>ready to renovate the Ba Mission Hospital, even up to nine months into the project but that did not 
<br/>happen, that fell through.  So, we had to look for another location and that took time so that explains 
<br/>why we were not able to utilise it in the last Budget year completely.  But that is noted, thank you, 
<br/>honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- On SEG9 - Purchase – Boat and Outboard Engine ($18,000), 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not understand that allocation.  Is there a correction that is required there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question.  It actually is the 
<br/>cost of purchasing an 80 HP Long Shaft Outboard Engine for Kadavu to be fitted to the Kadavu eagle 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>boat which is what we use in Kadavu so that our officers can move around in Kadavu. So, that is the 
<br/>allocation of $18,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Boat and Outboard Engine, honourable Minister, is that correct, and not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>‘Board’?  If that can be taken care of, the correction? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, Mr. Chairman, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister,  SEG5 - Expenses for Juveniles ($35,000),  
<br/>it  is  a  very  important  area  that  involves  a  lot  of  care,  nurturing  and  rehabilitation  work  for  our 
<br/>juveniles.  Can you clarify on this expenses and is this enough for its purpose?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for the question.  There has actually 
<br/>been an increase in this allocation.  It was $25,000 in the previous Budget, so I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance for this increase because it does cater for the boys’ welfare expenses, including 
<br/>school stationery, uniform, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, the Juveniles, when they come through the Centre, they are not staying there 
<br/>for a long period of time.  They are usually in remand from around the Divisions in the country.  It 
<br/>is probably one or two who are convicted, and they are staying at the home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The expenses vary but there has been an increase, and like I mentioned, what it caters for, 
<br/>there is also travelling cost for the boys when they are allowed on a day out or for summer camps.  It 
<br/>is part of their rehabilitation programme with the NGO that works with them which is called Inspire 
<br/>Pacific.  There has been an increase in this allocation, and we are very thankful for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on.  Programme 2-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  Programme  2-2(10)  –  Welfare 
<br/>Graduation Programme.  I want to know the effectiveness of the programme?  What percentage of 
<br/>people who went through the programme last year are no longer receiving assistance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Thank  you  honourable  Member  for  the  question.  This  welfare 
<br/>graduation programme, in the previous Government, a lot of allocation was not used, so we only saw 
<br/></span><span>the engagement of welfare recipients through the Jobs for Nature programme which is the World 
<br/></span><span>Bank programme.  But as far as the Ministry is concerned, this allocation was not used but we had 
<br/>to  go  through  this  past  year  to  actually  have  the  positions  for  the  setup  of  an  actual  Welfare 
<br/>Graduation Unit within the Department of Social Protection which never existed before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are setting up this Welfare Graduation Unit and we now currently engage two staff to be 
<br/>in that unit.  As part of our review of the Social Protection Information System, we have to find those 
<br/>welfare recipients who have been on the programme for over 10 years and have continued to be on 
<br/>the welfare programme when they really should be graduated out of the programme, so this is being 
<br/></span><span>part of our work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The need for a targeted approach so that we can identify these recipients who will then be 
<br/>trained, because the Ministry, will not be able to do this but to align them with institutions like Pacific 
<br/>Polytech and other vocational institutions, as well as placing them in places of employment through 
<br/>some, sort of, formal attachment or apprenticeship programme.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1267 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what we are working on, we just had the positions jilted as you know that weird word 
<br/>‘jilted’ and you are very familiar as a former HR, but we have to do that and that took some time.  
<br/>So, they are now in the Welfare Graduation Unit and ready to roll for the next budget year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 3-1(8) - Completion of Fiji 
<br/>Barefoot College.  I think last year, $1 million was allocated.  What is the progress on the completion 
<br/>of Fiji Barefoot College? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for the question.  I want to start off 
<br/>by stating that the name that has been used which is the Barefoot College, that is currently under 
<br/>review in terms of the relationship between the Ministry and Barefoot College International.  When 
<br/>I came into the Ministry, there was a breakaway from Barefoot India to Barefoot International and 
<br/>we  met  with  them  and  they  wanted  to  take  up  this  project  but  what  they  had  needed  was  our 
<br/>commitment from our end before they would seek funding to do this programme.  That was in our 
<br/>opinion not secure enough. There was a legal battle between the two organisations about the use of 
<br/>name and logo so that, of course, created more delays for us.  But in the meantime, we did look out 
<br/>for  alternative  providers  like  International  Solar  Alliance  is  willing  to  come  on  board  but  this  is 
<br/>subject to Cabinet approval, of course.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The construction of the Nadogo Complex is near completion, you will see a reduction in the 
<br/>budget because these are just the final contractual payments for the completion of the project. The 
<br/>project is ready to go, we have the funds allocated to cater for the final payment to the contractor, 
<br/>Sambhu Lal Construction. The consultancy fees to the lead consultant Shri Singh and Associates and 
<br/>the installation of solar panels by the sub-contractor Clay Energy Limited. So that is what is left to 
<br/>pay, as you know in construction, there are always variations and final payments.  So that is what it 
<br/>will cater for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 6 – Grant to Women Institutions.  What we have 
<br/>found out that the distribution of these funds is done equally, irrespective of the size of the institution.  
<br/>Do you think it is a fair way of doing this or you going to change the formula or the format that you 
<br/>have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Sir, we actually have a reduction this year of  $100,000.  We allocate 
<br/>it to five women’s groups who have been doing their proper accounting back to the Ministry and 
<br/></span><span>have been proving their existence.  We have the Makoi Vocational Centre, the Ba Women’s Forum, 
<br/></span><span>the Life Bread Foundation and the Homes of Hope, so that is a $100,000 each. We have reduced the 
<br/>other $100,000 which was supposed to go a Women’s Safe Shelter in Lautoka because we are still 
<br/>struggling to secure a vendor to run the shelter.  We put out the tender, we put out the advertisements 
<br/>but there is being no office to run the Centre for us.  The tender has been withdrawn and the $400,000 
<br/>should be sufficient to support the four institutions that are listed in this Financial Year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, the honourable Minister has not answered my question.  
<br/>What I asked was that we had found out that this allocation was distributed equally to all the women 
<br/></span><span>institutions irrespective of the size or the membership of those institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Honourable Member, again this is what has been undertaken from 
<br/>the previous government and what these women’s groups have proven, it is not necessarily the size 
<br/>that matters, it is the activities that they undertake and the frequency of activities and the training that 
<br/>they conduct, they continue to make submissions and acquittals that meet what the Ministry requires. 
<br/>So,  there  have  been  no  accountability  or  governance  issues  from  these  organisations.  In  fact,  Ba

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Women’s Forum which you should be very proud of honourable Member, has done such great work 
<br/>and today they have not requested further funding. So, they are pretty well funded too from other 
<br/>sources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on Head 24 – Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Women, Children and Social Protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 24 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 25 – Ministry of Youth and Sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments, any comments?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Chairman, needing clarification from the honourable Minister 
<br/>on Programme 1-1(5) – Fiji National Youth Band.  How many band members would be paid from 
<br/>the  Fiji  National  Youth  Band  allocation;  and  will  they  be  employed  as  a  part-time  or  full-time 
<br/>employee?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, from the outset of Ministry of Youth and Sports’ core 
<br/>roles  are  to  empower  the  youths  of  Fiji  and  promote  sports  as  a  means  of  fostering  community 
<br/>coercion, healthy lifestyles and national pride. In addition to its core responsibilities focusing and 
<br/>facilitating  youth  and  sports  development  though  the  establishment  of  a  conducive  policy 
<br/>environment and having strategic support structures. This year we have been allocated $23.4 million, 
<br/>a 20 percent increase from last year’s budget. We go to the question being asked by the honourable 
<br/>Member and I him you for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National Youth Band, currently we have absorbed most of the Band members into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>establishments and General Wage Earners (GWE), about 10 of them and we are left with three.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.N.  TUICOLO.–  SEG  10  –  Upgrade  of  Youth  Training  Centre.  Which  Youth 
<br/>Training Centre would be upgraded and funded from this allocation? Does this allocation include the 
<br/>repairs of the burnt down Naleba Training Centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- The allocation in SEG 10 is for Yavitu Youth Training Centres.  As 
<br/></span><span>you know from last year, people were allocated certain amount of money as well, but due to things 
<br/></span><span>that are beyond our control on the delivery, we could not do that upgrade.  We are raising it again for 
<br/>this year for Yavitu Training Centre. It does not include Naleba Training Centre. Naleba we are still 
<br/>negotiating with a donor agency if they can fund Naleba, we are still talking to them right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(5) - Volunteer Expenses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Claim.  Can the honourable Minister clarify that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, the Volunteer Expenses is to cater for additional staff 
<br/></span><span>engaged through NEC on volunteer basis in assisting the Ministry during emergency basis and also 
<br/></span><span>provide work experience for our young Fijians. We do have volunteers too in the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-3.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr  .Chairman,  honourable  Minister  which  company  is  providing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>services for the Social Media Management at a rate of $45,000?  SEG 5, my apologies.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- It is on Activity 3, I am sorry.   Mr. Chairman, this allocation is used 
<br/>for the upgrade of the communication and media gadgets marketing and publication for the Ministry.  
<br/>We have our IT Unit and that is allocated for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- A question raised is what company? You are saying, honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is an internal one?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, this is done in-house.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  Programme  2-1(6),  Sports 
<br/>Scholarships.  I note that this budget has been reduced from $300,000 to $190,000.  If the honourable 
<br/>Minister can clarify the reason for this reduction, or whether this money has been given to TELS for 
<br/>sports scholarships?  If you can kindly explain that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the reduction is largely due to low utilisation, 
<br/>plus a lot of these sport men and women are also eligible for other scholarships under TELS, if they 
<br/>want to study in any other field.  That is why the utilisation was low and that is why we reduced it a 
<br/>little bit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, a question to the honourable Minister for Finance.   Do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you not think this should go under TELS rather than the Ministry of Youth and Sports? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, there are specific sporting programmes where 
<br/>they want to get training, for example, if someone wants to get into archery, it is a short training 
<br/>programme somewhere in Korea, so they will get a scholarship but by and large, the utilisation was 
<br/>small so we have reduced it, because a lot of those young men and women are studying at different 
<br/>universities, so they do not engage in specific scholarships which will take them away from here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, thank you for your explanation.  It is hard to believe 
<br/>that  Fiji  being  a  sporting  nation,  there  is  not  a  lot  of  uptake  for  this  sports  scholarships.    Now  I 
<br/>understand, maybe through your social media management and awareness raising, the numbers can 
<br/>go up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, currently the scholarships awards, there are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Swimming - eight recipients 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Athletics - one recipient (Yeshnil Karan) 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>AFL – six recipients plus one coach 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Gymnastics - one recipient 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Archery - two recipients 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Yachting - one recipient on part time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, do you still want to go into those details? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, Mr. Chairman, the question has been answered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-1(5),  Purchase  -Sports  Equipment 
<br/>($20,000).  My question to the honourable Minister is whether it is sufficient, and the purchase of 
<br/></span><span>sports equipment is for which organisation?

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.-  Mr. Chairman, we have  allocated $20,000  for sports equipment.    I 
<br/>think at the moment we feel that we are content with the budget allocated for that. This is to assist 
<br/>youth  clubs  and sporting organisations that need  assistance on sports  equipment like rugby balls, 
<br/>tackle bags, soccer balls, volleyballs so they are assisted from this fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO. - Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-1(8), needing clarification from the 
<br/>honourable  Minister.  How  many  hard  courts  will  be  constructed  from  the  allocation,  will  it  also 
<br/>include the maritime islands? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.  -  Mr.  Chairman,  the  construction  of  hard  courts,  there  has  been  an 
<br/>allocation for this Financial Year - one for Holy Cross, Natabua Housing, Tatayaya in Rakiraki and 
<br/>Tuatua, Labasa. That’s for the completion for the Tuatua hardcourt in, Labasa.

<div><span>Head 30 – Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  Mr. Chairman, my question to the honourable Minister for Agriculture is 
<br/>Programme  1-1(6)  –  Agriculture  Marketing  Authority  –  Operating  Grant  has  been  reduced  by 
<br/>$500,000. Since AMA plays a crucial part in market accessibility for all our farmers, will this grant 
<br/>not reduce their capacity to perform and also in the SEG 10 – Agriculture Marketing Authority – 
<br/>Capital  Grant  of  $1  million  has  been  allocated.  Will  the  Minister  be  kind  enough  to  advise  what 
<br/>would this grant be used for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the reduction was justified and AMA can operate 
<br/>within the amount that has been given. For the AMA Capital Grant from SEG10, that is used by 
<br/>AMA for procurement of agricultural produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I would have loved more details. In SEG 
<br/>6 also, the honourable Minister in one of his Ministerial Statements emphasized that the Ministry is 
<br/></span><span>embarking on a programme for alleviating poverty through agriculture.  However, I fail to see any 
<br/></span><span>allocation of funds for this activity.  Would the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/>be kind enough to advise how they are going to proceed with this programme if there is no financial 
<br/>allocation for this activity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- I think there is an allocation of 200,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Where is this located? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National  Planning  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development, would you like to help here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, just on honourable Nand’s earlier question on Agriculture 
<br/>Marketing  Operating  Grant,  the  reduction  of  $500,000,  they  also  have  term  deposits  in  other 
<br/>institutions that we assessed.  We are also saying that they need to be reviewed, so that is why there 
<br/>is a reduction in the grant.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On your question on poverty alleviation, there is no allocation as such because the allocation 
<br/>that we provided, as you know, the big increase in total of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/>Budget  last  year  continued  this  year  and  there  are  a  number  of  programmes  within  the  different 
<br/>programmes and activities, such as subsidies for non-sugar crops sectors, subsidies for increase in 
<br/>the prices of commodities, particularly rice which we feel is part of the overall strategy for poverty 
<br/>reduction. So, there is no specific allocation as such. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you.  The honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just advised that $200,000 has been allocated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- My apologies, we have asked for $200,000 but we were told that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we can work from within our programmes that are already there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was the request, the honourable Minister is correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  if  I  may  just  add  on  to  what  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics  said because I think the other side needs to understand this, the way that 
<br/>we are approaching  diversification, for example, we are opening up all the rural areas so the amount 
<br/>of investment on rural roads at the moment is unheard of in the country right now.  What is actually 
<br/>happening is that it is opening up access.  You can see on the ground that people are planting a lot 
<br/>more and we will continue with that investment this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the delta in Tailevu and Rewa, we are doing drainage that will dry up that area and allow 
<br/>bigger opportunities for actually planning.  That is the way we are approaching poverty alleviation.  
<br/>It is not a specific allocation because that is a handout.  What we are doing is providing opportunities 
<br/>for people to work and produce for themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I have a motion here from honourable Koroilavesau.  Would you like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduce your motion Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have come into discussions with the 
<br/>Fiji  Crop  and  Livestock  Council  during  our  meeting  with  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic 
<br/>Affairs.  I think our Chairman, honourable Tubuna and honourable Tuinabuna, who is the Assistant 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture understands this and I think honourable Kiran will also vouch for it, that this 
<br/>small organisation does a lot of coordination…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are just introducing, I need a seconder, before you elaborate on your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- My apologies, Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am running right ahead.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wanted an increase in the allocation given to Fiji Crop and Lifestock Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That motion has been seconded.  Thank you, you have not finished. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  have  already  made  the 
<br/></span><span>introduction. This small organisation does a lot of coordination between the farmers and the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture and does  a lot of work on the ground.   I understand that they have been given  an 
<br/>allocation  of  $500,000  but  I  take  that  they  have  requested  for  an  increase,  so  I  am  just  putting  a 
<br/>motion to increase their funding by $500,000 to take it up to $1 million.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the work of the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council 
<br/>is really to compliment some of the work that was carried out by our Extension Division in particular.  
<br/>I think the $500,000 given to them is enough. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I can just add, Mr. Chairman, for honourable Koroilavesau’s 
<br/>satisfaction, we had specifically allocated in the last budget a provision for purchase of vehicle and 
<br/>that  has  been  done,  so  we  have  reduced  the  amount  this  year.    The  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture agrees that we need to review the functions of the Crop and Livestock Council, to align 
<br/>it with the work that the Minister quite rightly pointed out to the Research and Extension and training 
<br/>components of the Ministry of Agriculture.  It is a reasonable allocation based on what they requested 
<br/>and we feel this is adequate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  satisfied  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explanation that has been given. I would like to withdraw that motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The motion is withdrawn.  We will move on.  Programme 1-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  1-2(10)  -  Commercial  Farmers 
<br/>Equity Package; Commercial Agriculture Development Programme.  I have looked at Head 50 as 
<br/>well, no change from last year.  All the allocations remain.  I know the purpose of this programme. I 
<br/>just want to ask the Minister, how is this being taken up?  Is it really well utilised and are we feeling 
<br/>the impact?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will also make a plea here on behalf of the Minister, the honourable Minister for Finance 
<br/>has been talking about decentralisation.  I have looked at Head 50, I think just a difference of $2 
<br/>million has been decentralised.  This is what the Ministry, having served as an Agricultural Minister, 
<br/>hopefully that most of the items under Head 50 on (R), if it can be decentralised, but we work out the 
<br/>process because it is important in agriculture is seasonalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes  when  we  finish  all  the  processes,  the  season  is  gone.    If  we  want  the  impact 
<br/>because most of it are just short term and medium term impacts.  If you give that opportunity to the 
<br/>Minister, he can do much.  I hope it can be considered for next year’s budget, not only the increase 
<br/>but the decentralisation - give him the powers, set up the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, is it going fast enough and what is the impact? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Through  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Commercial  Agriculture 
<br/></span><span>Programme is really part of the Ministry’s efforts in trying to develop value added products.  The 
<br/>bigger picture is exporting fresh products to overseas markets which poses a lot of problems for us.  
<br/>There are quarantine issues due to pest and disease status of countries where we are exporting to.  
<br/>These hinders the export of fresh products to those markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, if you can recall I had called out Australia here in Parliament after our ginger could 
<br/>not get through to Australia.  There was an oversupply of ginger last year.  This programme on SEG 
<br/>10 – Commercial Agriculture Development Programme is really to see that local companies take up 
<br/></span><span>the value-added processing activity.  There are already local companies that are doing that and there 
<br/></span><span>are new companies that have joined, but we hope to see that more companies take up the challenge 
<br/>of value adding local agriculture produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I always say that first of all, we must get our people get used to local value added products 
<br/>such as Cassava Chips, Dalo Chips, Kumala Chips, Cassava Flour, Breadfruit Flour. First of all, local

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1273 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people must get used to it, buy it, consume it, before even thinking of exporting it. Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  the  point  raised  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition is a very good one. In fact, I can tell you that this year, we have reduced 
<br/>the “R” from almost about $1.7 billion to about $1.2 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is always a risk of virement, there is always a risk of funds being diverted but we are 
<br/>looking at Ministries, particularly Ministries such as Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and 
<br/>Ministry of Education where we want to reduce the ‘Rs’ and also a possible Head 50 as well in terms 
<br/>of grants so that you said quite rightly that they can use that effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commercial Farmers Equity Package is  really  providing equity for commercial loans 
<br/>assistance on a case by case basis and upscaling smallholder farmers if they want to go and do that.  
<br/>It is a good programme and one that could be very effective.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Joseph  Nand,  your  question  before  we  come  back  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Sachida Nand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 – Public Consultation - Review 
<br/>of Agriculture Laws - $10,000.  A question to the honourable Minister, what type of review are you 
<br/>trying to do in public consultation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the laws that govern agriculture in this country 
<br/>are quite old, in fact, they go back to colonial days.  So, we need to review some of those laws to be 
<br/>on par with how far we have moved in agriculture so that we can be on par with the rest of the world.  
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-2(7) - Research Council ($100,000), the 
<br/>funding has increased from $20,000 to $100,000, a 500 percent increase.  Which Council is this and 
<br/>what are the funds for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, there is a Research Council within the Ministry 
<br/>that conducts meetings every quarter.  It consists of the Director Research and Senior Officers of the 
<br/>Ministry.  This fund is for that purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- For the meetings? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Yes, but not only for the meetings, there are other activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, one of the key things is that agriculture involves a 
<br/>lot of science.  Out of the Council, they make publications which is called the Agriculture Journal.  
<br/>That makes us competitive and relevant in the scientific world because most of the research is done, 
<br/>we have released new varieties, and that is where the publication of Agriculture Journal comes in, 
<br/>and it is distributed all over the world.  So, that is another function of this Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-4(7) - Agriculture Show ($200,000),  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry going to have shows in all Divisions, or is it going to be one central show?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, there will be one central show.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we have come to Programme 2, and I would like 
<br/>to adjourn Parliament now for lunch and when we resume at 2.30 p.m., we will go straight into the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Agriculture,  again,  on  Programme  2.    Then  we  will  take  our  usual  break  during  this 
<br/>Budget session, the afternoon tea and dinner at 6.00 p.m.  We are hoping to complete everything by 
<br/>this evening, so come tomorrow, we will be straight into the Consequential Bills.  I hope you do not 
<br/>mind that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Programme 2-1(8) Upgrade and Enhancement - Offices and Quarters ($1.5 
<br/>million). In a particular divisions and offices, this is being done or is it just earmarked for all the 
<br/>officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- All.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  That  is  how  we  always  got  our  answers  or  reply  from  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government. It was simply “yes” or “no”. Yes, honourable Sachida, you are comfortable? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Activity 2. We have two motions from honourable Sachida Nand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 2-2(8) - Women in Agriculture Programme.  His recommending an increase of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about $100,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one Programme 2-2(10) - Fertiliser and Weedicide Subsidy.  He is recommending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an increase to $500,000 from the current allocation in the proposed Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Sachida,  you  may  introduce  the  first  one  -  Programme  2-2(8),  Women  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture Programme.  We will go one by one.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, under Head 30, I propose that we increase by $100,000 in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 2-2(8) in respect for Women in Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Please, elaborate on your motion, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, women are now taking a prominent role in agriculture and 
<br/>are more and more involved in subsistence and commercial farming, not only in crops but they are 
<br/>venturing into livestock including dairy farms. The involvement cannot go unnoticed and now they 
<br/></span><span>a playing a very prominent role and this needs to be encouraged so that more and more women can 
<br/></span><span>take up agriculture or farming professionally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  such,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  Women  in  Agriculture  Programme  be  increased  by 
<br/>another $100,000 to assist more women to participate in the agriculture activity and also assist in 
<br/>poverty alleviation. This is not a point scoring motion but a motion that is needed so that women can 
<br/>actively  be  involved.  They  have  been  traditionally  involved  in  farming  but  not  taking  prominent 
<br/>roles. Now they are  and  I would  request  the Government  to  increase this allocation so that more 
<br/>women can be empowered to take up agriculture professionally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is to increase it from $300,000 by another $100,000, to take it up 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to $400,000 , honourable Sachida Nand? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Yes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.-  Mr Chairman, while the comment is appreciated, one thing we 
<br/>must keep in mind is that we have women farmers in almost all the programmes.  We have women 
<br/>goat  farmers,  women  dairy  farmers,  women  beef  farmers,  women  sheep  farmers  who  can  access 
<br/>funding  from  those  commodity  funding  and  to  have  $300,000  just  for  women,  that  should  be 
<br/>appreciated.    So,  any  other  funding  that  they  will  need,  they  can  access  because  there  is  no 
<br/>discrimination for all the other assistance. Are we okay with that, honourable Sachida Nand?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, the answer is good but I would have loved to get women 
<br/>directly involved and this is the way of encouraging and  empowering them to take control and it 
<br/>would have good initiative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Point is taken, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think that is a good suggestion, increasing, but the utilisation 
<br/>last year was only $260,100 so we kept it at $300,000 so there is still room to help additional women 
<br/>there, but we can look at it next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- So honourable Sachida, do you still want to continue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I’m okay with that motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You still want to continue with it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I would like to have a vote on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Okay, then will put that to the vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The second motion from honourable Sachida Nand.  I will invite him to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduce his motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  Head  30  be  increased  by  $500,000  in 
<br/></span><span>Programme  2-2(10)  with  respect  to  Fertiliser  and  Weedicide  Subsidy  (Dalo,  Ginger,  Cassava, 
<br/>Vegetables). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, vegetable farmers are an integral part of our agriculture  
<br/>sector  and  like  any  other  commodity  these  farmers  need  assistance.    I  see  that  in  the  Extension 
<br/>Programme, apart from Fertiliser and Weedicide subsidy, there is no other subsidy, and I did mention 
<br/></span><span>this in my response to the Budget Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to assist these farmers because weedicide and fertiliser are not only the two 
<br/>expenses.  There  are  seeds,  insecticides  which  have  a  toll  on  the  farmers,  therefore  I  request  that 
<br/>Fertiliser and Weed Subsidy be increased by another $500,000.  The activity should include Seed 
<br/>and  Pesticide  Subsidy  so  that  they  are  encouraged  to  produce  quality  vegetables  and  have  this 
<br/>commodity available to our consumers locally and this will also assist in reducing the import bill.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1277 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The proposal here is to increase from $1 million by another $500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  can  make  do  with  the  $1  million  that  is 
<br/>already there because there are other programmes.  For example, dalo, ginger and there is another 
<br/>root crop programme which can take care of what the honourable Member has mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For some of these crops, we would  rather just leave the trade of planting materials  to  the 
<br/>market force without interference because we have interfered before and it has resulted in the under 
<br/>cutting of the prices that which farmers were trading with those who needed planting materials.  So, 
<br/>we do not want to go there again, but I do agree that there needs to be some subsidy for seeds, but 
<br/>again in most of the programmes, we also supply seeds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I could just add to what the honourable Minister said.  This 
<br/>allocation  also  includes  vegetable  farmers  as  well  this  time  plus  in  addition  to  the  $1  million 
<br/>allocation here, the subsidy for rice farmers has been to, as we discussed yesterday to the Fiji Rice 
<br/>Limited  themselves.    So,  they  will  be  responsible  for  providing  the  subsidy  to  the  rice  farmers. 
<br/>Vegetable farmers will be included in the allocation here.  That is why the subsidy allocation here 
<br/>remains the same as last year in addition to what has been given to rice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, I see rice farming, coconut farming, cocoa, ginger, vanilla, 
<br/></span><span>yaqona, dalo</span><span> all having separate allocation for the Extension Programme and Assistance.  Vegetable 
<br/>farming or horticulture is very important.  Everyday you need to go to the market and farmers need 
<br/>assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farmers  are  struggling  with  pests  and  high  cost  of  seeds.    There  should  be  some  funds 
<br/>available  so  that  these  farmers  have  access  to  these  funds  and  can  get  seeds  or  pesticides  at  a 
<br/>subsidised rate and in  the small  blue book, we have compared ourselves  with India as a growing 
<br/>economy.  India hugely subsidises its agricultural sector, that is why they are able to produce so much 
<br/>of vegetables or agriculture produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is high time we should concentrate on agriculture and also not leave horticulture 
<br/>behind.  Horticulture is something, fruits and vegetables are something that needs to be looked at and 
<br/>vegetable farming is something that needs to assisted vegetable farming and green crop farming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is your right of reply, honourable Sachida? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.  You still want us to go for the vote? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, now we will put his motion to the vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-3. We have another motion here from honourable Sachida 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nand. May you introduce your motion, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- No, Mr. Chairman, that is not for that Activity, it is for Programme 3-2.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Okay, Programme 3-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, it is Programme 3-1(7), this is on behalf of our furry 
<br/>friends, cats and dogs.   We have $130,000 allocated this year, thank you.  It is the same amount last 
<br/>year, but the stray cats and dogs are still increasing.  Maybe for next year if we can increase this also.  
<br/>If we can also think about tax concessions for those that want to donate, for example the SPCA, so 
<br/>if CJS is going to donate $100,000 to SPCA, if they can get concession the same as we do to sporting 
<br/>organisations.  They do a big job in looking after our stray animals, there is one animal shelter in Ba 
<br/>- the Greater Good Foundation.  They have 200 dogs right now in there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I saw last week that they were asking for donations for 700 kilogrammes of rice for their food 
<br/>for the next few months.  So maybe a plea rather than anything else to change for next year, maybe 
<br/>we can look at increasing this and think about the concession for those that want to donate. One big 
<br/>contributing  factor  to  animal  cruelty  is  the  high  cost  of  medicine  for  animals.  I  am  not  too  sure 
<br/>whether we can have some subsidy also on animal medicine so that when our animal get injured or 
<br/>sick we are able to afford to buy the medicine and keep them rather than just throw them out onto the 
<br/>streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is a very interesting contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Point is taken, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- In some provinces they eat this thing such as Lomaiviti, Bua.  They are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very good, it is a delicacy; eating cats, dogs and everything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  For  the  honourable  Members  information,  there  is  an 
<br/>additional $530,000 allocated under Programme 3-2 for Stray Animals.  Some funding from there 
<br/>could also be used if it is necessary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  3-1(5)  –  Purchase  –  Veterinary  Drugs 
<br/>($6,000).  There is another allocation of $1 million in Programme 3-2. Why are these spread over 
<br/>two different Activities when the intention is to get Veterinary Drugs?  Why are we doing central 
<br/>procurement so that we do not have procurement issues? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, I can explain that.  Programme 3-1(5) is to cater 
<br/>for the purchase of drugs for the Veterinary Laboratory and Programme 3-2(5) is for the clinics in 
<br/></span><span>Stations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, one is for the livestock and the other one is for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vet specifically.  The livestock drugs are different.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  sure  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  would 
<br/>understand  that  livestock  drugs  and  other  drugs  if  you  are  using  in  the  Veterinary  Laboratory, 
<br/>livestock drugs have a heavy procurement and they require more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, that is why I am saying it is separate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the Vet laboratory and the Clinic are different. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Understood, Mr. Chairman.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1279 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  the  two  different  institutions  that  use 
<br/>these drugs.  One is the Veterinary Laboratory and the other is the general extension work carried 
<br/>out by Livestock Officers, and those are two separate uses of drugs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-2(10) - Upgrade of Nasinu and Vuda 
<br/>Abattoir - FMIB ($400,000).  For a long time, there was a talk about moving this Nasinu Abattoir 
<br/>but now, we are upgrading it.  Does that mean that it is going to stay there for good, because there 
<br/>were complaints about the Abattoir?  I am talking as a person from Nakasi, so I declare my interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, we cannot leave the Abattoir in its current state 
<br/>to fall into ruins.  We still need to upgrade and maintain, even though the plans are already there to 
<br/>move  the  current  Abattoir  from  Naulu  to  Navuso.    However,  that  does  not  mean  that  we  do  not 
<br/>maintain it because we have to keep certain standards in the Abattoir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  3-2(9)  -  Stray  Animals  Control 
<br/>Campaign ($530,000).  Again, it has been highlighted to address this issue with a lot of compassion, 
<br/>so  if  the  honourable  Minister  can  clarify  what  is  all  being  done  or  will  be  done  in  this  control 
<br/>campaign, and if this amount is sufficient for the bigger problems that we have with stray animals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the campaign to control stray animals is quite a 
<br/>lengthy and cumbersome process.  We first have to with the community and then there are animal 
<br/>groups that are heavily involved when it comes to the control of stray animals.  Then we have to take 
<br/>the  community  through, so  it  is  like  an  awareness  programme.    Then  we  start  putting  up  notices 
<br/>before we finally carry out the actual, whether it is bating, caging or even shooting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, normally what  happens is  while  we are still in  this process,  the damage is 
<br/>done. For example, when dogs attack goats in a goat farm or sheep farm, they do not tell you that 
<br/>they are going to come. They will just come in groups, stay around the farm, find a really nice cool 
<br/>place to lie down and then when everything there is right, then they attack. Very intelligent animal. 
<br/>The worst thing is, they do not eat the whole carcass. They just bite the neck, take the blood out and 
<br/>off they go.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, when we talk to farmers who have gone through the dog attack and had like 
<br/>dozens of animals killed, it becomes a very emotional issue. As a government, we have farmers on 
<br/>one side and we have animal activists on the other side.  At one time, I made a statement that may 
<br/>be, we need to shoot the dogs. I was crucified on the press, but you know, that came out of frustration. 
<br/></span><span>I talked with the farmers because to me, livestock is more important than the dogs, especially when 
<br/></span><span>it is wild dogs. It is a very sensitive and complex exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- A question on stray dogs in the urban areas. Last year, what kind of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work was undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture to trap the dogs in the urban area? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, it is a continuous exercise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Is that also part of this funding that you have received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Yes. Just to tell you a story, some mornings when I take a walk 
<br/>in front here, stray dogs sleeping on the steps of Parliament. I think one weekend I came, there were 
<br/>about seven dogs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUINABUNA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  can  add  on  to  the  honourable  Minister’s 
<br/>response to the question,  our work in the Ministry is also coordinated with Municipalities. We work 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with Municipal Authorities and we address stray animal campaign in towns and cities differently, 
<br/>compared to when we deal with stray animals on farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To go back to the cost of stray animals, we have a lot of operational costs in stray animal 
<br/>because  we  have  to  maintain  pounds  where  we  will  hold  animals  and  we  will  have  to  look  after 
<br/>animals, depending on the number of days that is required before they  are released. So, there is a 
<br/>component of operational cost in that capital cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Before  we  proceed  further,  I  have  a  motion  here  from  honourable 
<br/>Sachida Nand  that is  to  do with  Programme 3-2(10).  Honourable Sachida Nand to  introduce his 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 30 be increased by $1 million in Programme 3-2(10) in respect to Dairy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I second the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  Dairy  Sector  needs  continued  support  from  the 
<br/>Government to assist in rejuvenating the industry.  Farmers have been affected by Brucellosis and 
<br/>Tuberculosis and the person has lost a considerable amount of stock on the farm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, last year, injected a record of $5 million into the industry and I am very grateful 
<br/>for that.  This year, the allocation has been reduced by $1 million.  This reduction will hinder some 
<br/>of the activities that was being planned to be carried out in the dairy industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I request the Government to re-instate this $1 million so that activities can continue without 
<br/>disruption.  The farmers were very grateful for the Government’s continued assistance.  Last year, 
<br/>they eagerly awaited the reinstatement of $1 million back into the Dairy Development Programme 
<br/>so that they can continue with all the activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must stress, again, I acknowledge the Government’s record assistance with the industry and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would be grateful if they continue doing that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I acknowledge the sentiments echoed by the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Member, I think the decision to reduce the grant on this Dairy Programme the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Member is very much familiar with and the utilisation rate has been slow. So, I think that decision 
<br/>was taken due to the slow utilisation rate of the funds that they were given.  But I guess come the 
<br/>next Budget, we should be able to get back to what it was. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Sachida Nand your right of reply here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister.   I look forward to the increment so that 
<br/>they can continue with all the activities.  This sector is on a downward spiral at the moment and the 
<br/></span><span>Government’s continued assistance is needed to revitalise it and also to reduce our import bill because 
<br/></span><span>50 percent of what we consume is important and we have potential to reduce this import and thank 
<br/>you for your assurance that this will be looked into the next budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do you still want to continue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- No, Mr. Chairman, Sir.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The motion has been withdrawn and we shall continue.  Programme 3-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  3-3(8),  there  has  been  an  allocation  of 
<br/>$1.04 million for the Beef Breeding Programme.  Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and 
<br/>Waterways elaborate that this is purely for beef breeding or in the same context, you will also be 
<br/>handling dairy into it because in the breeding programme they can be simultaneously run for both 
<br/>beef and dairy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Yes,  we  have  at  least  four  breeds  that  we  are  currently 
<br/>developing.  One of the breed - brown Swiss is both, for beef and dairy breed. I think you must have 
<br/>had a chance to see the animal, the frame makes it out to be a beef animal, but the udder really makes 
<br/>it out to be good for dairy. So, yes, we do have that allowance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We shall move on. Programme 5-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 5-1(7) - Climate Smart Agriculture ($250,000), 
<br/>I would be grateful if the honourable Minister could elaborate on what commodities are being looked 
<br/>at, together with what actions will be carried out under this programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, this is an ongoing programme that involves the 
<br/>development of indigenous rootcrops and even livestock. This indigenous livestock and rootcrops 
<br/>have shown resilience over time. There are teams that go out to the islands and they have identified 
<br/>species of yams, coconuts and even pigs for that matter. So that is what is involve in this climate 
<br/>smart agriculture programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for your explanation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Is that part of the climate change development? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- In fact, if you go to Koronivia, Mr. Chairman, you will find in 
<br/>the piggery, there is a whole section dedicated to indigenous pig breed.  In fact, they do much better 
<br/></span><span>in terms of their mothering skills than the introduced breeds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. Honourable Tunabuna. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this is  information for those who do not really 
<br/>know indigenous breeds, it is not only for crops, it is also for livestock. They have stood the test of 
<br/>weather and times, and they have very good mothering abilities, especially for livestock, and they 
<br/>can  stand  the  change  in  weather  conditions.  Indigenous  breeds  have  been  part  of  the  breeding 
<br/>programme in Koronivia for the last decade and have been supported by the Food and Agriculture 
<br/></span><span>Organization. So, it is an ongoing programme for the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. How long does it take before a breed is being introduced to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>becomes indigenous, or is it like the trees, the pine and mahogany and other indigenous trees?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Depending  on  the  different  breed,  their  time  will  become 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>localised.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the honourable Minister on 
<br/>the Aid-In-Kind – Promotion for Regional Soid Waste Initiative, if she can explain on that initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, what you have in front of you is a misprint.  
<br/>The project is supposed to read, “The Project on Pacific Islands Capacity Enhancement for Achieving 
<br/>SDG14” and this project is solely to enhance capacity of the officials of the Ministry of Fisheries to 
<br/>coordinate regional trainings to other Pacific Island countries to promote marine conservation and 
<br/>sustainable fisheries development to achieve SDG 14targets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN- That is still Aid-In-Kind? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just a question whether the amount mentioned here is the same amount 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the name change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, honourable Member, the amount is the same but the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>project name is different.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  2-1(7)  –  Inshore  Compliance  and 
<br/>Enforcement ($300,000).  This amount that has been budgeted over the years, but this year has been 
<br/>a  slight  decrease.    I  think  the  honourable  Minister  will  realise  after  going  on  tours  that  this  is 
<br/>something  you  are  constantly  asked  about,  about  making  sure  that  there  is  compliance  and 
<br/>enforcement of the fishing laws around those areas.  I am just wondering whether the honourable 
<br/>Minister given the constant problems that we have had over the years and the similar budget, whether 
<br/>this budget is addressing these needs for ensuring compliance and enforcement in inshore areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, yes, SEG 7 will address the need for inshore 
<br/></span><span>compliance  and  enforcement.  It  is  implemented  by  the  Inshore  Compliance  and  Enforcement 
<br/>Division to ensure the enforcement of the relevant laws and legislations within the inshore sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Will that involve fisheries wardens and all that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Programme 1-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.- Sorry, my question is on Programme 2-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programe 2-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister 
<br/>on Programme 2-2(1) – Sea Going Allowance – Regional Observers Programme ($200,000).  Why 
<br/>I am asking the honourable Minister is that this Observer Programme is basically we are providing 
<br/>Observers for regional countries to be carried on board foreign ships that are serving the other island 
<br/>countries in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Sorry, Mr. Chairman, I did not get the honourable Member’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Under  the  Regional  Observers  Programme,  Fiji  provides 
<br/>Observers on international fishing vessels that operate with other Pacific Islands. So basically, we 
<br/>are seconding them to provide that service because they do not have observers in those regions.  My 
<br/>understanding was that they were paying for those observers being seconded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  sea  going  allowance  for  the  Regional 
<br/>Observer  Programmes,  not  only  do  they  go  on  foreign  vessels  that  has  been  mentioned  by  the 
<br/>honourable Member,  they are also placed on long line Fiji licenced fishing vessels.  So, they also 
<br/>assist the national observers in the vessels that are licenced to Fiji, based in Fiji and are flagged to 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Let us move on. Programme 2-3.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-3(8),  Fish  Cage  Culture 
<br/>Research Project ($700,000).  I would like to get a clarification on that Programme, because this is 
<br/>the first time that I am seeing it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase is to cater for the procurement 
<br/>and  installation  of  solar  at  the  Makogai  Research  Station.    This  is  to  allow  for  the  production  of 
<br/></span><span>12,500  giant  clam  juveniles  for  24/7  stable  power  supply  and  to  provide  a  backup  system  to  the 
<br/></span><span>hatchery.  That is the reason for the increase is to cater for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, can I just make a clarification.  Does that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cost $700,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman.  The increase is mainly to procure the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>equipment for solar panels for the Makogai Research Station.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- It is written here “fish cage”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  understand  that  the  project  is  Fish  Cage 
<br/>Culture  Research  Project  which  is  based  in  Makogai,  the  increase  from  $300,000  from  the  last 
<br/>financial year to $700,000 for the next financial year, is mainly to cater for the procurement of solar 
<br/>panels for the Research Station.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I was going to ask that question too on the fish 
<br/>cage culture, but I am confused by the explanation given by the honourable Minister.  I have seen 
<br/>fish cage culture in other places like India, but I will probably have to go to Makogai again to see 
<br/>what fish cage culture is like the one that they are doing there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, last year the budget for this was $300,000, now it has 
<br/>gone up to $700,000.  In these two years we have not yet cultured and produced any fish in cages. 
<br/>Are  we  still  in  the  development  phase  where  we  still  not  have  reached  the  stage  of  culturing  or 
<br/>growing  fish  within  cages,  that  we  are  still  developing  the  infrastructure?    Will  that  be  a  correct 
<br/>statement to say? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, over the years we have developed clams that 
<br/>we have put out to the other reef systems.  It is an ongoing project with Makogai, we continue to 
<br/>spawn, rear and put out these clams, crustaceans, turtles and all the marine species that are cultured 
<br/>at Makogai.   It is an ongoing project, and we have over the years fed our reef systems with what has 
<br/>been spawned at Makogai.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And all $300,000 was used last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, maybe they should change the name instead 
<br/>of “fish caging” because fish caging is basically breeding fish in cages and then float them in the 
<br/>ocean where they breed them to adult and then they sell it. So, maybe they should change the name 
<br/>to avoid the confusion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.-  Mr. Chairman,  in  the past,  the project  was known as the 
<br/>Makogai Development Project. I think under the previous administration, the name was changed to 
<br/>Fish Cage Culture Research Project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- There are three former Ministers for Fisheries on this side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Sir,  I  am  speaking  from  experience  while  I  was  at  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sorry, Mr. Chairman, it seems that we are focussing only now on 
<br/>marine but there is also cage culture particularly on freshwater and this is a big opportunity for Fiji.  
<br/>The dam in Navua was wanst, there was a study on it. This was the rice dam in Navua for freshwater 
<br/></span><span>fish cage culture. And with that technology, Sir, you just use floaters, and you breed fish inside the 
<br/></span><span>nets. You just change the sizes of the nets every now and then according to the growth pattern of the 
<br/>fish. That is a huge opportunity for Fiji. So, probably if the Ministry for Fisheries can consider fish 
<br/>cage culture in freshwater as well. It is available with most of our development partners, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  He  is  just  making  a  statement  there.  No  need  to  reply,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Noted, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Just take note. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Activity 4? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I seek clarification. On Activity 2-4(4), Operations of Ice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plants ($440,000).

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1285 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Clarification is sort there, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Programme 2-4, the increase in allocation is to enable the 
<br/>Ministry to operate the 24 ice plant machines nationwide and this will also include the purchase of 
<br/>equipment, needed spare parts of the hatchery equipment, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I have a motion here from the honourable Koroilavesau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I wanted the same allocation for operation 
<br/>of ice plants to be increased. This is a major challenge for the Ministry of Fisheries where ice plants 
<br/>are  all  distributed  through  the  maritime  islands  and  the  isolated  communities  and  they  would 
<br/>normally breakdown. The breakdown of these ice plants causes the whole chain events of the fishing 
<br/>activities within those communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In certain areas and in certain times, ice plants in maritime islands like Vanuabalavu, Lakeba 
<br/>and Rabi when they breakdown, it will take 3 to 6 months without been solved. It stops the whole 
<br/>fishing mechanism within those islands. All I am asking is to increase the allocations so that there is 
<br/>a better support system. I can say we had to buy two generators from the government of Japan. They 
<br/>gave us money to fund that. Instead of fixing generators, we just take the generators, place it, take 
<br/>the old one and then replace it again after its repaired.  That is all I am asking for, if we increase that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We just get the seconding for the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- I second the motion, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- And he had already elaborated on his motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Sorry for that, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, you want to make any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comments on the motion; increased to $540,000 the maintenance of ice plants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  think  the  increase  of  $140,000  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sufficient for the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- It is okay if she says that but I can guarantee her that she 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will have problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- So, withdraw this motion now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Activity 5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  would  just  like  to  seek  the  Koro 
<br/></span><span>Fisheries Stations which has been ongoing for about four years now.  I just wanted to ask where it is 
<br/></span><span>now and what stage they have reached? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Koro Fisheries Station honourable, Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  allocation  for  the  construction  of 
<br/>Koro Fisheries Station, $545,000, this is the first of the three years that the Ministry of Fisheries is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going to construct the Fisheries Station and the necessary works for Koro Fisheries Station.  I know 
<br/>it  has  appeared  in  the  past  budgets  of  the  Ministry  but  because  there  were  issues  regarding 
<br/>landowning units in Koro, that was the cause of the delay for the construction of the Koro Fisheries 
<br/>Station but all have been finalised and the project will take three years to be fully constructed and in 
<br/>operation.  This year is the first of the three years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think I had a motion, I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdraw that. That seeks clarification on the State’s development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Activity 6. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-6(8)  -  Food  Security  Programme  - 
<br/>Freshwater Aquaculture Small-Holder Farmers ($1 million).  How effective is this programme and 
<br/>is $1 million sufficient enough to cover all the small-holder farmers in aquaculture? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, because of the need to put less pressure 
<br/>on marine resources, the increase in funding is to cater for the increase in the demand for aquaculture 
<br/>farming around Fiji and also to ensure sustainable food security.  So, this $1 million is sufficient for 
<br/>the next financial year to cater for small-holder farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, is the distribution centres 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for aquaculture in all the divisions and easily accessible to all the farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, honourable Member, it is accessible to all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on the same SEG and on the same issue, the Food 
<br/>Security Programme for Freshwater Aquaculture, this is quite a large increase of around $400,000 to 
<br/>go up to a million dollars. But one of the things that we have seen for aquaculture, is that a lot of 
<br/>these areas where we built these farms, especially the smallholders, is the issue of getting good feed 
<br/>for them.  Is this just about digging up the ponds or also giving them some assistance so that they can 
<br/>produce fish that are well fed, so that they can be as productive as possible?  Is it just about digging 
<br/>ponds or is it also looking at other things down the line to make the prawns as productive as possible? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Thank you, honourable Member, so it is not only about the 
<br/>digging up of the ponds, it is about the whole package.  Apart from the ponds, the feed and other 
<br/>assistance that is provided by the Ministry and we have had an increase in demand from farmers who 
<br/></span><span>are intending to venture into aquaculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-6(8) - Construction of Multi 
<br/>Species Hatchery - Ra ($781,038), can the honourable Minister clarify the amount of money that is 
<br/>allocated for this because this was part of a donor supported project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  allocation  of  $781,038  for  the  Multi 
<br/>Species Hatchery in Ra is to cover wages and FNPF for project officers, fuel and oil, procurement, 
<br/>shrimp feed, visits and site inspection and construction of two new staff quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the motion that I had put in, now 
<br/>that she has said that it also includes the salary of staff and people that are working in that Hatchery.  
<br/>I thought it was just a direct assistance to progress the work that was carried out by the Government 
<br/>of Taiwan.  Thank you.

<div><span>Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman on Programme 2-1(6) under Fiji Pine Trust - Extension 
<br/>($1,745,102), an increase of around $0.5 million.  Can the honourable Minister explain the reason 
<br/>for the increase just for our information? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  increase  is  to  cater  for  the  following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>activities: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Administration; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Silviculture; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Utilisation Consultation;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to Programme 2-1(5) – Annual 
<br/>Contribution- International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation. My question is whether any work is 
<br/>being undertaken by the Ministry of Forestry to develop this bamboo and rattan industry in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.– Thank you, Mr. Chairman and honourable Member,  you 
<br/>will notice there has been no change in the annual contribution from the previous financial year and 
<br/>the allocation was moved from SEG 6 to SEG 5 in line with the new budget classification structure. 
<br/>So,  the  provision  of  the  annual  subscription  fee  to  the  International  Union  of  Forest  Research 
<br/></span><span>Organization  is  to  enhance  the  collaboration  between  countries  on  forest-related  research  and 
<br/></span><span>disseminates information to all partners that gradually contribute to decision-making and policies. 
<br/>This also allows to new research areas and findings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.–Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  was  whether  we  have  developed  a 
<br/>Bamboo and Rattan industry in Fiji? Any work has been undertaken by the Ministry of Forestry to 
<br/>develop a sector on bamboo and rattan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.  –  Thank  you,  honourable  Member  and  Mr.  Chairman,  the 
<br/></span><span>work on developing the bamboo sector is still in the process.  The Ministry of Forestry is still looking 
<br/></span><span>at ways to develop the bamboo from the various species of bamboo that are available in Fiji. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.  – Thank you.  I understand there are only  three  varieties in Fiji.  Apart 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from Indonesia, they have several dozens of varieties. Anyway, they are still looking into it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU. – Mr. Chairman, the item on SEG 6 has already been asked 
<br/>by honourable Usamate. The Minister has explained what is included in the amount of money that I 
<br/>wanted to discuss, so I will withdraw my motion on increasing this allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. –Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7 - Emission Reduction Programme - Benefit 
<br/>Sharing Plan for the World Bank has a budget there of $6.3 million which is an increase from $4.1 
<br/>million (if I am correct) from last year. For our information, can you inform us on the purpose of the 
<br/>increase and what are the benefits that are coming out of this beneficiary plan?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.–Mr.  Chairman,  the  increase  is  to  cater  for  the  following 
<br/>activities; project administration, Alternative Livelihood Initiative Development, Capacity Building 
<br/>Training and Awareness, registered REDD plus conservation lease, Annual  staff emoluments, the 
<br/>ten-district  level  integrated  LUP,  implementation  of  communication  and  participation  plan,  the 
<br/>securing  of  forest  government  stock  and  securing  socket  layer  license.  So,  this  is  government’s 
<br/>contribution to support Fiji’s participation in the carbon financing mechanism under the World Bank, 
<br/>FCPF,  Carbon  Fund,  REDD  Plus  readiness  initiative  to  reduce  emission  from  deforestations  and 
<br/>forest decantation through the enhancement or establishment of forest government stock as syncs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN. – Has the Ministry arrived at a formula in the sharing, especially to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resource owners? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU. – Mr. Chairman, Sir, its coming soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  On  the  next  SEG  –  8  Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and 
<br/>Forest  Degradation (REDD Plus) of $1.2 million,  that  is  also  a $400,000 increase.  Can you just 
<br/>illuminate us on what that is for and the reason for the increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, she has already explained that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, the first one was on SEG 7, this is now on SEG 8. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation is a cash grant from the World 
<br/>Bank that supports carbon trade.  The processes, systems and institutional arrangements are clearly 
<br/>articulated in the Emission Reduction Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I think you have given the answer to my first question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-  We have a motion on Programme 2-7(9).  The two motions are from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Koroilavesau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  maybe  I  just  start  off  asking  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarification from the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are these the two motions that you have withdrawn again? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Or it has just arrived on the table? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman.  It is on SEG 9 and SEG 10?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  maybe  I  should  just  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  clarification  and  if  that  is  clarified  then  I  may  withdraw  the  motion.    I  just  needed 
<br/>clarification on those two figures on Programme 2-7(9) - Maritime Pine Development ($700,000) 
<br/>and SEG 10 - Commercial Maritime Pine Subsidy ($2,141,810).  I would like to ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister to clarify and explain the difference between SEG 9 and SEG 10?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase in Maritime Pine Development 
<br/>is  to  cater  for  the  following  expenses:  salary,  wages,  transfer  and  allowance,  vehicle  repairs  and 
<br/>maintenance, saw milling timber treatment and marketing.  That allocation is for those purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commercial Maritime Pine Subsidy is to cater for re-barge and boat fare from subsidy 
<br/>of  logs  and  timber  from  Kadavu  and  Lakeba,  the  construction  of  new  jetty,  the  roading  subsidy, 
<br/>outsourcing of portable saw milling and treatment, vehicle purchasing and staff recruitment.  I hope 
<br/>that is clear, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, that clarifies that these are two distinctive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>items, so I would like to withdraw the motion that I had put up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 32.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.  Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, on Programme 2-1, I will go straight to SEG 9 - Purchase of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research Vessel.  If the honourable Minister can elaborate further on this project, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the purchase of technical equipment, there is 
<br/>an  increase  of  $167,180.  This  is  just  a  holdover  from  the  last  financial  year.    So,  we  have  not 
<br/>completed with the purchases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- My question is specifically on the research vessel.
