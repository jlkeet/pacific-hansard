<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, SEG 5(5) and (6) Public Service Broadcast (TV) and 
<br/>Public Service Broadcast (Radio).  Is the Government continuing to engage FBC on this or any other 
<br/>service providers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-So, the idea for us as a Government is that we want to create a 
<br/>level playing field and part of the reason why it is in Head 50 is that we are going to take a decision 
<br/></span><span>on a policy where we can use other broadcasters as well, based on our need and the cost that would 
<br/></span><span>be determined as part of proper tender and expressions of interest.
