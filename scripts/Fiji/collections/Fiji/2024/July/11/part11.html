<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now resolve into Committee of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Supply to resume debate on the Heads in the Budget Estimates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 22 – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, before I ask my  question to the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health,  I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration.  There 
<br/></span><span>was  a  break-in  at  the  Baulevu  High  School  on  Tuesday  night  in  the  Science  Laboratory.   
<br/></span><span>Unfortunately, the police did not appear until 11.30 a.m.  When I texted the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Home Affairs, just 25 minutes after talking to him, the police was there.  Thank you, honourable 
<br/>Minister, for your prompt response.  Just letting you know that spirits and about more than two dozen 
<br/>testubes have been lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- What is the half dozen and two dozen?  What is that for?

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1243</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- More than two dozen testubes from the science laboratory at Baulevu High 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>School and I happen to be the Manager of the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I thought you were referring to some bottles or something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Testtubes and spirits  had gone missing.  I want to thank the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Home Affairs for his prompt address.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services on Head 22, given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that any government’s priority is infrastructure, education, health and we understand… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Which SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Head 22.  I am talking about the Head; no programme.  I have seen that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is a decrease in the overall Head. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is the first time that someone is concentrating on the wholesome 
<br/>figure for the Ministry, but  I thought we would dive straight into the SEGs and the Activities, et 
<br/>cetera, but you want to begin yours with the overall. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, no just on the Head, there is a huge decrease. If you look 
<br/>at staff establishment, there is a reduction and if you look at the overall budget of the Ministry, it has 
<br/>decreased by 26.382 per cent.  Knowing any government, they will want to see the Ministry of Health 
<br/>well looked after.  But here, we are seeing a decrease.  I request the honourable Minister to explain 
<br/>the decrease. Staff establishment decreased by 10.663 percent travel and communication by 1.130 
<br/>percent maintenance and operation, purchase of goods and services, special expenditures and capital 
<br/>construction and capital purchase 631.6 percent.  That is my only question, honourable Minister.  Can 
<br/>you explain these decreases? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I will refer your question honourable Nath to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance because  that is where they do the cutting of the cloth.  When you want your coat to 
<br/>measure to size but it depends on the cloth available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I request the honourable Minister to answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I understand you want the honourable Minister to answer it, but I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>refer your question to the honourable Minister for Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member knows what 
<br/>we said during the Budget Debate.  Last year we increased the budget for the Ministry of Health from 
<br/>$339 million to $453 million.  I do not know where he is getting this $26 million in this year’s budget, 
<br/>there is a slight reduction of only $2 million.  It is not a reduction of $26 million as he has pointed it 
<br/>out, I do not know where he is getting that figure.  We have looked at the utilisation in the last year, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, in fact, what we have allocated for the Ministry of Health is still a huge increase from what was 
<br/></span><span>there before and a slight reduction of $2 million because of the utilisation particularly in the capital 
<br/>budget.  The Health Ministry still gets the biggest increase from last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I refer to Programme 1-1(6) and this is with respect to the 
<br/>Grant to NGOs.  I see there is a substantial increase from $900,000 up to $1.6 million, just a little 
<br/>explanation if I could upon that particular increase?
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Koya for 
<br/>his query with regards to Programme 1-1(6) on the Grant to NGOs.  As you would have known, this 
<br/>grant  to  NGOs in  this financial year was allocated to  are few NGOs namely Fiji  Cancer Society, 
<br/>Empower Pacific, and are few others probably five.  For this financial year, we have noted an increase 
<br/>in request for funding through NGOs.  What the NGO does is fill in the gaps whereby the Ministry’s 
<br/>work is very much needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this year, we are also expecting WOWS Kids Fiji to come on board and also apply to get 
<br/>into this fund.  The funding is done through an EOI process. At the moment, we have five NGOs, I 
<br/>can  give  you  the  names  of  the  current  NGOs  in  this  financial  year  but  for  this  Budget,  we  are 
<br/>expecting more NGOs that will want to come on board and have a piece of these funds so that they 
<br/>can assist the Ministry in doing their work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 1-1(8) – Upgrade and 
<br/>Enhancement  of  Labasa  Hospital  (Interior)  -  $5.1  million.    From  the  $5 million  allocated  for  the 
<br/>upgrade of Labasa Hospital, less than a million dollar was used, that is, 16  percent of the budget.  
<br/>According to the information which is posted on the Parliament website, can the honourable Minister 
<br/>explain why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, in terms of the utilisation in Labasa 
<br/>Hospital, what the contractors faced was the electrical issues.  Because of the electricity capacity 
<br/>within Labasa Hospital, most of the capital projects in terms of the refurbishment of the A&amp;E was 
<br/>put on hold.  We currently have new machines in the Labasa Hospital such as CT Scan and laboratory 
<br/>equipment but due to the capacity of the electrical supply within Labasa Hospital, that cannot cater 
<br/>for the load of the new equipment.  Together with that, the old wirings, that is why we brought EFL 
<br/>on board to do a whole survey of the hospital and give us a report.  We should privatise the electrical 
<br/>work before they can commence with the completion of the work; that was the hold up in Labasa 
<br/>Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, on Head 22-1-1(5) – Outsourcing of Emergency 
<br/>Clinical Health Services, I noticed there was a reduction of $1 million from the last financial year.  
<br/>Seek clarification from the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, for the outsourcing part, there is a 
<br/>reduction but  because we are also improving our capacity within the Ministry of Health and Medical 
<br/>Services, we have improved our testing capabilities and other specialised areas.  That is why there is 
<br/></span><span>a reduction, but we have used that as a backup should the need arise then we will fund. Should we 
<br/></span><span>exhaust this allocation, there is always an opportunity to source from within to ask for more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  in  fact  I  have  two  questions.    One  is  on 
<br/>Programme1-1(5) and the other one is on Programme1-1(6). Shall I just do both questions as one, 
<br/>Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Programme1-1(5) – Doctors Specialisation ($650,000). I just need 
<br/></span><span>clarification  whether  this  is  to  do  with  further  capacity  development  in  order  for  our  doctors  to 
<br/>specialise in certain areas or where we lack such skills, we bring in the specialists?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My other question is on the Sai Prema Foundation which is on SEG 6.  I know that they were 
<br/>also  given  the  same  allocation,  we  appreciate  the  work  that  they  are  doing,  particularly  for  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1245 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>children, not only Fijians, but from the region as well.  My question to the honourable Minister is, 
<br/>whether this will be an annual allocation or this is just temporary?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  initially  when  Sai  Prema  Foundation  Fiji  was  in  the  infancy  stages,  there  were 
<br/>discussions  about  what  they  provide  and  what  comes  from  the  Government.    Like  I  said,  we 
<br/>appreciate the work that they are doing, but I have seen this allocation in both last year’s budget and 
<br/>this year’s, so I just wanted to know whether this will continue in the years to come or there will be 
<br/>some variations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, for his first question on doctors 
<br/>specialisation, that allocation is for course fee payment of our medical officers pursuing Masters  of 
<br/>Medicine Programme and Public Health through in-service training.  That is that allocation for.  It 
<br/>will be used to pay for the course fee for Semester 2, 2024, and the balance will be used to pay for 
<br/>the continuing students in 2025.  Again, as always, an EOI will be called for the utilised space for 
<br/>those who are graduating at the end of the year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, as for the second question in terms of Sai Prema Foundation Fiji, this grant 
<br/>started last year.  Yes, as alluded to by your good-self that they are doing a good work in terms of 
<br/>correcting  congenital  heart  defects  and  also  very  much  needed  screening  for  our  rheumatic  heart 
<br/>disease  patients.    This  allocation,  as  we  speak,  is  to  assist  with  the  operational  cost,  as  they  are 
<br/>bringing in experienced doctors from overseas to perform this lifesaving surgery at free of charge 
<br/>here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, it is not only localised to Fiji, but also including other Pacific countries.  In 
<br/>terms of answering your question, will it be a yearly thing, we are taking it early, it started last year 
<br/>and this year, it is divided into four disbursements.  Based on their acquittals, then we will give them 
<br/>their balance so that has been the practice from last year and this year.  Next year, Mr. Chairman, I 
<br/>do not know if it will still continue.  Nevertheless, they are doing a good work in addressing some of 
<br/>the gaps within the Ministry in terms of the specialised area of correcting congenital cardiac defects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will begin from the back again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, it has already been asked by honourable Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, firstly, I just would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for the big job done at the Savusavu Hospital, all the refurbishment works, maintenance and 
<br/></span><span>repairs that have been going for the past few years.  I am getting the feedback from the people of 
<br/></span><span>Savusavu that they really appreciate the Government’s effort in trying to fix the Savusavu Hospital.  
<br/>From the books that I have here with me from last year, you were given $250,000 for refurbishment 
<br/>work and again for this year, we have another $200,000 for the same purpose (refurbishment) in SEG 
<br/>8.  It is coming back this year on this Budget for another $200,000 for the refurbishment work at 
<br/>Savusavu.  I just need a bit of clarification on the kind of work.  Is that to complete the same kind of 
<br/>work  that  you  are  doing,  or  are  there  some  other  new  refurbishment  works  and  repairs  et  cetera 
<br/>coming up? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank honourable Tuinaceva for 
<br/></span><span>his query on the refurbishment of Savusavu Hospital of $200,000. He is correct in saying that that 
<br/>has been an ongoing allocation from previous year’s budget up until now, it is to do with a good 
<br/>amount of capital works within Savusavu Hospital as you are all aware of in terms of the surrounding 
<br/>and the landscape. There was some degree of landslide there so for this allocation, it is an ongoing 
<br/>one and supposedly to be for the Divisional Engineer Western, for sewer line re-alignment which 
<br/>was approved by the Ministry of Finance, contract documents were signed with the Ministry of Public 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Works and again we are waiting the new financial year to transfer funds to the Divisional Engineer 
<br/>Northern to confirm the commencement of work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr, Chairman, let us go to Levuka from  Savusavu. The Levuka Hospital 
<br/>was destroyed by fire and I do not see any allocation for the construction of the hospital that was 
<br/>destroyed by fire unless it is in SEG 8 on the Upgrade and Enhancement of Sub-Divisional Hospitals 
<br/>but it is not mentioned, just a clarification on that, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, with regards to Levuka Hospital 
<br/>after  a  part  of  the  old  hospital  was  damaged  by  the  fire  together  with  the  infrastructure  that  was 
<br/>housing the mortuary. The area where the old hospital which was damaged, that  was condemned, 
<br/>that was one-third of the hospital. The other two-thirds, when I visited last year and this year, I was 
<br/>told that the base of the hospital is  still intact and they are able to, if we can maintain it then it will 
<br/>be for good use but in terms of the infrastructure which was housing the mortuary and that area of 
<br/>the  old  hospital  which  was  condemned,  as  we  speak,  we  have  some  donors  who  stand  readily 
<br/>available to assist the Government in improving that part of the infrastructure. If you prioritize it, it 
<br/>is way low down because that part of the old hospital, the better half of the two-thirds of it, that is 
<br/>currently being housing our Environment Health Officers while the mortuary part, we will have to 
<br/>deal with it and see how we can build the infrastructure and put in the new mortuary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just to clarify that further, it is included in SEG 8. It is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned but it is part of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, supplementary. So if it is included, then the mortuary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>works is also included in that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Included. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, maybe we seek your direction, if we have more 
<br/>than one question, do we go one by one or do we ask all the questions at once on the same Activity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.  -    I  think  we  go  one  by  one  to  allow  the  Minister  to  respond  to  it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Otherwise, it will be like yesterday.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Yes, I noticed that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, we noted the 0.4 percent decrease with the Ministry of Health and Medical 
<br/></span><span>Services’ budget. I also noted in the new budget book the items that were missing which we seek 
<br/>clarification from the honourable Minister for Finance whether it has moved to other Activities or 
<br/>Programmes.  One is the Laundry Service, there was  $1.3 million  allocated in last year’s fiscal year, 
<br/>it  is  missing  from  this  year  and  the  Customer  Relation  Support  (DFAT)  -  $84  million  and  the 
<br/>Community Health Worker Wages amounting to $3 million. It was in last year’s allocation under 
<br/>this Programme but is missing from this year’s Budget book.  I just seek clarification whether it has 
<br/>moved to another Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it has been decentralised to all the different 
<br/></span><span>cost-centres activities.  So, if you look at all the other Programmes and Activities, you will find that 
<br/>we have moved to these cost-centres which is a better way of allocating so that expenditure is utilised 
<br/>in time and fully. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Thank you for that answer but I am not satisfied.  I have gone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through all the SEGs centres and it is not there, Mr. Chairman, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1247 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  will  let  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Services answer and then I will come back to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R.  LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, start  of with your Community 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Health Worker, you asked that question?  I think it is in SEG 7, an amount of $3 million.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  My  question  is  on  SEG  8  –  Upgrade  and  Enhancement  -  Sub-
<br/>Divisional Hospitals, Health Centres and Nursing Stations.  I can see that $2.4 million is allocated 
<br/>this year.  Last year the money was allocated, only 53 percent, that is around $1.2 million.  Again, if 
<br/>the honourable Minister can explain to us why the funds given last year was not fully utilised and 
<br/>why do you need another $2.4 million?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman,  I thank honourable Premila Kumar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for her question.  That is SEG 8 on the first one, upgrade… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is on  Upgrade and Enhancement - Sub-Divisional Hospitals, Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Centres and Nursing Stations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R.   LALABALAVU.- We are requesting $500,000 for seed funding.  
<br/>We are doing seed funding for this financial year so in the upcoming financial year, we are able to 
<br/>execute the work.  Seed funding preparatory works, we are doing it for newly established nursing 
<br/>stations, upgrading nursing stations to health centres that is part of the seed fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have gone around Viti Levu in terms of looking at our health facilities and areas where 
<br/>population have increased or areas which the road has reached up to.  We have identified that this 
<br/>facility needs to be upgraded to the health centre level.  For that to happen, there needs to be a doctor 
<br/>looking after the health centre, so the quarters, improving the storage space et cetera. We need seed 
<br/>funding for that to do our preparatory works before we can finalise everything and put a monetary 
<br/>value on it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue on is $50,000 on Incinerator Rehabilitation, Building Infrastructure, that is, for 
<br/>Sigatoka and Rakiraki only. The Extension of the Waiting Area at the Kamikamica Health Centre in 
<br/>Lautoka, again one of the issues is the electrical works for our facilities and this one is specifically 
<br/>for Nadi Hospital in the amount of $430,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question, Mr. Chairman, Sir.  My question will be 
<br/></span><span>in two parts.   Sir, you were also given some  funds last year, substantial amount and only 53 percent 
<br/>was used.  Can you explain why you were not able to use the rest of the funds? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  As  you  are  aware,  this  financial  year  we  were 
<br/>given an allocation for these works.  Together with that, we had assistance from our development 
<br/>partners and other multi-lateral agencies like UNICEF.  That is why there are some savings within 
<br/>those  allocations,  but  nevertheless  in  areas  where  we  were  unable  to  spend  was  external  to  our 
<br/>control, like the capacity within the Ministry of Works and so forth which limited our ability to spend.  
<br/></span><span>Those are two of the main reasons I can think of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman  through  you  to  the  honourable  Minister,  we  do 
<br/>appreciate the assistance by our bilateral partners.  I note that you are still receiving funds for Anti-
<br/>COVID  activities,  in  last  years’  budget  we  also  had  assistance  from  Indonesia.    This  is  under 
<br/>Programme 1-1(7) and that is not appearing, but we still have the China - Pacific Island Countries 
<br/>Anti-COVID  Cooperation  Fund.    Again,  the  question  honourable  Minister  is,  where  is  this  fund

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly focusing, whether it is the FCDC laboratory and on the continuation of it as well, because 
<br/>I am also aware that we are in Geneva, the team is in the process of developing the pandemic laws, 
<br/>so what is the purpose of this assistance and where is its focus on? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I believe the question was in two 
<br/>parts; the assistance from Indonesia (China Aid on COVID).  The assistance from the Indonesian 
<br/>Government, which was a grant, that has been fully utilised, that is why it is not here.  Probably last 
<br/>month we had completed the handing over of very much needed equipment by the Government of 
<br/>Indonesia to Fiji.  I think that was the spillover from the previous government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the funding by the Government of China, the COVID fund, the handover was 
<br/>done last year, and it was reflected in our allocation last year but we did not utilise it and again it is 
<br/>reflected this year that it is still there.  We have some plans on how we can utilise the fund both in 
<br/>evaluation  of  our  health  system  and  also  for  the  purpose  it  was  used  for  –  Incident  Management 
<br/>Response  Team  (IMRT).    They  will  come  up  with  their  own  process  on  how  to  utilise  fund  for 
<br/>programmes which better prepare us for certain and future pandemics so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Well, that is just about all, we will move on to Programme 2.  We have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been dwelling on this one for the last 40 minutes or something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is not clear, there are certain things which are still not clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Can we move on, you had two rounds each, you were being  given time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to raise your questions and queries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is budget, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, I understand it is budget, but we need to ensure that we prepare 
<br/>ourselves  well  otherwise  it  will  be  continuing  like  this  and  then  it  will  eat  up  the  whole  of  the 
<br/>morning.  Time is of the essence here, honourable Members.  When you come, please prepare well, 
<br/>you put your questions in a row so at least it helps everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want another, that is your third time, honourable Koya.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We cannot hear clearly what Programme, what Activity, what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SEG and what you are asking. It is not very clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are still on Programme 1-1 and we have been dwelling on this for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the last 40 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, it is quite a pertinent question that is why I am asking and 
<br/>I was actually only asking one at a time.  This is to do with Programme 1-1(5) – Clinical Services 
<br/>and Governance.  The allocation has been reduced by some $50,000 and the word “Governance” has 
<br/></span><span>been added to it.  From what I understand, governance would mean that this is relative to patient’s 
<br/></span><span>safety and quality care, et cetera.  Because we have added the word “governance”, can you explain 
<br/>why  there  is  a  reduction?    From  what  I  understand  is  to  do  with  infection  control,  et  cetera  in 
<br/>hospitals.  Why  would  there  be  a  reduction  and  addition  to  the  actual  clinical  services  line  but  a 
<br/>reduction in the budget?  Just an explanation on that honourable Minister.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, there is a reduction of $50,000, 
<br/>you are correct in saying that in terms of Clinical Services and Governance, it is to do with safety 
<br/>and  safety  is  paramount  in  terms  of  health.    The  budget  item  is  for  the  payment  of  Outreach 
<br/>Programmes relating to blood services.  With that being said, there is even a reduction in $50,000, 
<br/>you  will  note  that  in  the  other  Programmes  and  Activities  there  is  an  increase  in  the  Outreach 
<br/>Programmes for the various Divisional Hospitals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, it is all to do with the Ministry in trying to decentralise most of its services.  Clinical 
<br/>Services and Governance, when we had the signing with DFAT on the Master Plan, we also give 
<br/>Certificates to our staff (our nurses) who just graduated on doing clinical governance work within 
<br/>the Central Division.  That will be replicated in the other main hospitals and the other divisions as 
<br/>well.  In terms of costing, decentralising certain priorities to the Divisional and Labasa Hospital is 
<br/>the other hospital under the Ministry is where we will find those funds that has been put aside to 
<br/>those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question.  Are we sufficiently covered 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for infection control in hospitals within that particular budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Sir, for now yes because we continuously have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the assistance of our development partners mainly DFAT on this area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I could just make a general comment to help the honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side.  As I said last year we increased the Ministry of Health’s budget very, 
<br/>very  significantly.  This  year,  the  reduction  is  just  $2  million  and  you  will  see  the  reductions  of 
<br/>$20,000 or $30,000 and $50,000 in some of these areas. It does indicate utilisation of our budget.  
<br/>So, we have looked at the utilisation and reduced on the basis of that so it does not mean that the 
<br/>services will be affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- There is another question raised by honourable Premila Kumar that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reduction is $26 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman, in  the last financial year it was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$453 million, this is $451 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You get that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  not  know  where  they  are  getting  $26 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million from?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, let me explain, honourable Minister for Finance.  If you 
<br/>look at Page 152, you will find in brackets, that indicates that there is a reduction.  It says $26 million 
<br/>as the total.  I am asking him and he is misleading Parliament.  He says only $2 million, whereas the 
<br/>book says it is $26 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Go to page 150. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- So you are talking about  Programme 1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Yes, that is for Programme 1.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  First  he  talked  about  the  total  budget,  and  he  said  he  was 
<br/>reading Programme 1-2.  What I said very clearly, and I have repeated myself, the total budget for 
<br/>the Ministry of Health and Medical Services last year was increased significantly.  In the last financial 
<br/>year, it was $353 million,  and this year it is  $351 million,  it is  a reduction of total  budget  by $2 
<br/>million.  Then you have Programme and Activities where the movements are increased or decreased, 
<br/>but the overall budget has just decreased by $2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Nath, the honourable Minister wants to reply to your query.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Nath, you were correct 
<br/>in saying a reduction by $26 million.  If you look at the Established Staff ($10 million), it is nearly 
<br/>half of that.  That has been decentralised to the various Divisional Hospitals cost centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 8 on the Construction of New Tamavua Rehabilitation 
<br/>Hospital ($400,000).  In the last Financial Year 2023-2024, $1.5 million was given and the utilisation 
<br/>was zero percent.  They did not use the money.  Can I ask the honourable Minister, you could not 
<br/>use that $1.5 million given last year, this $400,000 is for what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, the last allocation for this Financial 
<br/>Year for rehabilitation of the hospital was $1.5 million.  Our ability to spend, again, it is beyond our 
<br/>control externally.  In terms of the development partners, who is looking into this?  Discussions are 
<br/>ongoing, but nevertheless, for this upcoming financial year we will start with the preparatory works 
<br/>on  our  end.    Once  that  is  done  then  KOICA  can  come  on  board  and  start  building  of  the  new 
<br/>Rehabilitation  Centre.    It  is  a  four-year  programme  before  the  completion  of  the  Rehabilitation 
<br/>Centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question will be on SEG 9 but before that, I just 
<br/>wanted  to  make  a  remark  on  the  unspent  money  on  construction  of  new  Tamavua  Rehabilitation 
<br/>Hospital. I can understand the honourable Minister’s frustration, he wants to do the work, but the 
<br/>work is stuck in the pipeline all because of Public Works Department and that needs to move. If the 
<br/>money is not spent, it simply means the service is not delivered to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, my question on SEG 9 is to do with the Purchasing of Specialised Medical Equipment 
<br/>for  Urban  Hospital  as  well  as  for  Sub-Divisional  Hospital,  Health  Centres  and  Nursing  Stations.  
<br/>Specialised Medical Equipment is so important for diagnostics.  The funds were given last year but, 
<br/>unfortunately, it was not fully utilised. The utilisation rate was extremely low.  So, if the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister can explain why the funds were not used. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>utilisation, again, it is nothing new. It has been there from the previous government until now. It has 
<br/>to do with the procurement process - tendering and the process itself.  It is an issue whereby there are 
<br/>delays in equipment coming over but, nevertheless, the Ministry through the Fiji Pharmaceutical &amp; 
<br/>Biomedical  Services  (FPBS)  are  working  on  how  they  can  expedite    the  process  in  bringing 
<br/>equipment over.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, there are equipment already in Fiji at the moment. Some have been installed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but others are waiting for, again, improvement in the infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  I  just  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  very  honest 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  forgive  me  from  my  ignorant  with  the 
<br/>Community Health Worker allocation.  My question to the honourable Minister is, does this only 
<br/>include the 1,200 villages or will it also include some heavily populated settlements? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, those Community Health Workers 
<br/>have been  registered not only in </span><span>itaukei </span><span>villages but in settlements as well. If they are registered, 
<br/>they have gone through the training, they registered within the Ministry, they should be receiving 
<br/>their allowance prior to submitting their report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity.  I  asked  for  an 
<br/>opportunity to make a general comment because it will help all of us, particularly the Ministers and 
<br/>the Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our Budget discussion with the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his team, we asked 
<br/>the  question  about  the  slow  implementation  and  the  problems  in  the  procurement  process.  The 
<br/>feedback from the Permanent Secretary, Sir, is that one of the key problems that they see in Ministries 
<br/>is junior officers are involved in the preparation of the documents for the procurement process. As a 
<br/>result, it goes to and fro, and the exchanges are taking time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, Sir, in terms of moving forward because we want implementation to be done because 
<br/>of the funding, if Permanent Secretaries can be tasked to ensure that senior officials from Ministries 
<br/>are involved in the process because of the tender boards. I had raised an issue where previously, we 
<br/>used to have agency Tender Boards, Divisional Tender Boards but all these has been centralised now 
<br/>for control purposes, particularly for those that are on ‘R’… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- By your government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …and it has not changed, honourable Minister. A lot of things are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>still on ‘R’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have changed that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- But the way forward is to get the right officers to do the work so 
<br/>that it can help in terms of expediting the process. I just want to make that comment, Sir, because it 
<br/>will help us in terms of the way forward. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, Leader of the Opposition for your comment.  We will now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 2-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-2(5)  -  Non-Communicable 
<br/>Diseases Prevention and Control ($350,000).  Just a question to the Honourable Minister, we have 
<br/>the same allocation that was given last year coming again this year and basing on the record that we 
<br/>have, there is about 80 percent death every year due to NCD related diseases and sickness.  So, is 
<br/></span><span>this allocation enough to fight against NCDs and the death rate that we are facing in this country in 
<br/></span><span>relation to NCDs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU. A.R. LALABALAVU.-  Mr. Chairman, through you, thank  honourable 
<br/>Tuinaceva for your question. These two new core Centres - Wellness in Activity 2 and Family Health 
<br/>in Activity 1, by way of background, they get a lot of funding not only from development partners 
<br/>but multilateral agencies as well, UNICEF, so it is  through this funding that they able to do most of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their programmes.  That is why their utilisation rate is a bit slow, not less, simply  because of the 
<br/>funding and assistance that comes to them. That is why most of these allocations are at the same 
<br/>level.  Nevertheless, it is sufficient for now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T.TUINACEVA.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR CHAIRMAN.-We will move on.  Programme 2-3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    Just  a  clarification  form  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister,  through  you  Mr.  Chairman,  the  reduction  of  Oral  Health  Promotion  and  Mental  Health 
<br/>Awareness by $100,000.  Just a clarification, I believe Oral Health Promotion used to be $300,000.  
<br/>Why was the reduction in view of the prevalence of dental decay in our society?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU. A.R. LALABALAVU.-  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, through you, I thank  
<br/>honourable  Ravunawa  for  his  question.  In  terms  of  the  reduction,  again,  for  now,  the  amount  is 
<br/>sufficient.  For this year, we have just appointed our National Advisor on Oral Health and for this 
<br/>financial year, he will be doing most of the programmes for which the coming financial year, they 
<br/>will be able to  carry out their activities.  Nevertheless, with  that reduction, we still have funding 
<br/>within the Divisions, within the two main Hospitals to carry out their outreach and also implement 
<br/>some of the programmes that are usually funded within this allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the reduction, there are allocations available at the Divisional and the two main 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Thank you, honourable  Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir,  my question is on SEG 5 - Climate Change and 
<br/>Health Care ($65,000).  Can the honourable Minister explain to us what activities will be carried out 
<br/>with this money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  The  Programme  looks  after  public  health 
<br/>complaints  or  new  environmental  issues,  such  as  public  health  nuisance  that  is  perceived  by  the 
<br/>public to be harmful for human health.  Environmental Health Inspectors will investigate, advise and 
<br/>prosecute.  This programme budget will look at assessment and monitoring of recreational water, 
<br/>procurement of point of care testing kits and re-agents, as well as assist on climate change and health 
<br/>interventions, training and community work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Koya, you signalling something.  We have gone past that, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, maybe you can raise it in other activities still ahead? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, Sir, it was relative to an increase that I had asked for.  I had sent the 
<br/>slip  across  earlier,  and  they  had  it.    It  was  to  do  with  the  mental  health  awareness  issue,  Sir,  in 
<br/>Programme 2-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are now into Programme 3 Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I had sent it earlier, it was with them, Sir, before we actually came up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have to take it from here, Sir.  We are now into Programme 3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  have  a  question  with  respect  to  Programme  3-5(5).    Just  seek 
<br/>clarification, Sir, from what I understand, from St. Giles, their budget usage has been in excess of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>100 percent.  I think it is about140 percent.  There is a reduction (correct me, if am wrong Sir) and I 
<br/>think it is an important issue.  Mental health is also an important issue with respect to St. Giles.  Are 
<br/>they not being resourced correctly in terms of rations, et cetera.  In SEG 5, there is a reduction.  Again, 
<br/>correct me if I am wrong, I just want an explanation on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- On ration? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- So, $200,000, a reduction in $10,000, and that is 
<br/>for procurement of ration.  As with this facility – St. Giles Hospital, on ration, that allocation is ration 
<br/>for inpatients.  In terms of the reduction, this is one area also where they get a lot of assistance from 
<br/>the private sector.  For now, the funding is sufficient, even with the reduction of $10,000.  So, should 
<br/>we need more, we can also source from within, but as it is, it is sufficient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I had really asked because I know because of the drug issue, we have 
<br/>had a huge amount of intake and St. Giles itself is actually using up a whole lot more than the budget 
<br/>that is  actually  given.  Fair enough, if you have private entities supporting  the St.  Giles institute, 
<br/>anyway, I think that fairly answers it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on to Programme 4-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, on Programme 4-1(5) -  Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue and 
<br/>Diarrhoea (LTDD) Control Programme, I note that we have only $50,000 allocation, particularly in 
<br/>the build-up areas in the Central Division.  Maybe, the honourable Minister for Finance Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics can help as well - the linkage between the Ministry 
<br/>of Local Government  in terms of the LTDD Campaign.  Maybe a chance to increase this allocation, 
<br/>Sir, based on previous issues that we have had in as far as LTDD is concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. In terms of this allocation under LTDD Control 
<br/>Programme, this is for their ongoing programmes.  Should there be any outbreak, funding is available 
<br/>within Headquarters on Emergency funding.  They can source from within Headquarters.  But for 
<br/>this allocation, it is specifically for their programmes on preventative and awareness. Now, they are 
<br/>doing it on a daily basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, still on SEG 5  - Boats and Outboard Motors, $50,000 
<br/></span><span>has been allocated in other programme as well.  What we were told in one of our meetings that there 
<br/>are areas where the Ministry gave boats, the Boats are there but engine is not there.  In some places, 
<br/>engine is there but boat is not there.  It is really a problem, especially for people in maritime areas. I 
<br/>can see the allocation of $50,000, is it to buy new boats or also to provide engines which has been 
<br/>missing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, in response to honourable 
<br/>Bala, this is the allocation for  purchase of new vessels, minor maintenance and life jacket -  item 
<br/></span><span>which is required by MSAF, repair, maintenance and  servicing of outboard motors and buying of 
<br/></span><span>the new outboard motors as well.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 5-1(5) – Service Fees – 
<br/>Biomedical Equipment ($1,600,000).  If the honourable Minister can explain in terms of what does 
<br/>it entail, I mean, when you say service fee? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- When we get new equipment, there is a provision 
<br/>there for procurement and servicing, so that is the service fee.  We make sure that there is a clause of 
<br/>service  fee  within  the  contract  so  should  anything  happen  to  the  machine  here,  the  suppliers  are 
<br/>contracted  to  come  and  do  the  servicing,  and  at  the  same  time,  build  capacity  within  our  local 
<br/>biomedical cadre within the Ministry. That is the allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.  –  The  reason  why  I  asked  that  question,  when  you  buy  a  new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>equipment, et cetera, there is always a guarantee period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I agree. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So it is only when the guarantee period expires, then only you have to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pay for that fee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Yes.

<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, it is, and I am not asking you the question, honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance.  Let the honourable Minister answer, he is answering questions much better than you. 
<br/>Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, the $1.6 million that is allocated, is that money going out to the foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>companies, or is it to the local institutions?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  some  are  going  to  the  foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>companies and some to the local institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Are you saying that we have the expertise?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, we have some expertise available 
<br/>in the private sector within Fiji, and even our own biomedical cadre.  In terms of the finer details of 
<br/></span><span>the very expensive machines, we still need to get overseas experts to come in and do the servicing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What about the spare part issues ? Normally, we hear that the spare 
<br/>parts are not here when it comes to servicing, et cetera, and the machines are not operatable, and they 
<br/>have to wait for a longer period.  Do you have the sources internally? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- It is mostly overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, what do you do in that period when the machines are not serviced?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I mean, these are practical issues that people are facing, and it is not a laughing matter, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  I  agree.    So,  I  will  give  you  a  scenario.    If  a 
<br/>machine is found to be faulty and that is the only machine available in Fiji in the public sector, then 
<br/>we  have  no  other  choice  but  to  source  servicing  and  spare  parts  et  cetera.    That  is  why  we  have 
<br/>allocation for outsourcing so that we are able to use the private sector to send our patients to, in the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1255 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meantime, while we do the repairs on our equipment.  Once that is done, we revert our patients back 
<br/>to public servicing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for your very detailed explanation 
<br/>because this is what people want to hear, and my questions were precisely from that point of view.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  other  question  is  on  SEG  9  -  Bio-Medical  Equipment  for  Urban  and  Sub-Divisional 
<br/>Hospitals ($10,000,000).  If I am not mistaken, $12 million was allocated in the last Budget, and it 
<br/>was not fully utilised.  This year $10 million is allocated.  If you can explain why that money was 
<br/>not used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, again, it goes back to the tendering 
<br/>and procurement process.  In some procurement, they expect partial payment or full payment.  With 
<br/>that being said, then the tendering plus the procurement from our suppliers overseas is where most 
<br/>of the delays are.  Nevertheless, especially in this programme, usually the funds are committed so 
<br/>that  we  do  get  in  the  equipment,  perishable  or  medicine.    Once  we  commit  the  allocation,  it  is 
<br/>reflected in the budget.  Only until we receive the items, then we do the full payment.  It may be 
<br/>reflected in the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-Thank you, honourable Minister for your response – much appreciated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 5-1(9) Dental Equipment for Urban 
<br/>and Sub-Divisional Hospitals ($800,000).  I noticed that there was a reduction in this allocation. Sir, 
<br/>a clarification from the honourable Minister, the dental service would need a boost in their allocation.  
<br/>I would particularly talk about the prosthetic service that is now being held at Nakasi Health Centre.  
<br/>It needs to come back to the CWM Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  the  expansion  of  the  dental  prosthetic  service  to  Vunidawa.    Now,  they  have  an 
<br/>appointed officer in Nadi when they need to set up the dental laboratory there.  Also, we want to 
<br/>expand that service to Savusavu and probably to Taveuni as well.  These are specialised dental care 
<br/>where we fabricate dentures for our elderly patients, and they cannot travel too far to get this service.  
<br/>I would urge the honourable Minister to, please, consider our elderly citizens in the decentralisation 
<br/>of service from the main centre and closer to their home.  So, I am particularly concerned, and I seek 
<br/>clarification on SEG 9.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, I thank honourable 
<br/></span><span>Ravunawa for his concerns and points.  Yes, I sincerely agree in terms of the Prosthetic Services that 
<br/></span><span>is done in Nakasi. It used to be in CWM Hospital. We do intend to bring it back, but the issue is 
<br/>space  within  the  CWM  Dental  Services.  Should  we  allocate  adequate  space,  then  we  should  be 
<br/>bringing it back.  Yes, it is a priority within the Ministry to decentralise Prosthetic Services to the 
<br/>Sub-Divisional levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been to Savusavu Hospital, the Dental Office there do agree with me that, yes, there 
<br/>needs to be Prosthetic Services done there, Taveuni, Vunidawa and other affected Sub-Divisional 
<br/>Hospitals. But to be honest, the dental cadre together with its area of work since taking this office is 
<br/></span><span>found to  be badly  affected.  I can say poorly  supported, and it is  something that the Government, 
<br/></span><span>through the Ministry, is trying its best to improve the workspace and infrastructure. This allocation 
<br/>we have here will buy more dental chairs to fit those that are in poor walking conditions. I can say 
<br/>for Rakiraki Hospital and other areas as well.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this financial year, we have approved in buying new dental chairs for certain facilities, 
<br/>but  this  is  just a continuation on that and for sure, we will improve and decentralise some of the 
<br/>services to the Subdivisional areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, this is relative to SEG 5 - Consumables. Patients 
<br/>have  actually  complained  with  respect  to  the  consumables  they  have  been  asked  to  purchase 
<br/>themselves and I am not sure, but I think some of the doctors also. I see there is $33 million that has 
<br/>been allocated for consumables and medicine and that has not changed from last year.  Why is there 
<br/>a disconnect with respect to what has been told in the space? Do we need more with respect to that 
<br/>particular  area  about  consumables  and  medicine?  Is  that  sufficient  to  cater  for  consumables  and 
<br/>medicine? Why I am asking this is in light of the fact that there are patients who been asked to bring 
<br/>their own medicines, et cetera. In some places, there was a shortage of even cotton wool.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, to answer the query 
<br/>raised by honourable Koya, yes, this allocation increased by $3 million from this financial year and 
<br/>it is still the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of shortage of medicine and consumables, I can say is something that is felt within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the region because of our location, purchasing power, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, we rely on our improved procurement system within FPBS which has just gone 
<br/>online. Together with that, we are trying to improve our processes on how we can streamline the 
<br/>approvals from the Tender Board and the availability of what we need from the suppliers. Most of 
<br/>the time, it is what we need that they do not send and what we do not need, they do send.  So, that is 
<br/>something the Ministry through FPBS is working on trying to improve the processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we speak, honourable Koya, I can say that for now, this is sufficient.  We do plead with 
<br/>our public to bear with us that, yes, at times, there will be shortage of certain things but, nevertheless, 
<br/>as a Ministry, we are always trying to improve and see that we have much the needed medicine and 
<br/>consumables readily available here in Fiji.  It also goes back to our storage capacity as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just recently, we opened a new storage facility in addition to the current one in Jerusalem 
<br/>Road and, likewise, we  will be commissioning another new facility in  Labasa  and, therefore, the 
<br/>West  is  left.  So,  once  we  have  the  storage  capabilities,  we  are  able  to  procure  more  and  store 
<br/>accordingly.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We shall continue.  My apologies to honourable Shalen Kumar.  I must

<br/>straight ahead. Sorry about that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 23 – Ministry of Housing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. Programme 1-1? . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have a very simple question on SEG7 -  National 
<br/>Housing Policy Implementation Plan. I would like to ask the Minister whether that Policy has been 
<br/>approved by Cabinet?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  National  Housing  Policy  has  not  yet  been 
<br/>approved by Cabinet. It is still currently under review.  The consultations was held in May this year 
<br/>and another public consultation needs to be undertaken before it can come for Cabinet approval.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. Yes, honourable Naisa and then honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. TUINACEVA.- On the same SEG7, Mr. Chairman, on the National Housing Policy 
<br/>Implementation Plan, $95,000 was allocated for that last year and we have another $63,000 in this 
<br/>year’s budget. Is this still on consultation process? What is slowing this Plan from its implementation, 
<br/>et cetera, honourable Minister?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the $63,000 that has been allocated will assist the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Housing for the following policy implementation and awareness: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of the National Housing Policy of $35,000 after approval by Cabinet.  
<br/>Awareness on the next revision of the National Housing Policy of $15,000. 
<br/>Awareness  on  other  housing  policies,  like  the  First  Home  Ownership  and  Fire  Grant 
<br/>which will further assist the Ministry in the promotion of its policies to the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, honourable Bala, then back to honourable Premila Kumar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  PALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  a  supplementary  to  SEG7,  can  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister confirm that this National Housing Policy Implementation Plan was approved in April this 
<br/></span><span>year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the paper that was presented to Cabinet was not 
<br/>about the National Housing Policy but it was just to update Cabinet on the procedural steps that our 
<br/>Ministry was going to take in the process of that review. So that was the purpose of the paper that 
<br/>was approved by Cabinet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.  Honourable Minister for Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There was a policy approved in 2011 so this allocation, as the 
<br/>Minister said, revised housing policy that set the discussion.  There has been some work already done 
<br/>so the allocation is for the completion of that housing policy and implementation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  yes,  I  agree  that  the  housing  policy  was  being 
<br/>formulated with  the help  of New Zealand assistance.  My concern here,  Sir, SEG7 says National

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Policy Implementation Plan. How can you implement a plan when the plan is not approved. 
<br/>So maybe the wording needs to change, that it is actually the formulation of a national housing plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the revised policy that is currently 
<br/>being discussed is not yet been completed. We are targeting to complete it before the end of this year, 
<br/>hopefully  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  next  financial  year.    That  is  where  we  are  going  to  do  more 
<br/>awareness and implementation of revised nation housing policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG 7 again, I am assuming confirmation  
<br/>by the honourable Minister that the National Housing Policy Implementation Plan will include those 
<br/>that are squatting on privately owned, Native and Crown lease? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the of the revisiting and reviewing 
<br/>of this Policy  is to review the whole Housing Sector .  We have also taken on board all stakeholders, 
<br/>all agencies, so as to ensure when we move ahead, we do not leave any sector behind.  It is a very 
<br/>inclusive process and that is something that we have in mind when we are reviewing the National 
<br/>Housing Policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Honourable  Minister,  Programme  2-1(10)  HART  -  $400,000. 
<br/>There is a reduction on the allocation given to HART.  Is there any reason for that?  Last year was 
<br/>$500,000 and we have gone down by $100,000 this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  The  $400,000  that  we  allocated  this  year  is  to  cover  for  the 
<br/>operational  cost  which  is  around  $60,000,  the  reconstruction  of  two  burnt  flats  at  Newtown  of 
<br/>$120,000; as well as payment of professional fees for the two burnt flats at Nadera -  $9,500, as well 
<br/>as general maintenance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been doing general maintenance of the HART complexes for  some time, it is an 
<br/>ongoing exercise, and we are allocating $210,000 to assist in the upgrading and renovation of the 
<br/>remaining HART flats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Still on SEG 10, Mr. Chairman, can I just continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, I can see funding for Habitat for Humanity Grant  – Greenfield Pilot 
<br/>Project - $500,000 in this year’s budget, nothing on that in last year’s budget.  I think this must be 
<br/>the  first  time  we  are  assisting  Habitat  Fiji  for  their  projects,  and  I  want  to  congratulate  the 
<br/>Government for that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The $500,000 allocated for Habitat Fiji, it says that this is for Greenfield Pilot Projects.  I just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>want to understand what is that Pilot Project and how do you arrive at that $500,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Through you, Mr Chairman, the.  Ministry has been receiving a 
<br/></span><span>request on how we can relocate families that are being served with eviction notices.  Currently, we 
<br/>do not have any scheme in place to assist in that regard.  So, what we have decided is to set aside 
<br/>some funds to assist the Ministry in relocating some of these families that have been evicted.  For 
<br/>example, those people at Veidogo Settlement, they have been served with eviction notices.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1259 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Housing has signed an MOA with Habitat for Humanity to assist the Ministry 
<br/>in the identification as well as any green field or green space, or one of the existing sites that was 
<br/>acquired  through  development  lease  to  assist  in  the  relocation  of  these  families.    We  do  not 
<br/>understand because some of these families, because of the state of their income level and the struggles 
<br/>they have been facing, so we engage Habitat for Humanity to assist in the provision of some simple 
<br/>houses in the process of relocating them to some of these green field or existing land that we have 
<br/>acquired through our development leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  2-1(8)  -  Formalisation  of  Informal 
<br/>Settlements  ($13,468,756),  for  last  year,  it  was  $10  million.    What  I  want  to  know  from  the 
<br/>honourable Minister is, is this the rollover from last year to continue with these projects or are there 
<br/>new projects in this year’s programme?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the Ministry of Housing acquired close to 50 development leases from </span><span>mataqali 
<br/></span><span>for the development of informal settlements.  Unfortunately, some of the development leases have 
<br/>not been renewed.  I can give you one example of Varavu in Ba, and I have discussed this with the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Finance.    That  lease  was  not  renewed  and  now,  the  tenants  are  paying 
<br/>whatever they are supposed to pay to the landowners.  What I am trying to say and justify is, at that 
<br/>point  in  time,  taxpayers’  money  was  paid  to  the  respective  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>.    Do  you  not  think  it  is  the 
<br/>responsibility of the Government to continue with that programme, or just forget about those monies 
<br/>that were paid? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, there are two parts of that question, and I will try 
<br/>and answer the first one which is on the utilisation of the formalisation of informal settlement with 
<br/>the allocation of $13.5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes,  there  are  four  informal  settlements  that  will  be  the  continuation  of  the  existing  and 
<br/>formalisation that have been allocated in the current financial year.  That is for Sakoca - $2 million; 
<br/>Nasinu - $2 million; Tavele, Nadi - $1.4 million; Toria in Lautoka, as well as Field 4 of $3 million.  
<br/>On the new capital  projects,  the formalisation of new projects  for Valele in  Ba  - $1 million; and 
<br/>Vunika in Labasa - $1.8 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also covers meeting some of the consultation engagement fees, covering consultation up to 
<br/>engineering drawings and phases of around $1.7 million and the improvement of some of the basic 
<br/>amenities of $250,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On your question on why the development lease for Varavu was not actually renewed, for 
<br/></span><span>any development lease, the onus is on landlord, and we have tried our very best to have consultation 
<br/>with  the  iTLTB  on  the  renewal.    Of  course,  we  have  requested  iTLTB  for  the  renewal  of  such 
<br/>development lease, and we have just been advised that there have been new demands now by the 
<br/>respective landowning unit, and that is something that we need to respect.  But it does not take away 
<br/>the fact that we will have to continue, and also encourage iTLTB for the renewal of the development 
<br/>lease.    So,  we  will  continue  our  consultation  with  them  and,  hopefully,  without  any  further  new 
<br/>demands, we will be able to renew their leases.  That was the only reason why the renewal of the 
<br/>development lease is still on hold.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Chairman, apart from Varavu, how many other development leases 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have not been renewed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, I think that is the only development list that we 
<br/>have not renewed at the moment,  the one at Varavu which is really a challenge now for the Ministry, 
<br/>while the other leases that we have, we managed to renew most of them.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Before  I  offer  the  floor  to  honourable  Viam  Pillay,  I  would  like  to 
<br/>acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of the New Zealand Deputy High Commissioner, Mr. 
<br/>Alex Shahryar-Davies. </span><span>Bula vinaka</span><span>, Sir. Also, a former politician, Mr. Rinakama and a gentleman 
<br/>from Wainibuka sitting in front of him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Programme  2-1(10)  -  Housing  Assistance  for  Persons  Living  With 
<br/>Disability ($300,000).  With the high demand of housing from Persons Living With Disability, is this 
<br/>$300,000 enough? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  programme,  honourable  Member  is  to  assist    Fijians 
<br/>living  with  disability  with  a  maximum  grant  of  $5,000  per  applicant  to  upgrade  their  homes  to 
<br/>accessible standards. So, that programme is for that.  We think, based on the number of applicants, 
<br/>this is sufficient for one year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Sir, I can see under SEG 10 that there is an allocation for Veikoba Bridge 
<br/>Project, $2 million and it comes from the Housing Authority Capital Grant.  Sir, my understanding 
<br/>is, this is a building of a bridge and it should come from the infrastructure budget.  So, why are we 
<br/>using Housing’s budget for this bridge project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, that allocation is to assist the Housing Authority, 
<br/>that is, after consultation with the Fiji Roads Authority for the  construction of that bridge.  On the 
<br/>other side of the bridge is a parcel of land where Housing Authority is planning to develop. It is going 
<br/>to generate nearly 400 to 500 new lots to the people of Fiji. For the Housing Authority it is really a 
<br/>very significant project in terms of bridge construction. This is just to assist the Authority in doing 
<br/>some  groundwork,  feasibility  study  before  discussions  with  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  on  that 
<br/>particular bridge. They are just assisting FRA in doing some of the preliminary works before the 
<br/>actual construction of the bridge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, if I can just add, this was a very conscious decision in the 
<br/>Budget because when we had the discussion with FRA, as the Minister quite rightly  said, this could 
<br/>open a large number of lots and the problem that we had was this bridge. We said that this allocation 
<br/>within the Ministry of Housing Authority, we will allow them to  provide this additional support, 
<br/>work with the FRA so that this bridge is completed as a matter of urgency so that they can start work.  
<br/>The development lease has already been granted, work has been done but this bridge is holding back 
<br/>the unleashing of these additional plots.  I think it will be a big addition if we are able to do this 
<br/>quickly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, who is doing the bridge?  Is it the Housing Authority or the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Roads Authority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Member should know that Housing Authority 
<br/>is not going to build the bridge on its own.  What we are doing is include it in this budget so that they 
<br/>can work with FRA and push this tender process and the construction of the bridge.  What we are 
<br/>doing is trying to decentralise allocations to each concerned Ministry and is able to push for it to be 
<br/>done quickly.  That is the idea of allocating this and giving it to the Authority. We have this big 
<br/></span><span>problem of centralisation, the honourable Leader of the Opposition knows this and we are trying to 
<br/></span><span>slowly do that so that things can be done as quickly as possible.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, still on Programme 2-1(10) on Housing Assistance 
<br/>to Fire Victims ($200,000). I just wanted to ask, roughly how many victims can be assisted from 
<br/>$200,000 and what was the assistance rate in the last financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the Housing Assistance Grant is allocated to 
<br/>those families whose residential homes are affected through fire, a grant of $5,000 is given and that 
<br/>$5,000 will continue.  So, from the $200,000 that have been allocated, we are going to give  $5,000 
<br/>per family whose house got burnt in this new financial year and there is a provision for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  we  are  trying  to  move  ahead  and  then  all  of 
<br/>someone has pulled out.  You all raise your hands and we took note of it because as I stressed the 
<br/>importance of sticking to time here.  Let us try and work together here, if you raise a question, that 
<br/>is your right to raise a question but when I allocate the time, please ensure that you stick to it or 
<br/>otherwise it is just a waste of time for all of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Housing and Community Development for his answers on SEG8 in relation to the formalisation of 
<br/>Informal Settlements. The issue that I had raised earlier, I would just like to clarify, I think this will 
<br/>also  Qauia  and  Wakanisila.    If  he  can  just  give  us  an  update  on  what  is  the  progress  of  that  and 
<br/>whether Wakanisila will really happen? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You still have an interest in Wakanisila or is it outside…? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, for Wakanisila there is an issue, I think there 
<br/>is a church whose boundary is partly inside the development lease and partly within the mataqali 
<br/>land.  This is something that we are trying to address with iTaukei Land Trust Board before we can 
<br/>move ahead with the project because I think something is very important and the landowners are also 
<br/>raising their concerns.  For the Ministry, I think it is prudent that we address it first, but it would not 
<br/>take away the fact that we also going to have Wakanisila as part of our formalisation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  in  Qauia,  it  is  not  here  but  something  that  we  are  also  looking  into.  In  one  of  the 
<br/>development  plans  that  were  done  earlier  on,  there  were  concerns  on  those  settlements  that  live 
<br/>alongside the Qauia River.  What the Ministry is trying to do is, if these areas are prone to flooding, 
<br/>then we need to relocate them to higher ground and that is something that we are also discussing now 
<br/>with iTLTB if they have any unused land in Qauia that the Ministry can use to formalise the Qauia 
<br/>Settlement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  Programme  2-1(10)  First  Home 
<br/>Grant [Income Threshold - $50,000 and below] and First Home Grant [Income Threshold - $50,001 
<br/>to $100,000].  The First Home Grant - $50,000 and below – I would like to know how many families 
<br/>benefitted and why only 68 percent of the fund was utilised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- On the utilisation of this, for this current financial year, a total of 
<br/>128 applicants were paid $2.8 million as well as further applicants have been approved and will be 
<br/>paid  out  before  end  of  this  financial  year  amounting  to  $150,000.  Accordingly,  a  total  of  134 
<br/></span><span>applicants will benefit from this programme in the current financial year with a total payment of $2.9 
<br/></span><span>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- For the other programme, the First Home Grant ($50,001 and above), 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>again I would like to know how many families benefitted and what is the utilisation rate?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  the  utilisation  for  these  housing 
<br/>grants for the current financial year currently sits at 75 percent and a total of 96 applicants have been 
<br/>assisted with a total payment of $1.1 million and six6 applicants have been approved and will be paid 
<br/>by end of July amounting to $75,000.  Accordingly, a total of 102 applicants will benefit from this 
<br/>programme in the current financial year with the total payment of $1.195 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on and Parliament will now vote on Head 23 – Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Housing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 23 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 24 – Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments ?  Programme 1-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman, under this Activity, I have got two questions. 
<br/>My first question is on SEG 7 – Development of Child Care Policy and Regulation. I can see that 
<br/>$10,000 was allocated for the development of this policy last year and I have seen $10,000 allocated 
<br/>again this year. Can the honourable Minister provide clarification on this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am just finding the page.  The development of 
<br/>the Child Care Policy has actually been finalized, this was completed by the IFC World Bank.  It was 
<br/>brought to Cabinet and approved. What we are trying to encourage now is for employers to actually 
<br/>set up childcare facilities in their workplaces. This is really what the allocation was for. So, we are 
<br/>continuing the work to reach out to employers and organisations to do so because this will help with 
<br/>our women who can come to the workplace and have childcare facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are very excited about the proposed development of BPOs because like overseas, BPOs 
<br/>are known to have childcare facilities in their BPO parks so we hope that this will be the case. So, 
<br/>there is continued work in implementing this Child Cre policy around Fiji and so there is continued 
<br/>work dedicated to this course so that is why the allocation remains so that we can raise awareness of 
<br/>this, not just here in Suva but in all the different Divisions and Districts as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.  -  Mr.  Chairman,  so  that  is  not  for  the  development.  It  is  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation am I right, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Yes,  honourable  Member.  Like  has  been  answered  by  previous 
<br/>Ministers, we do not just end at developing a policy, we need to implement them as well and so our 
<br/>teams are dedicated to carrying this out and yes that does assist with implementation as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, my second question is on SEG 8. Last year $250,000 was 
<br/>allocated for the construction of Lautoka Aged  Care facility, my  question is  how was the money 
<br/>spent and I can see another $225,000 given this year. How does the Ministry intend to use this money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, I think I explained this in the last sitting of Parliament 
<br/>where we had commenced work to renovate the Ba Mission Hospital for the relocation of our current 
<br/>residents but that fell through and so we have  had to now work and thank the Ba Provincial Holdings 
<br/>for offering the Matanakilagi House which will need renovation so that it is fit for purpose for our 
<br/>residents.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  construction  of  the  new  Lautoka  Aged  Care  facility  will  need  the  demolition  of  the 
<br/>current facility but as we are doing scoping on that particular spot, we feel that perhaps it needs to be 
<br/>relocated  to  a  different  location  for  expansion  purpose  as  well.    I  think  this  Government,  or  any 
<br/>government, should consider not just offering for our residents who come to us but also the possibility 
<br/>of looking at a voluntary facility where that voluntary facility can then fund the facility for those 
<br/>residents that are presented to us. So, a retirement living offered also by government. That is also in 
<br/>the plans. But to answer your question, it is still being scoped for the next financial year given the 
<br/>option of actually relocating that facility completely to another location. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  We  have  received  a  motion  from  honourable  Seruiratu.  This  is  the 
<br/>motion coming from your side as well, from the honourable Leader of the Opposition and if you care 
<br/>to introduce your motion, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase the allocation in Head 24-1-1(7) - Economic Empowerment of Persons with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disability from $10,000 to $40,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, at first, I do acknowledge the Government and the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  the  allocation  of  $10,000  for  the  purpose  of  economic  empowerment  of 
<br/>persons  with  disability.    I  did  raise  this  in  terms  of  the  resilience  level  of  our  people  in  our 
<br/>communities and it involves economic empowerment, particularly for persons with disability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, in this Parliament have always talked about handouts, or whatever we want to call it, but 
<br/>this is a programme that I hope everyone will support, because we need to look after our people who, 
<br/>unfortunately, have limited access to employment and many other benefits.  That is why I have moved 
<br/>this  motion,  Mr.  Chairman,  in  the  hope  that  we  can  consider  increasing  this  allocation  for  the 
<br/>economic empowerment of our people with disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, perhaps, if I could respond to that motion, I thank the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition for his motion.  Yes, there is always a need to economically 
<br/>empower our people living with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of this allocation, we have found that people living with disabilities reach out to the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry more effectively through their organisations.  If you look at SEG 6, we have the Fiji National 
<br/></span><span>Council  for  Disabled  Persons,  which  is  allocated  over  $0.5  million.    Then  there  is  the  Grant  to 
<br/>Organisation for Persons with Disability ($300,000).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of organising themselves, that is more effective.  This particular grant is really there 
<br/>if there is any individual who comes forward.  I will give the example of the Rewa Disabled Women’s 
<br/>Group who are thriving and doing very well in terms of planting and harvesting mushrooms and other 
<br/>cash crops.  They are very visible and mobilised.   It is a group of close to 200 people, including 
<br/>women and people living with disabilities.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The suggestion or the motion is noted, however, we would like to suggest, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, that to be more effective in terms of accounting back to the Government in terms 
<br/>of utilisation, to support each other, the organisations are much more effective this way. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We still have three more speakers listed here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, in the last sitting, the honourable Minister said that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation of $250,000 is directed to the renovation of the new building.  Am I right? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Good. So, that $250,000, plus another round of $350,000, that will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the total cost for the …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Sorry, what SEG is that?
