<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU. - Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>I rise to join other honourable Members of this 
<br/>august  Parliament  to  add  my  voice  to  the  Bill  that  is  before  Parliament.  On  this  note,  I  wish  to 
<br/>congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics for a well thought-out, balanced and visionary National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir</span><span>, </span><span>this Budget reflects innovation rather than business as usual.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The importance of  non-sugar crops contribution to the economy 
<br/>cannot be over-emphasized and the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways appreciates the budget of 
<br/>$101.2  million,  an  increase  of  $6  million.  It  is  an  indication  of  the  Government’s  support  towards 
<br/>resource-based sectors for growth and development in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the lack of luxury of time, I will focus on some key initiatives that the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways will be focussing on over this financial year. But before I do that, 
<br/>I would just like to answer to some of the queries made by the honourable Premila Kumar regarding the 
<br/>utilization of funds.  Rice, as she mentioned, our records show that we have a 90 percent utilisation rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  farm  access  roads,  we  are  approaching  50  percent  utilisation  but  let  me  make  it  clear  to 
<br/>Parliament that building farm roads is not like making sandwiches; it is not that easy. You first must do 
<br/>the scoping where engineers have to do their normal scoping exercise then we have to deploy machines 
<br/>to areas that were previously neglected for so many years; untouched.  Not even one of your Ministers 
<br/>visited those places. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Do the job, stop complaining.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  We  want  to  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  we  are  building  farm 
<br/>roads  in  areas  that  have  never  been  touched  before.    These  are  areas  that  are  farmed.    When  we 
<br/>opened up a farm road in Lovoni, there were a hundred thousand yaqona plants, so you can imagine 
<br/>the joy from those farmers when finally, they can load their </span><span>yaqona</span><span> in a four-wheel drive and get it 
<br/>down to the village.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will be focusing on the following initiatives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Empowerment through increasing income levels.  The Ministry is in the process  of the 
<br/>formation of farmer co-operatives for both crop and livestock producers. Let me just give 
<br/>an  example.  Currently,  we  are  focusing  on  beef  production  to  be  reintroduced  into  the 
<br/>highlands of Navosa.  I know my good friend, honourable Alipate Tuicolo is well aware 
<br/>because we talked about it here in Parliament before I went up to meet the beef producers 
<br/>in Navosa.  The Navosa beef farming is a well-known story in Fiji agriculture.  There used 
<br/></span><span>to be a beef farmer by the name of Mr. Masibalavu.  He was so successful that he opened 
<br/></span><span>up a butcher in Sigatoka Town.  Unfortunately, he went by himself.  He was a one-man 
<br/>army, so in the end, he could not keep up with the supply and the business suffered.  So, 
<br/>what we are encouraging the Navosa farmers now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to go together as a 
<br/>co-operative so that when it comes to supply for raw materials, in cases like the butcher by 
<br/>Mr. Masibalavu, they will not have to go through the same problem again.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1095 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The improvement of service delivery by raising efficiency level turnaround time.  This has 
<br/>been  a  sore  thumb  in  the  Ministry  since  I  joined,  but  we  will  see  that  the  services  are 
<br/>delivered on time.  One of the cases in particular is the results for soil tests.  We have been 
<br/>given  two  mobile  soil  laboratories  by  the  Indian  Government  and  the  results  can  be 
<br/>produced for those who have given their soil samples within minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  Ministry  will  be  focusing  on  increasing  the  production  base  for  both  crops  and 
<br/>livestock  to  achieve  economies  of  scale.    To  this  effect,  we  already  have  large  scale 
<br/>production technology companies that are producing vegetables on a large scale, but we 
<br/>need  more  investors  to  invest  on  large  scale  production  technologies  for  fruits  and 
<br/>vegetables and also for intensive livestock production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)  We  will  also  be  focusing  on  working  with  the  private  sector  through  the  PPP 
<br/>recognising that the private sector is their engine of growth, and we will be working 
<br/>together with the private sector in the value addition area.   I always say that, first of all 
<br/>let us forget about exporting what we produce, let us value add it. Get it into the taste 
<br/>buds of our people so that they start buying local products before we can even think 
<br/>about exporting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)  Managing  the  adverse  effects  of  climate  change,  disease  control,  soil  salinity,  flood 
<br/>protection and dredging.  We are currently developing a National Waterways Strategy 
<br/>which will cover ridge to reef.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Actually, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dredging of our main rivers really is a band-aid solution.  What 
<br/>we need is a National Waterways Strategy that will outline from coastal protection works right up to 
<br/>the tributaries up in the mountains. It will be a multi-sectoral approach, we will be working together 
<br/>with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and also the Ministry of Lands and iTaukei Land Trust 
<br/>Board to fix the loss of soil from our rivers and streams. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support 
<br/>the Budget before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Looks like the honourable Maharaj is still away, probably beside the wife 
<br/>who is in labour. Honourable Maharaj is not in labour, it is the wife. We will try and accommodate 
<br/>him when he is available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, it gives me great pleasure to respond to the 2024-2025 National Budget tabled by the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. I share similar sentiments with those 
<br/>honourable Members who have earlier shared their responses in expressing my unwavering support 
<br/>for  the  recent  Budget  Announcement  for  the  new  Financial  Year.  As  the  Minister  for  Youth  and 
<br/>Sports,  I  would  like  to  commend  the  Coalition  Government’s  unwavering  dedication  to  the 
<br/>development of youth and sports in our beloved nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the 20 percent increase in the Ministry of Youth and Sports’ budget for the next 
<br/></span><span>financial year is a significant boost and underscores the Government’s unwavering commitment to 
<br/>the development  of our youth  and the advancement of sports in  our  nation. The increased budget 
<br/>allocation is  a  clear testament to  the Government’s recognition  of the pivotal role that youth  and 
<br/>sports  play  in  our  society.  It  demonstrates  a  commitment  to  fostering  an  environment  where  our 
<br/>young people can thrive, develop their skills and contribute positively to our nation's progress. This 
<br/>financial support will enable us to implement a range of initiatives designed to empower the youth,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enhance their capacities and promote sports development at all levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, youth development is a cornerstone of our national progress. The future of our 
<br/>nations hinges on the capabilities, skills and empowerment of our young  people.  Our Ministry is 
<br/>dedicated  to  ensuring  that  every  young  person  has  the  opportunity  to  realise  their  potential  and 
<br/>contribute  meaningfully  to  society.  This  involves  multifaceted  approach,  encompassing  capacity 
<br/>building  programmes,  skills  training,  youth  empowerment  and  targeted  initiatives  at  our  Youth 
<br/>Training Centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have approximately 925,000 people residing in our beautiful country, and a 
<br/>significant one-third of this population consists of youth aged between 15 years to 35 years old.  It is 
<br/>evident that investing in their future is paramount to overall growth and development of our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that regard, this budget provides the Ministry with $650,000 to support our youth capacity 
<br/>building programmes, noting its importance for preparing our youth to meet the challenges of the 
<br/>future. Through various programmes, we aim to equip young people with the knowledge, skills and 
<br/>competencies  necessary  for  personal  and  professional  success.    These  programmes  focus  on 
<br/>leadership  development,  empowerment,  entrepreneurship  and  community  engagement,  providing 
<br/>youth with the tools they need to become proactive and responsible citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  skills  training  is  a  critical  component  of  our  youth  capacity  building 
<br/>development strategy.  In a rapidly changing global economy, it is imperative that our youth possess 
<br/>the skills required to compete and succeed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have established training centres across the country that offer a wide range of vocational 
<br/>and technical training programmes. These centres serve as hubs for our youth development, offering 
<br/>tailored  programmes  that  cater  for  the  unique  challenges  and  opportunities  in  each  region.    By 
<br/>providing  access  to  education,  training  and  resources,  our  centres  are  helping  through  a  second 
<br/>chance to education, ensuring that all young people have the opportunity to be successful.  A further 
<br/>$687,600 has been allocated to ensure the proper maintenance of our Youth Training Centres and 
<br/>strengthen the delivery of its programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we look to the future and also consider the current issues facing our young 
<br/>people today, we recognise the importance of instilling positive values and life skills in our young 
<br/>people from an early age.  To this end, we are committed to strengthening the Scouts and Girl Guides 
<br/>Programmes in our primary schools.  These programmes provide young children with the opportunity 
<br/></span><span>to  develop  essential  life  skills,  such  as  teamwork,  leadership  and  problem-solving,  in  a  fun  and 
<br/></span><span>supportive  environment.  The  budget  support  we  have  received  will  enable  us  to  expand  these 
<br/>programmes, reaching out to more young people and laying the foundation for their future success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with these students transitioning to secondary school level, the Ministry is proud 
<br/>to deliver the Duke of Edinburg Awards Programme and a budget of $32,000 has been allocated to 
<br/>support this initiative.  This internationally recognised initiative encourages young people to engage 
<br/>in a variety of challenging and rewarding activities, fostering personal development and community 
<br/>involvement.  By  participating  in  the  Duke  of  Edinburgh  Awards,  our  youth  are  able  to  develop 
<br/></span><span>valuable skills, build resilience and gain a sense of achievement.  The increased budget allocation 
<br/></span><span>will allow us to enhance and expand this Programme, ensuring that more young people can benefit 
<br/>from its positive impact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  sports  development  is  a  key  priority  for  our  Ministry  and  it 
<br/>accounts for 72 percent of our budget.  This significant investment reflects the importance of sports 
<br/>in promoting physical health, social cohesion, and serves as a platform for our youth to showcase 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their talents, build teamwork and develop a strong sense of discipline and dedication.  It is also a 
<br/>major contributor to Fiji’s economy through sports tourism, generating remittances from overseas 
<br/>athletes, creating jobs and fostering national pride through international competitions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  our  efforts  to  strengthen  sports  development,  we  have  proposed  a 
<br/>comprehensive review of the Fiji National Sports Commission.  This review is aimed at ensuring that 
<br/>the Commission is effectively fulfilling its mandate and is well-positioned to support the growth and 
<br/>development of sports in our nation. A budget of $50,000 has been provided to support this review, 
<br/>enabling us to access the Commission’s performance, identify areas for improvement and implement 
<br/>necessary changes to enhance its effectiveness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  focus  on  sports  development  begins  at  the  grassroots  level.  We  are 
<br/>committed  to  providing  young  people  with  access  to  sports  programmes  and  facilities  in  their 
<br/>communities. Through partnerships with schools, local clubs and community organisations, we are 
<br/>working to ensure that all young people have the opportunity to participate in sports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to grassroots programmes, we are also dedicated to supporting 
<br/>our elite athletes. The increased budget will allow us to enhance our support for high-performance 
<br/>sports, providing our athletes with the resources, training and support they need to compete at the 
<br/>highest  levels.  This  includes  funding  for  training  camps,  coaches,  international  competitions  and 
<br/>sports science programmes, ensuring that our athletes are well-prepared to represent our nation on 
<br/>the global stage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, infrastructure development is another critical aspect of our sports strategy. 
<br/>We are investing in the construction and upgrade of sports facilities across the country, ensuring that 
<br/>our sports loving people and athletes have access to training and competition venues. This includes 
<br/>the development of multi-purpose hardcourts, upgrading existing facilities, including sports grounds 
<br/>in underserved areas. A budget of $995,581 has been allocated to cater for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir, promoting community engagement and participation in sports is essential 
<br/>for building  a healthy and active society.  We are implementing a range of initiatives designed to 
<br/>encourage  people  of  all  ages  to  get  involved  in  sports  and  physical  activities.  This  includes 
<br/>community sports festivals, fitness programmes and awareness campaigns aimed at promoting the 
<br/>benefits of an active lifestyle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Youth 
<br/></span><span>and Sports represents a significant investment in the future of our nation. It is a clear demonstration 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Government's  commitment  to  youth  development  and  sports,  and  it  provides  us  with  the 
<br/>resources needed to implement a wide range of initiatives that will have a lasting impact on our young 
<br/>people and our society as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to,  once  again,  thank  the  Government  for  their  unwavering  support  and  for 
<br/>recognising the importance of investing in our youth and sports. Together, we can build a brighter 
<br/>future for our nation, one that is driven by energy, talent and potential of our young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and  fellow  Fijian  who  are  listening  and  watching;  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to 
<br/>respond to the proposed 2024-2025 Budget delivered by the  honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics  on Friday, 28th 
<br/>June, 2024. The theme of the Budget is “</span><span>Economically Stable, Secure and Sustainable Fiji</span><span>”..

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to congratulate and welcome honourable Graham Leung 
<br/>and wish him well in his tenure as the Attorney-General.  I look forward to the contributions and 
<br/>balance  he  will  bring  to  this  august  Parliament.    I  support  the  honourable  Attorney-General’s 
<br/>proposed initiatives on the Information Act and the Code of Conduct Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also congratulate and welcome honourable Alitia Bainivalu’s appointment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. I look forward to her leadership and contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the social and economic realities in which this Budget has been delivered 
<br/>are of serious concerns to all Fijians. This Budget has been described as a work in progress and holds 
<br/>the aspirations of many.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  has  the  task  of  creating  and  supporting  the 
<br/>initiatives that align with His Excellency the President’s intentions, identified in his Opening Address 
<br/>on 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 to this Parliament where His Excellency stated, and I quote, “to provide inclusive 
<br/>development that enhances the wellbeing of all our people”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an independent Member of this august Parliament and privileged to sit 
<br/>on the cross benches, I acknowledge the central place the Budget takes in delivering the Coalition 
<br/>Government’s agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the resolution of the outstanding issues regarding the Vatukoula 
<br/>Mine  workers.    I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Justice  for  completing  the  Fiji  Corrections’ 
<br/>overdue  Job  Evaluation  Exercise  (JEE),  which  allows  for  the  correct  alignment  of  salary  and  an 
<br/>increase in the number of positions within the Fiji Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I value the pay increases for our hardworking civil servants, the adjustments 
<br/>to FNPF pensions, ongoing support for welfare recipients, the new funding to establish the Narcotics 
<br/>Bureau  and  the  efforts  towards  a  National  Housing  Plan.    These  initiatives  indicate  that  in  some 
<br/>portfolios, the Coalition has a heart that is listening and moving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish this list of likes would be longer.  However, I must turn and address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the concerns that have emerged from scrutinising the Budget.  I wish to cover four areas only, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Police Force; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Corrections Service; 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Youth and Sports; and 
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>25 percent tax on NGOs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, hidden in the details is a decision to tax the property income of non-profit 
<br/>organisations.  There appears to be a need for more consultations with the stakeholders, as they are 
<br/>left wondering about the impact on the delivery of critical services and essential support. Our non-
<br/>profit sector contributes significantly to our society, meeting a wide range of social, disaster relief, 
<br/>livelihood and empowerment needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me illustrate the impact of this tax on one of our most respected charities 
<br/></span><span>that support the poor across our nation.  The Housing Assistance Relief Trust (HART) has faithfully 
<br/>served Fjii since 1970 and operates in 19 communities, one nursing home, four kindergartens and 
<br/>one primary school.  The HART tenants are provided accommodation at a very low rent to help them 
<br/>get back on their feet.  This rental income supports the daily operational expenses of HART, but it 
<br/>appears from this Budget that this income will now be taxed at 25 percent. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1099 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an injustice as it applies to HART and other organisations, whose 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mandate is to support our needy children, families, and the vulnerable in our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I NAIVALURUA.- To further the pressure, HART, in consultation with the Ministry 
<br/>of Housing, requested $1 million to undertake necessary upgrades to their housing stock in Suva.  
<br/>This request has been reduced to $400,000 only, and they now find themselves short in this budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics,  in  his  Budget  Address  to  this  august 
<br/>Parliament,  stated,  “We  need  to  get  the  basics  right”,  and  then  said,  “we  need  to  protect  our 
<br/>vulnerable, the elderly and people with disabilities”.  If this was his and this Coalition Government’s 
<br/>intention, how does he explain the imposition of a new tax on the groups who consistently support 
<br/>much of the good and charitable work the Government cannot fund or undertake?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I request the honourable Deputy Prime Minister to reconsider his budget decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Fiji  Police  Force,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  applaud  the  Government  for  recognising  the 
<br/>importance of the Fiji Police Force as the custodians of law and order and their role in combating the 
<br/>challenges of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century.  The budget has a significant increase of over $41 million which is 
<br/>commendable, however, the Police reset should not be dependent on external leadership as we have 
<br/>capable and competent leaders within the Fiji Police Force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  we  value  close  and  keen  cooperation  with  our  Australian  partners,  the  days  of 
<br/>dependency  are  long  gone,  and  we  must  learn  to  build  our  own  capability  and  integrity  with 
<br/>confidence. Fiji can achieve sustainable and impactful policing reforms that resonate with its people 
<br/>and values. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  refer  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration’s 
<br/>statement on 7</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024, in which he revealed that the Fiji Police Force requires a generational 
<br/>change, which will be achieved by resetting the core values.  The honourable Minister seems to have 
<br/>misunderstood that the current core values are valid, and officers are strongly determined to serve 
<br/>the  nation  diligently.    Outsourcing  mentoring  for  the  Commissioner  of  Police  undermines  the 
<br/>potential for local leadership to set and uphold ethical standards rooted in Fiji’s own cultural and 
<br/>societal context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force has come a long way.  What is needed within the Force 
<br/></span><span>is  good  leadership  developed  through  a  good  succession  plan.    I  beg  to  differ  with  a  widespread 
<br/>notion that the Fiji Police Force is in disarray.  What is always needed at the head of the Fiji Police 
<br/>is a leader who is trustworthy, fears God, has a solid ethic and hates dishonest gains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current bilateral and regional arrangements are functional and sufficient for partnership 
<br/>and development needs.  The Fiji Police Force should not sell the heart and soul of what it is today, 
<br/>nor sell out its future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a frontline agency in the fight against crime 
<br/></span><span>through  its  rehabilitation  focus  and  approach.    Fiji  Corrections  Service  operates  several  business 
<br/>enterprises that are a core function of the rehabilitation process for inmates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The suspension of the Trade and Manufacturing Accounts (TMAs) has seriously affected Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service.   I urge the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and  Minister for Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to work with the honourable Minister for

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice and consider reactivating the TMA accounts.  This is an essential part of revenue generation 
<br/>for the organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  commend  the  Coalition  Government  for  resolving  the  long 
<br/>outstanding Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) and the additional 81 posts, as a frontline agency in the 
<br/>fight against crime, the reduction in capital allocation for Fiji Corrections Service is disappointing.  
<br/>We know that the remand facilities are always overcrowded, as this is where much of the underlying 
<br/>drug and crime crisis in our nation ends up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Drugs and Counter Narcotics Strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continuing with the drugs issues 
<br/>facing our communities, the honourable Prime Minister has identified this as a national crisis, with 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Justice Minister declaring that the fate of Fiji is at a crossroad in </span><span>The Fiji 
<br/>Times </span><span>of 26</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I applaud the efforts of the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and 
<br/>Immigration in establishing a Narcotics Bureau, from what I hear on the ground, the situation has 
<br/>overtaken us.  Drugs are easily and readily available on our streets.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  ask  the  Coalition  Government,  does  our  effort  match  the  crisis?    In 
<br/>scrutinizing this Budget, our words appear empty as much of the Counter Narcotics Strategy 2023 
<br/>still needs to be funded in the various ministries identified as stakeholders.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>launch of the Counter Narcotics Strategy is  a positive step forward, however, I ask the following 
<br/>questions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Will the strategies in this document effectively disrupt the flow and use of drugs? 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Does this send a clear signal to the syndicates seeking to exploit our borders and our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Does this create a national conscience that everyone must stand and fight this together? 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Does this return Fiji to a safe and stable nation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the battle against drugs requires a vigorous and immediate response, not a 
<br/>bureaucratic one.  The actions taken must be proactive and precise.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I further suggest 
<br/>the establishment of a Joint Select Committee for Parliamentary Oversight to review and assess the 
<br/>strategy’s implementation and progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Youth and Sports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Ministry of Youth and Sports’ budget 
<br/></span><span>allocation.  On a previous occasion, I suggested to Parliament that youth and sports could be separated 
<br/></span><span>to improve the youth focused outcomes.  I state this again to my esteemed colleagues this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, separating the Ministry of Youth and Sports is important for Fiji because 
<br/>Youth and Sports have distinct needs and priorities.  By having separate ministries, youth and sports 
<br/>can  receive  focused  attention  and  resources,  leading  to  more  effective  policies  and  programmes 
<br/>tailored to their specific requirements.  This separation ensures that each sector’s unique challenges 
<br/>and opportunities are adequately addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports has the potential as both an industry and a foreign relations asset.  Youth are our future 
<br/></span><span>and deserve our focused attention and investment.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our effort to improve the 
<br/>efficiency of the Government structure and organisation, I strongly recommend to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister that the Coalition Government seriously consider the separation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this point, I also express my best wishes to our Fijian athletes preparing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the Olympics in Paris.  I extend a special cheer to our Fiji Sevens Team (men and women) – 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> “Gold Fiji Gold” not “Go Fiji Go” and look forward to our national celebrations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, I offer my support because I believe the Budget aims to create 
<br/>the right  environment  and establish a firm base to achieve its intended theme. However, the best 
<br/>litmus test to prove this would be a mid-term review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the past few weeks had been a very turbulent and uncertain time 
<br/>for some of us in this Parliament. I want to acknowledge your experience, wisdom and guidance in 
<br/>having the foresight to retain the services of the 16 Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, viewers and listeners, </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and good morning.  I rise in 
<br/>support of the 2024-2025 National Budget delivered by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister 
<br/>for Finance. on 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  acknowledge  the  honourable  Minister  and  his  hardworking  team  for 
<br/>presenting a well- structured and balanced Budget that aligns with the Government’s goals.  Realising 
<br/>the theme of the Budget, an economically</span><span> </span><span>stable, secure and sustainable</span><span> </span><span>Fiji.  It defines what is needed 
<br/>right  now  to  improve  the  fundamentals  of  our  economy.    It  is  a  priority-based  Budget  aimed  at 
<br/>meeting  challenges,  reducing  huge  Government  debt,  sustaining  growth  and  enhancing  resilience 
<br/>against future economic shocks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budget  aligns  with  our  national  commitment  to  the  UN  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals  and  the  Budget  narrative  also  supports  my  Ministry’s  strategic  priorities  on 
<br/>meeting national and international obligations through SDG 8, which is, to foster, sustain, inclusive, 
<br/>sustainable  economic  growth,  full  and  productive  employment  and  decent  work  for  all.    My 
<br/>Ministry’s vision of decent work and sustainable employment for all derives from SDG8 is closely 
<br/>aligned with the Budget.  The theme to promote decent work opportunities ensure safe and healthy 
<br/>workplaces,  ensure  productivity  and  continue  to  encourage  good  faith  employment  relations  and 
<br/>enhance social justice in Fiji for economic stability and sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, decent work provides citizens with stable well-paid jobs improving living 
<br/>standards and economic security, fostering stability in society.  This will help build a truly inclusive 
<br/>and sustainable Fiji where economic prosperity is shared equitably.  The Ministry has been allocated 
<br/>a total of $21.3 million for the next financial year, more than double the current budget.  We are 
<br/></span><span>thankful to the Government for this increase.  Let me outline some key initiatives supported by the 
<br/></span><span>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the National Employment Centre, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we thank and acknowledge Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand’s support through the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> and </span><span>Duavata</span><span> initiatives.  Selected low skilled and 
<br/>unemployed Fijian workers under the PALM Scheme now can take their families to Australia through 
<br/>the Family Accompaniment Pilot Programme from August 2024, fostering stronger connections and 
<br/>addressing social impact of long family separations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s employment 
<br/>reform  will  continue  to  significantly  contribute  to  increasing  in  remittance  and  improve  living 
<br/></span><span>standards of Fijians under the scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Workmen’s Compensation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been allocated $6 million 
<br/>for No Fault Compensation Scheme to facilitate employment and school accidents.  The Ministry has 
<br/>taken over the processing of cases from Veritas Pte Limited starting from 1</span><span>st</span><span> June, 2024, following a 
<br/>decision  by  the  Interim  ACCF  Board.    Veritas  Pte  Limited  managed  ACCF  from  2019  to  2023, 
<br/>charging  $75,000  monthly  and  $900,000  annually.    The  Government  will  be  able  to  save

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approximately $1.8 million annually with the transfer of the Workmen’s Compensation’s functions 
<br/>back to the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in alignment with the Government’s review on the Ease of Doing Business, 
<br/>led by the Ministry of Trade, my Ministry has reviewed the effectiveness of the general workplace 
<br/>inspections  and  audits  as  per  the  World  Bank  Report  of  August  2023  to  strengthen  risk-based 
<br/>inspections and audit provisions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 24 OHS technical staff have been assigned to 
<br/>implement  the  amended  regulations  focusing  on  high-risk  workplaces  and  promoting  pro-active 
<br/>safety measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has raised the minimum wage rate from $4 to 
<br/>$4.50 per hour from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024 and $5 from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2025.  It took the previous government 
<br/>five years to increase the minimum wage rate from $2.68 to $4. Our Government has taken two years 
<br/>to increase it by 25 percent. I know the facts hurts you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 10  sectoral wages will also be increased by the 
<br/>same amount. So, all workers will have their increases in due course. Mr. Speaker, Sir, increasing 
<br/>minimum wage, improve living standards and productivity contributes to a better nation for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Shame on you for doing what you did for the last 17 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, additional allocation has been made to ensure compliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The civil servants had been given a 7 percent to 20 percent increase which is unprecedented 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without any Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE), Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past, Sir, 2 percent to 3 percent will be given without a JEE, and let me clarify that. 
<br/>Whenever  there  was  a  JEE  there  would  be  a  higher  increase.  Now,  alluding  to  honourable  Hem 
<br/>Chand’s statement on the civil servants’ salary, Sir, the 2017 JEE which boast of a 14 percent average 
<br/>actually raised from 3 percent to 14 percent. The lowest was around 3 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 80 
<br/></span><span>percent of the teachers received below 15 percent and the 20 percent who received above 15 percent 
<br/></span><span>lost their positions because they were re-advertised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to reiterate that this Government is truly a government for the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Vatukoula strike settlement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is one of the key highlights of the new 
<br/>Budget.  I  wish  to  laud  the  commitment  of  the  Coalition  Government  which  accomplished  this 
<br/>through the efforts of my Ministry.  Today we have meaningfully touched the lives of 368 families

<div><span>in Vatukoula who were affected by the 1991 strike.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the National Secretary of FTUC, Mr. Felix Anthony for 
<br/>assisting with the negotiations. We all are aware that they will be paid $10,000 in the coming Budget 
<br/>and then $10,000 the following year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also activated the outstanding case of Master Tevita Koroi, the 
<br/>former President of FTA who was terminated without course by the previous government.  This is 
<br/>littered with the history of the previous government. Many people lost their jobs because they were 
<br/>terminated for speaking up like, Mr. Tevita Koroi for his members. This was reported to ILO and 
<br/>now we are settling the matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tripartism has been restored and ERAB is now reviewing the labour laws. 
<br/>The direct contact mission from ILO was overdue since 2019 has visited us in April and has given 
<br/>us a sound report. They were very happy with the progress we made in the last 18 months, and I am 
<br/>also happy to report, Sir, that we are now off the blacklist of ILO that was there over a decade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  mediation  team  has  been  able  to  sort  out  80 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent of the mediated cases that were referred to them with good-faith negotiations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Permanent  Secretary  has  now  taken  over  the  Chair  of  the  Asian 
<br/>Productivity Organization (APO) and we are going to host the APO meeting in October 2024. This 
<br/>is going to help us with education and training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate and thank my Permanent Secretary and the 
<br/>entire team for winning the four awards at the Civil Service Week, as well as the overall award for 
<br/>best delivery during the Civil Service Week.  I thank you for the opportunity, Sir and I fully support 
<br/>the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, viewers and 
<br/>listeners, I rise to provide my response on the 2024-2025 Fiji National Budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>wish to first focus on certain key aspects of the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic  diversification,  recognising  the  vulnerabilities  associated  with  dependence  on 
<br/></span><span>tourism and agriculture, the budget tries to navigate its efforts to diversify the economy.  However, 
<br/>it  falls  short  of  providing  incentives  for  expanding  industries  like  manufacturing,  information 
<br/>technology, renewable energy and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social welfare enhancements, the budget must have more than enough potential to prioritise 
<br/>social welfare programmes aimed  at  improving the wellbeing  of the vulnerable population.   This 
<br/>includes increased funding for social security, healthcare services and assistance programme for low 
<br/>income households. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, social safety nets should be strengthened to reduce poverty, improve health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outcomes and promote social cohesion contributing to overall societal stability and resilience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transparency accountability, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2024-2025 National Budget process must 
<br/>emphasise  transparency  and  accountability  in  financial  management.  Measures  such  as  public 
<br/>reporting of budget allocation, fiscal audits and oversight mechanisms contribute to ensuring that  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>funds are used efficiently and effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  hope  FijiFirst  legacy  of  transparent  governance  practices  will  be 
<br/>maintained  to  build  trust  amongst  citizens,  investors  and  international  stakeholders  fostering  a 
<br/>conducive environment for economic growth and development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell, the 2024-2025 Fiji National Budget demonstrates the lack of depth and strength 
<br/>in  strategic  infrastructure  investment,  economic  diversification,  education  and  human  capital 
<br/>development, social welfare enhancements, environmental sustainability initiatives and transparent 
<br/>financial  management.    In  order  to  promote  inclusive  growth,  improving  quality  of  life  and 
<br/>positioning Fiji for sustainable development in the coming fiscal year, the government must ensure 
<br/>that a wider participation is needed from all sectors, something which is lacking at the moment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  has  many  loopholes  and  I  hope  it  is  taken  on  board  very 
<br/>positively  so  that the Government  is  held  accountable,  and shortfalls are  adequately  addressed in 
<br/>future budgets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limited revenue diversification, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the primary weaknesses of the 2024-
<br/>2025 Fiji National Budget is it reliance on limited sources of revenue. Fiji heavily depends on tourism 
<br/>and agriculture, which are vulnerable to external shocks such as natural disasters, global economic 
<br/>downturns or pandemics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  a  lack  of  diversification  in  revenue  streams  will  certainly  hinder  the 
<br/>Government's ability to adequately fund its budgetary priorities during times of economic instability 
<br/>or sector-specific crises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiscal  Deficit  and  Debt  Sustainability  is  another  concern.    The  budget  includes  ambitious 
<br/>spending  plans without corresponding revenue increases or efficient expenditure management.   It 
<br/>will certainly lead to widening fiscal deficits and increased public  debt. The high levels of public 
<br/>debt will no doubt constrain future budgetary flexibility, limit the government's ability to invest in 
<br/>critical infrastructure and social programmes and potentially lead to economic instability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inadequate  Social  Welfare  Spending,  despite  likely  allocations  for  social  welfare 
<br/>programmes,  there  are  weaknesses  in  the  adequacy  and  distribution  of  funds.  Challenges  such  as 
<br/>bureaucratic inefficiencies, inadequate targeting mechanisms will result in funds not  reaching  the 
<br/>intended beneficiaries effectively.  This will give rise to socio-economic inequalities and undermine 
<br/></span><span>the  government's  effort  to  alleviate  poverty  and  improve  living  standards  for  the  vulnerable 
<br/></span><span>population, and in the last two years, we have seen some aspects of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure  and  Project  Implementation  Delays:  While  investments  in  infrastructure  are 
<br/>crucial  for  economic development,  weaknesses in project  implementation and management  could 
<br/>hinder the budget’s effectiveness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Issues such as delays in project execution, cost overruns and poor quality of infrastructure 
<br/>could  result  from  inadequate  planning,  capacity  constraints,  or  governance  challenges.    Such 
<br/></span><span>inefficiencies can diminish the expected benefits of infrastructure investments and delay economic 
<br/></span><span>growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  not  been  a  major  announcement  of  new  major  projects.    I  am 
<br/>inclined to say that under this Government, there will be no infrastructure revolution as anticipated 
<br/>by the people.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1105 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very sad to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that very soon, the infrastructure pipeline left by the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government will dry up and, without doubt, infrastructure investment will fall off a cliff and 
<br/>take a tumble.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment  Sustainability  Concerns: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  its  urgency  for 
<br/>environmental conservation and climate change adaptation, weaknesses in enforcement, regulation 
<br/>and  policy  implementation  could  undermine  sustainability  efforts.    Fiji  faces  significant 
<br/>environmental  challenges,  including  biodiversity  loss,  deforestation  and  vulnerability  to  climate 
<br/>change  impacts,  like  rising  sea  levels  and  extreme  weather  events.    Inadequate  funding,  weak 
<br/>governance frameworks and lack of coordination among stakeholders is limiting the effectiveness of 
<br/>environmental initiatives as outlined in the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the 2024-2025 Fiji National Budget may prioritise key sectors such 
<br/>as infrastructure, social welfare, education, and environmental sustainability.  It will face significant 
<br/>weaknesses  in  revenue  diversification,  fiscal  management,  social  welfare  spending  adequacy, 
<br/>infrastructure project implementation, et cetera.  I urge and plead with the Government to be more 
<br/>vigilant in the way the funds are disbursed and how the monitoring is done so that intended outcome 
<br/>is achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note and welcome the increase in the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget by 
<br/>$6 million to a total of $102.2 million.  This will hugely benefit our farmers as they will get more 
<br/>initiatives and funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly wish to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways and the Assistant Minister for Agriculture in addressing my concern for 
<br/>stray cattles in the Sigatoka area that was an eyesore, causing huge damages to crops and also being 
<br/>one of the contributing factors for road accidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, both the Ministers, with the able support from the Sigatoka Police and staff 
<br/>of the Ministry of Agriculture in Sigatoka and the Western Division, spearheaded a very effective 
<br/>campaign to impound stray animals and cattle.  We now feel safe while driving around Sigatoka and 
<br/>the Queens Highway, and farmers are able to maintain and attend to their subsistence vegetable and 
<br/>crop farming that were previously ransacked by stray cattles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the other hand, it is an eyesore to see land whose leases had expired and 
<br/>which  landowners  acquired  still  not  being  utilised  to  their  full  potential.    More  funds  must  be 
<br/></span><span>allocated for land utilisation and Government to open up those land so that local investors can access 
<br/></span><span>them and move towards commercial agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  those  land  are  opened  up  for  local  investors,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pretty  sure  more 
<br/>potential farmers can engage which will help boost our food security.  All we need is more funding 
<br/>and  developing  a  model  of  Agricultural  Development  for  our  nation.    I  urge  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture to work on this, and I am sure that one day this will come into fruition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget clearly confirms that the Coalition Government has no ridged 
<br/></span><span>plans to address the cost of living that is skyrocketing day by day.  Despite great anticipation, this is 
<br/></span><span>yet another budget that does not offer much to mitigate the increasing and new cost of living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems that the Government has lost a sense of control of its finances.  On 
<br/>a  more  worrying  note,  this  Budget  threatens  our  economic  security,  and  one  may  say  that  it  is 
<br/>delivering  more  deficit  and  so  more  debt.    The  cost  of  groceries  has  gone  up.    Rent  and  interest 
<br/>repayments are up too.  Unable to maintain its financial competence, this Government is borrowing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more and generating less. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a different note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what boggles my mind is that despite free education, 
<br/>free medical, subsidies on water and electricity, assistance for first home buyers, et cetera, why do 
<br/>our citizens still leave our shores and end up paying handsomely for education, water, electricity, 
<br/>health schemes, et cetera, elsewhere? I urge the Government to find the reasons and in the interest of 
<br/>our nation, try fixing this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget lets the majority of the people down.  It is not so good Budget, 
<br/>and the Government is to be blamed.  A Budget with a lot of ideas but no vision, it has targets but no 
<br/>plans.  It plans to generate revenue but less is allocated to the new cost of living support.  None of its 
<br/>ribbon cutting on Coalition projects, formerly FijiFirst, can disguise the Government’s inability to 
<br/>mitigate the high cost of living.  The people of Fiji deserve much better.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank 
<br/>you for giving me this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Joseph Nand for your response.  You attracted a lot 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of flak as well.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers 
<br/>and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; a very good morning to you all,  </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>, </span><span>sat sri akaal</span><span> and 
<br/></span><span>namaste</span><span> to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the 204-2025 National Budget.  I would like 
<br/>to begin by expressing my heartfelt commendation to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance and Strategic Planning,  National  Development  and Statistics for his  exemplary efforts  in 
<br/>preparing  a  Budget  that  promises  an  immediate  and  much-needed  increase  in  income,  thereby, 
<br/>enhancing the quality of life for our beloved citizens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As  articulated  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  this  Budget  represents  the 
<br/>beginning of our journey to rectify the missteps of the past.  Rest assured; we are resolute in our 
<br/>commitment to steering the course towards correcting the historical wrongs and its legacies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our goal  is  to  elevate income levels  and ensure  that essential services such as healthcare, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>education and infrastructure meet and exceed acceptable standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The wheels of change have been set in motion with remarkable speed over the last 18 months, 
<br/>and we are determined to maintain this momentum and driving forward with unwavering dedication 
<br/>and purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I speak on my Ministry’s budget, I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and all my colleagues - Cabinet Ministers and honourable Opposition Members who, 
<br/>whenever I approach them for their assistance in the Sugar Industry, they have come up and assisted 
<br/>me  with  my  request.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  his 
<br/>support towards the sugar industry, as mentioned in his deliberation yesterday. Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now speak on the budget provided to the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs and Sugar Industry.  The Sugar Industry will benefit significantly from this budget with an 
<br/>allocation of $70.1 million.  We had requested this fund to continue with our 13 initiatives introduced 
<br/>in 2023-2024 Budget, and we are pleased to have secured funding for all the essential projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The primary concern for any cane farmer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has always been the amount they 
<br/></span><span>receive  for  their  cane  payment.    As  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech, we made a historic $91.38 per tonne last year and we 
<br/>have paid $101.08 per tonne for this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the ongoing favourable cane prices, I am grateful that the Government has allocated 
<br/>$4  million  for  the  sugar  price  stabilization  budget.  This  decision  underscores  our  unwavering 
<br/>commitment to ensuring our farmers receive their due and are not short-changed, as they were done 
<br/>by the previous regime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address farm productivity and increase overall sugar production, we are providing budget 
<br/></span><span>support under the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance Programme of $4 million, which 
<br/>funds sugarcane planting and replanting will continue. Additionally, the Farm Incentive Programme 
<br/>of $1 million will provide $5 for every tonne of cane increased from the 2023 season in comparison 
<br/>to the 2024 season. The farmers will be paid extra $5 per tonne. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To tackle transportation issues, the Ministry will provide services to the farmers through the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cane Access Roads Programme of $4 million, ensuring the temporary repair of over 3,000 roads, 
<br/>culverts and crossings, as needed to facilitate cane transportation to the mills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has,  once  again,  allocated  $1  million  for  the 
<br/>provision  of  cane  cage-bins.  We  expect  to  fabricate  over  40  cage-bins,  enabling  the  transfer  of 
<br/>mechanically harvested cane via the rail network, which is the cheapest  mode of transportation of 
<br/>cane.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing labour shortages which have affected many of our sectors, we aim to mechanise 
<br/>the  industry  through  the  Sugarcane  Farm  Mechanization  Programme  with  a  $500,000  budgetary 
<br/>allocation. Furthermore, we will increase support to our farmers who harvest their cane using manual 
<br/>labour by providing a subsidy of $3 per tonne which was previously $1 per tonne. Meanwhile, we 
<br/>have continuously engaged the Fiji Corrections Service and their inmates for manual cane harvesting, 
<br/>with an allocation of $320,000 set aside for this project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  ensure  the  cost  of  inputs  is  manageable,  the  Ministry  will  continue  with  the  Fertilizer 
<br/>Subsidy Programme of $20 million, where farmers will pay only $20 per bag of fertilizer. We will 
<br/>also subsidize weedicide costs of $1 million and subsidize cartage costs of $4.9 million for the Penang 
<br/>farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address land lease issues, the Government has set aside $1 million to assist growers, whose 
<br/>leases  are  expiring  or  who  wish  to  purchase  land  for  cane  farming  by  providing  a  subsidy  of  30 
<br/>percent or $7,500, whichever is lower.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To mitigate the impacts of climate change, the Ministry will continue with the Drainage for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sugarcane farms of $5.5 million, aiming to reduce the effects of flooding during the offseason.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  continuing  these  vital  programmes,  the  Government  has 
<br/>allocated $15 million as working capital support for the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) in this budget. 
<br/>This allocation ensures that FSC can meet its payment obligations for the EXIM Bank loan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that the project undertaken with this loan was one of the 
<br/>many  failures  under  the  previous  regimes.  We  are  now  compelled  to  bail  FSC  out  through  this 
<br/>provision, a necessary measure to rectify the past missteps and stabilize the sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  is  allocated  $6  million.  This  was 
<br/></span><span>disbanded by the previous government. There is a lot of work that needs to be done and there is a 
<br/></span><span>report that has been made by Dr. Rajen Prasad and Mr. Radhe Nand, which will be tabled in Cabinet 
<br/>for the adoption of the report and implementation after. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  re-establishment  marks  a  significant  milestone  in  Fiji’s 
<br/>history  as  it  offers  a  fresh  approach  to  enhancing  relationships  amongst  our  diverse  ethnic 
<br/>communities in Fiji. This initiative presents an opportunity to promote the development of a dynamic, 
<br/>prosperous and a socially cohesive Fiji society, a society where all Fijians are proud of their identity 
<br/>and heritage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are other projects that we have in hand.  However, just a quick one, in 
<br/>addition, the Ministry has undertaken most of the preliminary work in relation to the development of 
<br/>a gas crematorium at Tuatua, Labasa, while work on other gas crematoriums are in progress, notably 
<br/>at Varoko Cemetery in Ba, Lovu Cemetery in Lautoka and Raiwaqa Cemetery in Navua.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will reinvigorate its efforts in reaching out to the communities 
<br/>through  active  engagements,  advocacy,  participation  in  cultural  events  and  collaborating  with 
<br/>community-based organisations by supporting community-based programmes, such as renovation of 
<br/>religious  places,  extension  and  upgrade  of  existing  multi-ethnic  infrastructure  and  support  to 
<br/>language, culture and arts programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I would like to say that I fully support the Budget before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We hope other ethnic groups will also be able to access that crematorium.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament; I rise to respond to the 2024-2025 National Budget that was delivered by the Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and 
<br/>Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  I  acknowledge  the  sentiments  raised  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and I fully agree with it.  The people of Fiji have mixed feelings about the 2024-2025 
<br/>Budget and that is the bitter truth about this Budget.  I praise some of the initiatives taken by the 
<br/>Government, and that too, with a pinch of salt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase in civil servants’ pay is welcome.   However, why is the disparity between grades 
<br/>and bands?  All civil servants are an integral part of the Civil Service, and these are the people who 
<br/>keep the Civil Service running. The increment should have been uniform as all work equally hard, 
<br/>or is the honourable Minister for Finance of the view that some are more important than the others? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is finally coming partially true to their words of increasing 
<br/>the minimum wage.   However, my question is, why $4.50 from 1st August and $5 from April 2025?  
<br/>On what basis have they come to this rate?   Is it based on a minimum wage review?  If it is true, 
<br/>where is the report?  Why has the report not been made public?  The staggered increase has not gone 
<br/>down well with the wage earners. They were expecting better from this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  sure  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics understands the concept of time value of money.   It states that 
<br/>the  value  of  a  dollar  today  is  more  than  the  value  of  a  dollar  tomorrow.    Therefore,  I  urge  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, if you really want to give a minimum 
<br/></span><span>wage of $5 to the people, then give it now rather than nine months down the line.   Do not drip feed 
<br/>them.    By  the  way,  let  me  remind  you  that  it  was  the  FijiFirst  Government  that  brought  in  the 
<br/>minimum wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the Government for the reinstatement of the FNPF pension 
<br/>payments.  This has been requested by our people for a long time and finally, it has happened.  Thank 
<br/>you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is good to see that finally, the issue of Vatukoula mine workers strike has been settled.  I 
<br/></span><span>wish all the beneficiaries of the settlement well, and with the Government’s help, I hope they can 
<br/>move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The conversion of bus fare assistance to cash top-up in the social pension scheme cannot go 
<br/>unappreciated. I have heard a lot of appreciation from the people, and I wish to convey this to the 
<br/>Government.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  all  is  not  well  with  the  2024-2025  Budget.    The  Budget  falls  short  of 
<br/>addressing investment and growth in Fiji.  There is nothing new that encourages local investment in 
<br/>the country. Banks are complaining of high liquidity as people are not borrowing to invest.   Even 
<br/>when loans are approved, people are not drawing to invest.  Also, I fail to see anything in the Budget 
<br/>that attracts foreign investment in Fiji. This is not good as Fiji needs foreign investments to grow the 
<br/>economy. When the economy booms, people’s trust and confidence in the government increases. I 
<br/>urge the honourable Minister for Finance to work on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, until November 2022, the only thing the honourable Minister for Finance 
<br/>talked about was </span><span>dinau</span><span> or the nominal debt or debt per capita. This was very much missing from his 
<br/>speech and he took an about-turn and started talking debt-to-GDP ratio.  I am sure the people of Fiji 
<br/>would  like  to  know  the  expected  debt  level  in  the  2024-2025  Budget.    It  is  $10.9  billion,  and  it 
<br/>translates to per capita debt of $12,000 to $12,800.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What have you done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- In the honourable Minister for Finance’s language, every citizen carries a 
<br/>debt of $12,000 to $12,800 depending on the actual population. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that an 
<br/>allocation of $2 million to establish the Narcotics Bureau is far too little to fight a multibillion-dollar 
<br/>problem. I believe we are investing too little to fight a problem that is overarching on all other issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I urge the honourable Minister for Finance to increase this allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Direct Infrastructure Development is completely missing from this budget. Allocation is only 
<br/>for  continued  maintenance  of  infrastructure  already  developed  by  the  previous  government.  My 
<br/>question is, what new roads are being done? The answer is none. The Government is  relying too 
<br/>much on direct budget support from donor agencies. The Government should remember that this is 
<br/>not  a  permanent  facility  that  will  always  be  available,  this  can  be  withdrawn  if  the  economic 
<br/>conditions in these countries are not favourable. We should start focusing on having a budget without 
<br/>this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Government aware of GDP contribution for each sector? This should be 
<br/>considered when allocating resources and prioritizing engagement in these sectors. The agriculture 
<br/>and aquaculture sector will be contributing close to $946 million towards the GDP in 2024. Every 
<br/></span><span>second or third investment we hear is in the tourism sector. We fail to encourage either foreign or 
<br/></span><span>local investment in the agricultural sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just yesterday the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism stated that 
<br/>when the tourism sector does well, the other sectors do well also. Great, but you also mentioned that 
<br/>this year tourism will be contributing 40 percent to the GDP.  Who is he trying to fool? This year 
<br/>tourism’s contribution to GDP will be $2.5 billion with a total GDP of the country at $11 billion. It 
<br/>equates to only 22 percent, do not mislead the population, do not try to oversell the tourism industry.  
<br/>However, considering that, we will import $1.2 billion in food alone in 2024.  Why is there so little 
<br/></span><span>development or investment in the agriculture sector to negate these imports? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Good question, what did you do ? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- We should not lose focus that Fiji is an agricultural country, Fiji was an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agricultural country and Fiji will be an agricultural country.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do for 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Agriculture is a sector that keeps the country ticking.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let 
<br/>me give you some interesting facts about tourism. According to RBF, pre-booking for the next 90 
<br/>days has decreased by 8 percent. Our hotels are outpricing themselves out of the market. This will 
<br/>affect the returning visitors as people may opt for cheaper Asian markets where the sun, sand and 
<br/>beaches are the same. Increase in departure tax puts a further burden on the tourists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture  sector  engages  majority  of  the  citizens  of  Fiji  and  the  sector  demands  the 
<br/>Government’s  unwavering  attention.  During  the  COVID  pandemic,  the  borders  closed,  tourists 
<br/>stopped  coming  to  Fiji,  other  manufacturing  sectors  either  downsized  or  closed  but  the  farmers 
<br/>continued to farm and continued to feed the nation. Had it not been for the farmers, we would have 
<br/>had some serious problems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for an allocation of $101.2 million in the 
<br/>agriculture sector. There has been an increase in crop extension from $17.3 million to $18.5 million. 
<br/>Thank you so much for providing this increase but it is not enough.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, why are the vegetable farmers left out of the commodity focus and assistance? 
<br/>The only assistance allocated to them is the fertilizer and weedicide subsidy. Does the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance realize that this sector is vital for Fiji and needs the 
<br/>assistance  for  land  preparation,  seeds,  agronomic  practices  and  supply  chain  management?    All 
<br/>vegetable farmers work equally hard to farm and get the produce to the market. Why is a holistic 
<br/>approach not taken to provide assistance to the vegetable farmers?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see 
<br/>why a farmer in Labasa or Bua should get a lower price for a bundle of bean than a farmer in Nausori? 
<br/>The only thing that hinders them from getting the optimum price is market access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would be pleased to see a collaborated effort between the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
<br/>Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) to establish a supply chain including cold storage to enable 
<br/>farmers  to  get  better  market  access  and  ensure  quality  produce  is  available  to  the  consumers.  
<br/>Assisting our farmers in growing quality produce and assisting them with supply chain management 
<br/>can also reduce imports. These farmers can supply to the hotels and resorts which heavily rely on 
<br/>imported produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is trying to have a significant livestock sector in order to reduce the 
<br/>import bill.  However, the funds allocated to these sectors are negligible. Piggery, goat, sheep, beef, 
<br/>apiculture have all received between $175,000 to $300,000. Are we planning to have any significant 
<br/>growth with such investments in our extension programme?  These sectors require a more targeted 
<br/></span><span>approach with goals and timelines clearly identified. Performance of each sector should be measured 
<br/></span><span>against these timelines and failure to deliver should be questioned and dealt with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  does  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  have  an  Individual  Commodity 
<br/>Development Plan? Is the funding allocation as per plan? If the Ministry has such a plan and have 
<br/>allocated funding as per plan then good. If the plan or the funding does not match, then people need 
<br/>to know why.  Does the Ministry of Agriculture have a dairy sector development plan? Does the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture have a beef sector development plan? Does the Ministry of Agriculture have 
<br/>a livestock sector development plan? Does the Ministry of Agriculture have a vegetable and green 
<br/></span><span>crop sector development plan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, money should not be just allocated. It should be in sync with the relevant 
<br/>development plans and achievements should be measured against these plans and reported.  We need 
<br/>to  look  at  the  agricultural  sector  commercially  and  to  do  this,  the  Ministry  also  needs  to  operate 
<br/>commercially.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allocating funds and utilizing funds are two different things.  The Minuity 
<br/>of  Agriculture  was  allocated  $95.2  million  in  the  2023-2024  Budget.  Actual  expenditure  as  per 
<br/>Ministry of Finance statistics until 30</span><span>th</span><span> April 2024 was $48.7 million.  Only 50 percent of the funds 
<br/>or $46.5 million has not been utilized. They have only three months to utilize this unspent fund. What 
<br/>miracle will they pull to do what they have not been able to do in the last nine months? This is a 
<br/>serious  issue  and  needs  to  be  properly  looked  at  or  is  it  a  fact  that  there  is  no  money  given  the 
<br/>Ministry; </span><span>paisa nai hai</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of time I hear people saying that farmers are lazy and do not work hard. I challenge 
<br/>these critics to spend one day on the farm with the farmer. I am sure you will change your opinion 
<br/>and think twice before making such comments. Do not criticize the hands that feed you and it is our 
<br/>farmers that feed you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  has  an  import-based  economy.  This  shows  that  we  have  a  robust 
<br/>domestic demand. Fiji is regarded as the hub of the South Pacific. We trade with our Pacific Island 
<br/>neighbours, some of our Pacific Island neighbours have much stronger currency than Fiji.  Over the 
<br/>last two decades, the Fijian dollar has been devalued by around 60 percent. This has significantly 
<br/>increased the cost of imports and have further burdened our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is time this Government revalues the Fijian dollar by a nominal 
<br/>rate of 20 percentage. Revaluation will increase our purchasing power. The imports will be cheaper. 
<br/>When the imports become cheaper, it will reduce inflationary pressures. Our people’s purchasing 
<br/>power will increase with goods becoming cheaper. Ultimately the cost of living of our people will 
<br/>decrease. Some may argue that exports will be more expensive, and it may be more expensive for 
<br/>the tourists to come to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at the balance of trade. Our imports are much more than our exports and the net effect 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in terms of savings should be more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- For the tourism industry, I am sure the hotels can revise their absurd room 
<br/>rates and make it more competitive. With these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I await to see a better performing

<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/></span><span>the Opposition, honourable  Deputy Prime Ministers, Attorney-General, honourable Ministers and 
<br/></span><span>Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and all our viewers watching on television 
<br/>and the internet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise today to fully support the Coalition Government’s Budget for the next financial year as 
<br/>announced by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance on 28</span><span>th</span><span> June in this 
<br/>House.  I  wish  to  commend  our  leader,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  for  his  leadership  in 
<br/>steering us to a new Fiji, a freer Fiji, which over the last 18 months is a Fiji that  has enabled our 
<br/>people their basic freedoms; their freedom of speech, their freedom of assembly, their freedom of 
<br/></span><span>movement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  A more secure, sustainable and stable Fiji.  I thank honourable Prasad 
<br/>and his team for their hard work to deliver a Budget that realises the same goals.  I congratulate the 
<br/>Attorney- General on his appointment and a well delivered speech and timely reminder of his core 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1113 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>role as chief legal advisor to Government, and to uphold the rule of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I congratulate my sister Minister, honourable Alitia Bainivalu for being appointed Minister 
<br/>for Fisheries and Forestry, a welcome addition of another woman to Cabinet.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister for his continued commitment to promote women’s national leadership, no matter 
<br/>where we sit in this House. I thank honourable Ravu for his commitment and service to our people 
<br/>during his tenure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  I  wish  to  respond  to  the  repeated  criticism  against  the  Government  from  the 
<br/>Opposition Members and civil society leaders that the social welfare allowances are not enough to 
<br/>sustain a recipient given the cost of living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  I   wish  to  issue  a  reminder.  It  is  not  the  sole  responsibility  of 
<br/>Government to financially sustain the welfare of our social welfare recipients, Mr. Speaker. It is first 
<br/>and foremost the responsibility of the family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- There you go! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I want to say this in </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> Mr. Speaker.  </span><span>E sega ni tavi ni Matanitu 
<br/>me qarava  vakatabakidua vakailavo na qase, o ira e ra sega ni tu vinaka na tuvaki ni yagodra kei 
<br/>na dravudravua. Oqo nai tavi ni dua na vuvale. Na Matanitu e  solia ga na veivuke me vakuria nai 
<br/>tavi e dodonu ga me nona eliu e dua  na vuvale.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government merely supplements this responsibility in recognition of the service of our older 
<br/>persons that have given to Fiji, and supplementary support for our most vulnerable which are our 
<br/>poor, our children and our disabled.  For those that truly need more support, Mr. Speaker, who are 
<br/>abandoned by their family, then this is done on a case by case basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  having  said  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  Government  continues  to  prioritize  the  support 
<br/>services to our most vulnerable.  An increase in budget, Mr. Speaker last year for our social welfare 
<br/>recipients, it had not been done for years by the previous government and then, of course, this year 
<br/>and this budget, there are two major changes I wish to highlight and I thank honourable Sachida Nand 
<br/>for highlighting it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Number one, the Transport Assistance Scheme (TAS), this was previously known as the Bus 
<br/></span><span>Fare  Assistance  Scheme  that  has  been  supporting  around  48,000  beneficiaries.  This  has  been 
<br/>allocated $13.4  million to subsidise the cost of travel  for older persons over 70 and persons with 
<br/>disabilities.  To  enable  beneficiaries  to  subsidise  additional  modes  of  transport  beyond  the  public 
<br/>buses, the programme will be renamed, as I mentioned, the Transport Assistance Scheme.  From 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August,  2024,  our  Social  Pensioners  over  70  years  old  and  disability  recipients  on  the  Disability 
<br/>Allowance Scheme will no longer be on the Bus Fare Scheme but will receive Transport Assistance 
<br/>in cash of $25 a month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the establishment of a Child Well-being Centre.  Subject to consultation of line 
<br/></span><span>ministries and Cabinet approval, this initiative will see our children at risk, who are facing some form 
<br/>of addiction or trauma including majority of our street kids, to be rehabilitated, trained and integrated 
<br/>back into society. An allocation of $250,000 has been made in this Budget for the renovations of the 
<br/>Vunirewa Bible School in Serua donated by the Methodist Church of Fiji for this purpose.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An  initial  commitment  from  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  to  fund  the  programme 
<br/>component  shows  the  confidence  in  our  Government  in  efforts  to  effectively  tackle  the  drug  and 
<br/>trauma issues faced by our children.  We hope more bilateral and donor partners will come on board 
<br/>in these efforts as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other programmes to note, the Ministry has been allocated $200,000 under 
<br/>the  Welfare  Graduation  Programme.  We  aim  to  increase  the  skills  of  our  beneficiaries  through 
<br/>training  programmes  and  link  them  to  dignified  and  decent  work  which  matches  their  skills  and 
<br/>experience that will enable them to start jobs or find employment opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under this reform agenda, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has engaged two staff in the newly 
<br/>established  Welfare  Graduation  Unit  within  the  Department  of  Social    Protection  who  will  be 
<br/>working in close partnership with employers, our vocational institutions especially Pacific Polytech 
<br/>and  I  hear  the  other  side  of  Parliament  constantly  berating  the  increase  in  funding  for  Pacific 
<br/>Polytech, but they are coming to the table in order to provide these vocational training for our people 
<br/>on Social Welfare and also our women.  And, of course, working with the Ministry of Employment 
<br/>on this important programme, which aims to not only support the long-term well-being and resilience 
<br/>of working age beneficiaries but also aims to begin addressing the labour shortage in our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are building on the Department of Children, it was allocated a budget 
<br/>this  year  and  it  will  continue  into  next  year.    We  now  have  a  Director  Children,  Principal  Child 
<br/>Welfare Officer, Welfare Officer and an Administration Officer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of the Child Care and Protection Bill and the Child Justice 
<br/>Bill is well into the legislative consultation process. I wish to thank all Members of Parliament for 
<br/>your unanimous support for these Bills and we look forward to the continued support of Parliament 
<br/>when the Bills finally come for debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  of  Women,  I  am  honoured  to  once  again  highlight  the 
<br/>crucial importance of gender equality and women's rights which is fundamental to the advancement 
<br/>and  sustainable  development  of  our  Fiji.    I  am  pleased  to  highlight,  we  continue  to  make  good 
<br/>progress  to  align  all  Government  agencies,  ministries  and  sectors  to  the  shared  responsibility  of 
<br/>empowering  our  women.  I  applaud  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  its  leadership  in  advancing  the 
<br/>implementation of gender responsive budgeting.  In the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of 
<br/>Women further affirms this commitment by an allocation of $$4.34 million for its  operations and 
<br/>programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition the Women Economic Empowerment Grants continue to assist 
<br/>our women who wish to venture into business.  I want to thank the Juncao Technology Demonstration 
<br/>Centre  staff  for  the  pilot  project  in  Makoi  which  is  a  pilot  project  in  our  urban  areas  covering 
<br/>approximately 80 women to set up backyard gardens in this large peri-urban area. Since last week, 
<br/>the  women  of  Delaivalelevu  have  shown  interest  and  we  hope  this  initiative  for  our  women  will 
<br/>realise the successes already enjoyed by the Naitasiri Women’s Group and Rewa Disabled Women’s 
<br/>Group in their backyard farming of mushrooms and related easy cash crops. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue to work with our development partners and I wish to thank the 
<br/></span><span>Government of Australia, the Government of New Zealand, the World Bank and UNFPA for coming 
<br/>on board in their continued support for our National Action Plan to Prevent Gender Based Violence, 
<br/>the    continued  development  of  our  Women's  Economic  Empowerment  National  Action  Plan 
<br/>(WEENAP) and, of course, there is a critical issue of the Tech-Facilitated Gender Based Violence 
<br/>that we are focusing on, including a gender analysis of the online safety legislation and landscape.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1115 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to express support for the Budget presented in 
<br/>Parliament.    This  is  a  budget  for  the  people,  with  diligent  efforts  to  promote  stability  in  the 
<br/>management of our finances, security for our future and sustainability of our debt for our children 
<br/>and their children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>fellow Members of Parliament and all Fijians watching this from around the world;   </span><span>Bula vinaka, 
<br/></span><span>good day, </span><span>Namaste, Aslam Walekum, Jai Siya Ram</span><span> to all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today with profound disappointment in the 2024-2025 Fijian National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget presented by honourable Rabuka’s Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yes, I will, honourable Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, this Budget fails to meet the expectations of ordinary Fijians, who are grappling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the escalating cost of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji anticipated relief from the high cost of living through a reduction in VAT 
<br/>on essential goods and services.  Regrettably, the Coalition Government appears to have postponed 
<br/>this measure, perhaps as a strategic to move for future electoral campaigns.  That will appear next 
<br/>year, I believe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  delay  adds  to  the  disappointment  amongst  voters,  who  entrusted  them  with  their 
<br/>aspirations.   Fijians in every household are voicing their concerns about soaring prices of essential 
<br/>goods, a burden that threatens to worsen in the coming months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  how  can  an  economic-professor-turned-finance  Minister  overlook  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>widespread outcry over affordability?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Fijians, struggling to make ends meet, are confused by the Government’s 
<br/>disconnect  from their daily hardships.  The Budget  theme,  </span><span>“An Economically Stable, Secure and 
<br/>Sustainable Fiji”</span><span>, rings hollow without concreate strategies for sustainable economic growth.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite lofty promises during the election campaign and supposed public consultations, the 
<br/>Coalition Government has yet, again, failed to deliver on its commitments.  Instead of scaling down 
<br/>on lavish pledges, they have inflated the budget by over $200 million, inching closer to a staggering 
<br/>$300 million increase from the previous year.  This irresponsible fiscal management will push the 
<br/>country’s national debt beyond $10.5 billion, an unprecedented level under this Administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  budgetary  decisions  dampen  the  prospects  for  genuine  economic 
<br/>growth and have tangible negative effects on the lives of ordinary Fijians, if not properly planned.  It 
<br/></span><span>reduces opportunities for businesses and individuals in low and middle class brackets, to own homes, 
<br/></span><span>hindering the ability to build wealth and secure their financial future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, infrastructure development plays a crucial part in long-term prosperity and 
<br/>development.    However,  the  2024-2025  budgetary  allocation  for  Capital  Grant  for  Fiji  Roads 
<br/>Authority has decreased by over $34 million.  Will this mean that from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024, we expect 
<br/>more potholes on our roads? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FRA, again, in the new financial year has no new projects, similar to other capital projects. 
<br/>It seems like the Coalition Government has nothing new to think about and are continuing with the 
<br/>previous government's projects. The deteriorating conditions of roads continues to create everyday 
<br/>issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WAF was allocated a substantial amount of funding. Every Fijian faces water crisis for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>weeks and despite that, Government continues to ignore these issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  of  Energy  fails  to  address  the  common  problems.  We 
<br/>continue  to  receive  calls  from  poor  Fijians requesting  for  connectivity  where  new  house  wiring  is 
<br/>being done and people are waiting, and not connected to the EFL grid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is highly vulnerable to climate change and climate produced disasters. In last six years, the 
<br/>Fijian Government has spent around $500 million in rehabilitation works. The deteriorating state of 
<br/>our roads and water crisis plaguing various regions reflect this neglect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker  Sir, the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics has repeatedly failed to allocate funding for 
<br/>new projects. There is nothing new in the 2024-2025 Budget. The ongoing projects were all approved 
<br/>by the previous government and the Coalition Government is now here to cut ribbons and show that 
<br/>under their administration, those projects were implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Health Sector was allocated substantial funding under their capital projects in the 2023-
<br/>2024  financial  year  to  fund  a  number  of  projects.  I  have  been  informed  that  most  of  their  capital 
<br/>projects were not implemented. Is that true? I am requesting the honourable Minister for Health and 
<br/>Medical Services to, please, look into this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this time to talk about climate change and the policy 
<br/>shortcomings. The Budget also exhibits a lack of innovation and action on climate change. Repeated 
<br/>allotments without new ideas or concrete implementation plans highlight the Government's future to 
<br/>access green climate funds, despite the solid groundwork laid down by the previous Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of policy directions and action on climate change is not just a failure of imagination 
<br/>but a serious threat to our nation’s future. The continued reliance on outdated and ineffective strategies 
<br/>means that Fiji is falling behind in the global effort to combat climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  people  are  already  experiencing  the  adverse  effects  of  climate  change  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government’s failure to address this issue with urgency and innovation is dereliction of duty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous government had laid the groundwork for accessing green climate funds, but this 
<br/>Administration has failed to build on that foundation. I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I know that 
<br/>this will be microwaved, renamed or rebuild in the next Budget (I will put on the table).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This lacks the plan and vision that is typical of this Coalition Government and the honourabe 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  is  costing  us  just  not  financially,  but  also 
<br/></span><span>environmentally, jeopardizing the future of our children and grandchildren. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  The  groundwork  is  already  done,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but  you  have  done 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1117 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The substantial increase in the Police budget makes me wonder where this funding is going to. 
<br/>The rise in crime rate, particularly targeting specific communities, threaten social cohesion, and the 
<br/>economic stability does not justify this substantial increase.  The Government's failure to address these 
<br/>security challenges undermines public confidence and investor trust, hindering economic growth and 
<br/>prosperity.  It is unacceptable that the Fiji Police Force has been unable to effectively address and 
<br/>control these crimes, leading to awful consequences on our economy and social fabric.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public  safety  and  security  is  crucial  for  fostering  a  conducive  environment  for  economic 
<br/>growth and attracting investments.  When crime rate escalates and citizens feel unsafe, it undermines 
<br/>confidence and hampers economic activities.  This not only affects individuals and communities, but 
<br/>also discourages both domestic and foreign investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PAP, NFP and SODELPA Coalition are all going to an unknown or 
<br/>rather different direction, where each Party has its own agenda.  The honourable Prime Minister, at 
<br/>one  point  in  time,  says  something  and  the  following  week,  he  apologises  to  the  nation  for  his 
<br/>statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To put fuel to the fire, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and 
<br/>Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  issues  another  statement  to  cover  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister’s statement.  It seems like that there is no solidarity or aim to serve the 
<br/>people, but three different Parties are serving different groups of people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Absolute hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call upon all honourable Members of this Parliament to 
<br/>hold the Coalition accountable for their failures.  The people of Fiji deserve leaders who prioritise 
<br/>their welfare over personal gain and political manoeuvring.  Let us work together to steer Fiji towards 
<br/>a future where prosperity is shared by all, not just a privileged group or privileged few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government’s lack of accountability and foresight jeopardises 
<br/>Fiji’s future.  Their penchant for rhetoric over action, combined with lavish spending and broken 
<br/>promises, paints a grim picture for our nation’s governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the figures on paper may look rosy-rosy, but the reality on the ground seems 
<br/>different.      I  will  take  you  to  2023-2024  Budget.    The  capital  project  utilisation  was  only  41.47 
<br/>percent.  Let me throw some light or furnish this Parliament with few of the projects which were not 
<br/></span><span>even touched and had zero utilisation.   I will just take a few, there is  a  whole list,  and thanks to 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Premila  Kumar  for  asking  this  Oral  Question  which  was  furnished  to  this  Parliament 
<br/>through the Ministry of Finance.  This is the list: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Bridge general - $500,000; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Miscellaneous infrastructure- $400,000; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Building infrastructure - $182,000; 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Rural electrification - $400,115; 
<br/>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Naboro landfill design stage - $200,000 to $300,000; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  </span><span>Paisa nai hai. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- </span><span>Paisa nai hai.</span><span>  This was just last year.  I am talking about 2023-2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is properly spelt out there that these projects were there but never been 
<br/>addressed.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I do not know what is the honourable Minister doing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- </span><span>Paisa nai hai</span><span>.  I remember when the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics was on this 
<br/>side, he is very easy to speak, but to address the people of Fiji, is difficult, and to run a government 
<br/>is difficult, because we know.  He was always harping when he was at this side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  declare  my  interest  to  be  an  independent  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament for my remaining parliamentary tenure, based on the current status.  I will continue to 
<br/>echo my voice and opinion on the same platform set by the former Prime Minister, Mr. Bainimarama.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I do not support the 2024-2025 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members  of Parliament and my fellow Fijians;  my contribution to the Budget Debate will focus on 
<br/>four major things: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dealing with drugs; 
<br/>Resetting the Police; 
<br/>Reforming the RFMF; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Making Immigration Services more efficient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But before I do that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a short reply to the comments made 
<br/>by honourable Naivalurua on two specific issues, one on Police reset and secondly, the matter of the 
<br/>Narcotics Bureau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the honourable Member that our only Commissioner 
<br/>will be a Fijian. He will be a man in blue, as I have assured Parliament already. He will not be a man 
<br/>in green, nor in red, nor will he be a foreigner.  He will be a Policeman or a Policewoman. So, the 
<br/>executive leadership of the Fiji Police Force will be a Fijian and I just want to assure you that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the matter of the mentor, Mr. Speaker, a mentor is about a sounding board. Every good 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leader will know that they need help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and myself were mentored by 
<br/></span><span>great people in the RFMF. I think we testified to that. We are standing here today because we were 
<br/></span><span>mentored well. We had good leaders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I find the relevance for it, that a mentor is someone who gives 
<br/>proper advice when the time is right. I would just like to assure honourable Naivalurua that there is 
<br/>no ulterior motive about giving help and that is why we need help from everyone as we do. Parliament 
<br/>needs help from UNDP. It is not local, so that is what we are doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the matter of the Narcotics Bureau, I support the idea raised by honourable Naivalurua for 
<br/></span><span>a Special Committee of Parliament, under Standing Order 129, to deal with drugs. This is a very 
<br/></span><span>important and emotional issue for me, Mr. Speaker.  Exactly five years ago, I said exactly the same 
<br/>thing to the honourable Member. I got assaulted for it in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The government at that time, Sir, they did not need help. Now, I am telling Fiji, I need help. 
<br/>We   need to fix it. When that is raised, I am going to fix it. I have said that the Narcotics Bureau will

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be the solution to lead Government’s fight against this.  So, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that we are 
<br/>doing something about it, and we are passionate about it, and I am going to acknowledge that later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I think the honourable Member will understand. Fiji needs good leaders. The Fiji Police 
<br/>Force needs good leaders. Good leaders understand they need help. We all need help, and that I will 
<br/>support your motion to have a Parliamentary Committee to look after drugs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration is at the forefront of safeguarding 
<br/>our  nation.  Our  strategic  focus  includes  implementing  critical  initiatives,  such  as  the  ongoing 
<br/>National  Security  and  Defence  Review  (NSDR),  establishing  a  dedicated  Narcotics  Bureau,  and 
<br/>supporting  the  Police  Reset  Initiative.  These  initiatives  are  designed  to  modernise  our  security 
<br/>infrastructure and address contemporary threats effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the  establishment of the Narcotics  Bureau is  a crucial step  in  combating  the 
<br/>scourge of illicit drugs in our society. This Bureau will spearhead our National Narcotics Strategy, 
<br/>focusing on prevention, enforcement and rehabilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are committed to creating a safer environment for all Fijians by eradicating the menace 
<br/>of  illicit  drugs.  This  initiative  represents  our  dedication  to  protecting  our  communities  from  the 
<br/>devastating effects of drug abuse and trafficking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Truly, this is becoming a national issue, I agree. I am encouraged to see that we, Fijians, are 
<br/>coming together as a community to do what we can to combat this epidemic. I would like to especially 
<br/>mention the Fiji National University, Fiji Village, Ms. Kalesi Volatabu and Drugs Free World Fiji, 
<br/>Fiji Council of Churches, </span><span>vanua</span><span> and many other NGOs who have made this fight their priority.  The 
<br/>nation called and they stood up to the challenge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Police  Reset  Initiative  is  a  significant  component  of  our  strategy  to 
<br/>restore the integrity and effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies. By enhancing intelligence 
<br/>capabilities, human resources and strategic operational planning, we are committed to making our 
<br/>police force more responsive, accountable and effective in combating crime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are embracing modern technologies such as advanced forensic tools, digitizing criminal 
<br/>records and deploying drones for surveillance. These advancements will enable our police force to 
<br/>effectively combat sophisticated crimes and ensure public safety. Furthermore, we are dedicated to 
<br/>the continuous professional development of our police personnel, ensuring they are well-equipped to 
<br/></span><span>handle the evolving landscape of criminal activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to add a special thanks today to the Australian Government 
<br/>through the High Commissioner in Fiji, His Excellency Ewen McDonald and the Commissioner of 
<br/>the Australian Federal Police, Commissioner Kershaw for their support to our Police Reset Initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the RFMF remains steadfast in its commitment to protect Fiji and contribute 
<br/>to  global  peacekeeping  efforts.  This  year,  we  are  focusing  on  internal  restructuring  to  improve 
<br/>efficiency, establishing the Joint Logistics Command, and implementing the Automated Logistics 
<br/></span><span>Management Systems. These initiatives will streamline its operations, reduce costs and enhance its 
<br/></span><span>overall capability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  naval  division  continues  to  safeguard  our  vast  Exclusive  Economic  Zone  (EEZ)  and 
<br/>support maritime operations critical to our national security and economic interests. The surveillance 
<br/>of Fiji’s EEZ and the execution of maritime search-and-rescue missions are vital to our sovereignty 
<br/>and economic well-being.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Security and Defence Review (NSDR), although not yet released has already 
<br/>provided us with invaluable insights. I want to take this moment to extend our gratitude to the review 
<br/>team led by Mr. Jim Sanday, for their thorough and dedicated work. The insights from this review 
<br/>will form the bedrock of our future national security strategies, ensuring that we are prepared to face 
<br/>modern  threats  with  robust  and  effective  measures.  This  review  emphasizes  the  importance  of 
<br/>modernizing  our  military  capabilities,  improving  our  logistics,  and  enhancing  our  readiness  to 
<br/>respond to various threats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also  focusing on the professional  development  of our military personnel,  ensuring 
<br/>they have access to the latest training and technology. This commitment to excellence will enhance 
<br/>our ability to  protect  Fiji’s interests both  at  home and abroad. Our continued participation  in  UN 
<br/>missions  demonstrates  our  dedication  to  global  peace  and  security,  and  the  NSDR  will  help  us 
<br/>maintain and improve our contributions to these important international efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of Immigration, we are committed to making our immigration services more efficient 
<br/>and effective. This involves a comprehensive approach to streamline processes, improve customer 
<br/>service and leverage technology. Here is how we plan to achieve this: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Streamlining Processes: 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Leveraging on Technology to assist us in the work that we do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving Customer Service; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue to strive to enhance national security, this is the heart of our 
<br/>work and specifically we are supporting law enforcement abilities in Fiji particularly to deal with the 
<br/>work of the Police today.  All our law enforcement agencies, our border agencies and in particular 
<br/>Immigration in terms of looking after or processing people who come from abroad to come and work 
<br/>in  Fiji.    We  are  committed  to  our  international  peacekeeping  effort,  and  we  are  committed  to 
<br/>providing an environment for economic and social stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  running  out  of  time,  and  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the 
<br/>Commander and team RFMF, Commissioner of Police and team Fiji Police Force, the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary of my Ministry and also the Director of Immigration and all the hard work that has been 
<br/>put in by the Ministry of Home Affairs to try and help to keep our Fijians and our communities safe.  
<br/>I would like to end by saying that I support the Budget that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am speaking in this Parliament Chamber for the 
<br/></span><span>first time as a crossbench Member of Parliament. This situation has come about because of a decision 
<br/></span><span>that I made in this Parliament, (a decision that I do not regret) and decisions that were made by others 
<br/>outside of this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say at the outset, that the decisions made outside of this Parliament 
<br/>were theirs to make and I respect, and the reasonings behind their decisions, I will not question. I 
<br/>have accepted the situation I am in, and I will move on as a crossbench Member of Parliament for 
<br/>the remainder of this Parliament term.  I have made my choice also publicly, and as the saying goes 
<br/>“You  are  free  to  choose,  but  you  are  not  free  from  the  consequences  of  your  choice.”    That,  I 
<br/></span><span>understand very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite all that has happened, I stand here today with a sense of freedom; 
<br/>freedom to exercise my own judgement, freedom to consult across the floor, freedom to work with 
<br/>others including those across the floor; all to ensure that I serve our citizens well.  Today is a new 
<br/>start for me.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1121 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, democracy is only partly about votes and seats in the legislature because 
<br/>democracy is mostly about human encounter and interaction. It is about arguing our cases, debating, 
<br/>it  is  about  compromise  across  different  people,  people  with  different  beliefs,  different  political 
<br/>affiliations, people who may be radically different than ourselves, but we have to learn to say,  “Okay, 
<br/>I may not understand you fully where you are coming from, but I am beginning to see you and I show 
<br/>you respect, admiration and reverence.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  politics  of  “us  versus  them”  and  “it  is  my  way  or  the  highway”  and  I  must  say  still 
<br/>flavoring this Parliament is a form of politics that sows seeds of anger and hatred.  When it comes 
<br/>from this Parliament, we are not being good examples to the multi-racial, multicultural and multi-
<br/>religious society that we serve. I think that we need more humanity in our politics rather than identity.  
<br/>This is why I made my only interjection (rather loudly) in response to honourable Kiran’s speech 
<br/>yesterday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  disappointed  because  she  is  supposed  to  be  spearheading  the  move  towards 
<br/>reconciliation. If one is genuine about reconciliation, one must bite the bullet and let go of his or her 
<br/>anger and hatred and bias. I want to remind the honorable Sashi Kiran, through you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, that the two gentlemen that she somewhat ridiculed in her speech, in my view unfairly, because 
<br/>they are not here to defend themselves have a combined total of 160,000 votes and in that 160,000 
<br/>are people that you would want to come to the reconciliation table. That speech yesterday will just 
<br/>make them clam up and stay away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  budget  is  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  a  democracy  because 
<br/>through the budget, development is pursued. Development, defined as a process that creates growth 
<br/>and  brings  in  progress  and  positive  change.  My  judgement  of  the  budget  will  be  based  on  that 
<br/>definition and my general view is that the budget creates growth but not as big as we want it to be. It 
<br/>provides for some progress, but not as fast as we want it to be.   It provides for some positive changes 
<br/>but not as much as we want it to be, but Mr Speaker Sir, we do not live in a perfect world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise four issues on the 2024-2025 Budget.  First is this issue 
<br/>of the Vatuwaqa Primary School.  You might recall that I had raised a few questions in Parliament 
<br/>on the repair of Vatuwaqa Primary School, the building that was burnt the day before Elections in 
<br/>2022. Despite the assurances from both the honourable Minister of Education that it was going to be 
<br/>repaired, nothing has materialised to date and there is no provision for it in this Budget; if there is 
<br/></span><span>one, I do not see it.  I plead with the honourable Prime Minister to please intervene and allow the 
<br/></span><span>repair  of  this  school.  Perhaps,  Government  can  take  back  the  school  given  it  was  a  Government 
<br/>school before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir this school is in a tsunami safe zone.  It is very convenient for the children 
<br/>in the informal settlement nearby to attend the school (just a short walking distance away) and it is 
<br/>very convenient for USP students who come with their family to send their children there. The longer 
<br/>we  leave  it,  the  more  deterioration  will  set  in  to  the  otherwise  perfectly  good  buildings  that  are 
<br/>currently standing there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, while I am still on education, I would like to voice my disagreement and disappointment 
<br/>on a statement that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister made during his delivery of the Budget where 
<br/>he said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In fact, we spent around $160 million on almost 22,000 students who never completed 
<br/>their studies, a major loss for the taxpayers. We have got that changed now and the focus will 
<br/>have to be on quality.”</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1122 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, money wasted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am assuming that the word “quality”</span><span> </span><span>here means that the threshold mark 
<br/>will be increased for those that want to access this facility.  The question is, how far high you will go 
<br/>before you can say that the money used on the students who never complete their studies are not a 
<br/>major loss to the taxpayers because in my view, it should never be seen as a loss in the first place 
<br/>anyway.  Some of those taxpayers would be parents of those students and you would not want to tell 
<br/>them that they had wasted their money on their children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, money spent on education is never wasted regardless of how far the student 
<br/>progresses,  that  is  the  cost  of  developing  our  nation’s  human  resources.  The  statistics  that  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister provided were very selective and incomplete because surely some 
<br/>of those students he was referring to would be gainfully employed by now. Some of those students 
<br/>with low marks would have completed their studies with flying colours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the budget is the allocation to SPCA on Animal Welfare. Whilst 
<br/>I welcome the $130,000 allocated, this is the same amount last year and I hoped that it would increase 
<br/>this year given the ever-increasing number of stray cats and dogs on our streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the contributing factors to stray dogs and cats is the high veterinary 
<br/>charges and the high cost of animal medicine. A tax relief on the medicine costs would help and also 
<br/>a tax concession perhaps to those that donate to SPCA and other animal shelters would go a long way 
<br/>towards curbing animal cruelty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourth,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  is  on  the  allocation  to  RFMF  and  especially  the  allocation  to 
<br/>peacekeeping.  I  thank  the  Government  for  their  continuous  support  to  RFMF  and  especially 
<br/>peacekeeping. I disagree with my friend the honourable Shalen Kumar on his suggestion yesterday, 
<br/>to do away with peacekeeping and divert the fund to the Police.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During one of the Post-Budget Dialogue, it was reported that a Professor stated and I quoted: 
<br/>“Peacekeeping is useless.” Such an insensitive comment. My disappointment here also is that the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister did not defend peacekeeping and the peacekeepers there during 
<br/>that discussion, and the Minister responsible for RFMF has not said anything about that insensitive 
<br/>comment.  I may be biased because I am a former peacekeeper, but I am not the only one in this 
<br/>Parliament and there are thousands of others and their families outside this Parliament who would 
<br/></span><span>feel the same. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  peacekeeping  is  never  useless,  because  through  Fiji’s  participation  in 
<br/>missions around the world, Fiji’s voice is heard and Fiji commands respect on the world stage.  Some 
<br/>of the countries say yes to Fiji’s request, they do so because they respect the fact that a small country 
<br/>like Fiji is punching above its own weight when it comes to fulfilling its global citizen responsibilities 
<br/>through the boots of our soldiers on peacekeeping grounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, to say that peacekeeping is useless is to infer that the soldiers who happen 
<br/></span><span>to  be  sons,  husbands,  fathers  who  paid  the  ultimate  sacrifice  whilst  serving  in  those  various 
<br/></span><span>peacekeeping missions died in vain. It is a desecration of the sacred memories of these brave souls. 
<br/>How dare you say that peacekeeping is useless!  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will support this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and 
<br/>all Fijians who are also watching on livestream.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1123 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my contribution on the 2024-2025 Budget delivered by the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics on Friday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and everyone who helped 
<br/>contribute to  the  2024-2025  National  Budget,  especially  the contributions  from  the  various 
<br/>stakeholders that form the foundation of Fiji's development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Sunday, 7th July marked the 46th anniversary of Independence of the 
<br/>Solomon Islands. The date marks a significant chapter also for our fellow Fijians of Solomon Islands 
<br/>descent as it gives them a day to remember, reconnect and celebrate their roots and heritage. There 
<br/>is no other Pacific Island country that has contributed immensely to Fiji than Solomon Islands. All 
<br/>the major roads in Vanua Levu including Taveuni were constructed by Solomon Island blackbirders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Declare your interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  I  congratulate  the Solomon  Islands  Government  and  its  people  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their 46 years of Independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I go into my speech, I would like to address some issues that has been raised by the 
<br/>Opposition. First, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the issue of Pacific Polytech. I wish to emphasize that Pacific 
<br/>Polytech was established in 2021 and approved through the Higher Education Commission. It caters 
<br/>for students from low-income families and those who cannot access FNU.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recently attended a graduation at Pacific Polytech and I was amazed that 99 percent of the 
<br/>students are from the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community.  These students would have fallen into crimes and other 
<br/>social ills if Pacific Polytech was not there.  Secondly, most Opposition members have continued to 
<br/>criticize the Coalition Government’s effort in establishing infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the infrastructure in this country was undertaken and established 
<br/>in the 1970s and 1990s during Ratu Mara’s time and very minimal was done during the FijiFirst time.  
<br/>These  infrastructure  works,  included  the  Suva-Nadi  Highway,  the  Monasavu  Hydro  Scheme,  the 
<br/>Seaqaqa Cane Development and Irrigation Scheme, and this just shows that the previous Government 
<br/>had done all the infrastructure that was there and minimal was done by the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I refer to some honourable Opposition Members who continue to promote 
<br/>that  racial  divide  is  widening  amongst  the  major  races  in  Fiji.    This  is  far  from  the  truth,  as  this 
<br/>Government is firm in its believe that we need to promote inter-racial harmony in this country, and 
<br/>this is to begin from our schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, I was blessed to have been a part of the opening ceremony of Navesi Primary and 
<br/>Kindergarten School.  I was honoured to have received their invitation because it is at the tender age 
<br/>where we can mould our children to become innovative, creative, analytical and critical thinkers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, videos of the opening ceremony are circulating widely on the social media 
<br/>on the traditional protocols that were carried out by the Kindergarten students of Navesi.  This is 
<br/>evidence of the idea that our children need our utmost attention, love and care, training and modelling 
<br/>our values to them at a tender age, moving away from the laid back excuse and moving towards being 
<br/>a productive and responsible citizens of our beloved Fiji.  They were also involved in performing 
<br/>Indian and Chinese dances, and this is what this Coalition Government is trying to promote.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of this month, as part of the National Reconciliation and Unity 
<br/>initiative, we will be hosting a field day in the highlands of Viti Levu.  During this field day, Indian 
<br/>ladies and farmers from Sabeto will be there teaching </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> ladies on how to plant the cowpea and 
<br/>other crops.  This is a government that is trying to promote social cohesion amongst our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Asian  Subterranean  Termites,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Coalition  Government 
<br/>assumed office at the end of 2022, we were informed of the infestation of the Asian Subterranean 
<br/>termites,  which  have  not  only  caused  structural  weakening  of  the  wooden  foundations  but  also 
<br/>instilled fear and anxiety among homeowners in the Western Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The termite infestation problem was reported to the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF) in 
<br/>2009.    However,  due  to  insufficient  attention  by  the  previous  Government,  the  issue  escalated, 
<br/>resulting  in  widespread infestation  and significant  property damages.   The Coalition Government 
<br/>allocated  $3  million  in  the  last  Budget.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  inform  Parliament  that  the 
<br/>provision of $3 million has already been spent, and we have assisted 448 families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, the provision of $2 million in the 2024-2025 Budget is welcomed to provide relief 
<br/>packages to homeowners affected by termites, and we will first roll out this initiative in the most 
<br/>affected areas in the Western Division. This is a testament of the Coalition Government’s strategic 
<br/>collaboration and community involvement aimed at creating a resilient defence against the threats 
<br/>posed by these invasive termites.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the foresight of the Coalition Government in recognising the 
<br/>contribution of minority communities in nation building.  As the Assistant Minister in the Office of 
<br/>the Prime Minister, I welcome the budgetary allocation for minority communities in Fiji under the 
<br/>Office of the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $130,000 has been allocated to the Melanesian-</span><span>Vasu i Taukei</span><span> communities; 
<br/>$300,000 to the Rotuma Island Council; $200,000 for the Rabi Island Council and $70,000 for the 
<br/>Kioa  Island  Council.  These  allocations  are  intended  to  empower  these communities  with 
<br/>development  projects  that  build confidence  in  themselves,  ensuring  improved livelihood  and  self-
<br/>resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>Sir,  in  conclusion,  I  commend  the efforts  of  all  Government  Ministries,  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development  and  Statistics  and  his  team  for  their  diligent work  on  the  2024-2025  Budget.  The 
<br/></span><span>Budget  is  a  reflection  of  the  collective  efforts  of all  Government  Ministries  that  addresses  the 
<br/></span><span>diverse community needs, demonstrating a</span><span> </span><span>commitment to</span><span> </span><span>our nation's growth and development.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge this august Parliament to endorse this Budget for the betterment of 
<br/>our  nation and  the  wellbeing  of  our  citizens.  I  commend  the  2024-2025  National  Budget  to 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Tubuna, for your response.  Before I offer the floor

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before proceeding with my budget response, I would like to congratulate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Graham Leung for his appointment as Attorney-General of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will also  wish,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  congratulate  </span><span>Na i  ‘aukei  ni  Vara’</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>honourable Alitia 
<br/>Bainivalu, as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  It is an honour and an achievement to the people 
<br/>of Ra, as one of our daughters have been appointed as the first lady Minister of this particular Ministry 
<br/>in which we are grateful to the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Very true. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the  2024-2025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Budget…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Very true, honourable Member, coming from the interior.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  …which  was  presented  to  this  august  Parliament  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics on 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024. I would like to thank the honourable Minister and his 
<br/>team for putting forward this Budget. I thank our people, not only for helping get us this far, but for 
<br/>the belief in our ability to take us forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the Coalition Government for the continuing free education 
<br/>programme for our children. We  all know that if Fiji  is  to  be successful, we need to  educate our 
<br/>young ones. This Budget ensures that that will continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite  the  hard  times,  our  Budget  provides  for  our  future  generations  and  should  be 
<br/>commended. Mr. Speaker, Sir, no matter what happens, we need to ensure that our children continue 
<br/>to get educated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more than just learning about science and accounting, I would like to remind 
<br/>parents that they have the responsibility to teach their children the importance of being good people. 
<br/>Learning starts at home by ensuring our children grow up as good human beings. Parents, please, 
<br/>talk to your children, watch over them, give them guidance and help them to become better citizens 
<br/>of Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I thank the Government that a holistic approach is needed to tackle the drug problem, a 
<br/>problem  in  my  view  which  is  very  detrimental  to  the  future  of  our  country.    I  acknowledge  the 
<br/>Government for the establishment of the Narcotics Bureau with a Special Drug Unit within the Office 
<br/>of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also thankful that funding will be provided to the Fiji Police Force to procure drug testing 
<br/>equipment to ramp up drug tests across the country and the Drug Rehabilitation Incentive Package 
<br/>which has been developed for the private sector and other civil society organisations, to set up drug 
<br/>rehabilitation centres to further boost our efforts in the fight against drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am calling on all Fijians to work together and solve the issue of drugs, as 
<br/>people are moving away from marijuana but are going into hard drugs which is a very sad situation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the Government for the allocation of $101 million to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Agriculture to boost the agriculture economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  subsistence  economy,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  long  the  economic  model  for  the  rural  areas 
<br/>must  be  strengthened.    In  fact,  this  model  is  keeping  Fiji  above  water  when  compared  to  other 
<br/>countries.  There is no lack of food in Fiji, unlike in other countries.  It is through the subsistence 
<br/>economy that we have as part of our makeup.  There is the sea for seafood, the mangroves and the 
<br/>land all available as sources of sustenance.  We must focus on these areas.  Countries are internalising 
<br/>their economies.  For Fiji, this subsistence economy can be a huge part of the equation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is encouraging, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that villagers are now growing and selling vegetables at 
<br/>attractive  prices  by  the  roadside,  long  the  domain  of  other  communities.  This  trend  must  be 
<br/>encouraged  as  it  will  also  lead  to  the  reduction  in  leakages  for  tourism  with  food  supplies  being 
<br/>purchased locally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to commend the Government for all the developments that have been 
<br/>carried out in the Province of Ra, from road to infrastructure development and I do hope that this will 
<br/></span><span>continued in this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I plead with the Government through the Public Works Department to consider rural roads, 
<br/>like Nasau, Nakorotubu, Nailuva and other roads in Ra, which require urgent attention.  Certain parts 
<br/>for  these  roads  need  to  be  tarsealed,  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works  and  Meteorological 
<br/>Services and Transport, as it is really bad during rainy season which affect travellers during rainy 
<br/>weather. Sir, I come from the interior, and I know their struggles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted that no allocation has been 
<br/>made for the re-establishment of the FSC Penang Sugar Mill.  But I know that it will come next year, 
<br/>as the honourable Minister for Sugar has clearly spelt out in this august Parliament in May this year 
<br/>that, and I quote: “it may not start now, but it will definitely finish before the end of our term.” 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is our hope that the Penang Mill will be a full scale refinery with an opportunity to come 
<br/>back  bigger  and  better,  bringing  economic  opportunities  in  the  Ra  area.  I  have  noted  that  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Sugar has revealed that FSC has looked into purchasing a second-hand mill 
<br/>from China to be installed in Rakiraki, which we are very grateful for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, very dollar that has been allocated in  this  Budget  is  shared with  a clear intention that 
<br/>should benefit all Fijians.  I request the Government to ensure that the Budget is delivered so to allow 
<br/>Fijians to enjoy the assistance and incentives which was announced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must commend the various arms of Government for their untiring effort to keep our country 
<br/>running.  I ask all Fijians to care for one another and continue to pray for our beloved nation.  We 
<br/>show the true Fijian spirit that there is nothing that we cannot achieve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  once  again  declare  my  full  support  for  the  2024-2025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  </span><span>Vinaka  vakalevu</span><span>,  honourable  Ratu  Josaia  Niudamu,  for  that  wonderful 
<br/>speech. It is a first time that I have heard a chief stressing the importance of ensuring that we have 
<br/>protective legislations for the villages and all, because of how we can best support the Minister for 
<br/>Home Affairs in the drug issues that have infiltrated the villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion at hand. 
<br/>The honourable Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians, ladies and gentlemen; I thank you for 
<br/>the opportunity to address Parliament and elaborate on the budgetary allocation for the Ministry of 
<br/>Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  acknowledge  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and his team in the Ministry of Finance for 
<br/>the hard work undertaken for the Budget Outcome 2024 -2025 and in producing the second Budget 
<br/>of the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also take this opportunity to congratulate honourable Graham Leung as Attorney-General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and honourable Alitia Bainivalu as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  I  wanted  to  say  that  this  Coalition  Government  knows  the  importance  of 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure  and  understands,  especially  in  terms  of  water,  energy,  general  infrastructure,  sea 
<br/></span><span>transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is through this Coalition Government that we will improve and better develop this sector to 
<br/>lessen the load on our urban infrastructure.  It is also through this Government that we will assist in 
<br/>the rural and maritime areas in terms critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, jetties which 
<br/>has been a major concern.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the 2023-2024 Budget achievements, let me highlight some of the deliverables in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>terms of what the Ministry has achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have launched the 2050 Water Strategy, and it provides strategic directions in moving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forward - where we want to take our Water Sector in terms of development and coverage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Viria Water Project, thank you to the last Government for initiating this.  It continues 
<br/>and we have brough this online and continue with the various stages which is a responsibility of any 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>incoming  government  in  terms  of  line  extension  and,  of  course,  rural  water  upgrades  and  related 
<br/>urban upgrades. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  for  various  roads  and  bridges,  projects  have  been  delivered  and  upgraded  and 
<br/>maintenance projects brought up to date, despite the mess left behind by the previous government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  just  demeaning  and  insulting  to  our  roads,  water,  maritime,  energy,  workshop  and 
<br/>technical and other hardworking staff to hear members of the Opposition say that nothing has been 
<br/>done or there is no progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  make  special  mention  of  our  development  partners  in  terms  of  our 
<br/>infrastructure  and  thank  the  ADB,  EIB,  GEF,  the  Australian  Government  through  the  Australian 
<br/>Infrastructure Financing Facility in the Pacific and People’s Republic of China, in addition to others, 
<br/>and  thank  them  sincerely  for  their  continuous  support.  This  support  will  greatly  assist  us  in 
<br/>connecting  the  unconnected  and  enhance  those  who  are  connected  with  roads,  water  and  power, 
<br/>especially for our women and children in vulnerable situations such as isolated rural areas or informal 
<br/>settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in terms of enabling legislations, we have passed the first ever Fiji Meteorological and 
<br/>Hydrological Services Act 2024.  This, recognises and empowers the Fiji Meteorological Services in 
<br/>delivering responsibilities effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also endorsed the re-establishment of the Public Works Department with the aim of 
<br/>remodelling  and  effectively  managing  rural  infrastructure  and  other  services.  This  works  include 
<br/>maintenance  of  rural  roads,  water  sanitation,  energy,  as  well  as  construction  and  maintenance  of 
<br/>various Government buildings which have been neglected under the previous government and we 
<br/>will continue to work and improve on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed policy direction and legislative amendments have been initiated within LTA, 
<br/>to  ensure a more efficient  and well-regulated transport system.  Sir, in  addition  to these, a special 
<br/>press release have been done in order to upgrade the public on the deliverables from the 2024 -2025 
<br/>Budget and if the Opposition had listened carefully, most of what have been set out to be achieved 
<br/>have been achieved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to commend the Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Finance, for the 
<br/>level  of  budgetary  support  we  have  received,  and  we  will  continue  to  invest  in  infrastructure 
<br/></span><span>developments to raise the standard of essential infrastructure and, of course, access to markets and 
<br/></span><span>services in moving forward, especially for the rural communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the allocation of $721.4 million, comprising $210 million for Operating Expenditure 
<br/>and $507.4 million for Capital Expenditure, leaving $4.1 million for VAT, this will greatly support 
<br/>the expected work deliverables within the Ministry.  I am grateful that our Infrastructure Budget has 
<br/>been pulled together under one Head which is Head 40, this will greatly facilitate work in the Ministry 
<br/>in terms of project management, grant management and also one of the main concerns raised which 
<br/>is effective monitoring. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  again  we  will  be  focusing  on  the 
<br/>deliverables and ensuring that our people get better services in moving forward in this financial year.  
<br/>With the $354.8 million which comprises $16 million for Operation Grant and $338.8 million for 
<br/>Capital  Grant  and  again  this  will  assist  with  the  ongoing  construction  and  maintenance  of  roads, 
<br/>upgrading  and  replacement  of  bridges  and  jetties  as  we  move  forward,  particularly  Maintenance 
<br/>Budget of $120 million, Renewals and Replacements of Roads and Bridges $70 million, Upgrading 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bridges and Crossings $29 million, New Jetties Construction $15 million, Rural Roads $24 million 
<br/>and a New Community Programme with a budget of $23 million focusing on community, village 
<br/>roads, schools and similar roads which had been neglected in the past and which had been disregarded 
<br/>as non-FRA roads.  The re-instatement of the Public Works Department will complement the road 
<br/>works  done  by  FRA  as  we  move  forward  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  and  the  budget 
<br/>allocation is $5 million, and of course, this will also look after our rural people and ensure they are 
<br/>connected as we have already mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to assist Land Transport Authority (LTA) in terms of its 
<br/>operations  and  LTA  has  been  allocated  a  budget  of  $36.7  million,  comprising  $26  million  as 
<br/>Operating Grant and $10.7 Capital Grant.  I wish to update the Ministry that the LTA has finalised 
<br/>Cabinet Papers in terms of re-opening permits and looking at the various regulatory and legislative 
<br/>amendments to move us forward in that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of course Water, this has been a key area in terms of the gripe by the 
<br/>Opposition.  Of course, I have mentioned the Water Strategy and Water Authority of Fiji has been 
<br/>allocated $259.45 million, $135 million for Capital Expenditure.  So there are capital expenditures 
<br/>in every allocation I have made and I am not sure why the Opposition is saying that there is no capital 
<br/>injection.  The Budget allocation is projected to target improvement in both Water and Wastewater 
<br/>in moving forward and that is in terms of our deliverables as far as water is concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  also  another  important  programme  in  terms  of  digital 
<br/>transformation.  Water cannot move forward with the latest technological developments and this will 
<br/>be prioritising seamless operations of critical water, reticulation mechanical and electrical assets on 
<br/>a 24/7 basis as we move forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, in Energy, again a sum of $9.6 million, it is critical here that we will be extending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>various power grids particularly Rotuma, Lakeba and of course our Rural Electrification Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in these last few minutes ask a critical question before I conclude.  Why 
<br/>does the Opposition politicise infrastructure?  That is the fundamental question, everytime we speak, 
<br/>they are politicising infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ask yourself, we learned from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Because in infrastructure  whatever that has been done, we 
<br/>shall continue the work and that is what the Coalition Government is doing.  However, when we 
<br/>came in, of course, we did not come in when everything was rosy as what they are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- For example in the three-year period when we did a special 
<br/>audit for FRA, the cost variation and escalation of $405 million in a three-year from July 2020 to 
<br/></span><span>2023, these variations were largely facilitated through flying minutes and with the concurrence of 
<br/></span><span>the Minister of Everything who is no longer here.  This is a significant amount and exceeded the 
<br/>annual budget for each of the three years.  It is equivalent to 10 percent of the National Budget and 
<br/>they are also emphasising continuously about big projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Put the reports here! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This Government is not about big projects, it is about projects 
<br/>which enhance the livelihood and uplifts the lives of the people; not the projects which you have 
<br/>done.  For example, the Four-Lane Project for Nadi $65 million, this escalated with a cost overrun 
<br/>of $50.9 million.  Included in that was $600,000 bought for bougainvillea plants which were not even 
<br/>tendered.    These  are  the  shenanigans  which  we  had  to  fix  when  we  come  in  as  a  Coalition 
<br/>Government.  Just imagine if we did not come in, it would continue, and I do not know whether the 
<br/>Government would still exist, or it would be bankrupt; that is the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I have got about 30 seconds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue, apart from that, I have just landed on my table a $23 million debt that we 
<br/>need to pay from the previous government for engineering services and this has been taken to court.  
<br/>I am thinking of putting a motion that $23.8 million be divided by 26 amongst the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $915,000 each surcharged, then you can pay $30,500 a month before your term ends in 
<br/>2026.   These are the kinds of things we have to deal with when we come in; it is not simple. The 
<br/>other thing, Sir, just give me a few seconds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  FRA,  I  asked  the  CEO,  “what  was  the  situation?”  Let  me  quote  this,  “The  previous 
<br/>government  had  advised  that  after  the  budget  announcement  that  they  will  have  a  supplementary 
<br/>budget after elections where additional funding will be provided to maintain the momentum of road 
<br/>rehabilitation works and meet the contractual obligations.”  That is why when we came in, nothing 
<br/>was there.  Sir, I support the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Exposed, exposed! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That was a fiery contribution.  I was just given a question by one of the 
<br/>Members from the Opposition, how come he was given more time when the light was already red, 
<br/>maybe he was reading the wrong figures up there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Colour blind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch and we will resume when the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bell is sounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 1.03 p.m.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1131 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.31 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You seem to be smiling a lot honourable Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers  and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to give my response to the 2024-2025 Budget Address given 
<br/>by the honourable Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2024-2025 Budget proposal, as presented by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance, outlines measures that, is aimed at economic stability, however, it fails to address the 
<br/>pressing needs of our people, especially those most vulnerable in our society. I have grave concerns 
<br/>over the direction our nation's economy is taking under this Government's fiscal policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most alarming aspects of the past budgets was the increase in 
<br/>VAT and in this Budget, we see there is no push to lower VAT to give some needed relief to the 
<br/>people of Fiji. While I understand the necessity of generating revenue for our nation's development, 
<br/>we must not do so at the expense of our citizens' wellbeing. With the high cost of living rising day 
<br/>by  day  at  an  alarming  rate,  coupled  with  new  taxation  policies,  it  burdens  our  already  struggling 
<br/>families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the backbone of our economy is our people - the hardworking men and 
<br/>women  who  contribute  daily  to  the  growth  and  prosperity  of  our  nation.  At  least  a  simple  act  of 
<br/>kindness from this Government to lower VAT would have given much needed relief for the people 
<br/>and any competent Minister, the honourable Minister of Finance would have found creative ways 
<br/>and means of generating the lost revenue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, families are already stretched thin by the rising cost of living, and this additional 
<br/>financial  strain  threatens  their  ability  to  provide  even  the  most basic  necessities  for  their 
<br/>children. Furthermore,  such  tough  fiscal  measures  risk  stifling  economic  growth  by  dampening 
<br/>consumer spending, which is a critical driver of our economy. When families are forced to allocate 
<br/>more of their income to basic needs, discretionary spending declines, affecting businesses across all 
<br/>sectors and potentially leading to job losses and economic stagnation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I therefore urge this Government to reconsider its approach. Instead of 
<br/>burdening our people, we should explore alternative revenue-generating strategies that do not impact 
<br/></span><span>our  most  vulnerable  citizens.  Measures  such  as  closing  tax  loopholes  and  combating  tax  evasion 
<br/></span><span>among  the  wealthy  could  generate  substantial  revenue  without  further  burdening  those  who  are 
<br/>already struggling to make ends meet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I recognise the importance of fiscal prudence, it should not come at 
<br/>the  expense  of  our  people's  welfare.  We  must  adopt  policies  that  foster  economic  growth,  while 
<br/>ensuring fairness and equity for all Fijians.  Let us prioritise the well-being of our citizens first and 
<br/>foremost as we navigate these challenging economic times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning now to the critical issue of the sugar sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The business of sugar 
<br/></span><span>cane production means planting cane on time, tilling the land on time, harvesting it on time, applying 
<br/>fertiliser  and  manure  on  time,  needs  substantial  efficient  Government  intervention  and  timely 
<br/>assistance.  It is saddening to note that many cane farmers are for various reasons, unhappy today as 
<br/>they want a sympathetic and caring Government that is sensitive to their needs and aspirations.  This 
<br/>is reflected in the unwanted mill stoppages, breakdowns and delays in the processing of work visa 
<br/>for mechanical harvesters drivers.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farmers throughout the nation were expecting to hear the guaranteed 
<br/>sugar cane price per tonne, as promised before, $110 per tonne or more.  The hardworking farmers 
<br/>and  workers  of  Rakiraki  were  anticipating  the  construction  of  a  new  Penang  Mill,  but  to  their 
<br/>disappointment, no such announcement was made.  Now, the honourable Minister for Sugar is talking 
<br/>about a second-hand mill.  We do not know what he is going to say to the farmers after a few months, 
<br/>maybe a third-hand mill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we as Members of Parliament are the representatives of the people of Fiji.   
<br/>It is our primary duty to echo the wants, hopes, fears, joys and the sorrows of the people whom we 
<br/>all  represent,  and  at  this  time  I  wish  to  assure  our  supporters  that  we  remain  your  voice  in  this 
<br/>Parliament.  The sugar industry does not only provide livelihoods to thousands of Fijians, but also 
<br/>drives  rural  development  and  supports  additional  sectors  such  as  transportation,  education  and 
<br/>agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Fiscal Year 2024-2025, the Ministry of Sugar Industry and Multi-Ethnic Affairs has 
<br/>been allocated a substantial  budget  of $76.1 million.   While this allocation is  commendable, it is 
<br/>imperative  that  we  examine  how  these  funds  are  utilised  to  ensure  maximum  benefit  for  our 
<br/>sugarcane farmers and their families.  The current budget allocates $66 million for farm development, 
<br/>including subsidies for fertiliser and weedicide, mechanisation support and improvements in cane 
<br/>access roads  and drainage systems.  These investments are crucial for enhancing cane production 
<br/>efficiency and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.  However, there are areas of concern that 
<br/>must be addressed to truly revitalise the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly  the  issue  of  declining  cane  production  remains  a  significant 
<br/>challenge.  From a peak of four million tonnes to the current 1.6 million tonnes, this decline threatens 
<br/>both the economic viability of our farmers and the overall sustainability of the industry.  It is essential 
<br/>that we identify and address the root causes of this decline, which include land lease uncertainties, 
<br/>aging  farming  demographics,  poor  drainage  and  inadequate  infrastructure.    Secondly,  while  the 
<br/>Government has made efforts to support farmers through initiatives, such as Lease Premium Renewal 
<br/>Assistance  Programme,  however,  more  needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  these  programmes  are 
<br/>accessible and beneficial to all sugarcane farmers, especially small holders and those in remote areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recent  increases  in  production  costs,  such  as  the  rise  in  cane 
<br/>cartage  fees,  harvesting  and  production  costs  have  added  further  financial  strain  on  our  farmers.  
<br/>Fertiliser  subsidies  of  $20  million  is  not  adequate,  and  as  a  result,  many  farmers  are  minimising 
<br/>fertiliser usage as hidden costs keep on increasing, and we see cane production on a downward spiral.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  light  of  these  challenges,  I  urge  the  Government  to  reassess  its  priorities  and  allocate 
<br/>resources more effectively to support sustainable growth in the sugar industry.  This includes not 
<br/>only financial support, but also comprehensive strategies to address issues such as climate change 
<br/>adaptation and mitigation, agricultural innovation and market diversification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry holds immense potential to contribute significantly to our 
<br/>nation’s economy and social wellbeing.  However, realising this potential requires a concerted effort 
<br/>from all stakeholders - Government, industry players and civil society, to work together towards a 
<br/></span><span>sustainable and prosperous future for our sugarcane farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  budgetary  allocation  for  people  living  with  special  needs  is  a  step 
<br/>towards  inclusivity,  but  it  falls  short  in  addressing  their  comprehensive  needs.    The  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education was allocated only $1,157,000 in Programme 2-3, of which $1,041,905 is a grant to special 
<br/>schools.  While this funding is vital, it is insufficient to meet the broader needs of individuals with 
<br/>special needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1133 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also worth noting that assistance will continue for homes destroyed by accidental fires, 
<br/>with a budget of $200,000, and for retrofitting homes for people with special needs, with a budget of 
<br/>$300,000, to enhance accessibility.  However, these amounts are minimal per household and may not 
<br/>be  adequately  address  the  extensive  requirements  for  making  homes  and  public  spaces  truly 
<br/>accessible and safe for those with disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must ensure that these funds are utilised effectively and reach those who 
<br/>need them the most. The Government must consider broader support mechanisms, such as training 
<br/>programmes, accessible infrastructure and inclusive policies that enable people with special needs to 
<br/>participate fully in society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budgetary allocation for people with special needs is a step in the right 
<br/>direction,  but  it  is  not  enough.  We  need  a  comprehensive  strategy  that  includes  consultations, 
<br/>incentives for employment and broader support mechanisms to ensure that people with special needs 
<br/>can lead fulfilling and independent life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While this allocation is a step in the right direction, more must be done to ensure that our 
<br/>policies  are  inclusive  and  supportive  of  people  living  with  disabilities  and  special  needs.  These 
<br/>individuals face unique challenges in accessing education, healthcare and employment opportunities, 
<br/>which require targeted interventions and support services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must strengthen our commitment to upholding the rights 
<br/>and dignity of all Fijians, regardless of their abilities or background. This requires a holistic approach 
<br/>that  integrates  disability  rights  into  mainstream  policies  and  ensure  that  our  communities  are 
<br/>inclusive and welcoming for everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us reaffirm our commitment to building a society where every individual, 
<br/>including  those  with  disabilities,  have  the  opportunity  to  thrive  and  contribute  to  our  nation’s 
<br/>development.  By investing in their wellbeing and promoting inclusivity, we can build a stronger, 
<br/>more resilient Fiji for generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  representatives  of  the  people,  it  is  our  duty  to  hold  this  Government 
<br/>accountable and to advocate for policies that promote fairness, equity and sustainability. Let us work 
<br/>together to address these challenges and to build a future where every Fijian can live with dignity, 
<br/>prosperity and hope.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span><span>Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>and honourable Members of Parliament; let me begin by commending the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for 
<br/>delivering a well thought-out and healthy Budget. I will be speaking on the increased budget set aside 
<br/>by  the  Coalition  Government  for  Fiji's  culture  sector.  This,  as  we  all  would  know,  fall  under  the 
<br/>banner of the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The annual budget for the sector has increased twice in a row, and this is a symbol of how 
<br/></span><span>Government has yet, again, prioritised culture as an important issue for national development.  In 
<br/></span><span>fact, over the last 10 years, the world has changed in ways that make culture even more relevant to 
<br/>our everyday living and addressing global challenges that impact our communities. Fiji, I can proudly 
<br/>say, is following in this new direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increase  in  budget  is  inspired  by  policies  such  as  the  Fiji  National 
<br/>Cultural Policy which will ensure the sector succeeds. The Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts'

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget increased to $7.8 million in the new financial year. This is $1.8 million more than the $5.9 
<br/>million given in the current financial year. These highlights the significant work required to:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve museum activities so that our stories are told over and over again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Promote the heritage of our people.  
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Support the development of artists, our artisans and creative arts stakeholders.  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Address the urgency to include culture in our national curriculum so that our children can 
<br/>learn and appreciate our history, our art, our traditions, our indigenous knowledge systems 
<br/>and the many others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Establish a data and statistics collection tool to ensure that culture sector contribution to our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic and national development is addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget for the new financial year 2024-2025 for culture covers a wider 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>range of issues that is beneficial to our key stakeholders and critical to improve the sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Grants to our national cultural agencies increased by $80,000 to $100,000, which will boost 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  implementation  of  our  National  Cultural  Policy  is  a  priority  for  the  Department  of 
<br/>Culture.  Government is setting aside $350,000 for this work and the development of other cultural 
<br/>frameworks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, $50,000 will help in a feasibility study to be undertaken 
<br/>to plan for a National Culture and Arts Awards. The award will be a first step to recognising our 
<br/>cultural stakeholders and show gratitude for their contribution to the sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department  of  Culture  will  pilot  in  four  Provincial  Council  Offices  the  inclusion  of 
<br/>Cultural Project Officers to carry out work of the cultural agencies at the provincial level, so that our 
<br/>services reach villages. This is a first in our history and a total of $120,000 has been set aside for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  allocation  of  $80,000  has  been  put  aside  for  review  of  the  cultural 
<br/>agencies structure and legislations, to ensure that our aging cultural institutions become relevant to 
<br/>this day and  
<br/>age.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A new grant scheme, known as "Creative Art Scheme", will be rolled out to provide financial 
<br/></span><span>assistance for our artists, artisans and curators so that they can develop their skills and talent. A total 
<br/></span><span>of $50,000 has been allocated for this activity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is allocating $3.2 million for capital works in the culture sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and this includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>$1 million set aside for the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts to support property 
<br/>owners in Levuka Town, whose houses and buildings have suffered greatly over the years 
<br/>due to disasters and climate change and is falling apart. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>A separate $500,000 is allocated to the National Trust of Fiji to complete the furnishing of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the newly renovated Levuka Community Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>A further $1 million has been set aside for the Fiji Arts Council to begin repair works on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the newly established National Art Gallery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Fiji Museum has been allocated $700,000 to look into the relocation of its collections 
<br/>so that it can make way for the building of a new storage building that will also house a 
<br/>research facility, a library, archives and a laboratory.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>working hard to ensure that assistance will reach other heritage sites that feature on the island. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our budget is a good budget as it supports the bigger work that the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs is doing to promote the socialising of the Fiji National Action Plan for the United 
<br/>Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and Fiji National Action Plan 
<br/>for International Decade of Indigenous Languages (IDIL).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also look forward to seeing all Fijians celebrate their cultures and traditions, show respect 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for one another, achieve economic success, social unity and meaningful co-existence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will end by saying that culture is an important component of development, and we must 
<br/>rally our support for our cultural institutions so that they can continue to showcase our unique identity 
<br/>and traditions to the world. </span><span>

<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, and those who are viewing this telecast live 
<br/>from the comfort of their home or their office this afternoon; a very good afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  also  acknowledge  those  Health  Officials  who  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>serving our people diligently all over Fiji.  </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  this  opportunity  to  address  Parliament  and  my  fellow 
<br/>members.  I also extend thanks to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  for  presenting  his  second  National 
<br/>Budget for the Coalition Government on Friday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  also  allow  me  this  opportunity  to  thank  you  most  sincerely,  for 
<br/>exercising  wisdom  and  maturity,  after  receiving  the  termination  letter  of  the  G-16+1  Group,  all 
<br/>former  FijiFirst  Members  of  Parliament  on  30</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  2024.    Thank  you  most  sincerely,  Sir,  for 
<br/>dealing with the matter professionally.  Since then, there has been a lot moving parts, both on this 
<br/>side and also on the other side of Parliament.  You gave us hope in our hopeless situation.  </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/>saka vakalevu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same breath,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also acknowledge and thank the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister.  Sir, thank you for taking out your rest time, to come over and meet with some of us 
<br/></span><span>in  the  last  weekend.    Sir,  I  thank  you  and  personally  appreciate  your  wise  counsel,  sharing  your 
<br/>experience and advice with us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly and not the least,  I also want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for 
<br/>keeping us intact during those dark moments.  As a new Member of Parliament, I am still learning, 
<br/>and I thank the God Almighty for His Grace and comfort in those turbulent times.  It resonates the 
<br/></span><span>Bible</span><span> verse in Romans 8:28: where Apostle Paul wrote, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are called according to His purpose.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to speak on Health and Medical Services.  In my response 
<br/>to the 2024-2025 Budget, it is crucial that I emphasise the importance of health in our nation, Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget themed, "</span><span>Economically Stable, Secure and Sustainable Fiji</span><span>",</span><span> </span><span>does cover various 
<br/>sectors, but it is worth noting that this security and sustainable growth starts with a healthy Fijian 
<br/>population</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investment in primary healthcare highlighted in the 2024-2025 fiscal year 
<br/>is, indeed, a commendable and pivotal step towards building a robust and efficient healthcare service 
<br/>in Fiji. I say that with respect that in the health sector, the goal post keep moving.  Therefore, as we 
<br/>try to address issues of today, new ailments could rock up to our shores tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1995,</span><span> </span><span>the Pacific Health Ministers declared the Healthy Island vision in 
<br/>the </span><span>Yanuca Island Declaration</span><span>. The Healthy Islands concept is envisioned as a place where children 
<br/>are nurtured in body and mind, it promotes an environment for learning and leisure, where people 
<br/>work  and  age  with  dignity,  where  ecological  balance  is  a  source  of  pride  and  the  ocean,  which 
<br/>sustains and protects us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Healthy  Islands  concept</span><span> </span><span>is  a  comprehensive and  integrated  approach  to  health  and 
<br/>wellbeing, first envisioned in 1995 during the Pacific Health Ministers Meeting on Yanuca Island, 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the concept involves continuously identifying and resolving priority issues 
<br/>related to health, health infrastructure development, and the wellbeing of all Fijians. This will be 
<br/>through  advocacy,  facilitation,  and  enabling  partnership  among  communities, 
<br/>achieved 
<br/>organisations and agencies at local, national and regional levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The approach encourages community participation and ownership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, aiming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to create environments that support healthy lifestyles and sustainable development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Primary Health Care (PHC)</span><span> </span><span>is a cornerstone of the Healthy Islands concept.  It focuses on 
<br/>providing a comprehensive, accessible, community-based healthcare that meets the health demands 
<br/>of individuals throughout their lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Primary healthcare is the first point of contact with healthcare professionals and is also the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>foundation in maintaining overall health society, communities and a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In prioritising primary healthcare, the Ministry is taking integral steps to improve our general 
<br/>quality of life, prevent disease and manage health conditions at an early stage. This preventative 
<br/></span><span>approach  can  help  decrease  hospital  re-admissions  and  eventually,  lower  healthcare  costs  over 
<br/></span><span>time.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investments in capital and infrastructure developments are crucial in improving the quality 
<br/>of  access  to  health  services,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  This  could  include  building  new  health  facilities, 
<br/>upgrading existing ones, equipping health centres with adequate medical equipment, medicines, and 
<br/>also compassionate health staff to look after the patient.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  same  time,  enhancing  technological  capabilities  for  better  inventory  and  patient 
<br/></span><span>management.  Collectively,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  investments  should  greatly benefit  the  Fijian 
<br/></span><span>healthcare system, making it more efficient, more inclusive and sustainable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  cannot  ignore  the  efficient  allocation  of  resources  and  meticulous 
<br/>implementation  of  policies  is  a  key  factor  for  a  tangible  benefit.   Transparent  monitoring  and 
<br/>evaluation processes must be set up in the Ministry to ensure that resources are being used as intended 
<br/>and yielding a desired outcome.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1137 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  Government's  budget  for  the  health  sector  in  Fiji  for  the  fiscal  year  2024-2025 
<br/>presents  some  promising  elements,  as  a  representative  of  the  Opposition,  I  cannot  overlook  the 
<br/>glaring deficiencies and inconsistencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  the  Public-Private  Partnership  driving  the  $90  million  funding  to  Ba  and  Lautoka 
<br/>Aspen Medical Hospitals must be scrutinised further. The role of private players in Aspen Medical 
<br/>in managing the public health resources raises concern about equity in access and affordability of 
<br/>care.  While the patient satisfaction mostly excellent customer service, to a state of the art secondary 
<br/>and tertiary level healthcare are being enjoyed by the people of Lautoka and Ba, the remaining paper 
<br/>works in this business dealing must be completed.  It is the Coalition Government’s responsibility to 
<br/>do it for us, and also provide transparency to the taxpayers and the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker sir, I declare my interest in the Free Healthcare Scheme under the General and 
<br/>Dental Practitioner initiative. These private dental practitioners play a crucial role in improving the 
<br/>oral health of all Fijians:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)   Accessibility  and  Availability:  These  clinics  are  flexible  hours  compared  to  public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clinics, making it easier for patients to get timely care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)   Range  of  Services:  They  offer  a  wider  range  of treatments,  including  advanced 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>procedures that might not be available in public clinics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)   Quality of Care: Private practitioners often have access to the latest dental technologies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and materials, which can lead to better treatment outcomes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)   Preventive  Care:  They  emphasize  preventive  care, such  as  regular  check-ups  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cleanings, which helps in early detection and management of dental issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)   Patient Education: Private dentists often spend more time educating patients about oral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hygiene practices, which can lead to better long-term oral health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(f)   Overall, private dental practitioners enhance the quality and accessibility of dental care, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributing significantly to the oral health of Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call on the honourable Prime Minister and the Coalition Government to 
<br/>expand these services to the Northern, Eastern and Western Divisions. Now, despite the expression 
<br/>of  interest  by  my  dental  colleagues,  the Ministry  of  Finance  has  been  very  ineffective  with  their 
<br/>communications. It is a great programme that relieves the burden on our public health sector, reduces 
<br/>waiting time, and better quality of service provided to vulnerable Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore Mr. Speaker, although the Ministry's overall capital expenditure has decreased, 
<br/></span><span>we should be cautious and be responsible with our dwindling resources. The $2.3 million decrease 
<br/></span><span>in funds for bio-medical equipment. Cutting corners on essential biological and technical resources 
<br/>is not advisable, especially when the supply chain remain a challenge globally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In moving on Mr. Speaker, Sir, a decrease of $400,000 for the upgrade of Sub-Divisional 
<br/>Hospitals, Health Centres and Nursing Stations and a cut by another $400,000 on dental equipment 
<br/>purchases is equally concerning. These reductions may lead to  compromised delivery of essential 
<br/>healthcare services to our Fijian population.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving further, the funding of $1 million for ICT infrastructure and network, a slight increase 
<br/></span><span>from the previous year, still appears a worthless sum given the rapid medical advancement of our 
<br/>time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning  to  the  SDG-related  budget  allocation,  again  the  commitment  towards  SDG3  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>creditable, however, preventative healthcare funding needs to be adequate and effective. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs) are a heavyweight challenge in Fiji 
<br/>health  system,  yet  the  allocated  budget  of  $350,000  for  NCD  prevention  and  control  seems 
<br/>disproportionately small, given the gravity of NCDs in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, the Budget does not reflect the urgency of mental health issues currently plaguing our 
<br/>communities.  This glaring omission fails to factor in the skyrocketing mental health issues and their 
<br/>profound impact on individuals and families.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a positive note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my view, the health care budget for the Fiscal Year 
<br/>2024-2025,  while  displaying  some  strong  needs  to  be  improved,  for  us  to  truly  move  towards  a 
<br/>healthier and a well- served Fijian, we need a budget that is equitable, efficient and forward looking, 
<br/>representing all Fijians, leaving no one behind.  We cannot afford to only favour urban over the rural, 
<br/>rich  over  the  poor  or  physical  health  over  mental  health;  all  aspects  must  be  catered  for  in  our 
<br/>collective pursuit for a healthier Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, all in all, the Ministry’s priorities and budget 
<br/>allocations  for  this  fiscal  year  shows  a  strong  commitment  to  building  a  robust,  sustainable  and 
<br/>accessible health care system for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the rise in salary for civil servants, which includes health workers, I hope that it will 
<br/>also change the attitude towards how they look after their patients. The focus on primary health care 
<br/>is  somewhat  appropriate  ensuring  disease  prevention,  better  health  outcome  and  emphasising  on 
<br/>infrastructure development, which will really help the health facility to better equip to deliver their 
<br/>service.  For years now, we have been focusing on NCDs in almost all of our previous national budget 
<br/>announcements, but we also need to ask ourselves, whether our efforts in dealing with NCDs are 
<br/>making an impact?  If not, what do we do about it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  summary,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  2024-2025 
<br/>Budget  responds  well  to  both  the  immediate  needs  for  infrastructure  and  health  service 
<br/>improvements, as well as the long term Sustainable Development Goals.  It showcases the balanced 
<br/>importance  of  investing  in  prevention  measures  as  well  as  in  treatment,  facilities  and  services.  
<br/>Despite the budget cutbacks in certain areas, this detailed budget plan indicates a strategic direction 
<br/>towards moving into the overall health care sector in Fiji for the fiscal year 2024-2025.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I resume my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to join my colleagues in congratulating 
<br/>the honourable Alitia Bainivalu, the Chairperson for the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for 
<br/>ascending to the portfolio of becoming the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry - a first 
<br/>female in the history.  </span><span>Sa vakanuinui vinaka</span><span>, Madam.  I also thank and welcome the Attorney-General 
<br/></span><span>and thank him for accepting the honourable Prime Minister’s invitation to be with us in this august 
<br/></span><span>Parliament.  I wish him well, Sir, in his tenure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament and fellow citizens, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.  I thank the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance, and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for 
<br/>the progressive, well-planned and well-articulated 2024-2025 Budget.  I will present my response to 
<br/>compliment  the  response  that  was  presented  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture  and 
<br/></span><span>Waterways earlier this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is aimed to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>protect our children, youth and elderly; 
<br/></span><span>enhance participartion and involvement of women and youth in the agriculture sector; 
<br/></span><span>reduce urban drift;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1139 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generate  environmentally  friendly  or  green  jobs  that  will</span><span> </span><span>support  Fiji's  overall  economic 
<br/>stability; and  
<br/>boost</span><span> </span><span>the agricultural sector’s</span><span> </span><span>contribution to</span><span> </span><span>Fiji’s economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocated budget is focussed on ensuring Food and Nutrition Security to 
<br/>all Fijians. The Ministry will continue to accelerate the process of transitioning smallholder farmers 
<br/>to a commercial level. The Ministry is committed to progressing the development and use of Good 
<br/>Agricultural Practices for semi commercial and commercial production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Resource Planning Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir, land is the foundation of agriculture 
<br/>development, and the Ministry appreciates the Land Resource Planning budget of $1.3 million, a 136 
<br/>percent increase from the current budget.  This Division will lead the planned review of ALTA with 
<br/>the Ministry of Lands and will continue to implement eco-friendly practices such as sustainable land 
<br/>management, climate-smart agriculture technology and farm management advisory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Crop Extension Division is allocated with $23.2 million, where $14.7 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million is designated for Capital Programmes and $6.8 million for Operational Expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mechanization plays a key role in increasing production, enabling farmers to achieve higher 
<br/>yields  efficiently  and  sustainably.  This  budget  includes  cushioning  the  cost  of  fertilizer  and 
<br/>weedicide, hiring of machines on an hourly basis and the purchase of machines for those who wish 
<br/>to own a tractor, digger, rice harvester or bulldozer. Furthermore, it also supports export promotion 
<br/>programmes such  as  </span><span>dalo, yaqona</span><span>, ginger, turmeric and coconut.  Consequently, in  this budget,  it 
<br/>supports activities that will add value to raw agricultural products such as processing of cassava into 
<br/>cassava flour, or cassava starch and other agricultural products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture Research, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Research Division is allocated with $12.7 million 
<br/>where $5.5 million is designated for Capital Programmes and $6.1 million for Operating Expenses. 
<br/>Research innovation is key to agricultural development. Funds will be distributed amongst 22 capital 
<br/>programmes such as providing quality seeds and planting material, pest and diseases control, genetic 
<br/>plant improvement, soil improvement and creating awareness and mitigation activities to reduce the 
<br/>severity  of  Kava  Die  Back  in  the  sector.  Furthermore,  to  improve  levels  of  efficiency,  research 
<br/>stations will be upgraded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Animal Health &amp; Production Division is allocated $21.1 million, where 
<br/>$15.4  million  designated  for  Capital  Programmes  and  $5.7  million  for  Operating  Expenses.  The 
<br/></span><span>funds will be distributed among the four geographical Divisions to aid in the advancement of our 
<br/></span><span>Extension and Research initiatives for the production of goats, beef, dairy, sheep, poultry, pigs and 
<br/>apiculture, as well as veterinary and regulatory programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Animal Disease Eradication and Control Programmes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ongoing 
<br/>programme to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis aims to control the two main zoonotic diseases 
<br/>that impacts cattle population in Fiji. The Ministry has made substantial progress in decreasing the 
<br/>prevalence  of  these  two  diseases  through  ongoing  testing.    A  budget  of  $1.6  million  has  been 
<br/>allocated for control of these two diseases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  Ministry  has  made  substantial  progress  in  decreasing  the  prevalence  of  these  two 
<br/>diseases through ongoing testing. A Budget of $1.6 million has been allocated for controlling these 
<br/>two diseases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue monitoring other diseases in Fiji and provide the required services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to minimise losses of production from pests and diseases.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For diary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2023 nearly $90 million in dairy products were imported for 
<br/>local consumption. To help the local dairy industry, $4.5 million has been allocated to support dairy 
<br/>farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Co-operative  Dairy  Company  Limited  (FCDCL)  has  been  allocated  a  sum  of  $4 
<br/>million. This will enable FCDCL to offer milk price incentives, raw milk cartage subsidy, livestock 
<br/>feed subsidy, develop  farm infrastructure, capacity  building  and hire of veterinary  consultant and 
<br/>dairy advisory officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the financial year, a favourable result was noted due to the rise in budget allocation to 
<br/>FCDCL. The total amount of milk supplied in the formal sector has resulted in a 10 percent increase 
<br/>in the third quarter of 2023-2024 financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Dairy Extension Programme assistance will include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span> provision of dairy sheds; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span> improvement to farm roads; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>training for aspiring dairy farmers at the Navuso Agriculture Technical Institute.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stray  Animal  Control  Campaign,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  continuously  receive 
<br/>complaints  on  stray  animals  including  cattle,  horses,  goats  and  sheep  for  causing  considerable 
<br/>damage to crop farms, disrupting traffic and increasing the risk of vehicle accidents.  Sir, between 
<br/>January and June of this year, a total of 410 animals have been captured. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also raise in this Parliament that stray dogs control has been a 
<br/>major component of this budgeted allocation.  I say this because the growth of sheep and the goat 
<br/>industry had been limited by the severity of dog attacks on farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Waterways, we have a number of programmes that been funded by the Waterways Division. 
<br/>We have a total $23.3 million and $16.6 million designated for Capital Programmes and $3.5 million 
<br/>for Operating Expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their programmes include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Watershed Management, Land Drainage and Flood Protection; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Coastal Erosion Protection;  
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage for Farmland/Rural Residential Programme; and  
<br/></span><span>Irrigation Support Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to conclude, this Budget supports MDGs, it supports sustainability of land and 
<br/>food  systems,  and  it  supports  food  and  nutrition  security  and  it  generates  income.    his  Budget  is 
<br/>relevant  and  timely.  It  will  offer  assistance  to  our  rural  population  who  are  in  urgent  need  and 
<br/>solutions for their current challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  I  urge  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  to  join  me  in  supporting  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, from  the leaf of the story of Joseph when 
<br/>his brothers finally realised that he was second in command in the land of Egypt at the time of famine, 
<br/>they were ashamed to face him. Joseph stood upright and said to them, “what you meant for evil, 
<br/>God meant it for good.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the land, one river, one bus, one people, I stand before you to give my Budget Response 
<br/>for the 2024-2025 Budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity in allowing me to express 
<br/>my view and be the voice of the people of Northland, Tailevu; Nakorotubu, Nalawa and Saivou, in 
<br/>Ra.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight a few critical issues that the people I represent wish to 
<br/>highlight  in  this  august Parliament.    Mr.  Speaker,  the  coastal  road  from  Nakorotubu  in  Ra  needs 
<br/>serious attention. This is in particular the stretch from Mataso to Naocobau. I hope the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and  Transport  has  sufficient  funding  in  this 
<br/>Budget to fix this road, just like the roads around Tailevu South and the </span><span>Bucabuca</span><span> of Burebasaga. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I am on the need on roads to be fixed and upgraded, I wish to highlight 
<br/>a related issue of poor bus service.  Sir, this is a very, very poor bus service. Bus operators have buses 
<br/>coming very early in morning and returning very late at night to the constituency that I have visited. 
<br/>I hope that the Minister for Finance this time around is innovative and would relieve the bus operators 
<br/>from overhead costs which the services can be frequent, particularly for the people along the coast 
<br/>of Nakorotubu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request the honourable Minister to take the time off and drive down to 
<br/>Veidrala  Village  in  the  </span><span>Tikina</span><span>  of  Nakorotubu  and  witness  for  himself  that  this  these  roads  need 
<br/>serious upgrading.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the honourable Prime Minister if he can direct the Minister responsible, 
<br/></span><span>to extend the EFL power grid for the people in Namarai Village to Nadavacia Village in Nakorotubu, 
<br/></span><span>Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a dramatic shift  of mindset  with  our farmers.   If farmers  can be 
<br/>assisted with heavy farming machinery, such as a digger to assist them in cultivating their land and 
<br/>make that big shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  the 
<br/>provision of remembering the decades cry of the workers from our Mines in Vatukoula. As a Member 
<br/></span><span>of  Parliament  who  is  making  a  plea  in  this  august  Parliament,  I  hope  that  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister is listening to all that I have said in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the increased allocation for our youth, particularly at a time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when we are being challenged with lots of youth-related issues.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 2024-2025 Budget, however, if the issues I have raised earlier 
<br/>could be addressed accordingly, that would surely be an excellent compliment to this contribution of 
<br/>mine. </span><span>Qaqa saka tiko na veiliutaki ena vanua</span><span> </span><span>o Navatu</span><span>.  May God bless Fiji.

<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, Members of this august Parliament; I fully support the 2024-2025 Budget because 
<br/>of what it reflects - the stability, security and sustainability of our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Justice is entrusted with the oversight of the administration of justice.  The 
<br/>Budget utilisation for the Ministry for 2023-2024 is 85 percent. The Coalition Government, again, 
<br/>has demonstrated its long term commitment for the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say this Mr. Speaker, Sir, in what is reflected in the Budget in terms of resolving one of the 
<br/>longstanding strikes of 33 years to the people of Vatukoula.  I joined the Civil Service in 1991 at the 
<br/>time of the strike and to see the gratitude and appreciation expressed by the Vatukoula community, 
<br/>it touches my heart, and I am sure it touches every heart.  I only wonder if the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>had a heart similar to that of the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I also applaud the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  and  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government  in  terms  of  resolving  or  caring  for  its  civil  servants  by  addressing  one  of  the  long 
<br/>pending issues in terms of pay increase for our civil servants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service week, we pledge the people of Fiji that we value their 
<br/>work and we will continue to do so.  Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for the Programme last 
<br/>week, particularly in hosting the Permanent Secretaries on Friday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I can see the Budget support rendered to our roads in the rural areas and outer islands which 
<br/>enables the  accessibility of our people.  The island of Ovalau,  Koro  and  Gau eargerly awaits the 
<br/></span><span>opening of the Public Works Department in Levuka in terms of improving road infrastructure long 
<br/></span><span>forgotten by the de-registered FijiFirst Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration in terms of the 
<br/>National Narcotics Strategy.  The Ministry of Justice will work closely and lend its support to the 
<br/>work of the Narcotics Bureau and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that the future generations of 
<br/>Fiji are safe from the scourge of drug trade and drug abuse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Justice plays a pivotal role in delivering its essential services 
<br/></span><span>through  its  primary  Legal  Registries  that  manages  document  registration,  official  records 
<br/></span><span>maintenance  and  legal  documentation.    Key  responsibilities  include  overseeing  the  Registrar  of 
<br/>Titles, Registrar of Companies, Birth, Deaths and Marriages Office (OBDM), Official Receiver’s 
<br/>Office and the Administration of Justice of Peace Services.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Justice has undertaken significant changes 
<br/>with strong focus on enhancing operational processes.  The Corporate Team has been encouraged to 
<br/>adopt the process of continuous improvement, emphasising the following models: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Identify opportunities, recognising areas within their work and methodologies that can be 
<br/>enhanced and streamlined. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation - execute the plan improvements in a structured and systematic manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Planning - devote strategies and action plan to implement improvements effectively. 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Evaluation - to assess the outcomes and impact of the implemented changes, 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Adjust - make necessary adjustments based on evaluation feedback for further refined and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>optimised processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These modules of continuous improvement encourage ongoing refinement and innovation in 
<br/>work methodologies, aiming to achieve greater efficiency, effectiveness and quality in the corporate 
<br/>team operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key initiative currently underway is the development of a strategic development plan for 
<br/>the next five years.  This plan aims to systematically improve the Ministry’s effective functionality 
<br/>and efficiency ensuring better service delivery and overall effectiveness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative ensures that all Divisions in the ministry are focused on the 
<br/>Coalition Government initiatives of ease of business and in line with the National Development Plan 
<br/>(NDP).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Justice has been allocated a total budget of $6 million for 
<br/>the fiscal year 2024-2025. This allocation underscores the significant commitment to upholding the 
<br/>rule  of  law,  the  reinforcing  of  foundation  aspects  of  the  nation’s  legal  framework.    This  is  a 
<br/>transformative leap in a commitment to reinforcing justice, improving service delivery and ensuring 
<br/>prevalence of the rule of law nationwide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notably, our operational budget has surged from the $4 million to $5 million, reflecting an 
<br/>increase  of  $1,043,000  million.    This  heightened  funding  underscores  the  strategic  priorities  and 
<br/>unwavering support to tackle enduring challenge within our justice system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  digitalisation,  we  acknowledge  the  critical  need  for 
<br/>modernisation.  We have allocated $100,000 towards the digitalisation project.  This initiative aims 
<br/></span><span>to streamline operations and improve service delivery through adoption of digital technologies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  initiated  the  groundwork  for  the  digitalisation  of  Registrar  of  Titles, 
<br/>supported by technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and guided by a scoping 
<br/>consultant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  addressing  the  challenges  posed  by  money  laundering  and  terrorist 
<br/>financing is critical due to their complex and evolving nature.  Criminal organisations exploit the 
<br/>vulnerabilities of the financial system, posing risks to both economic stability and societal wellbeing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To counteract this, we are making a strategic investment in the Asia Pacific Group (APG) 
<br/>Money  Laundering  Subscription.    Our  commitment  extends  to  the  strengthening  and  regulatory 
<br/>framework, ensuring rigorous oversight compliance with international standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation of recommendations from the Financial Action Taskforce is pivotal in 
<br/>enhancing  transparency  and  accountability  across  financial  transactions.    The  APG  provides

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>additional  technical  assistance,  aimed  at  improving  our  non-profit  sector  through  risks  based 
<br/>approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving forward, we remain dedicated to collaboration with international 
<br/>partners and organisations to bolster our technical capabilities in detecting and preventing money 
<br/>laundering and terrorist financing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public awareness plays a pivotal role in combating these illicit activities.  To this end, we will 
<br/>launch educational campaigns and the increasing awareness amongst citizens, businesses, non-profit 
<br/>organisations  about  their  crucial  roles  and  responsibilities  in  preventing  money  laundering  and 
<br/>terrorist financing   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  inform  this  august  Parliament  that  various  initiatives  are  undertaken  by  the  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service. The Coalition Government has taken a positive approach in rehabilitation of our 
<br/>sons, daughters, uncles, aunties and grandparents cared for by the Fiji Corrections Service as reflected 
<br/>in the increase in 2024-2025 Budget of $57.8 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service intends to empower staff by creating an environment where staff 
<br/>may  participate  in  the  decision-making  process.    To  achieve  this,  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service 
<br/>deliberately and intentionally adopted a democratic decision-making process by having a Board and 
<br/>Committees  to  deliberate  and  discuss  pertinent  issues  affecting  the  operation  of  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service.    Members  of  this  Board  are  drawn  from  the  staff,  however,  the  recommendation  of  the 
<br/>Committee and Board will require the endorsement of Commissioner before implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  undertake  other  initiatives,  such  as  the 
<br/>establishment  of  the  Fiji  Parole  Board,  review  of  the  commercialisation  Prison  Enterprise,  the 
<br/>digitalisation of prisoners and staff records, the review of the Rehabilitation Framework, particularly 
<br/>Yellow Ribbon, and staff training and resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Elections Office budget of $7.4 million is provided for the operations of the Fijian 
<br/>Elections Office for the next financial year.  This office is responsible for the independent preparation 
<br/>and conduct of national elections of Parliament every four years and other elections assigned under 
<br/>the law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral Commission constitutes as an independent non-partisan authority that has the 
<br/>responsibility of the registration of voters and the conduct of a free and fair election in accordance 
<br/></span><span>with  the  written  laws  governing  elections  in  Fiji.    I  acknowledge  them  for  their  hard  work  and 
<br/></span><span>sacrifice  to  ensure  our  electoral  laws,  administration  are  transparent,  efficient,  effective  and  truly 
<br/>represent the views of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  been  advised  that  the  Electoral  Commission  faces  a  lot  of  challenges  in  terms  of 
<br/>administrative support.  I understand that these challenges are the direct outcome of administration 
<br/>hangover  from  the  previous  government.    The  challenges  facing  them  is  unfortunate.  As  line 
<br/>Minister, it is my desire to resolve these challenges soon. If anything, the Electoral Commission and 
<br/>the Fijian Elections Office should and ought to work in tandem and complement each other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may conclude, this Budget underscores our unwavering commitment 
<br/>to build a justice system that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the needs of our citizens.  
<br/>Within this Budget, our job is clear.  We are committed to addressing the deficiency of our justice 
<br/>system.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are investing in personnel and enhancing our operational framework and restoring public 
<br/>trust. Together, the objective is to establish a justice system that is fair, efficient and accessible to 
<br/>all.  This ensures that every citizen can trust the rule of law and to protect their rights and uphold 
<br/>justice proactively.  Philippians 4:13 states and I quote, “I can do all this through Him who gives 
<br/>me strength.”. May God bless Fiji. I fully support the 2024-2025 Budget.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hononourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>members in the gallery and thousands of Fijians who have tuned in today; </span><span>ni sa bula, Salaam Alay 
<br/>Kum, Namaste</span><span> and a very good evening to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to provide my response to the 2024-2025 National Budget.  I would like to extend 
<br/>my sincere gratitude to the team from the Ministry of Finance led by the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, and 
<br/>various stakeholders for their hard work in compiling this Budget.  After a critical examination of 
<br/>this Budget, I have several recommendations in moving forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to begin with, the road fatalities in Fiji has been surging with 44 cases in 
<br/>2022, 78 cases in 2023 and 24 cases in 2024, and there is a great urgency to combat this issue.  One 
<br/>of the recommendations I have already discussed with the honourable Minister for Public Works, 
<br/>Meteorological  Services  and  Transport  as  well  is  the  need  for  more  speed  cameras  for  speed 
<br/>detection, mobile phone usage, seatbelt detection and red-light offences.  This will penalise those 
<br/>who commit these offences, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we also need to relook at how the new driver’s 
<br/>licence is being issued as well because we cannot afford to lose more lives on our roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Viria Water Project has kicked off and has stated by the honourable 
<br/>Minister, it will deliver up to 360 households as intended in part of Suva, so I hope in the future, we 
<br/>do not have water cuts experienced by areas and households in the Suva and Nausori corridor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  would  like  to  thank  honourable  Tuinaceva  and  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public 
<br/>Works,  Meteorological  Services  and  Transport  for  attending  an  urgent  issue  in  one  of  the 
<br/>settlements  in  Naitasiri  and  fixing  the  road  issue.    So,  thank  you  honourable  Minister  for  your 
<br/>prompt response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I turn my attention, to Local Government, we have the Naboro Landfill 
<br/>that receives up to 184 tonnes of waste per day and 80 percent is organic.  But there is currently no 
<br/></span><span>large  scale  processing  of  organic  waste  that  turns  into  organic  fertilizers.  So,  one  of  the  future 
<br/></span><span>recommendations is for Government to implement measures that ensures households to separate 
<br/>organic and non-organic waste, allocate budget for waste collection trucks and processing facilities 
<br/>that turn this organic matter into organic fertilizers which is shred and composted.  There is a process 
<br/>where it can be provided to our Fijian farmers to boost organic agriculture in Fiji, boost GDP and 
<br/>improve environmental sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year in this august Parliament, I asked the question, can the honourable 
<br/>Minister be the owner of a company that deals with the buying and selling of beche-de-mer?  Sir, 
<br/></span><span>today  we  see  a  change  in  the  ministerial  position,  and  I  would  like  to  congratulate,  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Bainivalu for her new position, actually deserving.  Congratulations, honourable Minister, for your 
<br/>new role.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my personal recommendation for the Ministry of Agriculture was $100 
<br/>million and I am glad to see an allocation of $101.2 million.  The personal goal for this country is 
<br/>to make agriculture the backbone of this nation by my retirement.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  turning  my  attention  to  climate  change,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the 
<br/>significant  process  that  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Climate  Change  has  made  in  the  last  six 
<br/>months.  I know from media articles that they have secured US$5.7 million from the Adaptation Fund 
<br/>for Nature Based Solutions. They have secured $295,000 for COP29 from the Adaptation Ambition 
<br/>Support Alliance and almost half a million have been secured from the Climate Technology Centre for 
<br/>the agriculture sector.  I would also like to share with this august Parliament that I am aware of a proposal 
<br/>designed for Fiji’s agriculture sector and I have been informed it is being led by FAO, and it is up to a 
<br/>US$44 million.  There is another oceans economy proposal in a similar value, led in partnership with 
<br/>WWF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must acknowledge the leadership of young and innovative thinkers who 
<br/>have hands-on technical  expertise to  do great  for our nation.  But,  while this good work is being 
<br/>noted, I am curious to learn why the Ministry is only given $500,000 for the implementation of the 
<br/>Climate Change Act.  The fact that this legislation will govern the work of the Ministry against the 
<br/>little funding allocated, is quite critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  turn  my  attention  to  the  grassroots,  there  are  over  200  informal 
<br/>settlements in Fiji.  We need to formalise settlements, we need to empower people out of the squatter 
<br/>settlements and we need to continue renewing leases and provide them with lands so they can build 
<br/>and cultivate their livelihoods.  Currently, $171.1 million is spent on social protection programmes, 
<br/>and majority of the recipients are from rural, marginalised and vulnerable communities.  When we 
<br/>give people their sense of ownership of land in terms of leasing land, they aspire to build their homes, 
<br/>they aspire to build a garage, they aspire to buy a vehicle, and this generates economic activity right 
<br/>at the grassroot level, and this is going to help our GDP in growing forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with  resourced landowners, landowners in  Fiji  are resource rich and we 
<br/>need to empower them to be financially rich and wealthy with an approach of providing them with 
<br/>equity  and  shares  and  have  a  seat  at  the  table  to  have  their  voices  heard  when  negotiating  with 
<br/>investors.    We  should  amend  laws  that  allow  the  Government  to  backup  and  acquire  resource 
<br/>development projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More than 50 percent of the projects economic benefit should flow to the people of Fiji, where 
<br/>it  is  landowners’  estate  and  locally  owned  industries.    We  should  get  majority  of  the  cash  flow 
<br/>because the resources are owned by us.  Honourable Prime Minister, I am calling for a transformative 
<br/>change in going forward.  As legislators, we need to convert assistance to initiatives of empowerment 
<br/>through such action for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I turn my attention to the Ministry of Education, the Back-to-School $200 
<br/>support per child, there has been some cases of funds being misused.  This needs monitoring and 
<br/>reporting of how the funds were used, because no child in this country should be left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a matter of drugs, our youngsters are exposed to drugs like methamphetamine, marijuana 
<br/>and cocaine.  There has been cases of violent and aggressive behaviour, students fighting in schools 
<br/>and at the bus stands, and there is a very worrying issue where a student has punched a school teacher.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to boost parental responsibility towards their children, to safeguard and 
<br/></span><span>promote the child’s health, education, development and welfare, and parents are requested to monitor 
<br/></span><span>the smart phones and social media usage by their kids.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parents need to be informed about their children’s whereabouts because if you do not, you 
<br/>will  make  the  front  pages  of  the  media  articles  with  your  name,  and  I  believe  that  is  quite 
<br/>embarrassing.  I urge the honourable Attorney-General to look at laws in the areas of children using

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>social media, securing our network, drug use and violent and aggressive behaviour in schools, and I 
<br/>urge the Government to restore discipline in our schools like it used to be in our times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to clear the air for the public, in terms of social media, there has been a 
<br/>fake profile using my name, my credentials, impersonating me, and is requesting people for trade 
<br/>and  it  is  basically  a  scam.    Despite  reporting  the  account  to  Facebook  several  times,  it  has  done 
<br/>nothing.  So, that goes to show how vulnerable we are to the platform of the virtual world.  I commend 
<br/>the  Budget  for  allocating  $2  million  to  the  Fiji  Counter  Narcotics  Bureau;  the  drug  problem  is 
<br/>everyone’s problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  TELS,  one  of  the  major  recommendations  from  the  students  was  to 
<br/>increase the students’ allowances.  Another surprise factor in the Budget was the allocation to Pacific 
<br/>Polytech from $1 million to $5 million, and that is raising a lot of questions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I like to turn my attention to my favourite Ministry, the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>now. 
<br/>I have urged the Government several times in Parliament to fulfil their hundred day promise 
<br/>to increase the National Minimum Wages to $5 and their promise have come after 24 months, well 
<br/>it will be April next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker.  Sir,  I  would  like  to  respond  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Productivity, 
<br/>Employment and Industrial Relations, I would like to tell him that the FijiFirst Government or the 
<br/>previous government had introduced the National Minimum Wages. He was in the union back then, 
<br/>he could have done it, but they did not do it. People are also waiting on the query on the ferris wheel 
<br/>incident.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the Government for the increment to civil servants’ wages; that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was truly deserving.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I like to turn my attention to the MSMEs.  Fiji’s growth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was projected to 
<br/>slow down by 3 percent in 2024 and by 2.7 in 2025 as stated by the ADB.  The honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Trade goes on to say that 18 percent of the GDP is contributed by 
<br/>MSMEs and he wants to take it up to 30 percent in the next five to ten years but the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister has a huge obstacle in his part and I did share it with him. His huge obstacle 
<br/>is the honourable Minister for Finance because the honourable Minister has gone and said that the 
<br/>businesses need to absorb the increment of wages and absorb the increment of VAT. A business will 
<br/>transfer the high taxation cost to its consumers, reduce hours of their staff and send some of their 
<br/></span><span>staff home and that is the reality on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of zero-rated items at 22 and in this Budget it was expected to go 
<br/>up to 30.  The honourable Finance Minister believes in raising taxes to get Government income. He 
<br/>has labelled the Government as a responsible one, VAT has increased from 9 percent to 15 percent, 
<br/>Corporate Tax is 25 percent.  Is this a responsible Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a reduction in threshold from $2,000 to $1,000 and 15 percent VAT is applicable.  Is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this a responsible Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a big Government. Everyone is a Minister and Assistant Minister  - huge operating 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expense.  Is this a responsible Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over 100,000 people have left Fiji; loss of human capital, there is brain-drain and this has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had profound impact on our economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Is this a responsible Government?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are taxing Non-Profit Organisations that look after the vulnerable, marginalised and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grassroot. Is this a responsible Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The so-called People’s Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, accepted submissions for the Budget 
<br/>but the honourable Minister for Finance did not go out to do a nationwide public budget consultation. 
<br/>He did not hear the voices of the public. Is this a responsible Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to understand Fiji’s GDP grew up to 20 percent in 2022. The 
<br/>Coalition Government was left in a very economically sound position, so why borrow more money 
<br/>when you have increased taxes?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, debt is up to $10.9 billion. Debt to GDP ratio is $77.8 million but the price 
<br/>of bread has gone up, VAT is imposed on butter, it is a bread and butter issue. Is this a responsible 
<br/>Government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the rest of the Coalition Ministers, SODELPA and PAP, for the next elections you will be 
<br/>defending his economic policies.  That is the truth, you will be defending his economic policies and 
<br/>you will be answerable to the people; deficit budget, increase debts, increase spending, borrow more, 
<br/>sit and hope and pray there is no natural disaster, irresponsible government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to ask serious questions to his Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ratification of issues is imperative because every issue in this country comes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at a cost and that cost is to Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are possibilities of reshuffle and change. As I know, the honourable Prime Minister has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a lot of options now and he is smiling away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why focus on paying the debt when you can focus on increasing the GDP, 
<br/>empower the grassroots, renew leases, formalise settlements and make agriculture and fisheries the 
<br/>primary backbone of this country. The goal is massive, the challenges are massive, and it rests upon 
<br/>our shoulders to take action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I started by political career under the FijiFirst banner with 1,705 votes as a 
<br/>newcomer. This was unexpected for me. I have nothing but respect for those who once graced this 
<br/></span><span>august Chambers and who are here today.  Fiji’s political landscape has gone through challenging 
<br/></span><span>times, but I assure the people of this nation and over voters to remain positive and hopeful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I serve as an independent Member for the best interest of this nation, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  No matter what Party you are from, you must be for Fiji and for every Fijian.  Yes, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we go forward in supporting the honourable Prime Minister in scrutinising where we 
<br/>need to as Members of Parliament, but we want the best for this nation.  We all hold the power to be 
<br/>a catalyst for the change we need, that is when we can call a stable, secure and sustainable Fiji, a Fiji 
<br/>for all.  God bless Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1149 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to make my contribution to the motion that is before Parliament 
<br/>which is the Debate on the 2024-2025 Annual Budget.  At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to take 
<br/>this time to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Planning and Development and his team at the Ministry of Finance for a very 
<br/>well-thought and well-articulated Budget.  On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to congratulate 
<br/>the honourable Graham Leung and honourable Alitia Bainivalu on their appointments as Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  in  this  upcoming  financial  year  has  been 
<br/>allocated a total of $21.4 million.  Out of the $21.4 million, the Department of Immigration has got 
<br/>the largest chunk of $14.9 million which is an increase compared to $8.7 million in the last fiscal 
<br/>year.  This is a reflection of the Government’s commitment to fostering a robust, efficient and fair 
<br/>immigration system to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I proceed, I also wish to commend the staff, the men and women of 
<br/>the Immigration Department for their work.  The Department manages the movement of people at 
<br/>our  borders,  its  key  function  of  sustaining  border  management  and  security  are  operationalised 
<br/>through  the  delivery  of  essential  immigration  services  including  issuing  visas  and  permits,  travel 
<br/>documents, citizenship and enforcing immigration laws and regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department will continue its work on the several critical initiatives in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the coming financial year and this includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Document management system; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Enhancing of document management and security of immigration related documents;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Outsourcing of immigration administrative services; and   
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Passenger information system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  will  continue  to  address  the  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations of the Growth Reset Sub-Committee on Immigration Investment, ensuring that our 
<br/>Immigration policies support economic growth and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  investment  and  infrastructure  and  technology,  the  Budget  allocates 
<br/>substantial resource towards state-of-the-art infrastructure which is crucial for ensuring the efficient 
<br/>processing of applications and the seamless movement of individuals across our borders.  Therefore, 
<br/>significant investments will be made in upgrading our Immigration offices, implementing advance 
<br/></span><span>technology systems and enhancing our border security measures. This modernisation Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, will not only expedite processing times but also ensure that our immigration system is resilient 
<br/>and responsive to challenges of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  enhanced  training  and  staffing,  to  complement  these  infrastructural 
<br/>improvements,  we  are  also  prioritising  the  training  and  staffing  of  our  immigration  services.  The 
<br/>Budget includes provisions for recruiting additional personnel and providing comprehensive training 
<br/>programmes and for this, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for Finance for the approval from 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance.  This initiative aims to equip our Immigration Officers with the skills and 
<br/></span><span>knowledge  required  to  handle  the  complexities  of  modern  immigration  issues  efficiently  and 
<br/></span><span>compassionately.  A well trained and adequately staffed immigration workforce is essential for  
<br/>maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of our Immigration system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on support for integration as settlement services, the Government recognises 
<br/>the  importance  of  integration  and  settlement  services.    The  Budget  allocates  funds  to  support 
<br/>programmes that assist new immigrants in adapting to life in our country.  These programmes will

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>focus on providing language training, employment assistance and cultural orientation ensuring that 
<br/>newcomers  can  integrate  successfully  and  contribute  positively  to  our  society.    We  believe  that 
<br/>investing in the successful integration of immigrants is an investment in the future prosperity and 
<br/>social cohesion of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on streamlining administrative processes.  In line with our commitment to 
<br/>efficiency  and transparency, the Budget includes measures to  streamline  administrative processes 
<br/>within the Immigration Department.  This involves the implementation of a standardised national 
<br/>outsourcing administrative service restructure applicable both domestically and internationally.  By 
<br/>standardising these fees, we aim to create a fair and transparent system that facilitates smoother and 
<br/>more  predictable  interactions  for  all  our  applicants  whether  they  are  seeking  visas,  residency  or 
<br/>citizenship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on enhanced border security, the safety and security of our borders remain 
<br/>a  top  priority.    The  Budget  provides  for  enhanced  border  and  security  measures  including  the 
<br/>deployment of advanced surveillance technologies and the strengthening of our border patrol units.  
<br/>These  efforts  are  crucial  in  safeguarding  our  nation  from  illegal  activities  while  ensuring  that 
<br/>legitimate travellers and immigrants are processed efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On addressing humanitarian needs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Immigration Policy must also reflect 
<br/>our humanitarian values.  On 20</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024, Fiji celebrated World Refugee Day; the first to be held 
<br/>in Fiji and the region. In collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
<br/>the Department has developed joint procedures for assessing refugee claims ensuring fairness and 
<br/>efficiency in our asylum process.  We eagerly anticipate endorsing the refugee status determination 
<br/>Standard  Operating  Procedures,  a  testament  to  our  collaborative  efforts  in  refining  operational 
<br/>frameworks for the benefit of refugees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR) 
<br/>kind support, we are steadily progressing towards the formulation of Fiji’s first ever Refugee Policy.  
<br/>We will continue to work closely with international organisations and partners to ensure that those 
<br/>fleeing  persecution  and  conflict  find  a  safe  haven  in  our  country  upholding  our  international 
<br/>obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  review  of  Immigration  legislation,  I  have  addressed  this  in 
<br/>Parliament,  the  review  of  our  Immigration  legislation  is  in  its  preliminary  stages.  We  extend  our 
<br/>gratitude to our donor partners; International Organisation of Migration for their technical support 
<br/></span><span>and assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some notable announcements in the Budget, and I wish to highlight some of these 
<br/>and I am very fortunate that it has been highlighted in the Budget.  Firstly, the $200 assistance Back-
<br/>to-School grant.  This has been well received in our communities.  I have been going across to some 
<br/>of the villages back in Vanua Levu, they have been well received as this has been really helpful to 
<br/>them in preparation for school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the continuous support from the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development with 
<br/></span><span>regards to Rural Housing.  The honourable Minister has announced it, and we are thankful for this as 
<br/></span><span>this has really helped our rural communities especially in our villages for those who are seeking rural 
<br/>housing assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this can also be a timely increase in salary and wages of our civil 
<br/>servants which I believe is well deserving.  This has been a much needed incentive given the work 
<br/>that the civil servants has provided to our country. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1151 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the energy and electricity sector, as announced by the 
<br/>honourable Minister, a sum of $3 million is welcomed for the implementation of solar home system 
<br/>and this is very welcomed in rural areas especially in the villages in Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  take  my  leave,  I  wish  to  say  that  the  budget  of  $14.9  million 
<br/>allocation  for  Immigration  in  2024-2025  is  a  testament  to  our  dedication  to  building  a  modern, 
<br/>efficient and compassionate immigration system.  By investing in infrastructure, staffing, integration 
<br/>services and security measures, we are laying the groundwork for a system that not only meets the 
<br/>needs of today but is also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us move forward with confidence, knowing that these investments will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthen our nation, enrich our communities and uphold the values that define us as a society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget and I thank you for your indulgence.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow 
<br/>citizens here in the gallery and those joining us from the comforts of their homes via livestreaming; 
<br/>I rise to contribute briefly on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 that is before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand here to thank you, Sir, for allowing me this opportunity to be able 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to represent my voters, once again, as an Independent Member of this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, too, would like to congratulate our new Attorney- General, honourable 
<br/>Leung, and our new Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, honourable Bainivalu, in taking up their 
<br/>new leadership role.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, I wish to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for his Budget Address.  Although, we 
<br/>do not see much change, but we thank his Ministry, the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his 
<br/>hardworking team, for the compilation of the 2024-2025 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  according  to  the Reserve Bank of Fiji's  Economic Review, dated April 
<br/>2024, the Fiji economy is projected to return to the growth trend following the strong post pandemic 
<br/>recovery in the last two years. According to RBF's latest Business Expectations Survey (BES) most 
<br/>businesses anticipate an improvement in general business conditions over the next six months to 
<br/></span><span>twelve months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  gone  past  challenging  times,  and  with  divine  power  and  past 
<br/>decisive leadership, we are able to reach this far.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is only proper that we look 
<br/>ahead and deal with situations before us. Dwelling on the past means reading the same chapter over 
<br/>and over again, while expecting the ending to change. Dwelling on the past is the biggest roadblock 
<br/>from moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the preparation of any budget, whether it be personal or a business budget, 
<br/></span><span>we are always interested in how much money we make, how much we spend and, most importantly, 
<br/></span><span>how much we save for any rainy day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  like  many  ordinary  citizens,  I  am  more  interested  in  the  total  revenue 
<br/>collection offset by the total Government Expenditures.  I noted that in the Fiscal Year 2022-2023, 
<br/>the actual Tax Revenue was $2.2 million, compared to the expected Tax revenue to be $3 million for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>1152 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Fiscal  Year  2023-2024.   I  believe  that  the  increase  in  tax  revenue  is  the  result  of  the 
<br/>implementation of the 6 percent VAT levied on goods and services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We continue to depend on direct and indirect taxes revenue.  Are there plans in the pipeline in 
<br/>finding other alternative sources of revenue for the economy? The Government must seriously look 
<br/>into this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the number of initiatives introduced by the Coalition Government, I 
<br/>wish to highlight a few of these initiatives introduced in the forthcoming financial year, that directly 
<br/>benefits ordinary citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the increase in the National Minimum Wage to $5 per hour in a two-
<br/>phase approach, I thank the Coalition Government for honouring one of their promises and that is, to 
<br/>increase the National Minimum Wage rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  inadequate  pay  increase  that  has  caused  public uproar, I  believe 
<br/>more work must be done in terms of consultation and awareness.  Sir, what many do not understand 
<br/>is that whenever there is an increase in the National Minimum Wage rate, Micro, Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises (MSMEs) are the very ones that will feel the pinch.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  way  forward  would  be  to  regroup  each  businesses  according  to  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>revenue streams and calculate a sectorial minimum wage rate for the respective sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Coalition Government for the continuation of the Back-to-
<br/>School support. With the disbursement of this financial support at the beginning of the 2025 academic 
<br/>year, it will, no doubt, assist families towards the preparation of the new academic year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  Coalition  Government  for  reaching  a 
<br/>resolution  and  allocating  $9.2  million  in  settlement  to  families  of  around  368  Vatukoula  Mine 
<br/>workers.  Although this would be an additional cost to taxpayers, I fully support this funding as it 
<br/>would bring major relief to the families of these workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, illicit drugs has become a growing cause of concern in Fiji. It is affecting 
<br/>our Fijian children and youth today. The whole community can be affected by the negative impacts 
<br/>associated with illicit drug use, such as an increase risk of harm to children and families, as well as 
<br/>violence, assault and crime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  speak  about  the  Fight  against  Drugs,  we  refer  to  the  various 
<br/>stakeholders  involved  in  this  fight. We  thank  the  Government  for  allocating  funding  for  the 
<br/>establishment of a Narcotics Bureau within the Ministry of Home Affairs. This will greatly assist in 
<br/>our fight against drugs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force is not alone on this fight. Every law-abiding citizen are 
<br/>addressing these issues to their families and communities.  The fight must begin at home. Parents 
<br/>must focus on their parental roles and responsibilities. If parents are God-fearing and firm with the 
<br/></span><span>nurturing of their children, there is no way these children would be influenced by peer pressure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  last  week,  schools  around  the  country  celebrated  the  International  Day 
<br/>against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (IDADAIT) with the theme, </span><span>"Be Responsible, Make the 
<br/>Right  Choice  and  Stay  Away  from  Drugs.”</span><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe,  children  and  youth  must 
<br/>constantly be reminded on the issue and its harmful effect on their lives.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1153 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we often overlooked one important group that has contributed tremendously 
<br/>to keeping our children and youth off the streets. They are involved with the spiritual development 
<br/>of children, youth and our communities, and I am referring to religious bodies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Churches and religious bodies must be commended in the work they do in nurturing and 
<br/>leading our children to a meaningful life. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government must look into 
<br/>assisting religious bodies in the form of grants to assist them in their spiritual growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noted that personal remittances have increased from $1.4 million in 2022 
<br/>and $1.2 million in 2023. To every Fijian working or residing overseas, thank you for your continuous 
<br/>support towards your families and friends back home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the significance of remittances to the Fijian economy has increased over the 
<br/>years, particularly as it supplements household incomes as well as a major and reliable source for 
<br/>foreign exchange.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we rebound strongly in 2022 and tourism earnings hit a new record of $2.3 
<br/>billion in 2023. We commend the amount of work the tourism industry and its stakeholders has done 
<br/>that has led to a 929,000 visitor arrivals last year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we extend our sincere gratitude 
<br/>to our national airline, hoteliers and other industry players, who have contributed in a way or another 
<br/>to achieving this. This is a positive sign for the economy in terms of increased domestic spending, 
<br/>employment opportunities and increased tax collections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I take comfort in Jeremiah 29:11, knowing that it is not a promise 
<br/>to immediately rescue us from hardship or suffering, but rather a promise that God has a plan for our 
<br/>lives and regardless of our current situation, He can work through it to prosper us and give us hope. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-Honourable  Members,  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  the  next  speaker,  the 
<br/>Assistant Minister for Education, I would just like to remind honourable Members that we are really 
<br/>up to time here in trying to have 25 speakers speak today. But there is only one, honourable Alvick 
<br/>Maharaj, who still has not made his speech because he is busy with his sick wife. But I have allowed 
<br/>for those who will be speaking tomorrow, if they are ready.  You cannot force them because it will 
<br/>be most unfair, but only one has agreed to speak now, and that is honourable Naisa Tuinaceva, who 
<br/>will be speaking after honourable Vanawalu has made his contribution.  That is the only change today 
<br/>and I thank you for bearing with us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet colleagues, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, and those joining in via livestream and those sitting in the public 
<br/>gallery; </span><span>miau sa bula re</span><span> and a very god evening to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before you today to express my wholehearted support for the 2024-
<br/>2025 Budget.   As articulated by the honourable  Minister for Education,  I stand here  as Assistant 
<br/>Minister for Education to reaffirm that this Budget appropriately reflects the vision of our Coalition 
<br/>Government, of ensuring access to quality education for all, as this is crucial for achieving SDG 4.  
<br/></span><span>This includes providing education that is inclusive, equitable and relevant to the needs of our learners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Coalition  Government  and  partner  organisations  have  invested  in  education  that  will 
<br/>ensure  that  we  progress  towards  our  SDG4.    This  includes  funding  teacher  training,  school 
<br/>infrastructure and education programmes.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will focus on several areas of the Ministry of Education on the 2024-2025 
<br/>Financial Year.  First is equitable access to education.  This means that we continue to ensure that 
<br/>our children have access to education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, we have 656 Rural Service Licence (RSL) providers, and for this year, we have 
<br/>provided them with an increase of $3.7 million.  In working with our stakeholders, we will ensure 
<br/>that during the review of our Transport Policy, we allocate transport assistance to our children in a 
<br/>manner that carefully considers the modes of transport used, the number of children in the locality, 
<br/>location of the school, type of school, the terrain and distance travelled by various students.  The 
<br/>Government  transport  assistance  is  to  assist  89,703  eligible  students,  and  it  is  to  supplement  and 
<br/>support our parents to ensure that our children are able to have access to schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Ministry  is  committed  to  promoting  lifelong  learning  and  this 
<br/>opportunity  should  be  made  available  to  individuals  of  all  ages  to  support  their  personal  and 
<br/>professional development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the new financial year, we are pleased to inform this august Parliament that the Tertiary 
<br/>Scholarship Loan Scheme Board has agreed to consider the request from the honourable Minister to 
<br/>allow repeaters for MBBS and Pilot Training.   The point of differentiation is that Year 13 repeaters 
<br/>will need to have higher marks than the first attempt Year 13 students.  Therefore, keeping fairness, 
<br/>the TSLS Board has made a decision for MBBS first attempt Year 13 students to have existing 340 
<br/>marks as a cut off mark, whereby, the repeaters ought to have 365 and in their first attempt, 250 plus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Pilot  Training Scholarship, first  attempt Year 13 students  to  have 310 as  their cut  off 
<br/>marks  and  the  repeaters  to  have  335  and  first  attempt  with  250  plus.  The  pass  in  Fiji 
<br/>Airways assessment is compulsory for Pilot Training scholarships, despite meeting the cut off mark. 
<br/>By  having  250  marks  in  the  first attempt  for  repeaters,  we  are  ensuring  that,  at  least,  less  risk 
<br/>repeaters are taking up these two most expensive programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Ministry  will  continue  to  support  teacher training  and  professional 
<br/>development. Teachers are at the forefront of providing quality education. The allocation of budgets 
<br/>for training opportunities for staff is through – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations &amp; Conferences - $90,000;  
<br/>Teacher Leadership Training - $50,000;  
<br/>Implementation of NAP - Gender Based Violence against Women and Girls - $50,000; and 
<br/></span><span>Special Education Training - $5,000; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Totalling $195,000, this means that we can train our staff in  areas of needs, including  ECE, SIE, 
<br/>TVET and knowledge-based training on contemporary issues within our various schools here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, additionally, the allocation of $26.9 million for salary increments for our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>teachers  and  non-teaching  staff  will motivate  our  people  to  remain  in  the  workforce,  feel  valued 
<br/>and appreciated, fundamentally treating them well through their salary that is essential to improving 
<br/>educational outcomes for our children who are future leaders of Fiji tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  address  inequality,  the Ministry must continue to work systematically 
<br/>and working as per our priority. We received our National Qualifications Registration in June 2024 
<br/>from the Higher Education Commission of Fiji.  This will ensure that we are providing programmes 
<br/>that are accredited and recognized by our Higher Education Institutions.

<div><span>education journey - from the Certificates in Vocational Schools through to higher education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The support for our TVET sector is acknowledged and we will continue to work in the coming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year to bolster our TVET in our various schools here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need to read and enhance reading is well supported by our new budget 
<br/>for the financial year. The Library allocation has increased from $890,000 to $1.3 million. We will 
<br/>be able to train more teachers, more librarians, and also strengthen our work with our Fiji Facility 
<br/>Programme on community spaces. That is the community halls used for studying in the evenings, as 
<br/>well as strengthening the libraries, beginning with our remote, rural and maritime schools which we 
<br/>are also working on it within our current budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also working on promoting technology and innovation in education. 
<br/>The  allocation  of  $500,000  for  the purchase  of  technical  equipment  for  our  Secondary  Schools 
<br/>is critical  to  improving  access  to  education  and  enhancing  learning  outcomes.  By  leveraging 
<br/>technology and innovation, progress towards SDG 4 can be accelerated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of $1 million for the Centre for iTaukei Studies (CIS) is one 
<br/>of a kind in Fiji. This was gratefully received by the University's Vice-Chancellor.  This allocation 
<br/>is a sign of Government’s confidence in the work of the CIS which most recently showcased our 
<br/>traditional canoe - the Drua, for its climate change and ecological crisis research in the villages of 
<br/>Viseisei, Lauwaki and Namoli. The next project for the CIS is to sail the Drua to other villages in 
<br/>Fiji to research climate change and ecological crises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to compliment the areas of need where there are no provisions in the new 
<br/>budget,  our  Ministry  stands together  as  one  to  seek  alternative  funding  from  existing bilateral 
<br/>partners and new partners to fund our major operational and capital expenditures. At this juncture, I 
<br/>acknowledge our Education Partners Group, our donor partners and technical partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2024  Education  Ministry  Budget  indicates  that  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government values education and our children remain as the priority of our beloved Fiji.  Through 
<br/>this Budget we assure you, Sir, this august Parliament and our fellow citizens that we will continue 
<br/>providing quality services so that our children receive the education that they genuinely deserve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the 2024-2025 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- I rise to give my contribution to the 2024-2025 National Budget 
<br/>Debate. At the outset, I want to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance,  Strategic  Planning  and  National  Development  and  Statistics  and  his  entire  team  on 
<br/>delivering the 2024-2025 National Budget.  I have decided to focus on the positives and then explore 
<br/>the shortfalls in this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Positives:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  and  foremost,  I  commend  the  Government  for  its 
<br/>decision  to  increase  the  National  Minimum  Wage.  The  move  is  an  economic  adjustment  and  a 
<br/></span><span>powerful statement of our commitment to reducing poverty and addressing the deep-seated income 
<br/></span><span>inequality plaguing our society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  increasing  civil  servants’  pay  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction.  We  are  laying  the 
<br/>groundwork for a more motivated and innovative Public Service by promoting fairness and equity in 
<br/>income distribution with other comparative employment sectors. This pay rise together with proper 
<br/>key performance indicators in place is expected to significantly improve service delivery.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  decades  of  waiting,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  368  Vatukoula  mine  workers  will  finally 
<br/>receive some form of strike settlement.  I understand there is no obligation from the Government to 
<br/>do that but at the end of the day, it is the people and their cries we need to listen to and try to assist. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget also wisely  addresses the critical issue of the skills gap.  By 
<br/>investing in skills development, we prepare our workforce for the demands of the modern economy, 
<br/>ensuring that our people are quipped to seize new opportunities and drive our nation forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recognising the sacrifices made by our disciplined forces, the Government 
<br/>has allocated a $12 million boost to Corrections Officers. This is an intelligent and necessary step 
<br/>especially as we face losing our trained personnel to overseas opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  the  $2  million  investment  in  establishing  the  Narcotics  Bureau  is  a  crucial 
<br/>response to our nation’s rising drug issues reflecting our commitment to safeguarding the health and 
<br/>security of our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while celebrating these positive steps, we must also critically examine the 
<br/>Budget  shortfalls.  One  of  the  most  glaring  issues  is  the  need  for  more  exploration  of  revenue 
<br/>opportunities.  In its pursuit of meeting Fijians immediate needs,  the Government has overlooked 
<br/>potential avenues to bolster its coffers sustainably. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am stating the obvious here, a high deficit budget, if not addressed can lead to long-term 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic instability and limit our ability to invest in future growth. It is a big spending Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Government relies heavily on increased revenue from VAT and 
<br/>taxes,  this  approach  forces  our  citizens  to  dig  deep  into  their  pockets,  straining  their  financial 
<br/>wellbeing.  This  funding  model  risks  alienating  our  people  and  fosters  an  environment  of  high 
<br/>inflation, introducing new price pressures that burden everyday life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As prices soar, the cost of living escalates, eroding disposable income and pushing many into 
<br/>financial distress.  Rather  than  alleviating  our  fiscal  challenges, this  strategy  diverts  revenue  from 
<br/>essential  public services,  causing  Government  debt  to  continue  its relentless  ascent.  We  must 
<br/>recognise  the  unsustainable nature  of  this  approach.  We  must  seek  alternative,  more equitable 
<br/>methods of generating revenue - alternative revenue that does not compromise our citizens' economic 
<br/>stability and welfare. The real solution lies in growing the economy and managing our debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, Fiji is a nation abundant in resources, with immense potential to harness the 
<br/></span><span>agricultural  sector for  exponential  growth  in  exports  and  revenue generation.  Our  fertile  land  and 
<br/>diverse climate positions us uniquely to tap into global markets, promising to bring billions of dollars 
<br/>in  revenue. The  opportunity  for  agriculture  import  substitution  is  particularly  promising.    For 
<br/>example,  allowing  us  to  reduce  reliance  on  imported  fresh  and  chilled  or  value-added crop  and 
<br/>livestock commodities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2022,  we  witnessed a  commendable  4.9  percent  increase  in  the  value  of  these exports, 
<br/>growing  from  $121.3  million  in  2021  to  $127.3 million  in  2022.  However,  despite  this  progress, 
<br/></span><span>the import value of fresh or chilled and value-added crop and livestock commodities surged to $1 
<br/></span><span>billion in 2022. This disparity underscores the urgent need to bolster our agricultural infrastructure, 
<br/>innovate farming practices and incentivise local production. By doing so, we can transform Fiji into 
<br/>a  powerhouse  of  agricultural  exports,  significantly  enhance  our  economic resilience,  and  create 
<br/>sustainable livelihoods for our people.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure  and  Transport, the  escalating  road  congestion  problem in  Fiji  demands  our 
<br/>urgent attention. A 2018 study by Pacific Wave titled "Fiji Traffic Woes" quoted a comment by a 
<br/>former Governor of Reserve Bank of Fiji who estimated the congestion cost at a staggering $400 
<br/>million  per  year. This  immense  financial  burden  arises  from  wasted  fuel due  to  engine  idling, 
<br/>frequent  braking  and  acceleration, increased  vehicle  wear  and  tear,  and  the  significant  loss  of 
<br/>productivity time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond the economic costs, the relentless traffic takes a severe mental and emotional toll on 
<br/>our drivers, causing undue stress and frustration.  Furthermore, the environmental impact is profound 
<br/>with heightened carbon monoxide emissions harming our atmosphere. Addressing this issue is not 
<br/>just about  easing  a traffic flow, it is  also  about  reclaiming precious  time, reducing environmental 
<br/>damage and enhancing the quality of life for every Fijian.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the urgent need for safe and smart roads in Fiji cannot be overstated. We 
<br/>are witnessing an alarming increase in roads needing proper markings, insufficient traffic signs and 
<br/>poorly executed pothole patching that leaves a hazardous, corrugated surface. These conditions are 
<br/>dangerous  for  motorists  and  cause significant  damage  to  vehicles,  leading  to  costly  repairs and  a 
<br/>heightened risk of accidents. The safe and smart roads are the lifeblood of our nation's infrastructure, 
<br/>essential for the smooth flow of commerce, Fijian's safety, and our communities' overall well-being.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  e-Ticketing  system,  introduced  with the  promise  of  modernising  our 
<br/>public transportation has instead imposed its severe financial strains on our bus operators. They are 
<br/>now losing around 15 percent to 25 percent of their income. It was implemented for the first time in 
<br/>Fiji nearly a decade ago, but the system was meant to streamline operations and improve efficiency. 
<br/>However, a crucial oversight was the failure to conduct a review two years post-implementation to 
<br/>address initial teething problems. As a result, we find ourselves almost 10 years later still grappling 
<br/>with  the  same  unresolved  issues  that  plagued  the  system  from  the  start.  An  urgent  review  and 
<br/>overhaul of the e-ticketing system is needed to rectify these longstanding issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  escalating  road  safety  crisis  in  our  nation  demands  immediate  and 
<br/>decisive  action,  while  we  have  a  drop  in  fatality,  we  are  still  confronted  with  dangerous  driving 
<br/>behaviours on our roads. Current fines for traffic violations have proven to be insufficient deterrents, 
<br/>failing to curb dangerous driving behaviours that put countless lives at risk everyday. To address this 
<br/>critical issue, we must impose steeper deterrent fines reflecting these offences’ gravity and signal our 
<br/>unwavering commitment to road safety.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need for increased investment in inter-island travel has never been more 
<br/></span><span>pressing. As inter-island travel continues to rise, we must prioritise the safety and efficiencies of our 
<br/>ferry  services.  Ensuring  the  safety  of  inter-island  ferries  is  paramount,  requiring  stringent  safety 
<br/>standards,  regular  maintenance,  and  thorough  inspections  to  protect  people's  lives.  Moreover,  we 
<br/>must establish a reliable timetable that meets the growing demand and supports our islands economic 
<br/>and  social  integration.  Additionally,  implementing  fair  and  controlled  boat  fares  is  essential  to 
<br/>prevent exploitation and ensure equitable growth across our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Pressing and Social Issues.  Mr. Speaker, the rise in homelessness, particularly among our 
<br/></span><span>minor population is a dire and heartbreaking issue that demands our immediate attention. How can 
<br/></span><span>we sleep comfortably  at night, especially during these  cold  nights,  knowing  that our  children  are 
<br/>sleeping under bridges and in Thurston Garden, exposed to the harsh elements and countless dangers? 
<br/>I  propose  the  establishment  of  a  dedicated  task  force  to  work  closely  with  parents,  families  and 
<br/>communities to detect early warning signs and behaviours that might lead children to run away from 
<br/>home and become homeless. Such a proactive approach can prevent many children from ending up 
<br/>on the streets.

<div><span>Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not forget our disabled or differently-abled community, a significant 
<br/>part of our nation with a population of around 114,000 across Fiji. It is disheartening to see that the 
<br/>Fiji National Council for Disabled Persons has been allocated a mere $550,000 which falls short of 
<br/>meeting their needs and supporting their inclusion and empowerment. This inadequate funding is a 
<br/>stark reminder of the neglect and marginalisation faced by our differently-abled citizens. We must 
<br/>commit to significantly increasing investment in programmes and services that enhance the quality 
<br/>of life, ensure accessibility and equal opportunities. By doing so, we affirm our dedication to a just 
<br/>and  inclusive  society  where  every  Fijian,  regardless  of  ability,  can  thrive  and  contribute  to  our 
<br/>nation's progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must dedicate more investment and support to the Police Force Sexual 
<br/>Offence and Child Abuse Unit and the Crime Stoppers Fiji Scholastic Programme. These units have 
<br/>consistently  highlighted  the  urgent  need  to  improve  parenting  and  address  children's  nurturing  at 
<br/>home  to  mitigate  the  criminal  issues  involving  youth  today,  ranging  from  drug  use  and  teenage 
<br/>pregnancies to crime and homelessness. By increasing our prevention strategies and dedicating more 
<br/>resources to these critical programmes, we can address the root causes of these problems rather than 
<br/>merely reacting to their consequences. Prevention is more effective, humane and cost-efficient in the 
<br/>long run.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, this Budget is just like any other budget is a step towards a better 
<br/>future for all Fijians.  It reflects our collective aspirations and acknowledges our people’s hardwork 
<br/>and dedication.  However, it is also a call to action for us to think creatively and act decisively to 
<br/>address its shortcomings. Doing so can ensure our programmes is not a temporary relief but a lasting 
<br/>foundation for prosperity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in saying that, I support the Budget.  It is yet to be tested, but I am sure the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  will  conduct  a  mid-term  review  to  ensure  its  alignment  and  ability  to 
<br/>effectively support its financial goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge your guidance, Sir, wisdom and leadership on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how this case regarding the 16 plus 1 of us on this side of Parliament was handled and resolved.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  that  brings  us  to  the  end  of  the  sitting  today.  
<br/>Tomorrow, we will continue with the rest in the Batting Order, there are about five or six left.  If  
<br/>honourable Maharaj decides to make his contribution, we are allowing him to make that contribution 
<br/>and if not, there will be five and at the tail-end the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/></span><span>for Finance will be invited to give his Right of Reply and maybe proceed to the next item which is 
<br/></span><span>the Committee of Supply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you  very  much  for  today,  thank  you  for all  your  contributions.   Parliament  is  now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>adjourned until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow.
