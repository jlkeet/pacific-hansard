<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery 
<br/>and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking interest in 
<br/>the workings of your Parliament.

<div><span>Honourable Members, today we are joined by the Year 10 students and teachers of Yat Sen 
<br/>Secondary School.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu, </span><span>welcome to your Parliament and I hope that the proceedings 
<br/></span><span>this  morning  will  give  you  some  idea  of  how  your  Parliament  works.    Parliament  relies  on  you 
<br/></span><span>children, we need more astute ladies to be here representing the people of our country in Parliament.  
<br/>So, you being here is not new, you have your former colleagues in here, some may be Members of 
<br/>Parliament, others are members of the Secretariat, those that run the affairs for the Parliamentarians 
<br/>in our Parliament.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu </span><span>for making the effort. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Uncorrected </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>- Delay 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, the Uncorrected </span><span>Hansard Report </span><span>for yesterday’s 
<br/></span><span>sitting will be circulated as soon as it is finalised.  You may be wondering, honourable Members, as 
<br/></span><span>for the $4.4 million upgrade in our IT, nothing like this will crop up again.  I was a bit taken this 
<br/>morning when informed this happened yesterday and was fixed by 5.00 p.m. yesterday.  I told them, 
<br/>“$4.4 million must be worth the investment,” otherwise it is just like the IT people, they are so far 
<br/>ahead, they communicate with people abroad, up in the air and everywhere, but for simple things like 
<br/>this when it suffers a glitch like that if I may borrow that word, then it makes us ponder again

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether is this worth the investment?  But I promise honourable Members that the Secretariat will 
<br/>really look into this seriously so as to ensure matters like this do not arise again.
