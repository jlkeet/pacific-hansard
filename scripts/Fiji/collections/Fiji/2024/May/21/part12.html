<div><span>Update on the Refurbishment of the Ba Mission Hospital 
<br/>(Question No. 55/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  inform 
<br/>Parliament on the progress of the refurbishment of the Ba Mission Hospital, for which a grant 
<br/>of $710,801 was allocated in the current financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question.  I 
<br/>would like to wish all students, including our students in the Chambers today, a very good first day 
<br/>at school for the second term, and I wish you all well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  administers 
<br/>services and programmes aimed at ensuring that senior citizens in Fiji are supported to live a life of 
<br/>dignity, and this includes providing care for the elderly residents at our three Golden Age Homes 
<br/>across the country located in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a brief background, the structural condition of the more than 80 years old Golden Age in 
<br/>Lautoka, has deteriorated significantly and is in urgent need of repair.  In light of the above it was 
<br/></span><span>decided that the Ba Mission Hospital be renovated to temporarily accommodate the residents and 
<br/></span><span>carers, while the Ministry renovates the age-old property. And to this end, a grant of $710,801 was 
<br/>allocated in this financial year for the renovation of the Ba Mission Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, and for the information of honourable Members, at the beginning of 
<br/>the financial year, the Ministry was advised by the Methodist Church of Fiji who are the owners of 
<br/>the Ba Mission Hospital, that there were alternate plans for the property.  So, due to time constraints 
<br/>and the urgency of the project, the Ministry with assistance of the Provincial Administrator (PA) in 
<br/>Ba,  worked  on  identifying  an  alternative  site.    Please,  note  we  have  explored  other  alternatives 
<br/></span><span>referred by the Board Chairperson of the Home and, unfortunately, those sites were neither available 
<br/></span><span>nor suitable for the residents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry, through PA Ba, now has managed to secure an alternative property, 
<br/>and will be moving the residents and carers to Matanakilagi House which is owned by Ba Provincial 
<br/>Holding Company Limited, and we would like to thank Ba Provincial Holding Company Limited for 
<br/>this partnership.  The Ministry has signed this letting agreement from 30</span><span>th</span><span> April this year.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Matanakilagi  House  needs  to  be  renovated  to  meet  the  needs  of 
<br/>accommodating our elderly. The renovation works will be undertaken by the Divisional Engineer 
<br/>West (DEW) under the Ministry of Public Works at a cost of $341,835.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  approved  the  diversion  of  the  fund  from  its  initial  intention, 
<br/>which is the renovation of the Ba Mission Hospital to the renovation of the Matanakilagi House.  At 
<br/>present, the Ministry awaits the request to incur expenditure under RIE for the release of funds to the 
<br/>Divisional Engineer West, who has advised that the refurbishment of Matanakilagi House will take 
<br/>about eight weeks. Once Matanakilagi House is refurbished, the residents and carers will then be 
<br/>moved to allow for works on the restructure of the current site to take place.  On that note, I would 
<br/>also like to confirm to this Parliament that consultations are also underway for the restructure of the 
<br/>Golden Age Home in Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I conclude my response, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and 
<br/>appreciation to the dedicated members of the Board of Visitors for the Golden Age Homes. Their 
<br/>unwavering  commitment  and  tireless  efforts  in  ensuring  the  wellbeing  and  care  of  our  elderly 
<br/>residents  do  not  go  unnoticed.    A  special  thanks  to  Mr.  Kanti  Punja,  Mr.  Abinesh  Chand,  Mrs. 
<br/>Rajneesh  Charan,  Mr.  Vinesh  Chandra,  Ms.  Yvonne  Lagilevu.  Mr.  Selwa  Nand,  Ms.  Shivali 
<br/>Kashyap, Mrs. Marica Rokovada Hallacy and Mr. Rajesh Patel, for their outstanding leadership and 
<br/>service.  Your invaluable contribution are truly commendable and have made a significant difference 
<br/>in the lives of our senior citizens. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to our Gold Age 
<br/>Homes.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the problem with this Government.  They have 
<br/>allocated the money for a particular task, year is about to end, and no action taken on the ground.  
<br/>But when the budget is read, it is made to sound it is so good, everything will happen according to 
<br/>the delivery, but we know the implementation of various things that were stated in the budget has not 
<br/>been realized. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have only 30 seconds left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Therefore, honourable Minister, you were saying that it will take eight 
<br/>weeks to complete.  Initially, we were told that people will be moving to St. Thomas, now some other 
<br/>place.  How sure are you that this project will be completed within this budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for 
<br/></span><span>those comments, but I do want to share some history on how the Golden Age Home in Lautoka was 
<br/></span><span>handled by the previous Government.  It is most unfortunate that at the time when I came in as the 
<br/>Minister, my predecessor had actually given the order for the elderly in the Golden Age Home in 
<br/>Lautoka because it was not inhabitable, to be moved to Labasa.  It became very impractical, and the 
<br/>dislocation or displacement of our elderly are to be close to their families, as well as the staff would 
<br/>need to be relocated and moved away from their own homes too in Lautoka to Labasa in Vanualevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, just to shed some light, these things take time and also to look for 
<br/>suitable locations, but it has to be in Lautoka, it has to be in the Ba Province so that families can 
<br/></span><span>continue to  visit  their family  members.  They need  assistance  - the medical  assistance as well  as 
<br/></span><span>emotional support. That is why it has taken time, and we are very grateful to the </span><span>vanua</span><span> and the people 
<br/>of Ba for letting us use the Matanakilagi House because it has to be fitted properly so that we can 
<br/>take care of our elderly residents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  here  is  about  the  process  of 
<br/>allocating funds.  In simple project management, there are cycles of project management - initiation, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>697 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation and then the close up.  My question to you is how and who is responsible in terms 
<br/>of doing the work in which Government has given the funds but there was no clear direction as to 
<br/>what will the funds be utilised for?  Allocation has been provided but preliminary work should have 
<br/>been satisfied before the allocation of funds to be given has not taken place. Who is responsible and 
<br/>why was this taken by the Ministry responsible? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/>As I had mentioned, when the allocation was made in the budget, we had already had an MOU with 
<br/>the Methodist Church of Fiji.  So, we had gone through the preliminary process to ensure that Ba 
<br/>Mission Hospital was suitable for the relocation.  So, we were counting on that relationship that had 
<br/>already  been  established  with  the  Methodist  Church.    But  it  is  most  unfortunate  that  they  have 
<br/>reneged  on  this  agreement  for  their  own  purposes.    They  have  other  plans  for  the  property,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, so we were literally left out in the cold to find another location. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not easy to find properties in that area or even in the province, especially when it comes 
<br/>to the needs of the elderly because they have to be fitted out specifically and this takes some works 
<br/>that are usually outside of the usual construction.  So, it took time to find an alternative location.  We 
<br/>scouted a few and then we were able to secure Matanakilagi House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we did go through the process when we applied 
<br/>for the funding in the last budget, based on that MOU and agreement with Ba Mission Hospital which 
<br/>also came to Cabinet.  Unfortunately, we had to deal with that situation, but we will certainly commit 
<br/>to our elderly in Lautoka that we will not relocate them to locations so far where they are away, like 
<br/>Labasa.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from the honourable Minister, 
<br/>given the original purpose for the funds been diverted to something else, in that process of awarding 
<br/>the funds, was a proper tender process utilised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  when  I  came  into  the  Ministry,  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussion with the Ba Mission Hospital was going back and forth with the previous Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, we were told that the Ba Mission Hospital was secured but then the Minister at that 
<br/>time felt and made the decision that they be relocated to Labasa, even though there was already that 
<br/>MOU in place with Ba Mission Hospital. So, coming into the Ministry, that was already in place. So, 
<br/>the process had already been done by the previous Government and my predecessor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision that was taken to move them to Labasa, in my opinion, was taken in haste, not 
<br/>considering the circumstances, as well as the emotional circumstances surrounding, even consulting 
<br/>our elderly as well as the staff.  As I have said, coming into it we were prepared to work with Ba 
<br/>Mission Hospital as we proceeded but within the number of months on that faith, we applied for the 
<br/>budget but as you know, what happened after that did not happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. - The tender process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.  –  On  the  relocation  to  Matanakilagi  House?  Yes,  it  is  currently 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>underway.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  question,  of  course,  on  the  relocation  to  Matanakilagi  House,  as  I  had  mentioned,  all 
<br/>project processes are being followed and you can ask that in the next budget, perhaps, if you have 
<br/>any issues.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Thank you. That is the last supplementary question, honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will move on to the second Oral Question for today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable Development Priorities 
<br/>(Question No. 56/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  update  Parliament  on  the  Whole  of 
<br/>Government approach in achieving the Sustainable Development Priorities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this question itself, perhaps, would require a broader Ministerial Statement 
<br/>but  very  briefly,  I  want  to  say  that  the  achievement  and  progress  towards  the  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals  (SDGs)  by  way  of  background,  when  we  started  with  the  Millenium 
<br/>Development Goals (MDGs) where there were eight goals focused on reducing poverty, providing 
<br/>housing, health and education, environmental sustainability in those 15 years and in anticipation of 
<br/>the end of the MDGs, the United Nations adopted the SDGs and, obviously, most countries including 
<br/>Fiji, signed the United Nations Agenda 2030 in 2015.  Of course, for any country, that itself is a 
<br/>Whole of Government  approach. No country  could  achieve the SDGs without  having  a whole of 
<br/>country approach.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SDGs,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, compared to  the MDGs are more ambitious.  They address  a 
<br/>much broader set of concerns and emphasises the links between global goals, national targets and 
<br/>national  agenda.  So,  as  part  of  the  Government’s  approach,  we  embrace  a  very  comprehensive 
<br/>approach  involving  the  entire  Government  and  the  inter-connected  economic,  social  and 
<br/>environmental pillars of the 2030 agenda necessitate collaboration between different  Government 
<br/>ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I could just very quickly lay out the different Ministries that are responsible as focal points 
<br/>to  coordinate  this  whole  of  Government  approach  would  provide  some  information  for  the 
<br/>honourable Members in Parliament with respect to how this is being done.  This was demonstrated 
<br/>in our most recent 2023 Voluntary National Review Report which was presented by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs at the United Nations.  That report was very well received. The 
<br/></span><span>focal points for each SDG (17 goals) as compared to 8 under the Millennium Development Goals.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>699 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11.</span><span> </span><span>SDG11  –  Sustainable  cities  and  communities  comes  under  Ministry  of Housing  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12.</span><span> </span><span>SDG12 – Responsible consumption and production comes under Ministry of Trade and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cooperatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13.</span><span> </span><span>SDG13 – Climate Action comes under the Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/>14.</span><span> </span><span>SDG14 – Life Below Water comes under the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry. 
<br/>15.</span><span> </span><span>SDG15 – Life on Land comes under the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry. 
<br/>16.</span><span> </span><span>SDG16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions comes under Ministry of Justice and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Office of the Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17.</span><span> </span><span>SDG17 – Partnership for the Goals comes under the Office of the Prime Minister and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in that way, in accordance with the national priorities, I will just also name 
<br/>a  few  ministries,  particularly,  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  is  actively 
<br/>involved in sporting programmes that have a goal of reducing poverty.  But again, reducing poverty, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  whole  of  government  approach.    That  is  a  focal  point  and  that  ministry’s 
<br/>mandate  is  to  work  with  all  the  other  ministries.    Then  we  have  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
<br/>Waterways, Ministry of Health, SDG13 – the importance of climate action.  Again, the importance 
<br/>of addressing SDG13 falls under the Office of the Prime Minister and that gives us a lot of synergy, 
<br/>influence and power to be able to promote SDG13 because it reflects the Coalition Government’s 
<br/>highest attention to SDG13. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are very pleased that some of the actions that we have taken over the last 17 months, not 
<br/>only  in  terms  of  accessing  climate  finance  and  looking  at  various  projects,  the  influence  and  the 
<br/>leadership of the Prime Minister has given different ministries a much better influence and leeway in 
<br/>terms of negotiating some of the broader project-based activities under different development goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Whole  of  the  Government  approach,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  emphasizes  the  collective 
<br/>contribution  of  all  the  stakeholders  in  achieving  the  SDGs.    I  could  provide  the  whole  list  of 
<br/>stakeholders that are engaged.  But let me also assure Parliament that the new National Development 
<br/>Plan will itself be a holistic approach to achieving the UN SDG Priorities and each sector of the new 
<br/>National Development Plan will align the Whole of Government commitment to the SDGs for future 
<br/>that is inclusive and prosperous and environmentally responsible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just in terms of the National Development Plan, the nationwide public consultation was held 
<br/>over  300  locations  around  the  nation  with  a  record  number  of  more  than  21,000  people  being 
<br/></span><span>consulted  who  had  the  opportunity  to  talk  about  the  plan,  exchange  their  ideas  and  the  depth  of 
<br/></span><span>analysis and collaborative nature of the Government ministries participation in the process, focussing 
<br/>on the SDGs has been quite defining.  We are very pleased, and I am sure when the final plan comes 
<br/>out,  it  will  also  support  this  idea  of  holistic  Government  approach  to  achieving  Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Thank    you  to  honourable  Professor  Biman  Prasad  for  his  speech.  
<br/>Honourable Minister, the UNDP just recently issued a report which we were all quite privy to.  This 
<br/>report basically said that the Pacific region and also the rest of the world was not on track to deliver 
<br/></span><span>any of the Sustainable  Development  Goals  by the targeted 2030. Now it  has been put to  2065  (I 
<br/></span><span>think).  Have you, honourable Minister to ensure that we are not only doing this so that we do comply 
<br/>but are we doing things at breakneck speed so that we are compliant bearing in mind also that there 
<br/>is a climate change perspective to this and climate change issues are at the forefront for all the Pacific 
<br/>Island countries.  I understand that there is a lot of stuff that needs to be attended to but what we want 
<br/>to know is, has this report been an integral part of your thinking....

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, sorry to be cutting you off the time has .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I had 15 seconds left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That is my question, I think he understands that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, I have not allowed that, the time for him to ask that question has 
<br/>lapsed. So, we will go on to the next one.  Any supplementary questions?  Please you abide by the 
<br/>time that we have set there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  good  that  we  have  the  framework  but 
<br/>implementation,  pragmatism  in  the  implementation  is  what  is  important.  I  have  served  in 
<br/>Committees.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do about that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  There  is  only  one  SDG  that  all  Government  ministries  sort  of 
<br/>concentrated on and that is SDG5.  My question is, the cross-cutting issues, particularly handling 
<br/>resilient cities, climate change, et cetera.  How is this being handled and how will you ensure that 
<br/>this trickles down to the very lowest level of implementation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years, did nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think that is pretty obvious, Mr. Speaker, that is understood 
<br/>that the implementation and bringing the cross-cutting issues together and putting it in a strategic 
<br/>framework so that all the different Government ministries are able to see where the focus is.  It is not 
<br/>always easy to do that but as I said, the National Development Plan is really cutting through different 
<br/>ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we said, the reason why we have 3-year, 5-year and 20-year Development Plans is because 
<br/>we think that there are some basics that needs to be done as quickly as possible and we are looking 
<br/>at three years.  Then there are things that immediately beyond basics may take five years or a little 
<br/>bit more. So that is how we are looking at implementation and I agree with the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, implementation in anything you do, any project, any plan is critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the point that honourable Koya was trying to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of not 
<br/>meeting the targets. That is pretty obvious, again, COVID-19, environmental exigencies, existential 
<br/>threats has disrupted the original UN Agenda in 2015 to actually achieve certain SDGs in a specific 
<br/>period of time.  Even the United Nations admits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, throughout the world, no country 
<br/>is actually on track to achieve all the SDGs partly because of COVID-19, partly because of what is 
<br/>happening globally in terms of conflicts and extreme climate events.  So, we have to as a country 
<br/>make sure that we prioritise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot have the resources for everything that we do.  No country ever has that and so the 
<br/></span><span>important thing for us as a Government is to make sure that we put priority.  I pointed out certain 
<br/>Ministries - Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women, Poverty and Social Protection and Ministry of 
<br/>Public Works are some key priorities that we have to focus on, even if we do not achieve fully the 
<br/>goals, we are actually making a progress towards it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>701 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the National Development Plan which he has just mentioned? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Obviously, the honourable Member has not been listening.  It 
<br/>is all over the country.  We have said so many times here in Parliament and outside of Parliament 
<br/>that the National Development Plan would be completed by the end of this month.  We gave the 
<br/>timeline  and  it  is  ridiculous  for  him  to  come  here  and  waste  Parliament’s  time  asking  a  stupid 
<br/>question, when is the plan going to be ready when it is all out there, publicly stated, approved timeline 
<br/>in Parliament.  This is the level of questions and debates coming from them.  Completely bogus, Mr.

<div><span>Dental and Allied Health Professionals Salary Anomalies 
<br/>(Question No. 57/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on 
<br/>its  plans  to  review  salary  anomalies  existing  among  the  Dental  and  Allied  Health 
<br/>professionals in the public sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has acknowledge that 
<br/>there are existing salary discrepancies affecting healthcare workers employed by the Ministry.  Some 
<br/>of  these  discrepancies  have  existed  and  remain  uncorrected  for  many  years  up  until  now.    The 
<br/>Ministry recognises the importance of addressing these salaries discrepancies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For healthcare workers including the oral health, professional and allied health professionals 
<br/>employed by the Ministry, and these they are very much committed to this process.  It is an ongoing 
<br/>process,  thus  take  time  and  effort  and  require  wide  consultation  with  stakeholders,  including  the 
<br/>Government agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have started our nursing cadre which the Government had earlier endorsed and likewise 
<br/>we  will  anticipate  other  cadres  within  the  healthcare  sector  to  also  put  in  a  submission.    At  the 
<br/>moment, we are looking into the medical imaging technologist which the honourable Member had 
<br/>also raised in the Parliament last session.  Sir, the Ministry will continue with the process to ensure 
<br/>that salary issues of its  workers, including more than 200 oral health workers and more than 500 
<br/>allied health practitioners currently in the Ministry are appropriately addressed.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  we  appreciate  the  attempt  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Coalition Government to rectify the issues with our nurses, it is concerning to note that the same has 
<br/>not happened to other health workers in the public sector.  This is causing dissatisfaction, discomfort 
<br/>and pain, as I may say, among the workforce.  My supplementary question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>can he provide a projected timeline for these changes to happen? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- As I had alluded to earlier, it is a process whereby 
<br/>we do consultations with relevant agencies such as cadre of the association, including the one which 
<br/>the honourable Member is a member of, but for the time being, we have done that for the nurses, and 
<br/></span><span>we are looking into the Radio Imaging Technologists, which the honourable Member has also raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Sir, it is a process whereby the Ministry, together with our stakeholders - the Ministry 
<br/>of Civil Service and the Ministry of Finance, will have to look into so that we can properly remunerate 
<br/>our healthcare workers.  For the time being, it is just about dealing with our long serving staff to 
<br/>ensure that they are well remunerated for their years of service, so that is one of the areas that we are 
<br/>looking into.

<div><span>Again,  in  terms  of  the  Oral  Health  and  Allied  Healthcare  workers,  as  of  today,  we  are 
<br/>discussing with them on their way forward. They will bring their own submission. As a Ministry, we 
<br/>will sit down and discuss with them. As always, we will request the Ministry of Civil Service and the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance to accommodate those requests.

<div><span>Bogus Employment Recruitment Agencies 
<br/>(Question No. 58/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>update  Parliament  on  the  action  taken  by  the  Ministry  in  dealing  with  bogus  employment 
<br/>recruitment agencies in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for asking the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry,  as  part  of  the  process  stipulated  under  the  Employment 
<br/>Relations  Regulations  2008  that  actually  governs  employment  agencies,  has  strengthened  the 
<br/>regulatory framework, including the review and  update of  existing  enforcement, compliance, and 
<br/>other  regulatory  procedures  for  recruitment  agencies,  to  ensure  that  they  are  comprehensive  and 
<br/>effective  in  addressing  fraudulent  practices.    This  includes  implementing  strict  licensing 
<br/>requirements for recruitment agencies and a cash bond of $20,000 is part of the requirement as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the requirement also ensures that potential employment agencies applying 
<br/>authorisation will have to provide clear description of the services to be provided to the job seekers 
<br/>and they must also provide police clearance and valid address from where the business will operate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the inspection and compliance process,  our  Labour  Inspectors 
<br/>promptly respond to any report on the operation of any bogus agency. We have, in the past, stopped 
<br/>recruitment agencies that have not been registered here and we have also asked them to go away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, as part of the Public Awareness Programme, has continuously been conducting 
<br/>radio talkback shows, as well as media releases, to ensure that our people are not hoodwinked by 
<br/>these unscrupulous agents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also working with other enforcement agencies, like the Police 
<br/></span><span>Force and the Department  of  Immigration, to  ensure that we have a multi-sectorial  approach  and 
<br/></span><span>provide the right information and guidance to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  remind  any  company  or  person  who  wishes  to  recruit  Fijian 
<br/>workers  for  overseas  employment  opportunities  that  they  must  register  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Employment and obtain necessary approval from the Permanent Secretary for Employment before 
<br/>conducting  any  business  of  registering,  recruiting  and  deployment  of  workers  for  overseas 
<br/>deployment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  Ministry  responsible  for  the  enforcement  and  compliance  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Employment Relations Regulations 2008, the Ministry ensures all foreign contracts of service are 
<br/>vetted and attested to by a Labour Officer before workers leave for overseas employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  protect  members  of  the  public  from  becoming  victims  of  fraudulent 
<br/>activities by illegal recruiters, it is important for them to verify their recruitment authorization before 
<br/>entering into any financial agreement or providing personal details.  Members of the public must also

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>703 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>demand from the recruiting agent their valid authorization certificate from the Permanent Secretary 
<br/>for Employment to ensure that they are engaging with the authorized employment agency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the record, the National Employment Centre (NEC) under the Ministry 
<br/>of  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations  is  the  only  center  authorized  to  prepare 
<br/>workers for employment opportunities in Australia under the PALM Scheme, or in New Zealand 
<br/>under the Recognised Seasonal Employer Work Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  Ministry is  always available to  provide the right  advice on overseas 
<br/>employment issues, to register their interest with the registered employment agencies authorized by 
<br/>the Ministry. I thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>elaborate explanation. While the Minister had explained about the agencies here locally, I just want 
<br/>to ask the honourable Minister if there is a possibility of foreign or foreign employers coming directly 
<br/>and recruit workers in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you very much, Sir, and I thank honourable Koroilavesau for 
<br/>that question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the requirement is that they must first register with the Ministry of 
<br/>Employment and there is a $20,000 bond that they have to deposit.  We do a thorough background 
<br/>check  before  we  approve  any  agency  that  is  interested  to  recruit  our  workers  for  overseas 
<br/>employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We continue to monitor as they recruit and each time they come, they must come through the 
<br/>Ministry  and  then  guided  by  the  Ministry  to  actually  select  and  recruit.    After  our  pre-departure 
<br/>training, they are able to then deploy.  As I have stated earlier, the contract itself has to be attested 
<br/>by us before they depart. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>number of active agencies that they have with the Ministry, apart from NEC? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I understood clearly, honourable Bala asked whether 
<br/>there are any other agencies, apart from NEC.  There is no agency, apart from NEC, that is authorized 
<br/>to register workers who seek employment abroad under the two Schemes.  It is only through NEC 
<br/>that they can register. When the recruitment agencies come, they must come through NEC.  After 
<br/>our due diligence is done, they are registered and after that, they can recruit.  The eight agencies 
<br/></span><span>currently approved are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Packleader Pacific Limited; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Alpha Pacific Navigation Pte Limited; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Pacific Employment Agency; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Adventure World Travels Limited; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Blue Harbour Recruitment Limited; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Manpower Supply and Staffing Limited; 
<br/>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Colour Your Life Private Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Savenaca’s Services; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the only eight that are authorised and, as I have said earlier, we regularly monitor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them when they are around here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; the bogus employment 
<br/>recruitment agencies in Fiji, you are talking about those that are recruiting Fijians to go and work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overseas?  There is the other side of recruiting where you are recruiting overseas workers to come in 
<br/>and work in Fiji.  Are they included also in your scrutiny for those that are getting overseas workers?  
<br/>I heard the honourable Minister for Sugar said that those who came and worked for him came under 
<br/>a recruitment agency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  For 
<br/>those employers who are interested in recruiting workers from abroad to work for them here in Fiji, 
<br/>they go through the Ministry of Immigration.  But once the workers are here, they are employed, and 
<br/>it is the duty of our Ministry to ensure that the employers here comply with the minimum standards 
<br/>equal to those that are governing our local employees.

<div><span>Utilisation of Funds for PPP for Housing 
<br/>(Question No. 59/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics to update Parliament as to how the $2 million allocated in this 
<br/>financial year for Public Private Partnership for Housing has been utilised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question on the utilisation of the $2 million allocated under Head 50 for this particular project.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  very  quickly  give  you  and  Parliament  a  background,  this  Public  Private 
<br/>Partnership (PPP) initiative was actually the brainchild of the FijiFirst Government. I think it was a 
<br/>good thinking to look at prospects of PPP in making sure that there is affordable housing because 
<br/>over the years, the number of increasing informal settlements has just continued.  It has not gone 
<br/>down in any way, and the problem is getting bigger and bigger. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  government,  our  vision  is  to  look  at  the  next  10  years  and  ensure  that  we  provide 
<br/>affordable housing, that we make more land available and provide a mechanism through which we 
<br/>could increase the supply of houses available for this category of people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The partnership agreement  was signed with  the  International  Financial Corporation (IFC), 
<br/>which  is  an  organisation  of  the  World  Bank,  to  provide  financial  advisory  services  for  the 
<br/>Government and also act as the lead for the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  idea,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  to  earmark  six  sites  -  Davuilevu,  Nepani,  Wainibuku, 
<br/></span><span>Raiwaqa in the Central Division, a site in Takakubu, Lautoka, and in Tavua with a total area of 266 
<br/>acres to develop the first pilot project which is expected to supply around 3,000 housing units which 
<br/>will be climate resilient, green and Category 5 cyclone compliance structures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we came into Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we looked at the whole proposal.  We 
<br/>were, obviously, concerned about the success of PPP.  We have PPP in the Health Sector and at some 
<br/>point in time, I will be informing Parliament as to what is going on there and how we intend to take 
<br/>that forward, so Cabinet has already looked at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We took a very, very careful and considered approach in making sure that we get the right advice 
<br/>and that once the project, although it is a pilot project, it is a significant one that will be done properly. 
<br/>We have looked at models around the country, the tender has already gone globally, the process is at the 
<br/>moment underway and once the technical analysis and the appropriate due diligence is done with respect 
<br/>to the kind of companies or contractors, of course, local contractors are also eligible to do that then, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we will be embarking on that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>705 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a general point, we are also looking at other models to 
<br/>ensure that we address the whole issue of informal settlements. So out of the $2 million allocated for 
<br/>the PPP affordable housing project in the Budget under Head 50, to-date a sum of $859,702 has been 
<br/>utilised from the budgetary provision and that is essentially to accommodate the holding cost of four 
<br/>sites.  Obviously, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government will be looking at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are expecting that there will be some additional cost, we may not use all the $2 million 
<br/>that has been allocated under Head 50.  It will be a very prudent - </span><span>nahi paisa hai</span><span>.  Honourable Bala 
<br/>is saying, we got the money, but I am saying </span><span>baut paisa hai. </span><span>That is where we are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>on that project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I want to emphasise that the Government is very much focused on making sure that 
<br/>we create opportunities, mechanisms so that we can address the increasing squatters and informal 
<br/>settlements in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wanted  to  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, the $2 million that has been set aside for these projects, is this $2 million just specified for 
<br/>the already identified sites or is it possible to divert for new sites that can be brought in by the private 
<br/>sector as part of the PPP? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- Yes, I think what we are saying is that this is going to be a 
<br/>pilot project.  These sites were already identified, and we have focused on those 3,000 housing units 
<br/>and $2 million was allocated to ensure that all the holding costs or any other costs associated with 
<br/>making this project start is there.  As I said, we many not use all the $2 million but obviously the 
<br/>answer to your question, honourable Koroilavesau is “yes, we have to look at more because 3,000 is 
<br/>not enough” given the magnitude and the volume that we would require to address all the informal 
<br/>settlements and squatter settlements throughout the country.

<div><span>Repatriation of Chinese Nationals in 2017 
<br/>(Question No. 60/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the repatriation of Chinese nationals from Nadi International Airport in 2017? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in July 2017, a joint operation was conducted 
<br/></span><span>involving  the  Fiji  Police  Force,  Department  of  Immigration  and  the  People’s  Republic  of  China 
<br/>Police Force. This operation targeted cyber related crimes perpetrated by Chinese nationals in Fiji.  
<br/>The operation was executed under the framework of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters 
<br/>Act 1997 and was conducted simultaneously by Chinese officials in countries like Indonesia, China 
<br/>and of the six locations in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The operation was initiated following a memorandum from the Ministry of Public Security 
<br/>of the People’s Republic of China which was dated July 2017.  The memorandum detailed a series 
<br/></span><span>of  cyber  fraud  cases  linked  to  criminal  syndicate  led  by  a  suspect  named  Mr.  Wu  Chang.    The 
<br/></span><span>syndicate had established fake gambling websites leading to significant financial losses for victims, 
<br/>including tragic cases where a victim in Jilin Province committed suicide after being defrauded of 
<br/>over $3.3million Chinese Yuan.  Upon the approval of the Chinese request that was made to Fiji and 
<br/>the Police Force, the Chinese delegation of seven police officers arrived  in  Fiji  to  assist  with  the 
<br/>investigations. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  operation  on  18</span><span>th</span><span>  July,  2017  involved  six  teams,  comprising  Fiji  Police  Officers, 
<br/>Immigration  officials,  Chinese  Police  Officers  and  interpreters  from  the  Chinese  Embassy.    The 
<br/>operation took place in six occasions within the Nadi area namely, Nakurakura, Naisoso, Bountiful, 
<br/>Votualevu,  Legalega  and  Maigania.    This  effort  led  to  the  apprehension  of  77  Chinese  nationals 
<br/>involved in the cyber-related crimes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These individuals had arrived in Fiji, we are talking about the 77 people who are alleged to 
<br/>have committed this offence, arrived in  Fiji between May and June 2017 on a four-month visitor 
<br/>permit.    Investigations  revealed  that  they  were  operating  from  rented  dwelling  houses  set  up  as 
<br/>operations centres to entice victims into fraudulent online batting schemes.  Given their actions, the 
<br/>Department of Immigration recommended that these individuals be declared prohibited immigrants 
<br/>under section 13(2)(g) of the Immigration Act 2003. They were placed under house arrest in Legalega 
<br/>and Naisoso pending further action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that Fiji and China do not have an extradition treaty 
<br/>to-date.  However,  that  repatriation  was  facilitated  under  the  provisions  of  the  Mutual  Legal 
<br/>Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1997, which allows for cooperation between countries in criminal 
<br/>investigations  and  the  enforcement  of  legal  measures.    Might  I  add  that  we  had  used  similar 
<br/>provisions for repatriation recently to the US on drug related offences and on the current case that 
<br/>involved Mr. Kim from Grace Road, the case being currently pending in the High Court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  subsequently  section  9  of  the  Act  enables  foreign  countries  to  request 
<br/>assistance in criminal matters and section 133 permits the Attorney-General to authorise search and 
<br/>seizure operations in response to such request.  Consequently, detention warrants and removal orders 
<br/>outlined in section 9(2) were issued for these individuals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  breaches  of  their  visitor  permit  conditions  as  outlined  in  section  9(2)  and  section 
<br/>(64)(1)(k) of the Immigration Act 2003 warranted their repatriation.  These measures were necessary 
<br/>to uphold Fiji’s laws and maintain public order at the time.  The repatriation process ensured that the 
<br/>77 Chinese nationals were deported from Nadi International Airport back to their home county.

<div><span>Specialised Training and Resources for Teachers  
<br/>(Question No. 61/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  inform  Parliament  on  what  specialist 
<br/></span><span>training and resources are being provided to teachers to assist them in dealing with the huge 
<br/>problem of drug possession and drug use prevalent in our schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  I  have  answered  some  of  these  in 
<br/>yesterday’s question, but I would like to take this time to clarify and inform this august House on the 
<br/>important roles and responsibilities that are placed with the teachers.  As we know the responsibility 
<br/>of disciplining students in the Ministry of Education is confined only to the school boundaries or 
<br/>school organised activities in the boundaries whereby teachers can monitor students’ actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the students walk out of the school gate this is considered a public 
<br/>space  and  public  area  and  students’  activities  become  the  responsibility  of  other  Government 
<br/>agencies like the Fiji Police Force or the Ministry of Social Welfare. They usually liaise with the 
<br/>Heads of Schools on student behaviours and the schools will always contact the parents or guardians.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>707 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned yesterday, the Ministry of Education’s role starts with the 
<br/>Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC) which is the statutory body in the Ministry of Education.  
<br/>They have, over the years, been responsible for the drug demand reduction programmes in schools. 
<br/>This includes the provision of training for teachers on areas in: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how to identify the signs of students who may be using or abusing drugs; 
<br/>the type of drugs available in Fiji; 
<br/>its effects, the legal implications; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>we are also helping out students trying to recover from drugs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we will all agree that the Ministry of Education cannot hold 
<br/>the bull by the horn alone, it needs a united front from the family unit, </span><span>vanua</span><span>, government, religious 
<br/>organisations and civil society to restrain the drug problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2010, the SAAC has been providing training to teachers in schools and these trainings 
<br/>have been intensified with the support of the Police Drug Unit and Ministry of Health. This joint 
<br/>effort  has  resulted  in  having  1,960  teachers  from  the  nine  education  districts  who  attended  these 
<br/>organised trainings. These trainings also include the support mechanism available in school to assist 
<br/>the student who are showing signs of being addicted to drugs and the positive step towards recovery.  
<br/>The drug recovery plan also include the support that parents, teachers and friends will provide to the 
<br/>student.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Police Drug Unit now called the Police Narcotics Bureau facilitated an in-depth training 
<br/>sessions  with  the  teachers  on  all  aspect  of  drugs  and  substances  -  the  drug  effects,  signs  and 
<br/>symptoms, legislation, handling of drugs, reporting and referral.  The Fiji Police Force Blue Light 
<br/>Programme  which  empowers  students  is  also  a  platform  for  our  students  to  share  and  take 
<br/>responsibility and consequences of their decision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this training, these trained teachers conduct awareness during 
<br/>professional development through school staff meeting sessions, sharing the strategies in curbing the 
<br/>use and sale of drugs in their respective schools and mechanisms to actively listen and help students 
<br/>with drug symptoms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  his  response.  The  data  or  information  provided  by  the  Substance  Abuse  Advisory 
<br/>Council is quite alarming, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last three years. In 2021, there were 2,200 cases 
<br/>reported in schools.  In 2022, there were 2,800 cases and last year 3,500 cases.  It is a fight that the 
<br/>honourable Minister cannot fight alone, and it calls for our unified effort, not only by the Government 
<br/>but also the people in the community.  My question is, are our children safe in their schools?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only say that the Ministry of Education 
<br/>is providing a safe environment, the best as it can with all the support and necessary facilitation from 
<br/>other relevant agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  as  you  rightfully  pointed  out,  and  I  think 
<br/></span><span>honourable Naivalurua also did say that, it requires a concerted effort on all interested parties.  My 
<br/></span><span>question is relative to the parents because this begins at home.  In terms of the training being given 
<br/>to teachers, is there a concerted effort on the part of the Ministry to engage with each parent teacher 
<br/>association, to ensure that the parents are well-informed about the hazards, et cetera, that exist in 
<br/>schools and about the drug use and how it can be dealt with at home?  Because the discipline needs 
<br/></span><span>to start at home.  Is there an effort to engage with the parent teacher association at every school?

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member.  As I have 
<br/>said, on processes within the Ministry, there is always engagement of parents and parental consent 
<br/>when students are identified to be in possession of drugs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Honourable Minister, I do agree that the drug issue is everyone’s 
<br/>issue and it is corroding the future of our country. With the trainings you have spoken of that has 
<br/>been given to 1,960 teachers, is there any provision for the school management and the teachers to 
<br/>be equipped with the drug testing kits? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  was  a  very  good  question  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Member,  given  the  task  at  hand  that  has  been  expected  from  the  teachers  to  provide 
<br/>proper teaching methodology to the students and imparting knowledge, these are some additional 
<br/>areas that probably might be considered by the Ministry in discussion with the relevant stakeholders 
<br/>such as the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Defence to ensure that we are not putting ourselves at 
<br/>risk, especially the teachers, for conducting this extra or additional responsibilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn the Parliament now for lunch and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  we  move  on  to  the  second  stage  of  questioning,  that  is,  on  the 
<br/>Written  Questions,  please,  join  me  in  welcoming  another  lot  of  Year  10  students  from  Yat  Sen 
<br/>Secondary School.  Welcome to  your Parliament and I hope that the proceedings will give you a 
<br/>better idea of how your Parliament works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look forward to more visits such as this as it enables us to, kind of, come to grips with 
<br/>what sort of interest it generates to the younger part of our population, that is, the school children.  
<br/>We would like to encourage more visits, so the more visits you make, the more you will learn about 
<br/>this very important aspect of our country where democracy exists - how it makes laws, how it changes 
<br/>and amends laws and how it even repeals laws. So, welcome, and I hope you enjoy your visit here 
<br/>this afternoon.
