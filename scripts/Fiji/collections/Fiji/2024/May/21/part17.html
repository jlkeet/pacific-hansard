<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THERATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMINC FRAMEWORK</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE  
<br/>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMINC FRAMEWORK  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving this opportunity to speak on the 
<br/>motion.  After  COVID-19,  the  Global  Trade  Landscape,  consumers  and  businesses  all  faced 
<br/>numerous challenges. We all witnessed geopolitical tension which is still continuing globally but we 
<br/>have just recently seen the tension in New Caledonia, disruption to the supply chain which pushed 
<br/>the prices and as a small country we had no say.  We could do nothing about it. We were takers in 
<br/>this game.  Shortages of labour globally which created movement of workers across the nations and 
<br/>high inflation rate and of course high cost of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is designed to tackle these global 
<br/>challenges that require coordinated effort and when we talk about supply chain issues, definitely a 
<br/>single country cannot work against multinationals who are very powerful and they have lot more 
<br/></span><span>money and lot more clout to  do what  they want  to  do internationally. The  IPEF aims to  enhance 
<br/></span><span>economic ties and cooperation across the Indo-Pacific region to ensure sustainable economic growth, 
<br/>environmental stewardship and fair market practises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my reasons for supporting this motion are many but I will dwell into few 
<br/>areas only. The Indo-Pacific region is a critical  hub for global trade and economic activities. The 
<br/>countries that are involved or you can say the pioneers of developing this particular framework or 
<br/>engaged in producing this framework are USA and many other countries that join later on like India, 
<br/>Japan, Australia and Singapore. They are the powerhouse for innovation, no doubt about that. By 
<br/></span><span>participating in the IPEF, Fiji can have access to new opportunities for trade and investment that can 
<br/></span><span>lead to economic growth and can also contribute to improving the quality of life for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Clean Economy Agreement within the IPEF will assist nations to address 
<br/>the urgent challenges of climate change.  Fiji has been a champion of climate change.  This is another 
<br/>opportunity for us to look at the innovative practices and how we can utilise this within our nation.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>728 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Agreement  encourages  countries  to  adopt  renewable  energy.    We  already  have  our 
<br/>National Energy Policy and in that Policy, we are talking about achieving 100 percent  renewable 
<br/>energy by 2030.  Reducing carbon emission and investing in green technology which is the new way 
<br/>forward for industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Clean Economy Agreement will promote sustainable practices which industries need to 
<br/>adopt.  We have heard from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and 
<br/>Civil Aviation not too long ago about the Aviation Industry is moving towards the use of clean and 
<br/>green fuel.  These initiatives not only protect our planet, but also open up new avenues for economic 
<br/>growth and job creation in emerging green sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also heard from the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry 
<br/>on the establishment of an ethanol plant in Rakiraki.  These are all helping towards achieving the 
<br/>clean green environment.  However, the question would be for honourable Singh whether we have 
<br/>enough cane to produce ethanol; that is another matter for discussion at a later time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fair Economy Agreement is the foundation of the IPEF, ensuring fair 
<br/>labour practices and promoting gender equality and inclusivity in the workplace which is extremely 
<br/>crucial.  The Fair Economy Agreement aims to build a more just and inclusive economic landscape.  
<br/>We  all  know  the  exploitation  of  cheap  labour  in  making  designer  goods  which  are  later  sold  at 
<br/>exorbitant prices, and we hope that, at least, this Agreement will create a level playing field for the 
<br/>signatories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  IPEF  will  foster  stronger  strategic  partnership  when  it  comes  to  addressing  common 
<br/>challenges such as cyber security, tax administration, addressing corruption, or even diffusing geo-
<br/>political tension through dialogue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by embracing this framework, Fiji will commit to building a future that is 
<br/>economically robust, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable, with an opportunity to work 
<br/>together  for  the  prosperity  and  wellbeing  of  our  future  generations  and  above  all,  this  particular 
<br/>Agreement will also assist Fiji in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  again,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  and  I  support  the 
<br/>motion before Parliament.  I also wish the honourable Minister all the best.  I know he is in a hurry 
<br/>to go to Singapore, you have our blessings, and thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said from both sides of Parliament.  
<br/></span><span>We cannot underestimate the true value of this and I acknowledge the contribution from the other 
<br/>side.  It expresses the sentiment of this Parliament and the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I endorse, Sir, the ratification of the Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will keep it brief as well.  Again, this is very, 
<br/>very important for Fiji and this is an opportunity that we need to seize, given the benefits that this 
<br/>will bring to us.  Again, let me assure the honourable Minister that we have had very good discussions 
<br/></span><span>with the team, and again, we will continue to offer our assistance where it is needed and, of course, 
<br/></span><span>the experience and the expertise that we have on this side of Parliament as well.  That is still on offer, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Global Supply Chain that has been ratified already in November last year, again, this 
<br/>is very, very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  You would recall that in the recent IPU Meeting on the 
<br/>presentation by WHO, as they are doing the Pandemic Treaty in Geneva, I do not know how far that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>729 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has progressed but the Ministry of Health was there, Sir, and this is one of the main issues - supply 
<br/>chain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We encountered a lot of difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. I know for the fact that 
<br/>there  was  an  incident  in  which  we  sought  the  assistance  of  the  Australian  Government  when  the 
<br/>reactants that were needed in the lab were channelled to another country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we are thankful to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia, Senator Marise 
<br/>Payne,  who  assisted  us.    Again,  going  back  to  honourable  Professor  Prasad’s  response  to  the 
<br/>questions today, although this is an Agreement but going back to SDG 17, the partnership for the 
<br/>goals, this is very important for us as small countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I keep referring to the vulnerability of Small Islands Developing States.  Now, there 
<br/>is going to be a meeting in Antigua and Barbuda, there is a lot of questions about multilateralism but 
<br/>now that we are signing with the big boys in this IPEF Agreement, this will be very, very good for 
<br/>us, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just probably touch on Pillar 3 – Clean Economy Agreement.  We had some very good 
<br/>discussions, honourable Minister, with the Permanent Secretary, particularly on the issue of the IPEF 
<br/>Clean Economy Agreement which is a largely non-binding economic framework that supports the 
<br/>efforts of IPEF countries in achieving their respective climate goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  aims  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of  clean  technologies  and  facilitate  investment.  Of 
<br/>course, the objectives of it, I will not go into the details but in the discussions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>clearly explained to the team why it is crafted as such, because I linked that to the Paris Agreement 
<br/>Article 2.2 which reads: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common 
<br/>but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities, in the light of different national 
<br/>circumstances.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is where this Agreement is linked to the Paris Agreement.  This is one of the issues that 
<br/>will be continuously raised, particularly when it comes to big economies.  I know India’s position, 
<br/>this is because of the common but differentiated responsibilities.  On one extreme, they are far ahead 
<br/>in  terms  of  development  but  on  the  other  extreme,  there  are  still  people  in  rural  India  who  need 
<br/>electricity,  there  are  still  people  in  rural  India  who  need  other  forms  of  development,  including 
<br/></span><span>environmental issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why the common but differentiated responsibilities will always be 
<br/>linked to most of these Agreements post-2015 Paris Agreement. But there are opportunities for us in 
<br/>this,  particularly  our  access  to  technology  and  the  best  practices.    This  is  something,  honourable 
<br/>Minister, that we also had some very good discussions with the team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the Intercontinental Resort, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have talked about how the Chinese Chief 
<br/>Negotiator gave his advice to Fiji about our approaches to such negotiations.  We have a big list, but 
<br/></span><span>we will have to prioritise.  I think what is important for Fiji as well is the scoping - the details, because 
<br/></span><span>as I stated, the Chinese will say, “Oh, you talk a lot but where is your plan?”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we are working on this as the operationalisation of this Agreement when it comes into 
<br/>force, hopefully, because this is under the Biden Administration, that is a big question mark as well 
<br/>because of the Election that is coming up.  But, hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that does not stop us 
<br/>from making the necessary arrangements, particularly when we want to go to our partners, we must 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>730 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have our lists ready, even to the extent, if we have to ask for people who will need to help us in terms 
<br/>of drafting our requests, and do the technical scoping, it will be very, very important for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that we also discussed with the technical team, Sir, when it comes to private sector 
<br/>participation, particularly in climate-related issues, one thing that is the lacking in the Pacific is scale.  
<br/>This is probably something that Fiji needs to consider, because what will attract private investors is 
<br/>economy of scale.  This is why we established the Pacific Hub under the climate change when we 
<br/>were  in  the  Presidency  of  COP,  so  that  when  it  comes  to  scoping  of  projects,  when  it  comes  to 
<br/>enticing private sector investments in the climate space projects, they will be after the economy of 
<br/>scale, and this is something we have already discussed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by our colleagues, we wish the Ministry all the very 
<br/>best and we acknowledge the hardworking staff in the Ministry.  For us, we really need to look at our 
<br/>capacity issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are thankful to the UN agencies that are helping us when it comes to the limitation in our 
<br/>capacities.    Hopefully,  apart  from  trade  and  the  benefits,  we  will  access  new  technology,  new 
<br/>innovations and it will lift us to another level, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the statements that have already 
<br/>been given also in this Parliament during the course of Parliament this week.   We support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to support Fiji’s participation 
<br/>in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).  The decision in Parliament to ratify 
<br/>the - Overarching Agreement, the Clean Economy Agreement and the Fair Economy Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said in this Parliament and I suppose, I would be repeating a 
<br/>lot of the good contributions that had been made before me, including that of the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, in terms of this very important Agreement for Fiji.  What I will do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just 
<br/>contextualise what IPEF could potentially mean for Fiji and, more importantly, what is being done 
<br/>to actually get some of the benefits out of these Agreements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  at  12  o’clock  today,  I  excused  myself  to  go  to  a  lunch  with  about  14  US 
<br/>Businessman, who have come to Fiji to attend the infrastructure meeting that is held in Nadi over the 
<br/>next two days.  That is a direct result of IPEF Agreement.  Sir, this Agreement from what I can see 
<br/>is not just a lot of words on a piece of paper, as most of these Agreements are.  What I can see is that 
<br/>amongst the members, there is a lot of activity that is already happening.  Billions and billions of 
<br/>dollars have been signed in terms of Agreements between countries to actually activate respective 
<br/></span><span>economies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From that perspective, we thank the previous Government, the former Prime Minister and 
<br/>honourable Koya, for tapping me on the shoulder when I first got into office and reminded me to 
<br/>have a look at this Agreement because it is very good for Fiji.  Sir, I can say that this Agreement is 
<br/>geared towards action.  It is geared towards actually getting things done, and that is quite different 
<br/>from some of the trade agreements or some of the other Agreements that we see around the place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, the structure of Agreement has been explained. The Agreement is quite unusual, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, because it has four pillars and then an over-arching Agreement that monitors the four pillars.  
<br/></span><span>Because of the speed with which the negotiation was happening, there was a decision taken to come 
<br/>to  the  respective  governments  after  the  negotiation  of  certain  pillars  which  is  why  we  agreed 
<br/>collectively on the supply chain pillar. We now have a Clean Economy Agreement and also the Fair 
<br/>Economy Agreement Pillars in front of us.  This is why the Agreement has come in this manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>731 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, one of the other things that is going to be very beneficial for Fiji is particularly from my 
<br/>perspective as the honourable Minister for Trade is that part of the mandate that I saw when I got 
<br/>into this role is to try and really genuinely diversify the Fiji economy and actually leverage every 
<br/>single opportunity that we have to actually deliver a diversified economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some can argue, Sir, that even the Google Investment is probably one of the early harvests 
<br/>of  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework.  It  has  gotten  visibility in  Washington,  from  that  alone 
<br/>through Fiji, the whole Pacific will be transformed in terms of technology and access.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  each  single  Pacific  country  I  believe  will  have  a  second  cable  into  their  countries  creating 
<br/>redundancy across the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that again, Sir, this is why I am saying this Agreement is not like other Agreements. It 
<br/>actually has teeth and is starting to gain momentum.  We have big ambitions on Climate Change, Sir. 
<br/>This Agreement actually positions us to actually start seeking opportunities for access to finance, 
<br/>technical  assistance,  capacity  building  to  allow  us  to  implement  renewable  energy  projects  and 
<br/>develop the necessary expertise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, there is the Singapore meeting that I referred to earlier is the inaugural 
<br/>Clean Economy in the national forum which is going to be held in Singapore in early June. I invite 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar if she would like to attend as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is why I am saying this Agreement is important. The most important thing to note is 
<br/>that the investment forum has asked for a list of projects from the Pacific. It includes seven large 
<br/>infrastructure related projects in Rural Electrification, Landfill Hydro Energy, Waterways Treatment, 
<br/>Green Marine Transportation, Blue Shipping for possible farming amounting to about $300 million 
<br/>in terms of potential investment.  So, this is again some of the things that are coming out from this 
<br/>Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, Sir, they also have asked us to submit applications for SMEs that will have 
<br/>climate focus our businesses. So, there is a list of 24 SMEs that we have put together and they will 
<br/>be part of the list that has already gone to Singapore. I am hopeful that we can at least get some 
<br/>investment attraction from these opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned by the honourable Members on both sides, the fair economy component of this 
<br/>Agreement is very important, Sir. As we move forward it will be very important that we ensure that 
<br/>transparency in terms of tax administration and other necessary legal frameworks are there to in order 
<br/></span><span>to attract investment to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things also, Sir, that will ultimately, I am hoping will result out of that is that it 
<br/>will actually raise the standards in terms of all our current regulatory frameworks.  We will actually 
<br/>start  to  move  into  the  sphere  of  the  larger  countries.    Sir,  if  that  happens  in  terms  of  investment 
<br/>perception, Fiji becomes a different kind of preposition in terms of the global playfield.  That again 
<br/>is another significant reason why this Agreement is very important to the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, it goes without saying that there needs to be acknowledgement as well on the Trade 
<br/></span><span>Ministry and the team in the Trade Office. As correctly mentioned by honourable Koya they are a 
<br/></span><span>very young team but they fight like hell when it comes to Fiji.  To be honest, Sir, one of the things 
<br/>that  have  come  out  from  this  whole  negotiation  is  Fiji  holds  its  own  when  it  comes  to  trade 
<br/>negotiations.  We do not hold back, a lot of the benefits and disagreement particularly the technical 
<br/>assistance and technical cooperation is due to Fiji’s vocal push to get these things in and pushing the 
<br/>small country perspective.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that basis I thank the team in the Ministry and the Permanent Secretary for all their hard 
<br/>work  and  we  should  be  proud,  and  I  am  glad  that  I  will  go  to  Singapore  and  say  that  this  was  a 
<br/>bipartisan agreement and will not only a one-sided Agreement.  In the years to come, I am hoping 
<br/>that the IPEF Agreement will certainly set the platform for the building of the economic architecture 
<br/>in Fiji and also ensuring that we do achieve an economy that is diversified and can address the needs 
<br/>of all our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You were mentioned in the list of speakers, that is why I called you earlier 
<br/>on.  The way you gave your response, it kind of struck me that you were making your Right of Reply.  
<br/>Sorry about that honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Whip, how was his name included in the list when he is the mover of the motion?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- He was distracted, Sir.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Further distraction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I am grateful to be given the opportunity to be the last to speak and 
<br/>express the gratitude of the Government to the people of Fiji and, of course, civil servants.  We are 
<br/>here reaping the hard work of those before us and we will continue to do so.  I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
