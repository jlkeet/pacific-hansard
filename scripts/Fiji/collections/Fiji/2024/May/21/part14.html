<h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Standing Order 6, that so much of Standing Order 130(2) to (4) is suspended so 
<br/>as to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to move his motion on 
<br/>the  approval  of  an  international  Treaty  without  referring  it  to  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Foreign Affairs and Defence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the 
<br/>motion  being  referred  to,  that  Parliament  approves  that  Fiji  signs  and  ratifies  the  Indo-Pacific 
<br/></span><span>Economic Framework (IPEF): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overarching Agreement; 
<br/>Clean Economy Agreement; and  
<br/>Fair Economy Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a United States led initiative with Australia, 
<br/>Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malayasia, New Zealand, 
<br/>Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Fiji is the only Pacific Island country that was invited 
<br/></span><span>and  joined  the  14  Member  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  (IPEF)  for  prosperity  which  was 
<br/></span><span>launched in May 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The negotiation of the four pillars of the IPEF commenced after the Ministers agreed to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>scope in November 2022 and was considered that an extremely fast pace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that the IPEF partners announce the substantial conclusion
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the negotiations of Pillar 2 – Supply Chain Agreement, in May 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- In assistance to the honourable Minister, Sir, I think he has forgotten that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this is the suspension motion, not the actual motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, so that is why I am coming to an end. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, that is why we have to suspend, I still have 18 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, are you coming to it now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, Sir.  Given the importance of these agreements and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>IPEF, that we approve the suspension motion in order to consider this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  The 
<br/>motion, as rightly put by honourable Koya, is the suspension motion.  But the honourable Minister 
<br/>was  right  in  saying  he  was  just  getting  to  it  and  then  he  rounded  off  there  by  going  on  to  the 
<br/>suspension motion.  Let me remind you, on the suspension. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the suspension, that is why I am having 
<br/>the Standing Order with me.  Just seeking clarification, is it about suspending beyond 4.30 p.m. or is 
<br/>it about suspending the motion?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes,  it  is  about  suspending  the  motion  for  the  honourable  Attorney-General  to  move  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion.  It is not about 4.30 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is housekeeping. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, that is housekeeping, it is not yet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is part of my work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, I will be talking about suspension of  Standing Order 130, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I read Standing Order 130 that states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(2)   The Attorney-General must give notice of a motion for the Standing   Committee 
<br/>on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence  to  review  a  treaty.    The  notice  must  be 
<br/>accompanied by a - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>copy of the treaty; and 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>written analysis that includes the following information- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span> </span><span>a summary of the treaty; 
<br/></span><span>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>the requirements for its implementation within a signatory State; and  
<br/>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>a statement of the impact of the treaty on Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>At the time appointed under Standing Order 34 for motions for which notice has been 
<br/>given,  the  Speaker  must,  without  debate,  refer  the  treaty  and  the  analysis  to  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for consideration and review, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>717 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the Standing Committee on the Foreign Affairs and Defence may table a report 
<br/>in Parliament not later than 30 days after the treaty has been referred to it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Attorney-General may move a motion that the treaty be approved by Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>tables a report on the treaty; or  
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>does not table a report on the treaty within the required 30 day period referred to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in clause (3).”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what we are actually seeking in here by the honourable Leader of the Government in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament to be suspended.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been hearing a lot about Standing Order 51, that we have been 
<br/>bringing Bills under Standing Order 51, and they have been scrutinising us and telling us all about 
<br/>the Bills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I have 20 minutes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were being blamed for bringing this under Standing Order 51.  We accepted it, we were 
<br/>bringing Bills under Standing Order 51 and we never denied it.  There were urgencies, so we brought 
<br/>it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, they are doing it.  They have actually taken a step further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to fast-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>track the Treaties.  Why are we doing this for the Treaties?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree this is not the first time, this is the second time.  The first time when they actually 
<br/>made this blunder, we thought they will consider  it when bringing the second Treaty.  Now, it is 
<br/>becoming  a  regular  task  for  them  to  bring  in  Treaties,  suspend  Standing  Order  130  and  expedite 
<br/>ratifying the Treaty.  What is this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a procedure in place for Treaties.  What is the urgency for bringing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the Treaties? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am giving you the time to finish.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You people are not talking to each other, that is the problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am giving you time to finish, honourable Maharaj, and then I will reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  What  we  actually  fail  to  understand,  Mr.  Speaker,  what  is  the 
<br/>urgency of bringing this treaty in such a manner? We know they have got 100 percent of their Bills 
<br/>under Standing Order 51, even new Ministers introducing Bills are doing so under Standing Order 
<br/></span><span>51.  They are the same Ministers who have been objecting to the of Standing Order 51 all this while 
<br/></span><span>and now as I am suggesting, they have gone further to bring treaties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Honourable Minister, the vide is recording, you are now caught on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>video.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>718 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless,  Mr.  Speaker,  our  concern  over  here  is  that  we  should  refer  treaties  to 
<br/>Committees and if it was this urgent, we actually had a Parliament sitting in April. They could have 
<br/>actually  brought  the treaty  in  April, given it to the Standing Committee, the Standing Committee 
<br/>would actually produce a report within 30 days in this Parliament sitting and we could have actually 
<br/>debated and ratified the treaty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the reason why the suspension motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- If it is so urgent it can still be referred to the Standing Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we can have a Special Parliamentary sitting to ratify the treaty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Talk to your leader.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- That is the clarification I would like to seek and oppose  suspending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Standing Order 130. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  issue  raised  by  honourable  Maharaj,  he  is 
<br/>seeking that he highlighted SO130(2). May I ask that you read the motion that is before you very 
<br/>quickly and clearly. You better understand what the Government is trying to address here. That is the 
<br/>very core of this motion. It is a suspension of clauses 130(2) and (4) so as to the allow honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General to then go to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, they are going around it avoiding subclauses (2) and (4) by going straight to what then 
<br/>will  be  brought  in  by  the  learned  Attorney-General.  I  hope  I  have  clarified  that  because  you  are 
<br/>seeking clarification and you have quoted sub-clause (2); that s suspended now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A.A. Maharaj interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No.  You raised that issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You quoted sub-clause (2) and that is what I am trying to help you with in 
<br/>clarifying that.  The very motion that is before us now is the suspension of Standing Order 130(2) 
<br/>and (4). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And that is what we do not agreed to, Mr. Speaker, of suspending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those and not sending the treaty to the Committee. That is our stand from the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is both in Subclauses (2) and (4). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We are suspending it so we do not refer it to the Committees as you rightly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quoted. So, suspension is there now. Anything else? Any other comments? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, perhaps the other side of Parliament are not talking to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, let me explain. This treaty is the best thing that has ever 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>719 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened for this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Their Prime Minister actually approved getting involved in 
<br/>the  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework.  What  they  are  suggesting  is  that we  delay  the  process  of 
<br/>getting this done. Our Ministry, because of the respect we have for that side of Parliament which they 
<br/>never gave according to honourable Tabuya, consulted the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>honourable Koya. I think it is about three hours to advice on what we are trying to achieve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  (IPEF),  I  am  not  joking,  Sir,  is  a  significant 
<br/>agreement for Fiji.  I am going to Singapore, the intent is to deliver the instruments in Singapore as 
<br/>the first country that is going to ratify the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.  It has been vetted 
<br/>fully by the Solicitor-General’s Office together with 14 other legal officers in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What value can you provide?  My suggestion, Sir, is I ask 
<br/>the Opposition, we agreed, the same process was followed with one pillar, Pillar 2 on supply chain 
<br/>and we are doing the same thing again and for some reason they have changed their minds. I suppose 
<br/>we will have to put it to vote, but I was hoping, Sir, that we do this on a bipartisan basis because this 
<br/>is good for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need to clarify the Opposition’s position on 
<br/>this.    Let  me  assure  the  honourable  Minister  that  we  are  communicating.    This  is  a  matter  of 
<br/>procedure, do not take the Opposition for granted. That is the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yeah!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We know how important this is for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Stop grandstanding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  We  are  not  opposing  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but  as  a  matter  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>procedure because this is an abuse… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No, it is not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … of what is laid out in the Standing Orders because they will 
<br/>make it as a precedent based on the agreement that we did before.  Let me just tell the honourable 
<br/>Minister, we communicated with the staff and we communicated with the Opposition in the caucus, 
<br/>we agreed that this will be raised but we still support it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is our position and 
<br/>that has not changed but do not take the Opposition for granted; that is the point Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>We have been there and gone through this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This IPEF was initiated by us, we were there and we know how important it is.  We have 
<br/></span><span>given the assurance to the officials that we will support it but what is coming from the Opposition is 
<br/>about the process because this is supposed to go through the Committees. It is supposed to go through 
<br/>the Committee and we are trying to help you so that the ratification can take place as planned but of 
<br/>course it is a matter of procedure.  You have no business to talk about the Opposition, we are here to 
<br/>handle the Opposition matters but we are here to look at the big picture and that is what we will stand 
<br/>for. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024720 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is  actually  disrespectful  for the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  raise  the  issue  again  when  you  clearly  clarified  that  the 
<br/>suspension motion was to go beyond the procedures.  The suspension motion is itself a procedure of 
<br/>Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and you allowed that in the Business Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The motion was moved by the honourable Minister, despite that, we had honourable Maharaj 
<br/>going over and over and again talking about the procedure when the suspension motion allows them.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you also have additional powers under Standing Order 20 to make this decision and 
<br/>you rightfully and correctly clarified.  I do not see why there is any fuss on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  suspension,  I  think  it  has  been 
<br/>explained to honourable Maharaj and I thank you, Sir, for that explanation.  It is just a matter of 
<br/>reading that motion or hearing what I said to move that Standing Order 130(2) to (4) be suspended 
<br/>so that we can move forward with this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was trying to explain the rationale on why we need this, but they shouted me down, if I had 
<br/>finished that then probably there would have a better understanding.  This is a critical issue at the 
<br/>moment in terms of this framework which we need to conclude and the timing too is very important.  
<br/>That is why the Standing Order are made out this way so that we cater for situations such as what we 
<br/>are  facing  now  because  we  need  to  sign  this  framework  early  next  month.  I  am  sure  that  the 
<br/>Opposition know the benefits of this to the country, at least they are smiling now, they are not angry… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can move forward, we continue to move forward as one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  so much has been said,  differences of views and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opinions as well but Parliament will now vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
