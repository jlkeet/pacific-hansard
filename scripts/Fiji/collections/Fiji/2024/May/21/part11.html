<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the following honourable Ministers have given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  once  again,  let  me  remind  you  that  Ministers  may  speak  up  to  20 
<br/>minutes. Yesterday I was following very closely on the notification of the timing on the walls and 
<br/>even to the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor Biman Prasad, he stuck to the time and that 
<br/>is an achievement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  Statement  has  been  made,  the  usual  comment  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition or his designate will then be given five minutes for those replies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recent Visit to the United Kingdom  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  honourable Deputy Prime Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition ,  honourable Ministers   and Assistant Ministers , honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament.  I also greet those who are listening in or watching us on livestream, and I reiterate the 
<br/>words  of  welcome  to  the  student  who  are  visiting  Parliament  this morning.  I  see  my  late  sister’s 
<br/>daughter leading the group and her daughter probably in the group too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>. I also thank those who may be listening in by radio 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a Ministerial Statement about my recent visit to the United 
<br/></span><span>Kingdom.  In late 2023, Sir, I received an invitation, or the Government received an invitation, it was 
<br/>a very well worded invitation that did not say very much.   It said that His Majesty the King was 
<br/>inviting the Prime Minister of Fiji to visit.   So, we waited for the Government representative in Fiji, 
<br/>the  British  High  Commission  to  give  us  more  details  about  the  invitation.    Only  last  month  we 
<br/>received confirmation that His Majesty was inviting me to have an audience with him in the palace.  
<br/>I accepted the invitation with great humility knowing that a King’s invitation or request is a subject’s 
<br/>command and those who have had military training would understand, “Your wish is my command.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The relationship  with  the United Kingdom,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, is  deeply  intertwined in  our 
<br/></span><span>modern history.  Most of the students who are here with us are history students, also enshrined in our 
<br/>laws, conventions and our institutions, a history that we share in part with those in England at this 
<br/>time.  It is a history that teaches us numerous lessons in Government, governance, leadership and life 
<br/>that embodies the balance between tradition and modernity, transitioning from one generation to the 
<br/>next, amidst the complexities around the changing environment we live in.

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>681 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The visit commenced with a call on His Majesty, King Charles III at Buckingham Palace on 
<br/>7</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024.  It might be interesting to note if our honourable Minister for Home Affairs is aware 
<br/>that they have changed the Crown that is used by the King and all the badges of rank of the British 
<br/>Military.  It has gone back to what used to be commonly called the “Georgian Crown” and they have 
<br/>moved away from the Edwardian Crown that Her Late Majesty had used.  That is all part of history 
<br/>also for our visitors this morning.  True to the respectability of the monarch, the reception was very 
<br/>warm and dignified.  I conveyed to her the greetings of the people, the chiefs and the Government of 
<br/>Fiji.    When  I  visited  the  honourable  Speaker  of  Commons,  I  also  conveyed  your  greetings,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These relationships were established in 1874 when the chiefs of Fiji ceded their authority and 
<br/>sovereignty to Her Majesty Queen Victoria on 10</span><span>th</span><span> October that year.  In our exchange, the words 
<br/>were profound and emanated from a deep sense of affection and a deep and treasured place within 
<br/>the Crown’s reservoir of goodwill for a nation under its realm.  We used to be under the realm, we 
<br/>now  are  under  the  Commonwealth,  but  we  still  maintain  that  very  cordial  relationship  with  the 
<br/>Crown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I took the opportunity to present my apologies again to His Majesty for my actions in 1987, 
<br/>as I had done to Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II when I visited her in 1998.  That action resulted 
<br/>in our expulsion from the Commonwealth.  Our withdrawal from the realm was at my declaration of 
<br/>Fiji as a Republic on 7</span><span>th</span><span> October, 1987, and with that he wished for Fiji to return to the realm, as Her 
<br/>Late Majesty had told me and as His Majesty said to me last week, “Let it be the will of the people.”  
<br/>The  same  was  also  expressed  to  me  by  the  post-King  of  Nepal  when  I  visited  him  the  Sunday 
<br/>following the Wednesday when the people trashed and conquered the Palace and took selfies on the 
<br/>throne.  I asked him, “Would you be willing to return as the King of Nepal?” He said to me, “General 
<br/></span><span>sahab</span><span>, let it be the will of the people.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our conversation revisited an earlier meeting which I had with the Her Majesty.  In noble 
<br/>magnanimity, His Majesty’s acceptance was truly humbling, his acceptance of my apologies.  Being 
<br/>a guest of His Majesty at a Garden Party at Buckingham Palace two days later, we also extended and 
<br/>continued our cordial exchanges.  It was embarrassing because the presentation line was about two 
<br/>in front of me, I was two rows behind, he broke the rank he was going through, went through the 
<br/>second one and came to me at the back in the third row and said hello and moved on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  delegation  also  met  with  the  Right  Honourable  Lord  Benyon,  the 
<br/>Minister of State for Climate, Environment and Energy and we focussed on our collective efforts to 
<br/></span><span>arrest the downward spiral of the climate crisis and sparing no effort in doing all that we can do to 
<br/></span><span>ensure human security.  The meeting with the Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr, Lindsay Hoyle 
<br/>focussed on the role of the House, as you had reiterated this morning in your address to the visiting 
<br/>students.  The role of the House on national governance and systems to ensure law making and the 
<br/>voice of the people are heard unhindered and sustained.  Therein lies the fundamental principle and 
<br/>demonstration of what democracy is all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The eagerness with which the Office of the Speaker offered its support for Fiji’s Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in particular, and democracy as a whole, is truly heartening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Day 3 started with a call, at Whitehall, on the Secretary of Defence, the Right Honourable 
<br/>Grant Shapps.  Defence co-operation with external armed forces are also being reviewed and guided 
<br/>by the recent UK Integrated Review Refresh 2023.  As a result of the review, the British Government 
<br/>recognises  the  need  to  forge  stronger  bonds  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  among  other  growing 
<br/>important focus in other regions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>682 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fact  that  the  Secretary  of  Defence  had  served  in  the  Royal  Green  Jackets,  the  parent 
<br/>Regiment or the founding regiment of that was the King’s Royal Rifle Corps before it became the 
<br/>Royal Green Jackets and now the Rifle Brigade.  It is where we inherited our rifle green and penny 
<br/>red colours - the regiment colours of the RFMF. Another history lesson for our students here this 
<br/>morning.  There are prospects for increasing cooperation on this front and which this Government 
<br/>would like to take up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  our  exchange,  it  is  very  interesting  that  we  live  in  a  world  that  is  getting  smaller.  My 
<br/>Company Commander when I was Company 2IC of A Company 1FIR here was Major John Bennett 
<br/>from the Royal Green Jackets.  He went back and commanded that Battalion when he was on active 
<br/>service in Northern Ireland and he must have met with some of our students who had come out of 
<br/>Sandhurst at that time.  John Bennett went back from here and became a Battalion Commander there 
<br/>and the Secretary of Defence served under Major John Bennett during that time in the military in 
<br/>UK. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  meeting  with  the  Secretary  of  Defence  was  followed  up  on  Day  4  with  a  visit  to  the 
<br/>Military Training Camp at Aldershot in Hampshire. Aldershot is known as the home of the British 
<br/>Army which currently has 2,000 active personnel from Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On arrival at Aldershot, we were met and received in the traditional ceremony of welcome 
<br/>from our countrymen who are serving in the Army.  Close by, there was also a training camp which 
<br/>had restricted entry and I was allowed in where the Ukrainian soldiers were training in the UK.  I 
<br/>was told that the Ukrainian soldiers will be training there, and I was surprised that before we went to 
<br/>the range, I was taken to a tent and I saw a </span><span>tanoa</span><span> and a group of Fijian soldiers in British uniform, 
<br/>waiting to present the </span><span>sevusevu</span><span>.  When the young man brought a cup up to me, I saw his face and 
<br/>asked him quietly, “what is your name”? He looked around rather embarrassed and told me, “</span><span>O au o</span><span>
<br/>Toni”, and I told those who were with me that he is my father’s namesake.  It was a moment of pride 
<br/>for me to see our very own countrymen who are trainers in the joint warfare facility in that restricted 
<br/>access camp. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Seeing  civilian  Ukrainian  women  participating  as  interpreters  on  the  training  lines  was  a 
<br/>reminder that this is their fight, a national fight for survival.  In the war that is going on, it is back to 
<br/>the 1</span><span>st</span><span> World War style  of fight  intense warfare  again  where the  Ukrainians dug in because they 
<br/>cannot go anywhere else.  It is their line of defence which is their front line and also their international 
<br/>boundary. Life expectancy in  the  front  line measured in  terms of hours,  and not  days, months or 
<br/>years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That visit was followed by a call on the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the Right-
<br/>Honourable Patricia Scotland, at the historic Marlborough House.  Marlborough House, honourable 
<br/>Members, and visiting students, was where they carried out the constitutional conferences that gave 
<br/>rise to our first constitution and the independence of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  meeting  focused  on  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of  Government  Meeting  (CHOGM) 
<br/>which is to be held later this year in Samoa.  We also discussed the mandate and activities of the 
<br/>Commonwealth  Secretariat  in  assisting  Member  States  on  a  whole  range  of  programmes  as  they 
<br/></span><span>require and needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commonwealth currently has three programmes running in Fiji.  The Commonwealth 
<br/>needs our imagination, our creativity and our cooperation.  For a small team at the Secretariat, there 
<br/>is  a  lot  that  they  are  shouldering  on  our  behalf.    We  have  a  small  team  of  Fiji  citizens  in  the 
<br/>Commonwealth Secretariat, and we were very proud to see them.

<div><span>683 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next stop for my delegation, Sir, after that was the visit to the Secretary-General of the 
<br/>International Maritime Organization (IMO), Mr. Arsenio Antonio Dominguez Velasco.  We heard 
<br/>of  IMO's  efforts  in  transitioning  the  shipping  and  maritime  sector  to  be  climate  resilient  while 
<br/>remaining commercially efficient and profitable in the emerging operating environment. As maritime 
<br/>States, this is of utmost importance to Fiji as we also endeavour to rebuild our ports, our shipbuilding, 
<br/>our slipway and maintenance capabilities, not only for our own sake, but also for the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Being  accorded  a  briefing  at  the  MI6  Headquarters  of  the  British  Intelligence  Service, 
<br/>provided deeper understanding of the situations and the scenarios the British Government and her 
<br/>Allies are confronted with and which they are trying to manage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MI6 Briefing was  an opportunity  to  share  common experiences  and insights  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Officials who were there.  These can only be referred to as -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investments in our common goals for accountable government; 
<br/>protection of the dignity of humankind; and  
<br/>our shared responsibility in ensuring that evil has no place in our midst, while decency, 
<br/>peace and security are promoted and sustained.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sharing of my concept for the Pacific as an "Ocean of Peace" found fertile ground there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at MI6 also in England.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Day 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had  a meeting at  Whitehall with  the Secretary for  Foreign, 
<br/>Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Lord Cameron.  I made a mistake of putting my hand out 
<br/>calling, “Hello David”, he was the former Prime Minister.  Then someone behind me said, “Lord 
<br/>Cameron.”.  Oh, Hello, Lord Cameron. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  meeting  acknowledged  the  deep  historical  relations  between  our  two  countries.  We 
<br/>looked into opportunities for furthering the relationship and our joint responsibilities as members of 
<br/>the Commonwealth in ensuring we remain strong and relevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had made the same mistake at the COP28 when I met Tony Blair.  I said, “hello Tony”.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>guy next to me said, “Sir Anthony”.  “Oh! I am sorry, Hello Sir Anthony.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was focus on common challenges that we are facing and they are – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the rise in autocracy;  
<br/>growing disregard for the international rules-based order; 
<br/>vulnerability of the global supply chain;  
<br/>the increase in transnational organized crime;  
<br/>illicit trafficking in people, drugs and goods (our newspaper is full of these accounts 
<br/>everyday);  
<br/>the place of development assistance; and 
<br/>need to be guided by the will of the people, among others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is recognition that the international environment is complex and perhaps, heading in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the wrong direction, and if we allow it, it can get even worse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The openness and willingness of the British Government to come to our assistance as needed, 
<br/>was very reassuring. As with other development partners, we do our part first before we reach out to 
<br/>our friends where help is needed.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clearly Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is much work ahead emanating from that visit.  At the official 
<br/>level, there was also a meeting with the Officials of the British Department of Trade, where the focus 
<br/>was on trade relations, particularly the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), Fiji’s products and 
<br/>British market requirements and processes. A follow up meeting is on the horizon and there is an 
<br/>opportunity to dovetail this with CHOGM.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are over 20,000 Fijian Nationals living in the United Kingdom. Of that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20,000, over 2,000 serve as active members of the British Armed Forces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission I will hand this Statement to the Hansard Reporters 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where we can all have access to them as my time has run out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>on the Statement that he has given on the visit that he has paid to the United Kingdom.  We are very 
<br/>glad to hear of all the various visits that he made. I was particularly struck with the rapport that he 
<br/>struck up  with  King Charles  III in  their visit  because  I can recall back in  2019 when we were in 
<br/>London with the former Prime Minister, we also visited him at that time with the invitation to be here 
<br/>at the 50</span><span>th</span><span> Anniversary of our Independence.  It was unfortunate at that time, COVID-19 came, so it 
<br/>was not able to happen. So, I think that rapport and the relationship that he has expressed has been 
<br/>there for a long time between our two nations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is good to think back on history, but it is also important to realise that the history that we 
<br/>have talked about a lot of the times is the embellished history. Sometimes there are also the history 
<br/>that needs to be taught.  There are other parts of history that are not spoken about at length, and we 
<br/>know that this is something that we also need to cherish. We can talk about the things that happened 
<br/>to the hill tribes of Fiji, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the kind of things that are not covered in our full history, and I think it is important 
<br/>too for the children that are here to understand that sometimes, the history books that you read today 
<br/>do not tell you the full history of what transpired in our country. And that is something that I hope 
<br/>the Ministry of Education and others can look into because we really need to understand where we 
<br/>came from as a country, what the forces are because the things that impact on us today are the forces 
<br/>of what has happened in the past and they have their ramifications over the generations.  But it is 
<br/>upon us as people today to look into acting on those things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to pick on some of the issues that the honourable Prime Minister spoke about.  
<br/>I am very appreciative of the fact that they talked about with Lord Bennet, if I am correct, on the 
<br/>issue of climate change and we know that this is something that is important for us.  I think one of 
<br/>the recent COPS that was held in the United Kingdom recently where His Majesty the King was 
<br/>involved in all of that.  I am glad to hear that the notion of ‘sparing no effort’ came through. I am 
<br/>glad to hear that because that is something that is very important for us, especially when we talk 
<br/>about climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The former Prime Minister used to talk about the differences between large countries when 
<br/></span><span>they  talk  to  us  in  person  or  when  they  come  to  the  Pacific  and  we  meet  them  in  international 
<br/>conferences. Sometimes, what they talk about begins to change and they look at their own interest. 
<br/>So, I am thankful that that expression came about.  He used to refer to some of them at some time as 
<br/>the ‘coalition of the selfish’ when it came to look at the interest of small island nations.  But I am the 
<br/>glad that, that has been talked about there.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>685 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note, again, the expression by the honourable Prime Minister on what he had talked about 
<br/>the Oceans of Peace, and I am glad to hear this. I had expressed some concern on this earlier on this 
<br/>year, about Oceans of Peace and how it manifests in our approach to conflicts in other countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  consider  at  the  moment  about  some  of  the  things  that  are  taking  place  in  New 
<br/>Caledonia.  We are a bit of concerned about our people there, so maybe the Prime Minister might be 
<br/>wanting to prepare a Ministerial Statement on how we will be dealing with that particular situation.  
<br/>I  was  interested  to  hear  whether  there  was  any  discussion  on  the  visa  free  entry  into  the  United 
<br/>Kingdom, but it seems that that it did not take place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  I  am  very  glad  to  hear  about  is  the  visit  to  the  International  Maritime 
<br/>Organisation  (IMO)  and  the  emphasis  on  Maritime  Safety  Security  especially  the  Pacific  Blue 
<br/>Shipping Partnership.  I think this is very important for us.  We need to show that we have reduced 
<br/>our emissions in our shipping in the Pacific but we have old fleets.  I think the amount of money that 
<br/>is being talked about in this project is $500 million and we hope the Government can continue to 
<br/>work very closely with the IMO to get that money into place so we can upgrade our ships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know we have had a lot of problems with shipping in our country and we are in a better 
<br/>state than a lot of those other countries.  We look forward to the IMO regional office being established 
<br/>in Fiji, it will allow field level engagement, technical cooperation and allow us to express our wishes 
<br/>to them to work with them, so we can also as small island nations also try to decarbonize our shipping 
<br/>fleets.  It is a big, big task but we have to go there, we have to show the world if we are moving, 
<br/>asking you to do something for climate change by reducing emissions here in the Pacific, we will 
<br/>also work on that but we need the assistance, and I thank the honourable Prime Minister for the visits 
<br/>and we look forward to being able to move this Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership forward for the 
<br/>benefit of the shipping of decarbonizing for shipping fleets in the Pacific.

<div><span>Duke of Edinburgh International Awards Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, students at the public gallery, viewers who are watching through television 
<br/>broadcasting live from the comfort zone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today with great pride to address this esteemed Parliament regarding 
<br/>a momentous occasion that transpired just days ago. On Wednesday, 15th May, 2024, the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Youth and Sports had the distinct honour of investing ten outstanding youths as Gold Awardees 
<br/></span><span>for  the  Duke  of  Edinburgh  Awards  programme  at  the  State  House.  The  auspicious  occasion  was 
<br/>officiated by His Excellency the President of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere. His presence 
<br/>and  support  further  underscores  the  significance  of  this  achievement  and  serves  as  a  source  of 
<br/>inspiration for our young awardees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Duke of Edinburgh Awards programme founded by His Royal Highness 
<br/>The Duke of Edinburgh in 1956 has been a beacon of excellence, character development and service 
<br/>for countless young individuals across the globe. It is a programme deeply rooted in the principles of 
<br/></span><span>self-improvement, community engagement and personal growth.  The programme has a rich history 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji, dating back to the 1960s however, since 1999, this only marks the third Gold Award event 
<br/>recorded  bringing  the  number  to  a  total  of  77  Gold  Awardees  nationally.  Since  its  inception,  the 
<br/>programme has empowered thousands of young Fijians to explore their potential, develop essential 
<br/>life skills and contribute positively to society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Participants between the ages of 15 years to 24 years engage in a variety of activities across 
<br/>four key areas: service, skills, physical recreation and adventurous journey. These experiences foster

<div><span>On Achievements, in recognising the efforts of the 10 youths and investing them into the Gold 
<br/>level  is  a  privilege  as  it  exemplifies  the  very  essence  of  this  prestigious  programme.  They  have 
<br/>demonstrated  unwavering  commitment,  resilience  and  a  spirit  of  adventure  through  their  journey 
<br/>which culminated in achieving the highest accolade, the Gold Award. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each of these remarkable individuals have traversed a challenging and transformative path, 
<br/>encompassing  four  key  components:  volunteering,  physical  fitness,  skills  development  and 
<br/>adventurous journey. Their dedication to these pillars reflect not only their personal ambition but also 
<br/>their profound sense of duty to their communities and society at large. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the achievements of these 10  youths are not  merely  a  testament to  their 
<br/>individual  capabilities  but  also  a  reflection  of  our  nation's  commitment  to  nurturing  the  next 
<br/>generation of leaders, innovators and global citizens. As custodians of their potential, it is incumbent 
<br/>upon us to provide unwavering support and encouragement as they embark on the next chapter of 
<br/>their journey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  2021  to  2023,  a  total  of  1,120  participants  registered  for  the  Duke  of  Edinburgh 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International Award (DEIA). Among them we have: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>463 participants successfully graduated at the Bronze level. 
<br/>115 participants achieved the Silver Award. 
<br/>77 participants received the Prestigious Gold Award. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The progress has been slow given that the Ministry was officially granted an official operating 
<br/>license in 2017 to implement the DEIA programme in Fiji. The progress was further impacted  by 
<br/>COVID 19 pandemic due to the restrictions put in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>in the realm of volunteering, our Gold Awardees have 
<br/>selflessly dedicated hundreds of hours to various initiatives ranging from environmental conservation 
<br/>projects  to  mentoring  disadvantaged  youth.  Their  altruism  and  compassion  have  left  an  indelible 
<br/>mark on those they serve, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, their commitment to physical recreation has not only fostered personal well-being 
<br/>but has also promoted a culture of health and vitality within their communities. Whether through 
<br/>sports,  dance,  or  outdoor  activities,  these  individuals  have  embodied  the  importance  of  an  active 
<br/>lifestyle and its positive impact on both physical and mental health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Equally impressive is their pursuit of skills development, as they have honed talents ranging 
<br/>from  Culinary Arts  to  Digital  Literacy. Through continuous learning and skill-building,  our Gold 
<br/>Awardees have equipped themselves with the tools necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving world, 
<br/>while also contributing their expertise to the betterment of society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the adventurous journeys undertaken by these trailblazers have not only tested 
<br/></span><span>their physical endurance but have also cultivated invaluable life skills such as teamwork, leadership, 
<br/>and problem-solving.  From traversing rugged terrain to navigating unchartered waters, they have 
<br/>embraced the spirit of adventure with courage and determination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  ensure  the  programme’s  effectiveness,  the  Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plans to establish a dedicated team that will focus on:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper implementation - We will provide the guidance and support to schools, clubs and 
<br/>participants to ensure consistent and high quality implementation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Monitoring and evaluation - Rigorous monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will help us 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assess impacts, identify areas for improvement and celebrate success.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Addressing unreachable areas - We recognise that some regions may face challenges in 
<br/>accessing the programme.  Our team will explore innovative solutions to bridge these gaps.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry of Youth and Sports is committed to expanding the reach of Duke 
<br/>of  Edinburgh  International  Award  programme  as  part  of  its  Strategic  Plan  as  we  recognise  the 
<br/>transformative impact it can have on our youth.  To realise the full potential of this programme, the 
<br/>Ministry will focus on the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusion in schools - We are actively working with the Ministry of Education to integrate 
<br/>the programme into schools across Fiji.  By doing so, we aim to provide every student with 
<br/>the opportunity to participate and grow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusion  in  youth  clubs  -  We  encourage  more  youth  clubs  to  take  ownership  of  the 
<br/>programme.    These  clubs  serve  as  hubs  for  personal  development,  mentorship  and 
<br/>community engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Collaboration with key Ministries and stakeholders - Our vision extends beyond individual 
<br/>participation. We seek to collaborate with other Ministries and stakeholders to reach a wider 
<br/>spectrum of youth, aged 15 years to 24 years.  Together, we can create a holistic approach 
<br/>to youth development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Boys Scouts and Girl Guides – In alignment with our commitment to youth development, 
<br/>the Ministry of Youth and Sports is mandated to support the Boys Scouts and Girl Guides. 
<br/>These esteemed organisations share many core values with the Duke of Edinburgh Awards 
<br/>programmes, such as leadership, community and personal development.  We recognise the 
<br/>complementary roles these programmes play in fostering well-rounded individuals who are 
<br/>prepared  to  meet  the  challenges  of  tomorrow.    To  this  end,  the  Ministry,  as  part  of  its 
<br/>Strategic Plan, will work closely with these organisations to strengthen the Boys Scouts and 
<br/>Girl Guides programme across the nation.  This plan includes sourcing funding for training 
<br/>and  resources,  enhancing  collaboration  between  these  organisations  and  schools  and 
<br/>promoting greater participation through public awareness campaigns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By bolstering these programmes, we aim to provide a comprehensive support system for our 
<br/>youth,  ensuring  that  they  have  ample  opportunities  to  develop  their  skills,  building  character  and 
<br/>serve their communities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we celebrate the achievements of our Gold awardees, 
<br/>let us also reaffirm our commitment to nurturing the potential of all our young people through diverse 
<br/>and  enriching  programmes.    By  investing  in  their  growth  and  development,  we  are  laying  the 
<br/>foundation for a brighter and more prosperous future for our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that there is a great interest in the DEIA 
<br/></span><span>Programme,  as  seen  through  the  steady  increase  in  the  number  of  participants  enrolling  in  the 
<br/></span><span>programme for the last three years.  We would greatly need an increase in resources to strengthen 
<br/>this  programme  and  realise  its  full  potential.    The  high  number  of  Bronze  graduates  indicates 
<br/>successful engagement at the entry level and the smaller cohort of silver and gold awardees reflects 
<br/>the Programme’s challenging nature, emphasizing quality over quantity.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last but not least, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to each of our 
<br/>Gold Awardees for their exceptional accomplishments and commendable dedication to the ideals of 
<br/>the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To our stakeholders, parents and the staff of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and Ministry 
<br/>of Education, for their unwavering commitment towards the development of youth in Fiji. May these 
<br/>achievements serve as a source of inspiration to all young people across our nation, reminding them 
<br/>that with perseverance, dedication, and a spirit of service, anything is possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his Statement on this very wonderful programme the Duke of Edinburgh Awards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  I  join  him  in  offering  our  congratulations  to  the  Gold  Awardees  of  this 
<br/>programme.    The  programme,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  also  cut  around  the  idea  that  not  all  learnings 
<br/>happen inside the classroom. It can also happen outside the classroom and those four categories – 
<br/>Service,  Skills,  Physical  Recreation  and  Adventurous  Journey,  in  some way,  moves  that  learning 
<br/>outside from the classroom setting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I usually teach the Duke of Edinburgh and I think it was more on the skill set  - it was on 
<br/>safety of life at sea. It is a wonderful programme and if you look at the four categories - Service, 
<br/>Skills,  Physical  Recreation  and  Adventurous  Journey,  we  can  be  creative  enough  and  set  up  a 
<br/>programme where you have a little bit of each, for example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that programme, we would get the students who are part of it, teach them how to inflate a 
<br/>life raft if they are on a ship, how to ride the life raft if it turns over, how to send SOS messages in 
<br/>different ways that you can attract attention, how to fire flairs if you find them inside. It was quite 
<br/>interesting and the students that came in and were part of this programme had a little bit of both. 
<br/>They were enhancing their skills - a bit of adventure, we would take them out to sea, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in progressing it forward and advertising it so the kids who get into it create those 
<br/>programmes that have a little bit of each.  Also, I think that Fiji as a maritime nation, skill set that 
<br/>really targets where they live.  I am sure if we ask the students who would want to go down and do 
<br/>all those – inflate a life raft, how do you put on a life jacket, how do you swim, how do you help 
<br/>someone who is struggling out at sea with a life jacket, I am sure they would raise their hands and 
<br/>say, “yes, I would want to go and do it”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also think that there is an age group.  So, you start the programme in school 
<br/></span><span>and then you leave school at about 19 years. In some cases, they do not continue, but because the 
<br/>programme caters from 14 years to 24 years, if we can keep track of them and push them into a club 
<br/>may be, then they can continue and be a gold awardee in the end.  A wonderful achievement for those 
<br/>who had done that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think also,  Mr. Speaker, that it is  worth  thinking about  is  the funding to the Ministry of 
<br/>Education and the Ministry of Youth and Sports.  They need money in order to run this programme.  
<br/>Also, they can partner with outside organisations, such as the Fiji Navy, for example, if they want to 
<br/></span><span>run that programme. There needs to be funding also so that they can be able to run that programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Ministry for continuing with that. I wish the programme well and I wish all the 
<br/>students, those who are here, those who are listening well.  It is a wonderful opportunity to pick up 
<br/>and join and be part of the Duke of Edinburgh Award.

<div><span>Transformative Changes in the Judicial System 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of this august Parliament, I welcome 
<br/>the students from Yat Sen School who are seated in the gallery and members of the public who are 
<br/>joining us virtually through the livestream media; good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my topic this morning is on the Transformative Changes in the Judiciary, 
<br/>Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Office of Legal Aid.  The integrity and effectiveness 
<br/>of a judicial system is paramount to the health of our democracy and wellbeing of our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Judicial Department, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Legal Aid 
<br/>Commission are the pillars that uphold justice, ensure the rule of law and provide access to legal 
<br/>resources for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministerial Statement this morning will focus on the current status, the 
<br/>achievements,  the  areas  necessitating  improvements  in  the  following  institutions  -  the  Judicial 
<br/>Department, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Legal Aid Commission.  At 
<br/>the same time, I will also provide a comparative analysis of the leadership and progress within these 
<br/>institutions over the past 16 years, highlighting the transformative changes brought about under the 
<br/>Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Judicial  Department  includes  the  Judiciary,  Magistracy  and  the  various  Tribunals 
<br/>namely, the Small Claims Tribunal and the Court support staff.  The Chief Justice looks after the 
<br/>Judiciary, the Chief Magistrate oversees the Magistracy and the Small Claims Tribunal, while the 
<br/>Chief  Registrar  manages  the  Court  support  staff  while  also  serving  as  the  Department’s  Chief 
<br/>Accounting Officer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Judicial Department has branches across Fiji with its main office in Suva, and they also 
<br/>have an office in Lautoka and Labasa.  Suva is the home of Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, 
<br/>while the High Courts are also looked in Suva, Labasa and Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  High  Court  convenes  in  each  of  these  three  main  centres.  There  are  36  established 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Magistrates Courts with further scheduled island sittings occurred during the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the previous Government, this was not the case. In fact, the structure 
<br/>heavily relied on expatriate Judicial Officers, resulting in increased costs due to allowance, gratuity 
<br/>and travel expenses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, a great number of visiting Judges for the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal 
<br/>were Sri Lankans. This led to high travel costs. Fortunately, when the Coalition Government came 
<br/>into power, we prioritised localization, significantly increasing the number of local Judicial Officers 
<br/>from 27 to 50, thereby reducing dependency on expatriates and associated costs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the previous Administration, the Judicial workforce included 55 officers. These were 
<br/>27 local Judges and 28 expatriates. We have further expanded this and we shift to include 59 officers 
<br/>with  a  strong  focus  on  local  appointments.  As  a  result,  we  now  have  50  local  officers  and  nine 
<br/>expatriates serving in key positions. This shift promotes sustainability and, of course, reduces costs. 
<br/>The total number of established staff has increased from 852 to 886, showcasing a commitment to 
<br/>strengthening the Judicial capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>691 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of Judges from Australia and New Zealand has reduced 
<br/>travel costs by one-third.  I am proud to say that we have increased the frequency of Supreme Court 
<br/>sittings from three to four sessions, and the Court of Appeal sittings from four to five sessions with 
<br/>back-to-back sittings,  enhancing  the efficiency and effectiveness  of our Judicial  processes. These 
<br/>advancements underscore our commitment to building a resilient and sustainable judicial system that 
<br/>effectively addresses the evolving needs of our nation. Through these efforts, we are fostering a more 
<br/>just, equitable and accessible legal system for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a critical area of improvement in case management. Under the 
<br/>previous Government, the number of pending cases was alarmingly high. There were 26,162 pending 
<br/>cases in total - 13,586 pending cases in the Central/Eastern Division; 10,402 pending cases in the 
<br/>Western Division alone; and 2,174 pending cases in the Northern Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the Coalition Government came in, these numbers have significantly decreased by 9, 
<br/>221.  There  are  10,675  pending  cases  in  the  Central/Eastern  Division;  4,758  pending  cases  in  the 
<br/>Western Division; and 1,520 cases in the Northern Division, so 16,941 pending cases in total. This 
<br/>improvement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because of enhanced case management meetings and the Chief 
<br/>Justice’s direct engagement with all Courts nationwide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  budget  of  the  Judicial  Department  has  been  notably  increased  from  $47,152,415  to 
<br/>$50,448,711 under the Coalition Government. This increase has facilitated various capital projects, 
<br/>including the construction of the new Court complexes and the refurbishment of existing facilities to 
<br/>better serve the needs of our citizens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the pipeline for the 2024-2025 Budget are several noteworthy projects, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>We are embarking on the extension of the Nadi Court – one of the busiest courts in Fiji, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a crucial step in expanding the judicial capacity in that region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>We are proud to announce the construction of a new Lautoka Court complex which will 
<br/>provide modern facilities to support the administration of justice. In 2012, there was a 
<br/>ceremony for the construction of the Lautoka complex. Until today, there has been no 
<br/>action, so we have implemented it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>We are moving forward with the establishment of a new court complex in key locations 
<br/>across the country. This include the Savusavu Court complex, Keiyasi Court, Dreketi 
<br/></span><span>Court and the Veiuto Court. These new facilities will not only improve access to justice, 
<br/></span><span>but  also  ensure  that  our  judicial  processes  are  conducted  in  a  state-of-the-art 
<br/>environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  these  constructions,  we  also  continue  our  efforts  to  upgrade  existing  court 
<br/>complexes.  This includes ongoing work at the Ba Court Complex which will be opened at the end 
<br/>of the year and the Lautoka Tagimoucia Court.  These upgrades are essential in modernizing our 
<br/>infrastructure and improving the quality of service we provide to the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to announce plans for the establishment of the High Court 12 and High Court 
<br/></span><span>13 at Government Buildings.  These additions will further strengthen the Judiciary and ensure that 
<br/>justice is accessible to all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shifting our focus – I would like to shed light on some of the systematic issues encountered 
<br/>by  the  office  of  Director  of  Public  Prosecution  during  the  previous  Government’s  tenure.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, imagine a scenario where fairness is merely a concept, where advancement is an elusive 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dream and where bureaucracy reigns supreme.  These were the reality faced by our prosecutors.  The 
<br/>unequal  workload  distribution  among  prosecutors,  some  were  burdened  with  more  case  that  they 
<br/>could not handle while others had their desk gathering dust.  How can justice prevail when the scales 
<br/>are so clearly tipped, I asked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  shifting  management  culture  that  unshackled  the  aspirations  of  our  local  prosecutors.  
<br/>They  were  held  back,  unable  to  rise  beyond  the  Principal  Legal  Officer  level.    Where  is  the 
<br/>encouragement  for  growth  and  excellence  in  such  an  environment?    The  Human  Resources 
<br/>Department, far removed from the courtroom, seizes control of the prosecutorial duties.  How can 
<br/>those  unfamiliar  with  the  law  understand  the  complexities  of  our  work?    It  is  an  insult  to  our 
<br/>profession. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine the despair of prosecutors toiling away in neglected workspaces, devoid of care and 
<br/>respect they deserve.  How can we expect dedication and passion where the very spaces in which 
<br/>they work are disregarded?  These issues created a toxic and unhealthy work environment, affecting 
<br/>morale and productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the Coalition Government came into power, we have transformed and revitalized the 
<br/>ODPP.  A change in leadership and management has brought renewed strength, vitality and courage 
<br/>to the work lives of the prosecutors.  Even amid a stagnant budget for the past four years, they have 
<br/>shown remarkable resilience.  Now, they are advocating for a $2 million boost in the 2025 budget to 
<br/>finance the establishment of new specialized units, additional staff positions and enhanced training 
<br/>programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For office renovations and strategic planning, the neglected conditions in divisional offices 
<br/>have been addressed.  Its Nadi office completed renovations in October 2023 with modern facilities 
<br/>costing $73,755.  The Lautoka office renovations are ongoing with a budget of $116,000, Labasa 
<br/>office renovations began in May 2024, moving to a higher floor to prevent flooding with a budget of 
<br/>$49,500.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A comprehensive strategic plan developed with senior officers will be launched in June.  The 
<br/>training programme has  been revamped to  include external  stakeholder  engagement and overseas 
<br/>opportunities,  addressing  current  crime  trends.    Funded  by  external  sources,  the  training  covers 
<br/>cybercrime,  child  development,  asset  recovery  and  leadership.    Since  2023,  14  prosecutors  have 
<br/>attended overseas training with significant national training events scheduled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us acknowledge the indispensable role of the Legal Aid Commission.  
<br/></span><span>The  Legal  Aid  Commission  stands  as  a  beacon  of  hope  for  those  who  cannot  afford  legal 
<br/>representation.  It provides invaluable services, including legal advice, representation in court and 
<br/>assistance across family, criminal and civil domains. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Legal Aid Commission embarked on a transformative journey, spearheading initiatives 
<br/>to enhance accountability, transparency and service accessibility.  Restructuring its organisational 
<br/>framework through compilation of its annual report from 2018 to 2023 and the review of key policies.  
<br/>These  include  the  Finance  Manual  2022,  Financial  Policy  (Fixed  Assets  Management  Policy), 
<br/></span><span>Transport Policy, Human Resources Policy and Procedural Manual 2023, implemented in March of 
<br/></span><span>last year following extensive consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission aimed to streamline processes, develop career pathways and foster internal 
<br/>growth.    This  overhaul  was  important  to  meet  the  evolving  needs  of  its  clientele  and  ensure 
<br/>operational efficiency.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share comprehensive update on the transformative initiatives 
<br/>taken  by  the  Legal  Aid  Commission.  These  efforts  are  designed  to  enhance  accountability, 
<br/>transparency, service delivery and access to justice for all Fijians. The Commission has strengthened 
<br/>its accountability and transparency through compilation of its Annual Report and of course all the 
<br/>policies of the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In December 2023, the Legal Aid Commission launched a new Strategic Plan for 2023 to 
<br/>2026,  it  was  developed  through  an  extensive  consultation  process.    This  plan  focuses  on  client 
<br/>service, collaboration with the justice system, organisational sustainability and fostering a positive 
<br/>culture within the Legal Aid Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Legal Aid Commission has initiated exchange programme with Pacific Island countries 
<br/>as exemplified by the MOU with the Solomon Islands Public Prosecution Office, similar agreements 
<br/>with PNG, Vanuatu and Kiribati are forthcoming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission has improved accessibility to Legal Aid services by enhancing this office 
<br/>accessibility for persons with special needs.  These includes the relocation of the Conflict Unit and 
<br/>the Navua Office and securing a new, more accessible space for the Nausori Office.  To streamline 
<br/>service  delivery  the  Commission  has  simplified  the  Legal  Aid  Commission  representation 
<br/>application from 16 pages to just four pages ensuring it is use of friendly and also decentralised and 
<br/>digitised civil litigation procedures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The launch of the Legal Awareness Programmes at secondary schools reaching 6,346 students 
<br/>from Year 13 to Year 17 across 17 high schools.  This proactive approach in crime prevention will 
<br/>be further supported by the upcoming MOU with the Ministry of Education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  1</span><span>st</span><span>  May,  2024,  the  Legal  Aid  Commission  has  streamlined  the  types  of  civil  contest 
<br/>measure they handle focussing on the specific area such as eviction, the SET appeals, enforcement 
<br/>proceedings and others to ensure efficient use of the time and limited resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  July  2023  they  conducted  a  first  workshops  for  lawyers  especially  dealing  with  child 
<br/></span><span>representation, in family and domestic violence matters, in collaboration with the Judiciary. The team 
<br/></span><span>at the Commission are holding regular consultation with key stakeholders to improve service delivery 
<br/>and efficiency including meeting the Judiciary, Statutory Bodies, NGOs such as Fiji Women’s Rights 
<br/>Movement for gender sensitization training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these initiatives marks given progress for the Legal Aid Commission.  We 
<br/>are  committed  to  continuing  our  efforts,  to  ensure  justice  and  legal  representation  for  all  Fijians, 
<br/>overcoming challenges, assisting opportunities to build a fairer and more accessible legal system.  As 
<br/>we look to the future, let us remain steadfast in our dedication to justice, equality and the rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together, we will build a justice team that only upholds the high standards of integrity and 
<br/>fairness but also serve as a pillar of strength and hope for all citizens.  Our journey towards a more 
<br/>just society continues and with unwavering resolve, we will achieve our vision of a Judiciary that 
<br/>truly reflects the values and aspirations of our nation.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his 
<br/>designate for their response. Honourable Members, this is another batch of students, Years 11,12 and 
<br/>13 (if I am right) from Yat Sen Secondary School once more, welcome students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  humbly  honoured  to  welcoming  you  to  your  Parliament.    This  is  the  People’s 
<br/>Parliament and this is where we make laws, we change and amend laws and repeal laws as well and 
<br/>even treaties.  That is our core functions.  We hope to see that you are encouraged more and hope to 
<br/>see you in probably a couple of years’ time, sitting amongst us or sitting amongst the honourable 
<br/>Members  here,  participating  in  serving  your  country.    Thank  you  very  much  for  taking  the 
<br/>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a response, in response to the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General’s Ministerial Statement this morning.  From the outset, it is a desperate 
<br/>attempt by the honourable Attorney-General to save his job.  He has not been performing in the last 
<br/>few months, 17 months in the Government.  He is trying to make a comparative analysis of what the 
<br/>previous government has done in the last 16 years.  It is just a poor attempt from the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All the improvements that he had talked about this morning, in terms of Judiciary, Legal Aid 
<br/>and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution are just continuing works of what the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government has done in the last few years.  He just needs to take it forward.  It was useless to come 
<br/>to Parliament and try to run down the previous administration.  I think he has to learn from what the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister told us yesterday, that he visited the former Prime Minister in prison.   I 
<br/>think it is all about compassionate leadership and moving forward.  You should not be stuck in the 
<br/>past if you really want to make some improvements in the portfolios that you have been given.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  FijiFirst  Government,  legal  access  through  the  Legal  Aid 
<br/>Commission,  I  think  the  FijiFirst  Government  had  developed  Legal  Aid  Commission.    It  was 
<br/>unprecedented.  It opened up offices in Nabouwalu, Taveuni and in areas where people can access.  
<br/>Last  December,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  had  a  workshop  trying  to  open  up  offices  in 
<br/>Lomaiviti, Rotuma and other places.  It is good for legal access.  He had talked about other areas in 
<br/>Dreketi, we also welcome that.  His speech today was comparing speed and quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  FijiFirst  was  there,  there  was  quality.    If  you  bring  speed  in  to  delivering  and 
<br/>clearing the backlog in our cases, you just have to visit the prison.  He is also the Minister responsible 
<br/>for Corrections.  Just visit our Remand Centre, people are still waiting for appeals and dates.  That 
<br/></span><span>shows our Corrections Centre in Suva is overcrowded, even convicted criminals in the prison waiting 
<br/></span><span>for  two  years  to  get  an  appeal  date.    These  are  some  of  the  things  that the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General needs to look into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the FijiFirst Government, the Office of the DPP developed a Serious 
<br/>Fraud Unit, Human Trafficking Unit, Child Protection Division and it also developed to separated 
<br/>legal and administrative work.  Those are the developments that have been done, you just need to 
<br/>take it forward, honourable Attorney-General and stop trying to compare the performance of the past 
<br/>government with what you need to do.  You need to focus on what needs to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  some  of  their  appointments  too  have  been  brought  in  the  limelight  that  had  been 
<br/>inconsistent with the 2013 Constitution.  I will not lament on that because I cannot talk about the 
<br/>issues that are before the courts.  I think Cabinet has already asked for an interpretation and I hope 
<br/>that those things will be brought to be consistent with the Constitution.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that when the interpretation comes out, the honourable Attorney-General still keeps
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>695 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his job.  Hearing from what the people are saying in the social media and mainstream media, they 
<br/>are talking about the weaknesses and the poor performance of the Coalition Government.  You should 
<br/>take this on board because it will help improve the work that you need to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, the previous Government has done a lot for the nation, for the Judiciary, for 
<br/>Legal Aid Commission and the Courts and access to justice. The Coalition Government just needs to 
<br/>take it forward and stop trying to run down the previous government.  That is all I have to respond 
<br/>to the honourable Attorney-General this morning, and I hope he grows up and stops acting like a 
<br/>child when he comes to this honourable Parliament.
