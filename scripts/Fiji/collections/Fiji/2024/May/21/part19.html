<br/>PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 2018–2019 ANNUAL REPORT</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that Parliament debates 
<br/>the Review of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018–2019 which was tabled on 
<br/>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister,  
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, as the Member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on 
<br/>the Review Report of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018–2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in July of last year and I wish to proceed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>directly in reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  being  with,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  a  few  issues  identified  which  the  Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>noted and those are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The high staff turnover in comparison to 2018, 2019 – todate. 
<br/>Low budget allocation for the reported year in which in turn constraints parliamentary 
<br/>work. 
<br/></span><span>Lack of awareness of the powers and authority of Parliament and its Committees by 
<br/></span><span>civil servants. 
<br/>Lack of full digitization of its Standing Committees. 
<br/>Significant number of bills stated for the reported year that stands at 88.5 percent and 
<br/>as a comparative, 99 percent for the year 2023 that were enacted under the Standing 
<br/>Order 51. 
<br/>The  Committee  notes  that  Parliament  has  considered  the  inclusive  participation  of 
<br/>communities at all levels through the medium of broadcasting and further notes the lack 
<br/>of  information  supplied  with  respect  to  the  gender  composition  within  the  two 
<br/></span><span>Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of information on gender hinders the ability of the Standing 
<br/>Committee to scrutinize the report from a gender perspective as required by the Standing Orders of 
<br/>Parliament under Section 110(2). However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of these issues were addressed 
<br/>and  clarified  by  the  Department  and  any  information  on  this  can  be  attained  or  retrieved  in  the 
<br/>Committee’s report.

<div><span>Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report  21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now go straight into the recommendations put forth by the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the consideration of this august Parliament and these are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends the timely submission of Annual Reports. 
<br/>The Committee recommends that a Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) be conducted for the 
<br/>Department given that the last JEE was conducted in the reported year. 
<br/>The Committee further recommends the upgrading of IT systems and full digitization 
<br/>of Committee sittings. 
<br/>The Committee further recommends that the Standing Orders be amended to review the 
<br/>use of Standing Order 51 by referring it to a specific sub-committee. 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Department  ensure  that  there  is  formal  SDG 
<br/>compliant component in all future reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture  I  would  also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the 
<br/>Department in tabling a substantive response to the Committee’s review report as set out in Section 
<br/>121(6) of the Standing Orders of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to present this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I ask the honourable Members to take note of this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  For 
<br/>the information of honourable Members, I have a list here of speakers and they will be speaking in 
<br/>the following order: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. K.K. Lal; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. M.D. Bulitavu; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  in  support  of  the  report  and  to  provide  my 
<br/>contribution.  I commend the Committee, this Report was tabled in April, and we can see that we 
<br/>now have fully fledged report here for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the immediate attention and collective action that we need to focus 
<br/></span><span>on is the consistency of staff turnovers.  The report highlights the pertinent issue of staff turnover 
<br/></span><span>from  2018,  2019  to  present.    High  turnover  rates  are  6.01:40  to  the  efficiency  and  continuity  of 
<br/>Parliamentary operations.  They lead to loss of institutional knowledge, decreased productivity and 
<br/>increased training costs.  Sustainability in staffing is crucial for maintaining the effective functioning 
<br/>of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other area I would like speak on is the lack of awareness or the powers 
<br/>and authority of Parliament and its Committees by civil servant.  Not only civil servants but I think 
<br/>we need to focus on creating more awareness for our younger generation.  We look forward to the 
<br/></span><span>Women’s Parliament and in previous sessions, I recommended to Parliament that we try and get a 
<br/></span><span>Youth Parliament as  well.  The younger generation are keen to  be part of how the democratic or 
<br/>legislature process of the country is currently being handled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about Parliament, we talk about freedom of speech, freedom 
<br/>of MPs doing our work.  Recently there was a case where honourable Member Rinesh made some 
<br/>opinions on social media and he was bullied by one of the Ministers.  The young people are talking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024         Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>745 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about this, Sir, how much freedom do they have to provide an opinion with respect to Parliament.  
<br/>We are talking about Parliament report, we should have the freedom that citizens of Fiji should be 
<br/>given the right to give their opinion and not be bullied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  see  that  Parliament  is  fully  digitalized.    I  understand  there  was  a 
<br/>extensive amount of funding allocated which was $4.6 million (I do not know the exact details where 
<br/>this funding was allocated) but we are still facing some technical issues and I hope our very talented 
<br/>IT officers can get down to the issues and solve that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last think I want to speak on, the most important one which we have been debating all these 
<br/>while  when  Bills  come  with  Standing  Order  51.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  highlights  the 
<br/>significant  number  of  Bills  enacted  under  Standing  Order  51  with  a  notable  increase  from  88.5 
<br/>percent in the reported year to 99 percent in 2023.  While this indicates a high legislative activity, it 
<br/>also raises the concerns about thoroughness of the legislative process.  The expedited procedures of 
<br/>Standing Order 51 should not be compromised, the quality of scrutiny and debate is carried out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, previous Oppositions were all about going to the consultation process, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now when they are in Government, some of them are in Government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Were you there, honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I was not part of the previous Opposition but I did research and went on  
<br/>and checked some of the </span><span>Hansard Reports.  </span><span> Some of these honourable Members were talking about 
<br/>consultation but now they are doing the opposite when they are in Government.  The people of Fiji 
<br/>are  watching,  they  will  hold  us  accountable  for  the  words  and  the  for  the  sentences  we  use  in 
<br/>Parliament.  With those words I have nothing more to add but all I have to say is we need a Youth 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are young people who are out there who see some of us speaking, some of us engaging, 
<br/>debating and they want to become future parliamentarians as well but they need this learning ground 
<br/>which  is  the  Youth  Parliament.    I  request  the  Government  to  increase  the  budget  for  Parliament 
<br/>(maybe the honourable Minister for Finance if he is listening to me) please increase the budget for 
<br/>Parliament and also if you can engage some money for the Youth Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute and support the motion that is 
<br/>currently being debated in this august Parliament.  I first of all would like to pay my respect to a 
<br/></span><span>member of the staff that we lost earlier in the month.  He has been a very loyal servant of the People 
<br/></span><span>in Parliament of Fiji, may his soul rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been described that it is the People’s House, Parliament is the people’s 
<br/>House,  the  highest  Court  of  the  land.    This  august  Parliament  is  the  third  arm  of  Government,  it 
<br/>carries a constitutional responsibility to make laws, and to hold accountable the Executive and the 
<br/>Judiciary in a balancing act required by and for the separation of powers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I reported in the morning, Sir, my delegation and I had visited the Speaker of the House 
<br/></span><span>of Commons last week. It was a very happy visit and as I stated this morning that Mr. Hoyle,  Speaker 
<br/></span><span>of the House of Commons was only too willing to render his assistance to strengthen this Parliament. 
<br/>I hope that in the not too distant future you will have a delegation going out to visit the House of 
<br/>Commons, particularly to visit Malborough House again. The root of the constitutional changes that 
<br/>had happened to Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report  21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Returning  to  the  Report  before  Parliament,  Sir,  I  want  to  firstly  commend  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee for their Report.  For latter half of the period under review, I was the Leader of the loyal 
<br/>Opposition in this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow  me,  Sir,  to  acknowledge  you  as  the  honourable  Speaker,  the  Secretary-General  to 
<br/>Parliament and all the staff of the Legislature for the long hours of dedicated service rendered to the 
<br/>nation.  I am aware few staff have also passed on since Parliament was re-established in 2014 after 
<br/>its last sitting in 2006 and I recognise the often-difficult environment the Secretariat operated in.  I 
<br/>must  also  commend,  Sir,  the  new  Standing  Orders  issued  in  July  2023  which  is  now  serving 
<br/>Parliament very well.  I now turn to the Report and recommendations made therein.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to express my concern at the length of time 
<br/>taken to review this Report, it has been eight months. This seems unusually long when no public 
<br/>consultation were held by the Committee or is perhaps due to the delay in responses to queries made 
<br/>by the Committee.  I also note that the Report ruled the limited number of Committee sitting days.  
<br/>Perhaps in future, Sir, all reports being reviewed by the Standing Committees of Parliament should 
<br/>be open for public comments.  In this  way, we  parliamentarians  and all agencies funded from  the 
<br/>appropriations approved by Parliament, should know the views of the people on how their taxes have 
<br/>been used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All annual reports are now in digital format, so they may be simply emailed out to citizens 
<br/>and organisations who, perhaps, sign up to be on the Parliament email distribution list, and they can 
<br/>make oral or written submissions to the Standing Committees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  support  the  recommendation  for  the  timely  submission  of  the  Annual 
<br/>Reports. This is a legal requirement breached by the consistent delay across the whole of Government 
<br/>in submitting Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Financial Management Act requires Annual Reports to be tabled to Parliament promptly 
<br/>and the failure to comply was evident when I was the Leader of the Opposition where we debating 
<br/>reports from 2007 and some Ministries and agencies had not submitted Annual Reports since 2013. 
<br/>Perhaps, it was due to no sittings between 2006 and 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a sad state of affairs and continues today, and I continue to urge Ministers to ensure 
<br/></span><span>their Ministries and any Commissions and statutory bodies under their portfolio must report promptly 
<br/></span><span>to Parliament as required by the Financial Management Act 2004. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For another job evaluation exercise, as there continues to be a high turnover in the Parliament 
<br/>Secretariat.  Perhaps, it is time to consider bonding or having a retention package so that we can get 
<br/>a return of investments made by Government in their development and training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those who proceed on study leave with pay, that the Secretary-General considers bonding 
<br/></span><span>them for a certain period of time after they come back and those who undertake trainings, conferences 
<br/>and workshops whether in Fiji or overseas, to be similarly bonded or encouraged to stay on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we do not want to stunt career progression of civil servants, Government must take 
<br/>steps to  safeguard the investments  made by taxpayers in civil  servants  to, at  least,  benefit on the 
<br/>knowledge and development gained for some time before they are released. Other people are  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024         Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>747 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>harvesting our human resource development programme, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service and Parliament, I find it commendable 
<br/>that  international  agencies,  regional  agencies,  NGOs  and  Embassies  find  our  civil  servants  to  be 
<br/>exceptional additions to their workforce.  However, as Head of Government and Minister responsible 
<br/>for the Civil Service, this is a consideration to be made across the Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has been implemented with the upgrade of the IT system and digitisation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Committee sittings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  review  of  the  Standing  Orders,  in  particular,  the  use  of  Standing 
<br/>Order 51, the review has already been carried out last year. I feel, Sir, that I must discuss Standing 
<br/>Order 51 in some detail, given the protests from the loyal Opposition to its use in the Bills tabled 
<br/>yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  you  are  aware,  as  a  former  Cabinet  Minister  yourself,  Standing  Order  51  has  always 
<br/>existed in the Standing Orders in some format. This is to allow Government of the day to fast-track 
<br/>urgent  legislations,  where  consultation  is  not  possible,  in  an  emergency  or  where  extensive 
<br/>consultations have already been carried out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Sir, that the extensive use of Standing Order 51 - the initial part of the revival of 
<br/>our legislation, we were probably coming out of a period when there was no legislation carried out 
<br/>in Parliament.  Bills were coming out of a period of legislating by Decree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember that very well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1987, I ruled by Decree from September to 
<br/>December of that year.  I passed 25 Decrees.  My first one was saying that we are now Republic and 
<br/>then my last one – Decree No. 25, I said that I am no longer the Leader of this Republic.  I handed 
<br/>over leadership to His Excellency the President and asked him to get a new Constitution, get a new 
<br/>Prime Minister and get us moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, when we were going through that period, when we had to use Standing Order 51, it was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>perhaps, that we were just coming out of the era when we ruled by Decree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are pretty much in order, and I support them.  On Recommendation 5, I propose that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this requirement apply to the Annual Reports from the Ministries, Departments, Commissions, 
<br/>Statutory Bodies and Public Enterprises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope, Sir, that my comments will be taken as constructive and in the interest of the nation.  
<br/>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this debate and I commend the motion 
<br/></span><span>to Parliament.  May we continue to work collaboratively for the betterment of Fiji, and I support the 
<br/></span><span>motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a short contribution to the  motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is before Parliament and that is the Review Report for Parliament for 2018 to 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>748 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report  21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of the issues that are covered in the key findings of our Report has been covered by 
<br/>previous speakers - the honourable Prime Minister and also honourable Ketan Lal and some will be 
<br/>covered  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance.  But  I  hope  it  is  not  boring,  given  that  all  those 
<br/>participating in this particular debate are from Vanua Levu and this is the Parliament of Fiji and you 
<br/>being the Speaker, Sir. I hope it will not be biased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we thank the Secretary-General and your  Office, Sir, for responding 
<br/>to our recommendations. We have received it, it has come in a very timely manner and also at a time 
<br/>when we are debating it at the moment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the response from Fiji Parliament in terms of the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE), as also 
<br/>recommended, I think the Parliament has assured the Committee that there will be a comprehensive 
<br/>assessment  to  the  current  roles  and  also  some  structural  changes  in  the  organisation’s  structural 
<br/>reform that will be taken. It will ensure the improvements in the organisation and also ensure that a 
<br/>Job Evaluation is conducted with its greatest possible level accuracy and efficacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The assurance in terms of recommendation for IT upgrade in the Chamber and also in the 
<br/>Committee rooms will also be prioritised.  I thank Parliament for responding to the Committee in a 
<br/>very timely manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the assurance from the honourable Prime Minister that this will follow suit for the other 
<br/>Ministries as well when Parliament makes recommendations that the Standing Orders are complied 
<br/>with  in  terms  of  the  14  days  and  21days  for  the  responses  to  come  back  because  it  helps  the 
<br/>Committee in making improvements in other future reports that it will deliberate on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  issue  of  Standing  Order  51,  I  think  a  lot  has  been  said  by  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister.  We all will agree that any Government of the day will always use Standing Order 51 to 
<br/>fast-track  Bills.  It  was  used  before  and  used  again  now,  but  there  is  always  argument  from  the 
<br/>Opposition to suggest that it has been overused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the statistics that were there, what we found in our deliberations as a 
<br/>Committee, given the higher number of Bills that were coming under Standing Order 51 and also the 
<br/>role of the Standing Orders Committee to deliberate on Bills, when suggested an amendment to the 
<br/>Standing Orders, I think this is not appropriate forum to discuss it but there is a Standing Orders 
<br/>Committee that is there under the Standing Orders in which you, Mr. Speaker, is the Chairperson, 
<br/>probably  the Committee was suggesting a discretion to  be with  you, Sir, in  terms  of approving  a 
<br/></span><span>particular Bill, whether it should go through Standing Order 51 rather than going to Committee of 
<br/></span><span>the Whole, given the high statistics we have seen in the Committee while we deliberating.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  as  we  move  forward,  probably  more  Bills  will  be  coming.  I  have  seen  some  Bills 
<br/>coming this week, and looking forward to other Bills that will be referred to the Committee this week 
<br/>and yet to be tabled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  the  Committee  has  seen  is  the  allocation  of  more  funding  to 
<br/>Parliament.  That  is  quite  urgent  -  increasing  the  Committee  work  and  also  more  staff  could  be 
<br/></span><span>recruited in which it will need more funding. I hope the honourable Minister of Finance who will 
<br/></span><span>speak after me, will also assure us, given that we are yet to come to the Budget, that probably the 
<br/>request from the Standing Committee can be taken on board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  what  the  Committee  has  found  in  a  few  cases  that  when  Parliament  makes  its 
<br/>submission to the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economy before, most of the time the full 
<br/>submission is not taken on board. So, I hope that we show special preference to our Parliament and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024         Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>749 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also that it is prioritised because it is the house of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the things that the Committee has noted and I have also been assured by 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister that in terms of civil servants and the authority of Parliament, that that 
<br/>is something that we all need to take part in, especially Government Ministers, in encouraging their 
<br/>civil servants or Permanent Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, that they need to appear before the 
<br/>Standing Committees when communication comes to them, given that certain powers that are with 
<br/>Standing Committees are equivalent to the powers of the High Court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committees can also summon people and also compel documents, but we do not 
<br/>want to exercise those powers.  We want to build that relationship with civil servants so that they do 
<br/>not fear the Parliamentary Standing Committee for any submission.  But, again, there needs to be 
<br/>some awareness in this particular area on the Powers of Parliament and also on how civil servants 
<br/>can work with Members of Parliament, especially on the information and they are the ones who will 
<br/>be implementing the policies.  At the end of the day, it comes in the form of annual report and that 
<br/>will be deliberated by the Standing Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister and honourable Members who have spoken before me.  Let me begin by saying that I feel 
<br/>this Parliament is now a much happier place to come to and I feel that as a group of legislators, we 
<br/>are now doing our work without fear and uncertainty.  I feel very good about it  - good about the 
<br/>environment, good about the feeling of bipartisanship, despite at times some bitter and acrimonious 
<br/>debates.  For that Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank you for your wise counsel, guidance and reliable 
<br/>leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, I also want to say that the honourable Prime Minister himself, within the 
<br/>Government and within this side of the Parliament, has always provided a leadership direction that 
<br/>brings about bipartisanship that feels that you like to come to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  can say this,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the eight years that  I was in  Opposition, sometimes I 
<br/>actually did not feel like coming to Parliament. I am very happy that, that is a past, and we are moving 
<br/>forward as a real democratic Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2023-2024 Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament was allocated $16.2 million, compared 
<br/>to $8.6 million for the 2022-2023 financial year.  No doubt the increase in the allocation by over $7.6 
<br/>million has been prudently utilised by Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other very important point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to the budget 
<br/>and under your guidance and leadership, that too has come to fruition.  In fact, Sir, you would recall 
<br/>that  after  2014  Elections,  in  2015,  the  formula  for  funding  political  parties,  funding  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament for the duties that they undertake as legislators was unilaterally chained, and particularly 
<br/>the  Opposition  suffered  in  a  big  way.      I  am  happy  that  under  your  leadership  and  under  our 
<br/>Government, we have ensured that the political parties, their officers and also the budget allocation 
<br/>for the Members in terms of the allowances is adequate for them to undertake their duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  increase  in  this  year’s  budget  as  you  would  know  that  it  has  allowed  Parliament  to 
<br/></span><span>increase its awareness programmes including the Standing Committee meetings, the preparation of 
<br/>the 2024 – 2025 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to ensure that the IT systems and the full digitization of the Committee meetings are 
<br/>also undertaken.  We know that the Fiji Parliament is mainstreaming gender issues in its legislative 
<br/>processes and oversight functions including in its corporate policy.

<div><span>Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report  21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that Fiji Parliament has also plans to translate </span><span>Hansard </span><span>into vernacular – </span><span>Vosa vaka 
<br/>Viti</span><span>  and  </span><span>Hindi  </span><span>and  translation  into  braille  will  also  be  an  enormous  undertaking  by  the  Fijian 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  very  pleased  to  say  that  under  your  leadership,  the  Parliament  has 
<br/>engaged translators to provide translation from vernacular to English during Parliament sittings.  This 
<br/>is very well appreciated and accepted by everyone in the country that after a long time, we have the 
<br/>ability  or  environment  to  actually  use  our  vernacular  language  to  make  our  points  as  we  see 
<br/>sometimes being done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $4.4. million was allocated in the 2023–2024 Budget, in supporting Parliament’s 
<br/>community  strategy  with  the  purchase  of  multi-language  captioning  system  that  will  enable 
<br/>Parliament to be a more inclusive and increase citizen engagement in the three languages that will be 
<br/>televised and livestreamed on the internet.  I know that the digitization of the is still in progress.  I 
<br/>am sure that this will be completed in a very short period of time, perhaps in the next few months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to also say that between 2018 and 2023-2024, a total of $61,526,389 has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocated to Parliament; the highest being in the current budget of $16.2 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Financial  Management  Act  under  section  37(a)  of  2004,  all  independent  officers 
<br/>including  the  Parliament  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  is  expected  to  be  adequately  resourced  and 
<br/>independently  provided  resources  so  that  the  Legislature  can  do  its  work  without  any  hinderance 
<br/>from anywhere.  We are very pleased that the budget that was allocated in the 2023-2024 Budget has 
<br/>allowed  the  Parliament,  as  an  independent  body,  to  achieve  those  objectives  which  support  the 
<br/>practice of democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say this to my Opposition colleagues and to all those who have a 
<br/>view  about  Government,  we  may  not  agree  on  the  performance  of  the  Government,  on  how  the 
<br/>Government has done in the last 17 to 18 months, but one thing Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all can agree 
<br/>that we now have an air of freedom, we now have a practice of democracy …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … we have a Parliament where legislators can feel free and 
<br/>can talk to each other; this is the feedback.  I have to be very honest to say this. When we go around, 
<br/></span><span>when you talk to the business community, they actually take the queue from Parliament, they look at 
<br/></span><span>your  leadership  and  many  people  have  come  to  me,  not  just  people  in  Fiji,  internationally,  our 
<br/>development  partners  and  they  highly  appreciate  the  fact  that  under  your  leadership,  under  the 
<br/>leadership of the Prime Minister and this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There is now a practice of democracy and all the indicators, 
<br/>the recent Freedom House   Index, puts us up there.  The removal of the draconian Media Decree,  
<br/></span><span>all these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has allowed Parliament to be the beacon of democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under your leadership is a temple 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of democracy and that is the biggest change that we have seen in the last 18 months.
