<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 (Bill No. 03/2024), be considered

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other committee of Parliament;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the 
<br/>Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Meteorological and Hydrological Bill 
<br/>2024  seeks  to  establish  and  recognise  the  Fiji  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Services,  and 
<br/>empowers the Director of Meteorological Services to carry out his or her duties in the most effective 
<br/></span><span>manner  -  having  practical  provisions  of  weather  forecast  and  promotion  of  public  sector  private 
<br/></span><span>engagement in the delivery of weather services in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, there is no established legal provisions with regulating meteorological and 
<br/>hydrological  services  in  Fiji.  This  proposed  legislation  aims  to  outline  the  establishment  and 
<br/>responsibilities  of  the  Fiji  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Services  which  is  currently  the  Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  service  may,  in  future,  be  established  as  a  body  corporate  responsible  for  providing 
<br/></span><span>meteorological  and  hydrological  services  and  carrying  out  functions  just  outlined  in  the  Bill.    It 
<br/></span><span>provides for the effective and efficient provision of meteorological and hydrological services in order 
<br/>to  contribute  to  a  sustainable  economic  development,  protection  of  livelihoods  and  property  for 
<br/>meteorological and hydrological disasters and hazards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  proposed  Bill  also  encapsulates  the  important  contribution  of  Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meteorological Services towards the Nadi Flight Information Region and in provision of aviation
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>711 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>services to selected aerodromes in the Southwest Pacific.  The Bill also recognises Fiji’s leading role 
<br/>in the region by providing weather forecasts and warnings to many of these smaller island countries 
<br/>in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of historical information, the first recorded observation in Fiji in 
<br/>terms  of  weather  was  by  a  volunteer  by  the  name  of  Robert  Fung  in  Delainasau,  Bua,  in  1871.  
<br/>Between 1876 and 1890, additional volunteers recorded the amount of rainfall at various locations, 
<br/>including Qarawalu, Waimanu, Wainunu, Suva, Nausori, Rakiraki, Ba, Lautoka and Labasa. In 1939, 
<br/>the Defence Conference designated Suva as a site of offering weather services in the Pacific region, 
<br/>marking the start of air temperature observations in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  South  Pacific  Air  Transport  Council  (SPATC)  was  founded  in  1946  to  oversee  civil 
<br/>aviation activities in the Pacific region.  The Meteorological Office in Nadi was founded by SPATC 
<br/>and functioned as a branch of the New Zealand Meteorological Services.  Its main purpose was to 
<br/>write weather services and assist in civil aviation requirements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1940, a Meteorological Office was set up as a section of the Royal New Zealand Air Force 
<br/>and  the  goal  was  to  provide  aviation  weather  forecasts  to  Military  Aircrafts  at  Laucala  Bay.  
<br/>Forecasting operations in Laucala Bay ceased in 1947 and merged with the Meteorological Office in 
<br/>Nadi,  downscaling  operations  to  collection  quality  control  and  archival  of  records  for  service 
<br/>observations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following independence in 1970, Fiji took over the role of regional aviation from SPATC. 
<br/>The  Meteorological  Service  was  established  in  July  1975  and  took  over  the  responsibility  of 
<br/>providing  forecasts  to  the  marine  and  public  sectors  as  part  of  its  expanded  services.    The  Fijian 
<br/>Government  acquired  the  ownership  of  SPATC  assets  in  July  1979,  and  managed  the  services 
<br/>provided by SPATC in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1980, Fiji become a member of the World Meteorological Organisation.  In 1982, Mr. Ram 
<br/>Krishna  was  selected  as  the  inaugural  Director  of  the  Meteorological  Services.    In  1996,  the 
<br/>Meteorological Services was designated as the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) 
<br/>for  the  Southwest  Pacific  region  to  issue  marine  forecasts  and  warnings  for  the  high  seas  or 
<br/>international waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the RSMC in Nadi is one of the only six centres globally which provides essential tropical 
<br/>cyclone  related  information,  including  the  naming  of  tropical  cyclones  and  the  related  alerts  and 
<br/></span><span>warnings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2012, for the responsibility of part forecasting was moved from the Ministry of Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Water Authority of Fiji to the Fiji Meteorological Service, a department 
<br/>within the then Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services.  Discussions have taken place 
<br/>with various organisations and institutions such as the World Meteorological Organization, World 
<br/>Bank,  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji,  National  Disaster  Management  Office,  Fiji  National 
<br/>University, University of Fiji, Red Cross, Energy Fiji Limited, Fiji Hotel Association and the various 
<br/>ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  Bill  is  also  part  of  the  policy  reforms  as  recommended  by  international 
<br/>institutions, such as World Bank to enable a more efficient and effective development partnership 
<br/>and also in terms of looking into the future financing, especially accessing of climate financing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be brief.  We understand what is in the 
<br/>Bill, but what we do not understand is the urgency. Nothing in here that is contained in the Bill says 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>712 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that there is an absolute urgency that it needs to go through Standing Order 51.  Once again, we have 
<br/>heard quite a lot from the other side, I know they will turn around and say, “Oh, you used to do it.”  
<br/>But you complained about it when we did it, so why are you doing it?  The point here is that there 
<br/>are particular provisions, first of all there is no reason.  Second of all, most importantly, they are the 
<br/>ones who turned around and told us that we go through this consultative exercise when these Bills 
<br/>are taking place.  So, why should it not go to a Committee? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Most importantly, Sir, also there are three objectives that are put into this particular Bill into 
<br/>clause 3, and one is the effective and efficient delivery of the service; two, which is important is 
<br/>actually  promoting  public  and  private  engagement.    Again,  this  would  be  a  provision  that  would 
<br/>require a Committee to have a look at it because there is public and private engagement in this.  Most 
<br/>of all, there is a provision in here, which I am sure we will argue about when it is actually on the 
<br/>floor, is that it is now going to be an offence for any other person unauthorised who is going to issue 
<br/>a weather report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my current understanding after a quick cursory glance of it.  If you put all those things 
<br/>into perspective, I think it  is only unfair to the general public and to all of those who do weather 
<br/>reports and to the people who may want to engage privately in this that it is actually, properly and 
<br/>thoroughly vetted through the Committee before it comes back to Parliament.  Otherwise, I do not 
<br/>know what the reason could be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot see for the life of me in here a reason that says that it has to be shot through quickly 
<br/>so  we  can  actually  get  this  amendment.    There  is  a  gap,  of  course,  they  said  that  there  were  no 
<br/>regulations before, all the more reason that it be thoroughly vetted before a Committee.  It is not too 
<br/>late for them to put it back just like they did with the Heritage Bill.  We ask that the Government 
<br/>have a good look at it because there are provisions that they put in there themselves that would mean 
<br/>that there would need to be proper deliberation through the Committee and a consultative exercise 
<br/>with the general public in Fiji and those who are involved in it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that particular clause that I am actually talking states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“7(1)  Any person who issues a weather warning or alert, including a flood alert or causes 
<br/>the  warning  or  alert  to  be  issued  without  prior  authorisation  of  the  Director  in 
<br/>consultation with the Minister, commits an offence.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are quite a few people around Fiji who do issue weather reports that a lot of people of 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  rely  on.    All  of  those  things  need  to  be  thoroughly  vetted.    We  are  against  it  going  through 
<br/></span><span>Standing  Order  51.    We  understand  the  content  of  the  Bill,  and  the  Bill  proper  is  actually  being 
<br/>argued, but against it going to Standing Order 51 suggests that we take it back to the Committee for 
<br/>it to be deliberated properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to contribute to the motion before 
<br/>Parliament,  particularly, again on the use of Standing Order 51.  We have nothing against the Bill, 
<br/>and  we  know  how  important  it  is,  but  there  are  few  good  reasons  as  to  why  we  would  urge  the 
<br/>Government to reconsider having this Bill to go through Standing Order 51.  For me, in looking at 
<br/></span><span>the Bill, it has included not only the Meteorological Services but the Hydrological Services as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will link this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the National Disaster Management Act which probably 
<br/>will be coming as well this week and the history behind the Hydrological Unit that is now under 
<br/>Meteorological  Services.  This  Hydrological  Unit,  Sir,  used  to  be  with  then  the  Public  Works 
<br/>Department before the establishment of Water Authority of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>713 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When Water Authority of Fiji came into existence, Sir, they shifted this Hydrological Unit to 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji, but this is what happened, and this is why I am urging the Government to 
<br/>look at the passage in which this Bill will come through. I have seen in the sitting calendar that we 
<br/>have another sitting in August, another sitting in September, sitting in October and, of course, one in 
<br/>November as well.  So, probably we can still, if they still prefer to bring it under Standing Order 51 
<br/>like yesterday, probably just put a timeline to it but go through the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go back to what I was going to explain, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  </span><span>TC Evans</span><span> was in December 
<br/>2012,  that  was  a  big  learning  for  us,  and  this  is  why  the  role  of  the  Meteorological  Unit  is  so 
<br/>important. What happened during </span><span>TC Evans</span><span>, there was heavy rainfall up in the highlands but very 
<br/>light showers in the Nadi area.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nadi Riverbank, the critical level is around 6 metres. 
<br/>So, what happened during </span><span>TC Evans</span><span>, the Meteorological Unit was giving the weather information. It 
<br/>was interpreted at National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and we gave the advisories but 
<br/>without the specific input of the Hydrological Unit. This resulted in the death of a man at the Nadi 
<br/>back road because this is what happened, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While Nadi was safe, I was at the NDMO that early morning from 3’oclock, water level was 
<br/>around 2 metres and then all of a sudden, every hour it is rising by about a metre each – three metres, 
<br/>4 metres, 5 metres and we were wondering because of what was happening in Nadi, we could not 
<br/>come to a conclusion as to why the rapid increase or rise in the water level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investigations after the death, Mr. Speaker, Sir, found out that the highlands, the rainfall 
<br/>was going at between 60 millimetres to 90 millimetres per hour. That is the new norm. The rainfall 
<br/>pattern  in  Fiji  has  changed  significantly  and  without  the  input  of  the  Hydrological  Unit,  Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Services was just giving the weather forecast, NDMO was interpreting the weather 
<br/>forecast and giving the advisories without the input of the Hydrological Unit, it resulted in the death 
<br/>and that was why it was shifted out of WAF so that they can be co-located with the Meteorological 
<br/>Services  but  they  have  very  specific  functions  to  perform,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  is  why  I  am 
<br/>requesting, give us time because we need to relate this with the NDMO Act that is coming soon as 
<br/>well. We have been consulted. I have been consulted too about the NDMO Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why I am urging Government to please consider this to be put 
<br/>before the Committee is because of the role of the Meteorological Office in the Paris Agreement, 
<br/>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).   I advised you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we 
<br/>went to Tonga on the signs in Fiji is handled by the Meteorological Office.  He is the focal point, the 
<br/>Director Meteorological.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to look at that given the role of IPCC in the climate change and we have our Climate 
<br/>Act which probably we need to look at it as well so that we can come up with a better approach when 
<br/>it comes to the final contents of the Bill.  Again, nothing against what we have, we know the need 
<br/>but,  of course, based on these two issues, I would urge Government  to  please consider this to  be 
<br/>brought before the Committee and we can bring it back say  in September or October but at least put 
<br/>it through the Committee so that we can tie up all these issues so that we can be relevant and it is not 
<br/>only about now, but it is about the future as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to first of all congratulate the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister  for  bringing  this  Bill  into  Parliament  and  to  Cabinet  and  the  fact  that  it  has  come  to 
<br/>Parliament. A lot of hard work has gone to it, through the work of the staff at the Fiji Meteorological 
<br/>including  the  assistance  of  the  World  Meteorological  Organisations  in  its  initial  drafting.    I 
<br/>congratulate all the members of the staff there, Teri Atalifo, Misa Funaki  they are no longer with us 
<br/>and the current management for bringing it through because it was great that we have finally got to 
<br/>this stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>714 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a lot of things in this Bill that I endorse but there are also issues here that we really 
<br/>have  to  look  at  carefully  and  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  has  talked  about  the  number  of 
<br/>consultations they have done. Those consultations were done amongst stakeholders at the executive 
<br/>level but in a Bill like this which is talking about establishing a new organisation that runs on its own, 
<br/>I think it needs to be also considered at the legislative level by the representatives of the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The representatives of the people are in Parliament, they have to have an opportunity through 
<br/>the Committees, this is the operational arm of Parliament to look as some of the issues that have been 
<br/>raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and a few others.  Some of the issues that the 
<br/>honourable Koya has raised some of the other issues, the other one that we have here is of course, 
<br/>the idea has been for it to be a standalone orgnisation that is able to charge fees for its services, which 
<br/>is to my mind is a good idea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  it  needs  to  be  thoroughly  scrutinized  at  the  level  of  the  legislature  itself  and  that 
<br/>thorough scrutiny is done by the Committees of Parliament.  Now, I will encourage the Government 
<br/>to reconsider this and as the honourable Leader of the Opposition has stated to allow sometime to get 
<br/>the Committees to have a look at it, to call the people that we need to call, to listen to alternative 
<br/>views and then to come up with its recommendation to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is not worth to highlight before Parliament.  
<br/>There was a Bill in 2016 and it lapsed, no action taken by the FijiFirst Government.  In 2022 there 
<br/>was a draft, Coalition came in, sees all the issues, addressed it, consulted with the officers and we 
<br/>bring it to Parliament.  There are only 12 simple provisions.  What happens, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>powers of meteorology is drawn from various legislation.  Ideally for one who works in that office, 
<br/>they would like a legislation on it. They want to take ownership, that is the simple reason.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was an issue raised in terms of offence, yes that is the reason why it is not in the Act, 
<br/>it is in the Regulations. There have been issues, deliberated with the officers what has happened in 
<br/>the past and obviously the same officers that they consulted, the same officers we are consulting.  For 
<br/>the past  weeks we have  been  consulting, there have been  collaboration between the office of the 
<br/>Director NDMO and the honourable Minister.  The people need this, the Meteorological Office needs 
<br/>it, we need to move this.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2060 is a long time, we are now in 2024.  I support this 
<br/>Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to some of the concerns raised, 
<br/>the  Standing  Orders,  of  course,    is  an  ongoing  debate  and  it  is  a  provision  there  which  we  will 
<br/></span><span>continue  to  utilise  but  in  a  responsible  and  pragmatic  way.    Unlike  in  the  past,  it  was  used 
<br/></span><span>irresponsibly and, of course, we see the data there and how many Bills they have passed using that.  
<br/>We will move forward in that using it in a pragmatic and responsible way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  issue  of  public  private  engagement,  that  is  there  as  an  option,  and  that  is 
<br/>something we need to move forward with in terms of the current environment within, in relation to 
<br/>development partners which are not probably Government’s but also in the private sector in terms of 
<br/>making investments and returns of investments.  That is also well covered in terms of formulation of 
<br/>MOAs, MOUs, which, of course, will be thoroughly scrutinised through the systems in the Executive, 
<br/></span><span>such as Cabinet sub-committees, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The weather reports and the concern about the fines, the provision is there for the Minister to 
<br/>have further regulations.  We will not be surprising everyone who is just making an announcement 
<br/>about  the  weather  because  that  is  what  they  are  implying  and  that  would  be  addressed  that  way.  
<br/>Regarding the concerns about the coordination and operations, we have consulted, as mentioned by 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General.

<div><span>The NDMO, the Hydrological Services and where it could be best placed, thank you to the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition for his insights and, of course, that is taken into account when 
<br/>we are looking into the operational part of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was mention of Meteorological Services to be standalone.  Yes, the Bill will give us an 
<br/>option, moving forward, whether it becomes fully standalone or statutory but, at least, we are taking 
<br/>the first step towards that.  It also molds well into the current environment in terms of our engagement 
<br/>with our international development partners.
