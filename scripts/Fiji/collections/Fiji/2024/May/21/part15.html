<h3>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK</h3>
<div><span>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that Parliament approves that Fiji signs and 
<br/></span><span>ratifies the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Overarching Agreement; 
<br/>the Clean Economy Agreement; and  
<br/>the Fair Economy Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We are becoming a merry go round now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a United 
<br/>States-led initiative. It was launched in 2022 with its founding members including Australia, Brunei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>721 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, 
<br/>Singapore,  Thailand  and  Vietnam.  The  IPEF  comprise  four  pillars  of  co-operation  amongst  its 
<br/>partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pillar 1 focuses on Trade, Pillar 2 on Supply Chain, Pillar 3 on a Clean Economy and Pillar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4 on a Fair Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  year,  Parliament  unanimously  approved  the  ratification  of  the  Agreement  relating  to 
<br/>Supply Chain Resilience which was negotiated under Pillar II (Supply Chain).  This Agreement, the 
<br/>first of IPEF Agreement to take effect, came into force on February this year, marking a significant 
<br/>milestone of Fiji’s economic and strategic partnerships with Indo-Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently,  IPEF  negotiators  have  successfully  concluded  agreements  on  Pillar  III  (Clean 
<br/>Economy) and Pillar IV (Fair Economy), along with overarching agreement to ensure a sustainable 
<br/>framework for future ministerial level cooperation among IPEF partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each of these IPEF Agreements presented to Parliament has been meticulously negotiated to 
<br/>align with our national interests and a broader vision of a prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have an overarching agreement, formally called the Agreement on IPEF, which sets forth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a clear and structured approach to achieving the objectives of IPEF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  does  this  by  establishing  a  governing  body  -  the  IPEF  Council,  that  is  composed  of 
<br/>ministerial-level representatives from each Party, responsible for overseeing the implementation and 
<br/>coordination of the IPEF agreements.  This IPEF Council is tasked with considering the collective 
<br/>operational matters, proposing new agreements and discussing amendments with decisions made by 
<br/>consensus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  overarching  agreement  also  establishes  a  Joint  Commission  which  comprises  of 
<br/>representatives from parties to specific subject agreements, overseeing the implementation of those 
<br/>agreements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have next the IPEF Agreement relating to Clean Economy under Pillar III of the IPEF for 
<br/>ratification.   This Agreement marks a crucial step towards promoting a sustainable future for Fiji 
<br/>and our regional partners.  Allow me to summarize its key elements and the substantial benefits it 
<br/>will bring to our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  IPEF  Clean  Economy  Agreement,  although  largely  non-binding, 
<br/>provides an economic framework aimed at supporting the climate goals of participating countries.  It 
<br/>focusses on accelerating the deployment of clean technologies and facilitating investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under this Agreement, the IPEF partners, including Fiji, will collaborate on the following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three issues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>research and development of clean energy technologies; 
<br/></span><span>commercialisation and deployment of these technologies to ensure they are accessible 
<br/></span><span>and affordable; and 
<br/>building infrastructure that supports de-carbonisation efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Agreement  emphasises  the  importance  of  investing  in  climate-friendly  projects, 
<br/>partnering with the private sector to leverage market opportunities in the clean economy, and creating 
<br/>quality job opportunities through industrialization.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>722 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support these initiatives, this Agreement offers financing options, technical assistance and 
<br/>capacity building measures.  The United States has also introduced complementary initiatives such 
<br/>as the Global Climate Fund and the Catalytic Capital Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Agreement  presents  opportunities  to  advance  clean  energy 
<br/>technologies,  attract  investments  to  build  climate  resilience,  and  supports  sustainable  economic 
<br/>growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, this Agreement establishes an annual IPEF Investor Forum.  The inaugural forum 
<br/>will be hosted by Singapore on 5</span><span>th</span><span> to 6</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024 (next month), providing a platform for investors 
<br/>to connect and share ideas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  IPEF  Clean  Economy  Agreement  is  a  vital  tool  for  Fiji’s 
<br/>development and our global climate commitments.  Ratifying this Agreement will enable significant 
<br/>advancements in our clean energy sector, attract essential investments and above all, enhances our 
<br/>economic resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, honourable Members, we have the Agreement relating to a Fair Economy under Pillar 
<br/>IV.  This  Agreement is  a pivotal  step towards enhancing  transparency, combating  corruption and 
<br/>fostering a fair economic environment within our region.  Let me outline the key components and 
<br/>anticipated benefits of this Agreement for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  IPEF  Economy  Agreement  is  dedicated  to  combating  corruption,  enhancing  tax 
<br/>administration and transparency, and fostering corporation among partner countries.  This Agreement 
<br/>prioritises  anti-corruption  initiatives,  transparency  in  tax  matters  and  capacity  building  efforts  to 
<br/>establish a transparent and predictable trade and investment environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Agreement has three main areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Preventing and combating corruptions and related to financial crimes 
<br/>Improving tax administration and transparency; and  
<br/>Co-operation, information sharing and capacity building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through collaboration on these issues, we will create a more transparent and predictable trade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and investment environment across our economies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  IPEF  Fair  Economy  Agreement  offers  Fiji  a  significant 
<br/></span><span>opportunity  to  enhance  our  economic  framework,  atttract  investments  and  promote  sustainable 
<br/>growth.  This Agreement aligns with our commitment to transparency, fairness and good governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ratification of the IPEF Agreements will mark a significant milestone in 
<br/>Fiji’s commitment to regional co-operation and sustainable development.  It will also demonstrate 
<br/>our strong commitment to the shared goals of prosperity and stability within the Indo-Pacific region.  
<br/>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  move  that  Parliament  approves  that  Fiji  ratifies  the  tabled  IPEF 
<br/>Agreements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a list of speakers in front of me from the honourable Whips, as follows : 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. F.S. Koya; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>723 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. P.D. Kumar;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Attorney-General and Minister for Justice; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. I.B. Seruiratu; and 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Hon.  Deputy Prime  Minister  and Minister for  Trade, Cooperatives, Small  and Medium 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very happy to hear that the honourable Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General was distracted by us rather than him saying, ‘destructed by us, Sir’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  quite  a  momentous  occasion  for  all  Fijians  because  as  rightfully 
<br/>pointed out by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small 
<br/>and Medium Enterprises and Communications, this is an important milestone for Fiji that we need to 
<br/>get it through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPEF Agreement which we all know when it started, et cetera, and the 
<br/>trials and tribulations that they have actually gone through to get to this stage, aims to establish some 
<br/>very high  standard commitments with respect  to  the four Pillars.  As spelt out  by the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General, IPEF actually covers four Pillars and we must remember right from the outset that 
<br/>it is not actually a Free Trade agreement. But it is a stepping stone and a starting, I think, for many 
<br/>things to happen in the future, especially for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important things that people forget, and I think everyone 
<br/>needs to be reminded, is that all of these 14 members tantamount to 40 percent of the global GDP, 
<br/>Sir, and that is 28 percent of the global goods and services trade.  So, you have got some fairly high-
<br/>powered people and countries that are actually part and parcel of IPEF. We are the only SIDS country 
<br/>that sits at the front table when we were invited from the beginning, so we should be very proud of 
<br/>the fact that we, Fiji, is a part and parcel of that particular 14 countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand also how the negotiations have gone on, we have kept a track 
<br/>on and I think if I remember correctly, right at the outset,  beginning of post-election, I had a quick 
<br/>word with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and 
<br/>Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  to  say,  “please,  keep  an  eye  on  this  because  it  is  very 
<br/>important for Fiji.”  He has done so, and I thank the honourable Minister for all the hard work that is 
<br/>going on, especially the hard work that is being done by the Trade Team at the Ministry of Trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know they have worked very long hours to get through this. It has been literally done at a 
<br/>great neck speed because the USA has insisted, and I understand the level of travel that he has had 
<br/>to go through to actually get all of these things done.  This is one of the reasons why we were asking 
<br/>for your Ministry to get more money so that you get all of these done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were quite a lot of negotiations around the world with respect to all 
<br/>the four Pillars that has actually happened.  The first Pillar that was alluded to was on Supply Chain 
<br/>Agreement in the States in May 2023.  Pillar II has also been signed now by the 14 IPEF Partners.  
<br/></span><span>Basically, Sir, there is another portion to it which is the Overarching Agreement that also exists which 
<br/></span><span>looks at establishing the IPEF Council and a Joint Council and formalising the partnership between 
<br/>the 14 countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a Clean Economy Agreement which was also mentioned. The main objective of that 
<br/>is to accelerate clean energy transitions in scale and reduce the cost of innovative technologies.  All 
<br/>of these also bodes well for Fiji in terms of the diversification that we talk about in terms of wanting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  make sure that  we  reach the milestones that  we do in  terms  of SDGs.  So, it has many, many 
<br/>tentacles to it that reaches different parts of our economy, different parts of our plans and different 
<br/>parts of our development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, and I cannot say this enough, and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has pointed 
<br/>out that this is such an important Agreement to Fiji and we are wholeheartedly supporting it.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue is with respect to the Fair Economy Agreement.  With that particular portion, 
<br/>Sir, this actually focusses on preventing and combatting corruption, improving tax administration 
<br/>and transparency and promoting cooperation amongst the partner countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had pointed out yesterday, Sir, this was one of the reasons why such an institution of FICAC 
<br/>is so important to this particular Agreement.  They keep an eye on it, they want to check with respect 
<br/>to our corruption, et cetera, the tax administration we have had for many years and I had a quick 
<br/>conversation with the honourable Minister of Finance today regarding the situation with the European 
<br/>Union and us being blacklisted.  We are still blacklisted in the EU, so it becomes a huge obstacle.  
<br/>This is a phenomenal and fantastic steppingstone for us for bigger and better things with respect to 
<br/>this particular economic framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All the necessary steps have also been taking place. I understand all the legal framework, the 
<br/>legal scrubbing, and this is actually for a trade agreement is being run in record time.  We have had 
<br/>assistance also, I think, from consultants, et cetera, but our team, I know, and a massive, massive 
<br/>congratulations to the team at the Trade Unit.  They have done really, really well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be said that these are a bunch of young people, very young Fijians 
<br/>who have been part and parcel of this particular negotiations.  I know for a fact that we have had 
<br/>consultations  with  the  Solicitor-General’s  Office,  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General,  FICAC,  et 
<br/>cetera, in terms of the negotiations and the legal scrubbing that actually has to go on, the stakeholder 
<br/>consultations  had  been  wide  and  varied,  so  all  of  these  things  and  all  the  Ministries  have  been 
<br/>consulted on this.  We have had consultations with the lawyers, accountants and also the UNDP.  
<br/>Basically, when the honourable Minister went the last time, I know he was very well armed with 
<br/>respect to ensuring that all the consultative processes had taken place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important part of this particular IPEF infrastructure, Sir, and I am sure the 
<br/>honourable Minister will explain, is that we also get to a stage where there is support being given to 
<br/></span><span>particular infrastructure projects and these projects could mean some rural infrastructure projects, 
<br/></span><span>funding support, whether it is to do with garbage refuse, whether it is to do with Water Authority, 
<br/>whether it is to do with zero carbon, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I said, it has many tentacles that touches every part of every Fijian’s lives.  There are many 
<br/>hydro projects, so projects that may come out of this and it is being wholeheartedly supported.  There 
<br/>is a Climate Tech Trek also that exists within it. I understand the Ministry has submitted quite a few 
<br/>projects onto that particular site where they may get assistance.  I think someone already has begun.  
<br/>There are some female entrepreneurs who were ready to be assisted, but I am not sure how far that 
<br/></span><span>has gone, but that was from the private sector.  It is not just the Governments that were involved in 
<br/></span><span>this, some of the large US tech companies are actually part and parcel of it.  They provide training, 
<br/>et cetera, for many of our SMEs that want to be a part of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is a bit of a background on it, what people must realise is as I said right 
<br/>from the beginning, this is massively beneficial for Fiji and this is why you saw me stand up and 
<br/>second the motion and support this. We know that this is very important and the way forward in this, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>725 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following the substantive conclusion of the agreement, upon the conclusion of this legal review of 
<br/>this Agreement, IPEF members are undertaking their domestic processes, we will have to do so also 
<br/>for  signature  ratification,  et  cetera.  I  understand  it  has  been  scheduled  for  the  5</span><span>th</span><span>  and  6</span><span>th</span><span>  June  in 
<br/>Singapore.  In  this  regard  actually  we  are  wholeheartedly  supporting  the  Minister  going  across  to 
<br/>ensure that the ratification process take place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the framework is a significant step also in our regional cooperation.  It promotes 
<br/>our  economic  prosperity  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  and  it  actually  enhances  Fiji’s  international 
<br/>standing.  You can be assured, Sir, that every person that actually goes there feels extremely proud 
<br/>because we are a massive company, the only Small Island Developing State that was invited to sit at 
<br/>the front table to do this work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a big tick for Fiji. This agreement will continue to dedicate and advancing the economic 
<br/>interest of prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region for all of us.  Well wishes to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for the ratification process.  We are wholeheartedly supporting this. I know there are one or two other 
<br/>speakers from this side who want to support it.  Best wishes to you, honourable Minister and full 
<br/>support from our side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion that is before Parliament 
<br/>and also to thank the honourable Koya for seconding the motion. It is obvious that he is the only one 
<br/>qualified to second this motion as he had done a lot of work in the initiation of the work that has led 
<br/>to us debating this motion before us today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  23</span><span>rd</span><span>  May,  2022,  leaders  from  14  Indo-Pacific  countries  announced  the  start  of  talks 
<br/>towards launching negotiations on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.  Fiji fully 
<br/>supports the vision of a greener global economy, as articulated under IPEF.  That aligns with the 
<br/>2050 Strategy for the Bule Pacific Continent, emphasising the need for nations to coexist peacefully 
<br/>and to collaborate on trans-boundary issues, including climate change.  To realise this vision and 
<br/>respond to climate change, substantial investment in infrastructure and innovation is imperative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our firsthand experience with the effects of the climate crisis underscores the urgent need for 
<br/>coordinated  action.    Investment  in  resilient  trade-related  infrastructure,  such  as  the  Trans-Pacific 
<br/>Submarine  Cables  being  installed  by  Google  is  crucial  for  our  economic  growth  and  regional 
<br/>economic integration. The agreements forged and partnerships established through IPEF are pivotal 
<br/>to enhancing our integration into the global economy and advancing the goals of the Blue Pacific 
<br/>Continent.  The  IPEF  Agreement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recognises  the  different  levels  of  economic 
<br/></span><span>development and capacity constraints of IPEF member countries and makes technical assistance and 
<br/></span><span>capacity building an integral part of IPEF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministerial  Statement  that  honourable  Koya  delivered  also  acknowledge  and  seek  to 
<br/>address the challenges linked with maritime connectivity which is also critical to Fiji. I acknowledge, 
<br/>honourable  Faiyaz  Koya  for  his  participation  in  the  formulation  of  Ministerial  Statements  in 
<br/>September 2022 in Los Angeles, USA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the efforts of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade 
<br/></span><span>honourable Manoa Kamikamica in taking up the mantle and continuing IPEF negotiations over the 
<br/></span><span>last 17 months.  Some do not agree with acknowledging the work of previous governments but that 
<br/>is  a  short-sighted  view  because  the  duty  of  each  successive  government  is  to  build  on  the 
<br/>achievements of previous governments - after all, none of us will rule forever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, upon invitation from President Joe Biden, I joined 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the APEC Summit held in San Francisco in November 2023. At that meeting, IPEF partners 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announced  the  substantial  conclusion  of  negotiations  on  the  Clean  Economy  Agreement,  Fair 
<br/>Economy Agreement and the Over-arching Agreement for IPEF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first IPEC agreement on Supply Chain was negotiated in May 2023.  Together with IPEC 
<br/>partners, Fiji signed the IPEC Supply Chain Agreement in November 2023 after it was unanimously 
<br/>approved by this august Parliament in September 2023.  The motion before Parliament today relates 
<br/>to  the  Over-arching  Trade  Agreement  for  IPEF,  and  the  other  two  pillars  on  Clean  Economy 
<br/>Agreement and the Fair Economy Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To formalise the partnership and ensure that a durable structure exists for future cooperation 
<br/>at the Ministerial level, the IPEF Partners negotiated an overarching agreement on the IPEF. That 
<br/>overarching agreement establishes an IPEF Council and Joint Commission.  The IPEF Council will 
<br/>consider  matters  affecting  the  collective  operation  of  the  agreements  as  well  as  considering  the 
<br/>possibility of adding new members or new agreements.  The Joint Commission will monitor work 
<br/>under the agreements to identify ways to reduce duplication and potential conflicts and enable work 
<br/>between or across those agreements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  IPEF  initiatives,  Fiji  will  establish  a  special 
<br/>Implementation Body at the national level, involving both private and public sector stakeholders. The 
<br/>Implementation  Body  will  then  commence  preparatory  work  to  fully  participate  under  the  IPEF 
<br/>Agreements, including through private sector engagement and proper planning for the utilisation of 
<br/>technical assistance and capacity building activities provided under the Treaty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ratification of the Overarching IPEF Agreement, the Clean 
<br/>Economy  Agreement  and  the  Fair  Economy  Agreements  are  timely  and  imperative.    We  find 
<br/>ourselves at a juncture where adapting to changing circumstances and ensuring the effectiveness of 
<br/>policies is of paramount importance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we navigate the complexities of open market trade policies, escalating maintenance costs, 
<br/>and the profound economic impact  of COVID-19, it becomes evident that our trade criteria must 
<br/>evolve to better serve, not only our nation as a whole but our partners and stakeholders who play a 
<br/>huge  role  in  ensuring  our  success.  I  invite  all  honorable  Members  to  support  and  engage 
<br/>constructively in this process, as we must together ensure that our trade policies remain responsive, 
<br/>inclusive, fair, and sustainable, serving the best interests of our beloved nation and its people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  the  motion  to  the  Parliament.  May  we  continue  to  work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>collaboratively for the betterment of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I must apologise that we never offered you the, these are two new ones for 
<br/>your information.  It was sighted by honourable Naupoto during our trip to Australia.  So, we had
