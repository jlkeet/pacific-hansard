<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF SUGAR 2016-2020 ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  of  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  2016–2017, 
<br/>2017–2018,  2018–2019  and  2019–2020  Annual  Reports  which  was  tabled  on  17</span><span>th</span><span>  April, 
<br/>2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  background,  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  has  an 
<br/>important role in Fiji’s economy through the formulation and implementation of Government key 
<br/>policies in the Sugarcane Industry, at the same time monitor their implementation of the Sugarcane 
<br/>Industry  Reforms.    It  consults  and  ensures  harmony  within  the  Sugar  Industry  by  bringing  the 
<br/>stakeholders  to  work  together.    This  includes  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation,  Sugar  Cane  Growers 
<br/>Council, Sugar Industry Tribunal, Sugar Cane Growers Fund, Sugar Research Institute of Fiji, South 
<br/>Pacific Fertilizers and landlords such as the iTLTB and Lands Department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key highlights: Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the years under review, the Committee noted that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>few highlights of the Ministry of Sugar: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance to enhance cane planting 
<br/>to increase cane production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Weedicide  subsidy  provided  to  cane  growers  to  subsidise  weedicide  cost  of  diuron, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amine, glyphosate and valpar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Cane Access Road, assistance were provided to improve cane access road transportation 
<br/>infrastructure to enhance efficient delivery of cane to the mills and reduce stand-over 
<br/>cane. 
<br/>Fertilizer Subsidy, initiative to subsidise fertiliser cost for farmers at $14.09 per bag 
<br/>until 2016 and 2017, was $25.59 from 2017 to 2018 and $60 from April 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.  Assistance to farmers; provision of grants to farmers for securing land and to establish 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cane farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the Committee’s findings and recommendations, the Committee had highlighted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Committee noted that the Sugar Industry faced a shortage of skilled labour during 
<br/>the  periods  under  review  because  of  step  migration  from  rural  to  urban  areas  while 
<br/>others  moved  to  overseas  or  venture  into  non-sugar  agricultural  farming  and  some 
<br/>sugarcane farmers either abandoned or sold their farms as they are too old to continue 
<br/>farming  and  their  children  had  opted  for  white  collar  job  in  urban  areas  or  move 
<br/>overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  Industry  engage  in 
<br/></span><span>comprehensive dialogue with stakeholders in the sugar sector to address the structural 
<br/>issues affecting  the industry, particularly land lease issues,  acute shortage of labour, 
<br/>excessive burning of cane and the Cane Payment System. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  the  Annual  Reports  presented  by  the  Ministry  of  Sugar 
<br/>lacked essential data during the periods under review which would enable the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>734 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee to make more informed recommendations.  The Ministry of Sugar needs to 
<br/>set a key target of achieving two million tonnes of sugarcane to breakeven.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  to  develop  relevant  Key 
<br/>Performance  Indicators  (KPIs)  collectively  with  respective  organisations  within  the 
<br/>Sugar sector to achieve the target. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  transporting  cane  through  rails  would  be  far  more  cost 
<br/>effective  than  through  trucks  which  required  more  fuel.    It  would  also  relieve  road 
<br/>congestion and damage caused by cane trucks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  work  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Finance to explore the establishment of a multi-purpose railway system to cater for cane 
<br/>cartage and other goods and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have in front of me the list of speakers.  They will speak in the following order: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. S. Nand; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. A. A. Maharaj; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development and Statistics 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Report being discussed. Before 
<br/>I start, I would like to urge honourable Members on the Government side to note that it is almost 18 
<br/>months  since  they  have  been  in  power  so,  please,  takes  some  ownership  of  the  issues  and  stop 
<br/>blaming the previous Government for your inability to deliver.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the recommendations recommended by the Committee was that the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Sugar  Industry  to  engage  in  comprehensive  dialogue  with  the  stakeholders  in  sugar 
<br/>sectors  to  address  structural  issues  affecting  the  industry,  particularly  land  lease  issues,  actual 
<br/>shortage of labour, excessive burning of cane and Cane Payment System.  However, it fails to include 
<br/>Mill efficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reliably told that the average TCTS for the last season was around 11 
<br/>tonnes.    Will  the  Minister  be  able  to  explain  this?  This  is  very  poor  and  it  is  the  direct  result  of 
<br/>inefficient extraction under his leadership.  Processing delays and mill breakdowns is, obviously, a 
<br/>contributing factor.  Improving milling infrastructure and optimizing process efficiency is crucial to 
<br/>reduce TCTS and improving overall sugar production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  problems,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  encountered  by  our  farmers  is  limited  access  to 
<br/>resources.  Cane farmers often lack access to resources, such as farm capital and technology.  This 
<br/></span><span>limits their ability to invest in modern farming techniques, leading to lower productivity.  Land tenure 
<br/></span><span>issues continue to top the list. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure on the farm, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a major challenge.  This includes farm loads 
<br/>and farm bridges and overuse or underuse of fertilizers.  A lot of our farmers are not aware of the soil 
<br/>PH on their farm, thus are not sure of how much fertilizer is needed on the farm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>735 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change is another factor. Another problem faced by the farmers in 
<br/>the  Sugar  Industry  is  the  aging  farmers.    It  is  difficult  to  attract  the  young  generation  to  get  into 
<br/>sugarcane farming.  Attracting young farmers to sugarcane farming can be a challenging factor and 
<br/>is crucial for the sustainability and future of the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, this can be done if you: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provide educational and training programmes for our young generation on how to work 
<br/>smart on the farms, not work hard.   
<br/>Provide financial support and incentives. I believe this Government is already providing 
<br/>some of these, but I request them to enhance the programme.   
<br/>Assist our farmers in getting land leases secured.  Security of land will encourage them 
<br/>to invest on the farm.   
<br/>Continue to encourage and assist in the introduction of technology on the farm.   This 
<br/>will greatly reduce the dependency on hired labour on the farm.   
<br/>Provide opportunities for mentoring and networking to our farmers, especially to the 
<br/>younger generation.  This networking provides a continuous learning opportunity for 
<br/>our farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  cane  farming,  like  any  other  commercial  farming,  is  a  business.  The 
<br/>objective of the business is to make money.  Are the cane farmers making money?  Is the honourable 
<br/>Minister aware of how much it costs to produce a tonne of cane?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  not,  I  urge  him  to  get  his  people  to  do  that.    Typical  cost  for  a  farmer  includes;  land 
<br/>preparation,  seed  materials,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  herbicides,  machinery,  transportation,  other 
<br/>miscellaneous  costs  like,  land  lease,  and  labour.    Not  only  the  paid  labour  which  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister is so often proud of in getting labourers from Bangladesh, but the man hours, the farmer and 
<br/>the farmers’ family put into the farm.  These all needs to be factored in.  A farmer merely makes $10 
<br/>to $20 a tonne of cane, so a farmer who produces around 300 tonnes of cane gets paid between $3,000 
<br/>and $6,000 a year - that too, after six months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge all our cane  farmers who are listening to, please, continue doing  cane farming but, 
<br/>please, diversify.  If you diversify or intercrop, then only you can make money.  They need to start 
<br/>cultivating other crops, together with sugarcane.  Doing this, will mitigate any risks associated with 
<br/>loss of income due to poor yield.  It will also provide them with additional income for sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diversification or inter-cropping also improve the soil health and will reduce the dependency 
<br/></span><span>on fertilizer.  Farmers will be able to value add to their diversified crops to get extra income, like 
<br/>maize flour from the maize.  Please, work smart, farm smart, diversify and get that extra income that 
<br/>your farm needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to carry out a whole of industry inquiry.  All agencies 
<br/>responsible for the production of sugar in Fiji need to be strategically looked at and improvements 
<br/>identified. It has to be a holistic approach.  Individually looking at the farmers or the miller will not 
<br/>work. All the industries, the sectors and all the stakeholders involved in the production of sugarcane 
<br/>in Fiji needs to be holistically looked at and recommended to improve production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  firstly,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  TCTS,  as  it  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there was a stakeholder’s meeting last week in Lautoka where almost 200 people 
<br/>right from the Sugar Cane Growers Council, farmers, Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), you name it, 
<br/>attended.  One of the things that we were concerned about is the very high TCTS in the Mills. It is 
<br/>not because of the mill inefficiency, but it is because of the sucrose content when the cane is out 
<br/>there.  That is why the extraction of sugar is not coming out right.  So, we have to come back and 
<br/>plant varieties of cane that has more sucrose content.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I support this Report. I had earlier mentioned in Parliament that the Report is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from 2016 to 2020. We are in 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- It is going to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am saying is, why are we trying to flog a dead horse here with this Report?  So, I urge 
<br/>the Committee to come out as fast as possible and scrutinise all the current Annual Reports - 2021, 
<br/>2022 and 2023, and bring it to us as soon as possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, firstly, I would like to commend my hardworking staff at the Ministry of Sugar 
<br/>Industry for putting together these four years Annual Report under review.  In the same period, my 
<br/>Ministry has also tabled 2016 to 2020 Annual Reports of Fiji Sugar Corporation, Sugarcane Growers 
<br/>Fund, Sugarcane Growers Council and Sugar Research Institute of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from when the Ministry was established until todate, the responsibilities of the 
<br/>Ministry  have  significantly  increased  without  any  relative  increase  in  the  number  of  staff  in  the 
<br/>Ministry.  The Ministry’s budget has increased over time, with more capital programmes to support 
<br/>the sugar industry, coordinated by the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the review of 2016-2017 and 2019-2020, a total of $281 million was 
<br/>allocated  to  the  Ministry.    Approximately  98  percent  of  this  amount  was  allocated  for  grants  to 
<br/>support the sugar industry, while only 2 percent was the Ministry’s operational expense which also 
<br/>included salaries and wages for the 10 staff who were employed by the Ministry.  This is an indication 
<br/>of the maximum utilization of funds to benefit the cane growers and the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  this  financial  year  (2023-2024),  a  total  of  13  capital  programmes  were 
<br/>approved  by  the  Government  to  support  the  sugar  industry  with  the  total  capital  grant  of  $44.5 
<br/></span><span>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Funds  Programme  aims  to  increase  the  cane  production  through  farm  mechanisation, 
<br/>cane planting assistance, subsidising input cost, upgrading cane access roads and assisting the new 
<br/>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time ever, the Ministry has introduced two new programmes 
<br/>which are the Farmer’s Incentive and Support for Manual Harvesting and Farmers Incentive which 
<br/>is a direct reward to cane growers who have increased their tonnage of cane where the grower has 
<br/></span><span>directly received $5 per tonne on the increase of cane harvesting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Manual Harvesting Programme supported those growers that hired labors had to harvest again 
<br/>manually and the Ministry has paid $1 per tonne of the manual harvested cane direct to the grower.  
<br/>A total of 4,924 farmers received a payment under the Farmers Incentive Programme while 8,336 
<br/>farmers were paid under the Manual Harvesting Programme. We are exploring all avenues to increase 
<br/>the cane production and sustain the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>737 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our sugar industry is confronted with wide issues of socio-economic and 
<br/>environmental forces.  These challenges must be well understood in order to appreciate the level of 
<br/>performance  of  the  industry.  We  have  set  targets  in  sugar  production  to  be  achieved  and  we  are 
<br/>waiting through these challenges to achieve our targets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite these challenges my Ministry in collaboration with the Government 
<br/>is trying all its efforts to re-establish a platform for the industry to grow and sustain itself as it was 
<br/>during its glory days before.   A Committee was established to look into the land issues on the land 
<br/>expiry of leases and non-proclamation of leased, agricultural land and renewal of leases.  For this 
<br/>financial year, a total of $2 million was allocated to assist those growers wishing to renew their leases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are thankful for the support through the government of India. Recently, 
<br/>a technical assessment team from India had visited our sugar mills and inspected the railway network 
<br/>to ascertain the scope of repairing works required. This visit is in line with the industry’s plan of 
<br/>fixing the railway system in Fiji, preparing the sugar mill and reconstruction of the Rakiraki sugar 
<br/>mill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  know  whose  grand  idea  was  in  the  previous  government  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dismantle and take away the Rakiraki Sugar Mill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Cyclone Winston. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- </span><span>Cyclone Winston</span><span> only damaged and there was a cost for repairing of $10 
<br/>million.  That is because of your doing, if we had to put a new mill, a brand-new mill will cost $215 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So, do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- We will do it.  The blunder you made, because of that, this country had 
<br/>to spend $215 million.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, proper planning and strategic realignment of the efforts to 
<br/>bolster the industry is ongoing.   In collaboration with the stakeholders the industry has provided 
<br/>targets  and  goals  with  the  relevant  policies  as  the  industry  submission  should  be  reviewed  in  the 
<br/>National  Development  Plan.  Based on the targets, all sugar institutions should  provide a plan of 
<br/>action  to  achieve  the  broad  targets  of  the  sugar  industry.    We  will  continue  consulting  with  the 
<br/>international partners and the sugar producing countries to identify areas of strengthening growth of 
<br/>a sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting and I must highlight in this august Parliament that my 
<br/>Ministry takes pride in supporting our female cane growers.  Through a new farmer’s programme, 
<br/>we have been assisting female individuals who wish to pursue cane farming. As to-date, we have 61 
<br/>registered  and  active  female  cane  growers  here.    There  are  some  highly  successful  female  cane 
<br/>growers  who  are  producing  more  than  300  tonnes  of  cane,  they  own  cane  lorries  and  other 
<br/>machineries.  Recently,  for  the  first  time  we  have  also  sent  four  male  farmers  to  India  to  receive 
<br/>training for their capacity building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, mechanisation and cane production is a way to move forward to achieve 
<br/></span><span>economies of scale in the sugar industry.  This is what other countries have adopted to mechanise all 
<br/>operations  for  the  sugar  supply  chain  including  venturing  into  artificial  intelligence  to  bring 
<br/>efficiency and tackle labor challenges. A total of $0.5 million was allocated by the Government to 
<br/>support the acquisition of machineries and technologies that will support cane production.  With this 
<br/>funding the Ministry in collaboration with FSC is acquiring planting machines, fertilizer machines, 
<br/>weedicide applicators and exploring drones to be brought to Fiji.  The work is progressing on setting

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up  a  GIS  system  to  digitize  farms  that  will  support  monitoring  of  field  activities  and  enhance 
<br/>efficiency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour shortages and reduced cane planting remains a notable issue of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sugar industry nevertheless the solution to address these issues remains within our beloved nation.   
<br/>We are exporting labour imports from Bangladesh and further updates to be provided as we progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry has been and will continue to contribute immensely towards economic 
<br/>growth and development of nation building. The sector is imploring to landowners with vacant land 
<br/>to  joint-venture  with  FSC  and  plant  cane  on  a  large  commercial  scale  on  vacant  lands.  This  is  a 
<br/>successful story of a landowning unit joint venture with FSC.  Based on these remarks, I therefore, 
<br/>support this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as requested, I would like to speak in Hindi.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I did not come into Parliament to hear this 
<br/>kind of stupidity.  As the saying goes, ‘One cannot fix stupidity all the time’.  It is actually quite 
<br/>hypocritical for honourable Maharaj to mislead Parliament and mislead the growers of this country, 
<br/>and to quite ironically make a point that he wanted to speak in Hindi.  These were the very people 
<br/>sitting in the Opposition who were part of a Government, part of a political party, and part of an 
<br/>agenda to destroy our languages.  It is this Government under this honourable Prime Minister, under 
<br/>your leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are allowed to speak in our vernacular languages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They all have posted here.  When he had an opportunity to 
<br/>support, he is talking about language. He does not even know.  Someone said that he was talking 
<br/>about Hindustani, Pakistani and Afghanistan. Instead of saying Afghan, he said Afghanistani.  There 
<br/>is no such word as Afghanistani in the video or somewhere.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is desperation.  I know he made a video, and I will tell you why he was 
<br/>misleading about the price.  He does not know how the sugar price per tonne of cane based on the 
<br/>international price of sugar, based on the 70-30 formula, based on the industry cost, based on the net 
<br/>proceeds, the final cane payment is decided.  He got it completely wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Someone showed me a video.   He was like a little primary school teacher in a video, trying 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to put the formula. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  He  was  like  a  primary  school  teacher  explaining  to  the 
<br/></span><span>children.   When primary school teachers teach the kids, they actually do it right.  They put the right 
<br/>formula, they make sure that the addition is right, the formula is right and the subtraction is right. He 
<br/>was putting these formulas without understanding … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, a Point of Order – Standing Order 74(1)(a).  It says, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any member may only raise a point of order if -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Member has discriminated primary a schoolteachers. However, 
<br/>honourable Maharaj had explained in his video or to the citizens of Fiji that you cannot compare it 
<br/>to  our  primary  school  teachers.  They  are  working  hard  to  teach  our  young  people.  You  cannot 
<br/>discriminate like that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I have said, Mr. Speaker, one cannot fix stupidity and that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a good example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I was saying is that our primary school teachers, Mr. Speaker, can explain better than 
<br/>what honourable Maharaj was trying to explain in a video.  That is what I am saying, Sir.  This is the 
<br/>level of hypocrisy.  I know, Mr. Speaker, he got it all completely wrong. He has put out his video. 
<br/>He is trying, he is weaving, doing this and trying to get something out of it, and he is thinking that 
<br/>by  speaking  in  Hindi  and,  again,  lying  about  the  formulae,  about  how  the  final  cane  payment  is 
<br/>decided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just also say, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister for Sugar had explained it very 
<br/>well in a very positive way. What are some of the things that we, as Government, are doing? In the 
<br/>last Budget, we provided $49.7 million expenditure, of which $44.5 million just went into capital 
<br/>expenditure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the incentives that we provided, in fact, there are 13 programmes in the Ministry 
<br/>that provide direct  support to  farmers in  the industry, of which eight major ones include;  manual 
<br/>harvesting,  sugarcane  development  farmers  assistance,  cane  cartage,  fertilizer  subsidy,  Sugar 
<br/>Stabilisation Fund, new farmers lease and premium assistance, and on top of those - in addition to 
<br/>that $2 million allocation, the Government, under the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>recently approved another additional $1.2 million to pay the premium for 218 agricultural farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government, Mr. Speaker, for the first time after so many years has taken the problems 
<br/>in  the  sugar  industry  head  on.  They  talk  about  the  history.  Honourable  Nand  was  talking  about 
<br/>diversification. But let me just remind him; in 2006 before the </span><span>coup</span><span>, European Union had provided 
<br/>almost $350 million and that was the first phase. The three components of the programme was for 
<br/>alternative livelihood, one was to fix the mills and one was to fix the farm level production efficiency 
<br/>of the sugarcane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We lost millions and millions of dollars because of the </span><span>coup</span><span>, and also because there was a 
<br/>promise that the elections will be held in 2009 which never was held and the 1997 Constitution was 
<br/>abrogated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, we had </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and the Rakiraki Mill that the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>talked  about  all  the  technical  assessments  after  the  destruction  of  their  Mill  showed  that  all 
<br/></span><span>Government had to do was put in $5 million to fix the Mill at that time.  They did not, because I do 
<br/>not know what kind of ideas they had.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I asked the former Prime Minister in this Parliament, “what are you doing about cane 
<br/>leases in Seaqaqa where the farmers were struggling to pay their premiums?”  He was the Chairman 
<br/>of iTLTB for so many years. Then they were in Government, but they did nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is this Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir that is now very clearly addressing the issues.  We 
<br/></span><span>started the taskforce involving the Ministry of Lands, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, iTLTB, Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of  Sugar  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.    That  taskforce  itself,  Sir  has  been  able  to  provide 
<br/>recommendations to fix the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Nand was talking about cane farmers’ income.  What the honourable Minister 
<br/>said very clearly is that the incentives that are there is to increase the level of production.    He said 
<br/>a farmer producing 300 tonnes or 400 tonnes will get $5,000 or $6,000 income.

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  last  price,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  300  tonne  farmer  or  a  400  tonne  producer  will  get 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$36,000, if you take 60 percent of the cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- That is gross. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know the difference between gross and net.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you take away 60 percent of the cost, still that farmer will make about $14,000 to $15,000 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>net, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- How many of them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This  is  the point, but  they just do not  understand what  the 
<br/>honourable Minister said, that we are trying to raise the level of production, Mr. Speaker.  So, my 
<br/>advice to honourable Maharaj is, he can now feel comfortable and we are very happy that he can 
<br/>speak in Hindi in this Parliament, and I invite them to speak more in Hindi and I will, next time, 
<br/>respond to them in Hindi.  I will respond to them very well in Hindi.  Honourable Bala speaks better 
<br/>Hindi, he will understand what it means because that is what they detested.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is now talking about Indian farmers, Indo-Fijian farmers, because that was what they were 
<br/>doing when they were sitting on this side.  When we were sitting on that side, any time we talked 
<br/>about the iTaukei problem, any time we discussed issues, it was seen as anti-Indian.  So, in his own 
<br/>speech, Mr. Speaker, in Hindi was designed to create that impression. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Your time is up, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the final point I wanted to make. That 
<br/>is the impression he created but he has failed miserably, and they will fail again and again to promote 
<br/>that kind of nonsense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we noted the various issues that has been brought 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about by honourable Members, relating to the industry -  aging farmers, infrastructure… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- …land leases, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  effectively  if  some  semblance  of 
<br/>turnaround can be contemplated.  If the trend remains unchecked, then the decline in production for 
<br/>both, sugarcane and raw sugar would lead to a non-viable and a non-sustainable industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  out  of  the  approximate  50,000  hectares  of  sugarcane  land  allocated  for 
<br/>contract in order to supply Mills, only about 24,000 are utilized for actual sugarcane production, even
