<h3>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 (Bill No. 05/2024), be considered by Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill  must  be  immediately  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Human Rights;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Standing Committee must report on the Bill at a sitting of Parliament in August; and 
<br/>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Upon presentation of the report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must 
<br/>be debated and voted by Parliament, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with 
<br/>the Right of Reply given me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, today has been almost 12 years in the making.  It is my privilege to introduce 
<br/>to Parliament a life changing Bill for the wellbeing of Fijian families today and for generations to 
<br/>come.  I acknowledge the political will of the previous Government to bring this law.  I thank the 
<br/>former Prime Minister, as well as my predecessors, including the late honourable Jiko Luveni, for 
<br/>the hard work that was rendered to this historic Bill to finally make its way to Parliament today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 has waited years for us to reach this 
<br/>point in our human rights evolution.  It embodies our commitment to the protection of our children 
<br/>under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a Convention that Fiji signed in 1993.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Bill  commits  us  to  protecting  and  supporting  all  Fijian  children,  but  especially  those 
<br/></span><span>deprived  of  parental  care  and  those  who  cannot  remain  with  their  families  because  of  abuse  or 
<br/></span><span>neglect.  It is a vital plan in our Government’s overall mission and strategy to free the children of this 
<br/>country from abuse and neglect and addressing why people perpetrate abuse in the first place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  point,  I  look  forward  to  sharing  our  plans  in  terms  of  bringing  a 
<br/>national plan of action to eliminate violence against children in the months to come.  But right now, 
<br/>this Bill heralds a new beginning for our children and for generations of Fijian families to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why is this Bill so important?  There is one statistic that encapsulates its importance.  Five 
<br/></span><span>out of every six children in Fiji face some form of abuse or neglect by their families.  It is difficult to 
<br/></span><span>read  that  statistic  aloud.    The  thought  of  being  one  of  those  children,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  truly 
<br/>unimaginable.  But this shocking statistic illustrates the extent of child abuse and neglect in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every one of these children carries a story of lasting hurt and trauma that 
<br/>will impact their adult lives.  If we do not act urgently, we risk a deeply traumatized generation where 
<br/>cycles of abuse will continue across their offspring and their offspring’s offspring.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If this statistic is not a call to action for our nation, then I do not know what is, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Children are precious gifts from God.  It is our duty as a people and Members of Parliament to 
<br/>protect  and  support  them  to  thrive,  especially  our  most  vulnerable  children.  Ultimately,  it  is  our 
<br/>children who will take this country forward after we are long gone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Bill  represents  the  Government’s  response  to  that  call  to  action.  
<br/>Therefore,  we  refer  this  Bill  to  be  moved  under  Standing  Order  51,  not  just  because  of  our 
<br/>commitments under the Human Rights Convention, but because we want to bring to life children’s 
<br/>rights, their development and their wellbeing.  We want to give all of our Fiji’s children the best 
<br/>future they can possibly imagine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill is so urgently needed because our current system of child protection, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>is based on an outdated philosophy of rescue and removal developed over 50 years ago.  In that time, 
<br/>the world and knowledge about what works to recover children and families has changed drastically.  
<br/>We know this approach has become more and more outdated because it ignores the importance of 
<br/>children’s holistic development within their own families and communities.  Indeed, it ignores the 
<br/>harm of depriving a child of their broader families’ nurture and the importance of their community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nation’s Committee that monitors the Child Rights Convention 
<br/>has pointed out that the number of residential homes and children coming into residential care in Fiji 
<br/>just keeps increasing over the years.  Most children find themselves in residential care because they 
<br/>have  been  neglected  or  abused  by  families.    These  children  spend  very  long  periods  of  time  in 
<br/>residential care with no love of family or their community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot let this continue.  That is why the Child Care and Protection Bill 
<br/>prioritises  family  preservation  and  family-based  forms  of  care.  It  explicitly  acknowledges  and 
<br/>reinforces the key role of parents, families and communities in raising children and protecting them 
<br/>from harm.  It also clearly presents the distinction between children in need of care and protection 
<br/>and children in conflict with the law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importantly, under the current child protection laws, the Government can only intervene once 
<br/>a child has been abused, and we know this is far too late.  Success only comes when you can prevent 
<br/>or intervene early. This new Bill encompasses prevention, early intervention and response services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Options for voluntary care plans can be negotiated with the child’s parents where court orders 
<br/>are used as a last resort when agreements cannot be reached.  The child, the parents, the extended 
<br/></span><span>family, traditional community leaders, can be actively involved with care planning.  Priority is given 
<br/></span><span>to kinship and family-based care. Prevention and early intervention has to be the new talk that we 
<br/>walk.  That  will  be  the  key  to  breaking  cycles  of  abuse  that  are  afflicted  upon  83  percent  of  our 
<br/>children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, without this new law, we will continue to have a child protection system 
<br/>that, at its best, can only be the proverbial ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. The ambulance will 
<br/>continue to desperately try and reach as many children once they have already been abused, but have 
<br/>no ability to intervene with the family, stopping this from occurring.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to get up there on the cliff, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and stop the abuse and neglect from 
<br/>being perpetuated by families against children.  We need to support communities to prevent violence 
<br/>in their families and to be the broad network of support for a child’s recovery from trauma.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  honourable  Members,  some  may  think  that  this  Bill  is  only  about 
<br/>children but let me assure you that this Bill does not serve the human rights of Children alone.  The 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>867 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>world’s largest study on childhood adversity shows that adults who experience abuse, neglect and 
<br/>trauma as children, were far more likely to suffer long-term intellectual, behavioral and physical, and 
<br/>mental health problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill is about the health of our entire society and our nation.   This Bills put us well on 
<br/>the way to improving the physical and mental health of generations of Fijians to come.  But this is 
<br/>not all that the Bill ultimately achieves for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  If we support our families and 
<br/>communities to stop abusing and neglecting children, we will also see a safer Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child  abuse  and  neglect  does  untold  damage  to  a  child  and  their  development.    The 
<br/>psychological harm, the lack of love and the lack of a home leave many children vulnerable to conflict 
<br/>with the criminal justice system, and this continues well into adulthood.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>this very Bill will set the foundations for the changes our country so desperately needs when it comes 
<br/>to  children in  conflict  with  the law. It  will set  the platform to  realise the aspirations of the Child 
<br/>Justice Bill 2024, should it be passed.  But it should also ultimately reduce the number of adults in 
<br/>conflict with the law, many of whom have experienced such backgrounds as the context to their own 
<br/>offending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  looking  to  make  seismic  change  here,  and  this  will  require 
<br/>investment in our child protection workforce.  This is why the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/>provides  for  the  upgrading  of  the  Child  Protection  Services  under  the  Department  of  the  Social 
<br/>Welfare  to  a  Department  of  Children  with  its  own  Director  of  Children,  Assistant  Director  of 
<br/>Children and a complement of specialised Child Welfare Officers at the national and divisional level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  confident  that  this Bill will  respond  to  the long  overdue  call  for 
<br/>change to reduce horrific levels of child abuse and neglect that are carried on in our community, and 
<br/>to truly ensure the children are treated like precious gifts from God.  To make sure we got it right, 
<br/>we conducted extensive consultation on the Bill.  These consultations engaged community members, 
<br/>the  justice  community,  faith-based  community,  child  rights  organisations,  CSOs  and  other  Fijian 
<br/>Government agencies.   We received wide support from the Bill, especially from our civil society 
<br/>organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also know, Mr. Speaker, that this Bill sits at the forefront of child protection lawmaking 
<br/>around the  world.    It  is  based on research  about what  works for  children and families.   It  finally 
<br/>moves us away from our outdated child protection laws to one that will be a shining light for the 
<br/>whole Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Gandhi once said, “The true measure of any society can be found in how it 
<br/>treats its most vulnerable members.”   Children are chief among our most vulnerable and are most 
<br/>treasured.    This  Bill  changes  the  bar  on  how  we  shall  be  measured.    I  commend  this  Bill  before 
<br/>Parliament under Standing Order 51, and I strongly urge honourable Members to support it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise again to give a short contribution from this 
<br/>side of Parliament.  Again, I thank the honourable Minister for tabling the Bill, and I also thank her 
<br/>for  acknowledging  the  FijiFirst  Government  that  had  initially  worked  on  this  Bill  and  her 
<br/></span><span>predecessor.  I think that is the way forward. We have nothing to say in the substance  of the Bill, 
<br/></span><span>given the Bill will be referred to the Standing Committee for Justice, Law and Human Rights and we 
<br/>will have proper deliberations when it comes to the hearing of public submission, moving around 
<br/>holding discussions with the stakeholders and consultants and the terms of reference, plus sitting with 
<br/>the consultants and the drafters from the Office of the Solicitor-General.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we probably might come up with some proposed amendments 
<br/>but that is too premature now for us to comment on.  Again, I thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>suggesting that in the premise of the motion, that we come back to Parliament in the August sitting.  
<br/>I hope that Parliament through you, Sir, with the Secretariat will facilitate that, given that we have 
<br/>Budget in July and also the Committees needs to sit and bring these two Bills.  They are both quite 
<br/>thick Bills, the one moved earlier and this one.  I think the Committees, we have a very short time to 
<br/>bring this and I hope that the cooperation from the Secretariat and the request from the Committees 
<br/>will be taken on board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just upon me to thank all honourable Members 
<br/>of this Parliament for their indication that they support what is before Parliament and that it does go 
<br/>under  Standing  Order  51  to  the  Committees,  and  I  wish  the  Committee  all  the  very  best  in  their 
<br/>deliberations.  This has been consulted quite extensively and it has been 12 years, so hopefully they 
<br/>do not take 12 years more.  I know they have a few months before them, and some very hard-working 
<br/>Members  are  in  that  Committee.    We  all  look  forward  to  the  Report  when  we  come  back  to 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Child  Care  and  Protection  Bill  2024  (Bill  No.  05/2024)  committed  to  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and to report back in the August sitting of 
<br/>Parliament]
