<div><span>Adaptive Social Protection Strategy  
<br/>(Question No. 78/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National  Development  and  Statistics  update  Parliament  on  the  Adaptive  Social  Protection 
<br/>Strategy and its Implementation Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  The Adaptive Social Protection (ASP) Strategy and its implementation plan was endorsed 
<br/>by Cabinet in April 2024.  The ASP Strategy and the implementation plan aims to assist Government 
<br/>of  Fiji  to  enhance  its  existing  social  protection  mechanism  so  that  it  can  offer  rapid  and  timely 
<br/>assistance to poor and vulnerable households particularly to cope with the negative impact of crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The genesis of this strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strategy from 5- Years strategy (2024 to 
<br/>2029) stems from the measures that were undertaken during COVID, US$100 million (almost FJ$200 
<br/>million) through the World Bank, about $42 million from DFAT and others made up the volume of 
<br/>social protection support that many households and families received during COVID. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since then the Government in 2022, and obviously from last year, we have 
<br/>been working closely with development partners and local partners to ensure that the strategy is put 
<br/>in place to mitigate the impact of shocks such as natural disasters, economic crisis, including those 
<br/>that may arise from health emergencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  Social  Protection  Response  System  Development  Project,  the  World  Bank 
<br/>provided technical and financial support to various activities including the design of the strategy that 
<br/>we now have which was approved by Cabinet and again the financing from the World Bank was 
<br/>secured  during  COVID  and  that  is  being  built  on  for  another  five  years.    The  total  funding,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that is expected to be part of the three approaches, particularly the two approaches will 
<br/>amount to about $294 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ASP Strategy Plan was developed under the review of a Project Steering 
<br/></span><span>Committee led by the Ministry of Finance, together with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social 
<br/></span><span>Protection as the key implementing agency.  The approach to formulating the strategy, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, was based on extensive stakeholder engagement.  There were 11 thematic workshops with a total 
<br/>of 229 participants  from Government agencies,  civil  society organisations, development  partners, 
<br/>field consultations at national, divisional, provincial, district and community levels were conducted 
<br/>with another 300 participants.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main idea behind this strategy is to expand particularly in approach one 
<br/>to expand social assistance benefits and to reach disaster hit communities.  The important issue, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, with respect to the strategy is to look at how the country is prepared to address the most 
<br/>vulnerable who get affected the most during disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition was talking about poverty, we can argue about the 
<br/>revised  poverty  rate  from  28  percent  to  24  percent.    But  the  fact  is,  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition that the large percentage, in fact two-thirds of those leaving below the poverty line are 
<br/>usually in the rural areas, and when disasters, particularly natural disasters such as droughts, floods, 
<br/>cyclones hit these areas, these are the people who are affected the most and are the most vulnerable.  
<br/>Therefore, the strategy really is to ensure that these groups of people are addressed first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, there are five priority action areas and I do not want to get into the 
<br/>details  of  those  specific  priority  areas,  but  the  strategy  is  a  public  document,  it  is  available  for 
<br/>everyone to see and look at what is there.  The point I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 
<br/>impact of climate change as we all know, Fiji is ranked 15th globally in terms of disaster risk and 
<br/>more and more what we have seen in the last 10 years, it was part of the world in the Pacific, including 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hope and pray for six months and probably more than six months now that we do not get 
<br/>hit by a devastating flood or cyclone or other forms of disaster, temperatures, patterns of heavy rain 
<br/>fall have both increased over the past five decades in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate  change  has  increasingly  affected  much  of  the  country,  including  rising  seas,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and saltwater intrusion we have seen in many villages and coastal communities and the 
<br/>excessive heat and the damaged crops and natural resources are also adding to the vulnerability of 
<br/>those  in  that  category  where  this  particular  strategy  in  the  National  Adaptation  Social  Protection 
<br/>Strategy and Implementation Plan is directed between 2024 to 2029.  The honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition was saying the other day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the important thing is about implementation.  
<br/>We have  got the strategy, we have got these priority areas, we have got the action plans, how it is 
<br/>implemented  at  times  of  disasters  and  before  disasters,  the  preparedness  will  ensure  whether  this 
<br/>adaptive strategy is going to be effective or not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  your 
<br/>response.  My understanding about social protection is, they are founded on certain principles.  One 
<br/>of them is the equality and non-discrimination.  How do you ensure these principles are reflected in 
<br/></span><span>the implementation plan right throughout because you are saying that the big challenge now is getting 
<br/></span><span>the implementation done.  The question is,  how will you ensure that these key principles of equality 
<br/>and non-discrimination will be part of this plan from the first to the final stage?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not know what you exactly mean, but it is assumed that 
<br/>any of those plans or action plans that are there with respect to addressing fundamentally those who 
<br/>would be affected by disasters, there is no room for discrimination.  When you are looking at those 
<br/>who are affected in  a particular area, if there is  a coastal inundation,  saltwater intrusion during  a 
<br/>certain weather pattern and groups and communities are affected, the strategy is very clear that those 
<br/></span><span>vulnerable groups will be provided with the support that they would need.  I do not expect and there 
<br/></span><span>should never be allowed any form of discrimination in the provision of those protection services, 
<br/>whether it is through cash transfer or to provide support to build infrastructure.  It should be on the 
<br/>principle of non-discrimination.

<div><span>Progress of EFL Extension Grid 
<br/>(Question No. 79/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and  Transport 
<br/>inform Parliament on the progress of the EFL extension grid to Soa Village, Matuku Village, 
<br/>Wailailai in Bucalevu, Nakorotubu, Ra? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  projects  in  question,  Wailailai  is 
<br/>completed, Bucalevu is  still in  progress  while Soa and Matuku  are yet  to  start.   The total cost  of 
<br/>Wailailai Settlement is $98,000, benefitting 13 households.  For Bucalevu Village, grid extension 
<br/>works is completed, and house wiring is planned to commence next month.  The total project cost is 
<br/>$170,000 that will benefit 15 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Soa  and  Matuku  Villages  in  Ra,  the  Ministry,  through  the  Department  of  Energy  is 
<br/>processing the final 50 percent payment to Energy Fiji Limited for grid extension works.  The total 
<br/>cost of the project is $713,000, which is planned to commence in August this year.  The project is 
<br/>envisaged to benefit a total of 152 customers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  communities,  like  Uluisavudua  in 
<br/>Sawani,  Naitasiri,  and  those  living  in  the  villages  of  Natua,  Vunidamoli,  Laucala  and  Naiqaqi  in 
<br/>Wailevu  West,  Cakaudrove  have  also  been  waiting.    Is  this  the  same  programme  that  they  come 
<br/>under or is there another programme because they have been waiting since September last year where 
<br/>they were told that the grid will be extended too.  Again, this year, the same story.  I just want to 
<br/>know whether it is the same programme so that people know while they are waiting for confirmation 
<br/>from the Department of Energy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, when the honourable Minister has given his reply, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then you may rise to ask your supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a totally new question because right 
<br/>now, we are at the Wainibuka River and I do not know why you brought up those areas which are 
<br/>not around there.  There is a limited budget but all those requests … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. K.K. Lal interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could we let the honourable Minister reply? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The requests are there, I am not sure about the status of it. 
<br/>Definitely,  as  a  Government  which  is  concerned  about  social  development,  social  equity  and 
<br/>development for all rather than specific which are targeted towards your voters, it is all there, we will 
<br/>follow up on that. You can contact me separately and I will follow up on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The extension of the grid is very costly. Normally we will look at the number of households 
<br/>and beneficiaries so there are some cost benefit analysis.  We cannot extend it if it costs half a million 
<br/>and there are just three houses there. That is the kind of consideration that needs to be considered. 
<br/>The other one is the limited budget, but we are working with development partners through UNDP 
<br/>and also KOICA to expand the Rural Electrification Fund.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for what has 
<br/>been  mentioned  about  Wailailai  in  Bucalevu,  Ra.  He  has  not  been  mentioned  about  the  EFL 
<br/>Extension Grid in Bucalevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is another Wailailai in Wailoku. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- This Wailailai is in Bucalevu in Ra.  Nothing has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done to the EFL Extension Grid right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, the honourable Member is referring to Wailailai in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wainibuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Yes,  I  will  look  into  that  and  get  back  to  you  on  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, still on grid extension because there are certain names 
<br/>mentioned and there are some more. This was just a claim when I tried to get Dakunimoto in Tabia 
<br/>connected.  Some people claim as soon as NFP comes into the picture, they will have it done in year’s 
<br/>time. Sir, it is one year and six months.  Just a clarification, when are those people going to get their 
<br/>houses connected to the grid extension? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I mean that is also a concern when I came in, the length of 
<br/>waiting time. I have asked the Director of Energy to review it and as I mentioned, budget is not a 
<br/>problem but is limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Our people are waiting, when we come back in 2027 then we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>connect it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We can just let them wait until 2027.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The Rural Electrification Fund needs to be expanded. So, that 
<br/>is why we are working with other development partners to look into expanding that; not only  for the 
<br/>grid but also renewable energy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.  NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has  mentioned twice limited 
<br/>budget and the honourable Minister for Finance has said he has got money. I thank the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for his answers. It is good that you understand now that grid extension is very costly because 
<br/></span><span>when you were on this side and we were on that side, you would ask the same question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Who was that side? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some households along King’s Road, the wires 
<br/>are already there since 2023 but not being connected to the grid and they were already being funded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was still right from Baulevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- You listen. Funds have already been provided for the projects but they are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not linking to the grid.  Can you tell honourable Minister when will that be done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you asking the honourable Minister or you engaging in other…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Honourable Minister.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- First of all, thank you honourable Member, he should refrain 
<br/>from pointing.  I do not know whether it is hypertension or something because he keeps jumping up 
<br/>and pointing.  The second point is, he was the Assistant Minister for the Ministry.  He knows all the 
<br/>details and those delays were from your time.  I am just there to catch up on the work left by the 
<br/>former honourable Minister and his Assistant Minister, but I thank him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were in the Economic Affairs Committee, so we were cooperating really well and I thank 
<br/>him for his question.  He was the Chairman of that Committee and in every  report we always support 
<br/>him.  Going back to the electrification, we went to Nasau Village in Ra, there was a whole lot of 
<br/>lamp posts and wires, et cetera, sitting there and we asked them as to why those were sitting there?  
<br/>They replied, “That is from the FijiFirst Government time and just before the elections, they diverted 
<br/>the contractors to the supporters.”  That is something we will need to rectify as we move forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!

<div><span>Plans to Improve Workers Compensation System 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 80/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on plans to improve the workers compensation system in order to deliver 
<br/>better social justice to the workers in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir and I thank the honourable Kiran for her question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to update this august Parliament on the proposal to transfer 
<br/>cases  from  Accident  Compensation  Commission  of  Fiji  (ACCF)  to  the  Ministry  of  Employment, 
<br/>Productivity and Industrial Relations as endorsed by the Interim ACCF Board.  The purpose is to 
<br/>expedite  the  processing  and  pay  out  compensation  in  a  timely  manner,  as  well  as  making  it  cost 
<br/>effective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  recent  deaths  that  have  occurred  during  and  in  the  cause  of 
<br/>employment  until  31</span><span>st</span><span>  December,  2018  are  investigated  by  my  Ministry  under  the  Workmen’s 
<br/>Compensation Act  which is  a  faulty-based system.  To determine the cause of injuries and deaths 
<br/>upon completion of investigations, reports are submitted to trained medical assessors for their expert 
<br/></span><span>opinion, assessment to determine the status of each case. Once a medical report is received and the 
<br/></span><span>percentage of disability is awarded to the workers, or medical opinion stated that the death was work 
<br/>related, then the Ministry calculates the compensation amount and forwards it to the employers for 
<br/>the payment of compensation to the workers concerned or the dependants as the deceased to workers.  
<br/>This is for all cases that had occurred prior to 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the financial year 2022-2023, my Ministry has successfully settled 208 
<br/>cases, consisting of 172 injuries and 36 death cases. For the current financial year, as of 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 
<br/>2024, a total of 109 cases, 91 injuries and 18 death cases had been settled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the five key players in the administration of the Workmen’s Compensation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Act are:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.  Employers: 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Workers; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Medical practitioners;

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Employment Relations Tribunal; and  
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Ministry is tasked to investigate the injuries and deaths that occur and affect the 
<br/>workers,  a professional  opinion of the medical  assessor is  vital  in  determining  our outcome - the 
<br/>outcome of any compensation case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as at 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024, the Ministry had 305 pending cases of which 230 are 
<br/>injury cases and 75 are death cases.  The Ministry is endeavoring to make sure that all these cases 
<br/>are disposed off by 31</span><span>st</span><span>  December, 2024.    Majority of them, of  course are with  the Employment 
<br/>Relations Tribunal and some are those that we are still trying to locate the victims. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to this, the Ministry has currently engaged, in consultation with the 
<br/>relevant  stakeholders  to  transfer  the  cases  from  the  ACCF  to  the  Ministry.    These  are  the  cases 
<br/>currently handled by the ACCF under the No Fault Scheme from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has been the enforcement arm of ACCF regarding employment 
<br/>accidents, since its establishment in 2019.  The ACCF was established in 2019.  My Ministry has 
<br/>been assisting ACCF with investigation of cases, dealing with complaints on non-payment of wages 
<br/>of injured workers and conducting meetings with employers on reporting of cases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, my Ministry has the entire machinery to deal with worker’s 
<br/>compensation  cases  where  the  staff  have  undergone  relevant  training  and  standard  operating 
<br/>procedures are in place to deal with these cases effectively and expeditiously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  proposal  to  transfer  the  processing  of  the  employment  and  school 
<br/>accident was submitted to Cabinet and the decision is pending as further consultation is required for 
<br/>Cabinet’s consideration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to inform this august Parliament that the interim ACCF Board 
<br/>has  been  approved  by  Cabinet  and  my  Permanent  Secretary  has  been  appointed  the  interim 
<br/>Chairperson.  The Interim Board Members have been tasked to conduct an independent review of the 
<br/>Commission that had the first meeting on 19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024.  Sir, I am happy to report that 264 pending 
<br/>cases have been approved for payment by the interim Board.  This comprises of 131 employment 
<br/>cases,115 motor vehicle accident cases and 18 cases of school accidents.  These pending cases on 
<br/>ACCF have been resolved by the interim Board and payment of $1,237,500 have been made to those 
<br/></span><span>that qualify under the No Fault Scheme, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  you  have  pointed  out  what  the  Ministry  of  
<br/>Employment is actually going to take over with respect to ACCF.  Is it correct that you are obviously 
<br/>looking at dis-establishing the entire ACCF and functions with respect employment and schools will 
<br/>go to you and the rest will go to the LTA?  Whilst on the topic, Sir, do you not think that it would be 
<br/>a conflict of interest for the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment to be sitting as the 
<br/>Chair of the ACCF currently? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Employment is the Chair 
<br/></span><span>and  that  appointment  was  made  by  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  which  is  the  appointing 
<br/>authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think he has answered your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Half of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>845 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What? Should be one question only.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  first  one  was  the  question  that  this  is  heading 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>towards the complete dis-establishment of the ACCF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You want to reply to that, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my apology. Can the question be repeated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir.  Is it correct, honourable Minister, that in light of what 
<br/>you have  actually  advised Parliament now that the proposal  is  that the  ACCF be completely  dis-
<br/>established and the functions with respect to the education and employment will go to the Ministry 
<br/>of Employment and the rest will go to LTA? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not the case. The ACCF is there. The Accident 
<br/>Compensation and the school accidents are being passed onto us.  The Interim Board is going to look 
<br/>at the entire process, the consultation with the Ministry of Works is still ongoing in terms of how 
<br/>LTA cases are going to be handled.  As it is, LTA still stays with ACCF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Alvick Maharaj, your supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification. When the ACCF came into 
<br/>the picture, all the cases were supposed to be referred to ACCF under the no fault policy.  Does the 
<br/>Board have the powers to reverse these cases back to Workmen’s Compensation, because I think the 
<br/>ACCF Act has not been amended by Parliament. So the cases are referred to ACCF according to the 
<br/>Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  the  cases  are  referred  to  the  Workmen’s  Compensation  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Employment, the Act needs to be changed, because I do not believe the Board has those 
<br/>powers because it will be an issue if it is done without amending the law.  At the moment, they should 
<br/>be compensated at no fault policy, that is why it is being referred to ACCF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are asking, does the Board have the powers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, according to the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  powers of the Board under the Act are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>To  assist  ACCF  in  the  assessment  of  the  current  and  pending  applications  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compensation with the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Approve an application for compensation after reviewing all relevant information. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Prescribe the amount of compensation payable to personal injury or death under the no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fault compensation scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  stipulated  under  section  11(1)  of  the  ACCF  Act  and  I  quote:  “The 
<br/></span><span>Commission may in writing, either generally or particularly, delegate any of its powers, authority, 
<br/></span><span>duties and functions to its officers, employees, agents or consultants as it thinks  fit.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Interim ACCF Board is an independent Board, had its first meeting on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 and made the following decisions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Non-renewal of the ACCF CEO’s contract which had expired in January. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Appointment of the interim officer in charge to oversee daily operations of the ACCF. 
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Appointment of interim ACCF Secretariat. 
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Appointment of interim Chair (already there) to clear all cases pending with ACCF. 
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Review the renewal of LTA’s contract with ACCF - it remains with ACCF. 
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Non-renewal  of  Veritas  Finance  Private  Limited  claims  agent  for  ACCF  contracts  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processing of employment and school accidents will be done by my Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Board  has  decided  that  Veritas,  the  company  that  had  been  contracted  by  ACCF  for 
<br/>$900,000 a year to just process is not being engaged anymore.  So we are going to save $900,000 a 
<br/>year for government because my Ministry has the full capacity to actually process those and then 
<br/>pass them back to ACCF for approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister.  I  think  that  takes  care  of  all  your 
<br/>questions, honourable Maharaj.  Does the Board have the powers? That has been fully explained by 
<br/>the honourable Minister which are the delegated authorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A.A. Maharaj interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is reading from the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just quoting from what transpired in this 
<br/>Parliament  when  the  Accident  Compensation  Commission  Act  was  approved  that  once  all  the 
<br/>pending cases with the Workmen’s Compensation Team is done, all the clauses there in the law to 
<br/>govern that particular department would be repealed.  They do not have the mandate of the Parliament 
<br/>at this point in time to continue with any new cases.  That is why the ACCF was developed in the 
<br/>first place.  So, the ACCF Board …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We are talking about delegated authority here and I hope you understand, 
<br/>honourable  Maharaj,  you  have  been  here  for  quite  some  time.  That  is  the  legislation,  the 
<br/>empowerment that is now being read out by the honourable Minister and we will leave it at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important because we have had a lot of people 
<br/>come up to our office.  Honourable Minister, can you explain exactly why claimants who have been 
<br/>completely processed still have not been paid, whether it be, I think there are claimants there from 
<br/>an education and employment perspective, they still have not been paid.  I understand there may be 
<br/>some difficulties with the Board but now you are saying that there is a Board there but they have not 
<br/></span><span>been paid.  Can you explain why they still have not been paid? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I wish to thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for the question.  The pending cases were there from the beginning of 2022.  There were around 
<br/>1,000 cases pending then.  When the Board took over, there were 1,447 cases.  The Board has now, 
<br/>as I have alluded to earlier, done the first lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  20  others  that  they  are  approving  this  week  and  the  approval  is  continuing  as 
<br/>processing  is  taking  place.    There  is  processing  and  there  is  approval  by  the  Board.    There  are 
<br/></span><span>challenges, of course.  One of the challenges is getting the services of trained doctors who actually 
<br/></span><span>assess impairment. Those are some of the challenges, otherwise since this interim Board has come 
<br/>in, they have sped up the actual processing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the fact that when you set up your budget last 
<br/>year, you did not include the processing of these cases.   I am wondering how are you funding this, 
<br/>or is your Ministry then being paid by the ACCF to do this?

<div><span>847 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my predecessor, honourable Usamate was also the 
<br/>Minister at one time.  He knows very well that we have a Directorate -the Director of Occupational 
<br/>Health and Safety Board.  There is a Board, a Director in the Ministry, and a full set of staff within 
<br/>the Ministry who were processing in the past, until ACCF was given birth to and it was hived away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the trained staff, we have SOPs, we have the ability and we have been doing three- 
<br/>quarter of the work anyway.  It was just the processing and then Veritas.  We have  calculated and 
<br/>the cost is going to be reduced by 70 percent if we take over everything.

<div><span>Assistance to Cane Farmers - Land Lease Renewals 
<br/>(Question No. 81/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  update 
<br/>Parliament on how the Ministry plans to assist cane farmers obtain land lease renewals on 
<br/>leases that are expiring? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question by honourable Virendra 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lal and thank him for this important question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are all aware of the challenges faced by the sugar industry as we listened to the debate on 
<br/>the motion by the honourable Tubuna on Tuesday.  One, of course,  is related to the challenges in 
<br/>accessing  good  agricultural  land  including  lease  expiry  and  competing  demand  of  land  for  the 
<br/>alternative  use  of  sub-residential,  commercial  business  developments  and  land  needed  by  the 
<br/>landowning units themselves for daily use and support the maintenance as such.  Completion for this 
<br/>land has been an impediment to cane production and in sugarcane fields. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  challenges  we  have  been  very  supportive  in  improving  the 
<br/>livelihoods of the sugarcane farmers to its service delivery and direct financial support to the farmers 
<br/>with  grants  and  subsidies.    Sir,  one  of  the  financial  support  is  to  the  grant  assistance  for  land 
<br/>acquisition and lease renewals to establish cane farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, between 2018 and 2020, the Ministry spent a total of $1.52 million to assist 
<br/>267 farmers inclusive of 46 female farmers for the payment of 100 percent of the lease renewal cost 
<br/>and purchase of new farms with a maximum grant of $10,000 per farmer. These farmers were also 
<br/></span><span>registered with cane planting grants and input subsidies to established farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this financial year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $2 million has been allocated under the new 
<br/>farmers and lease renewal programme to assist with the payment of their lease renewals and purchase 
<br/>of farm costs.  The Ministry is covering one-third on a maximum of $7,500, whichever is lower of 
<br/>the lease renewal cost on the purchase of farm.  As of last week, we have received 163 applications 
<br/>and so far 95 farmers have signed the agreement with the Ministry to receive funding for the leases 
<br/>for the cane farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority of these farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were from Vanua Levu, mainly from Seaqaqa 
<br/></span><span>cane belt areas and have been assisted with a total of $0.4 million for the payment of lease renewable 
<br/>cost. The rest of the applications are being assessed by the Ministry and the farmers will be assisted 
<br/>before the end of this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To add on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the cane is grown under leased land which has been 
<br/>leased from the iTaukei Land Trust Board.  According to the information obtained from  iTLTB, a 
<br/>total of 1,609 cane leases will be expiring between 2024 to 2031 both, in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Ministry, together with the industry stakeholders: the Fiji Sugar Corporation, Sugar Cane 
<br/>Growers Council, Sugar Cane Growers Fund have been working in close collaboration with iTLTB 
<br/>to assist both, the cane farmers and the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These sugar industry institutions have established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
<br/>with iTLTB to share useful information on the sugar industry and have been at the forefront to resolve 
<br/>the lease-related issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTLTB Chairman has been in consultation with the landowners and the 
<br/>cane farmers regarding these lease renewals for mutual benefit of both parties.  Farmers are no longer 
<br/>required to wait for the lease to expire in five years, but they can start  consultation within 10 years 
<br/>before it expires.  This will bring confidence for the continuity of not only the farmers but the sugar 
<br/>industry as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have appointed the Chief Executive Officer of iTLTB on the Board of the 
<br/>Fiji Sugar Corporation, who will assist and better understand the needs of the sugar industry in terms 
<br/>of the land requirements firsthand.  Mr. Nata will be able to discuss issues of the  landowners and 
<br/>iTLTB directly with the FSC Board and management. In this way, Sir, we will be able to develop 
<br/>strategies with iTLTB and serve the needs of both the landowners, tenants and our sugarcane farmers 
<br/>as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  understanding  of  the  situation,both  the  cane  farmers  and  landowners  and  the  sugar 
<br/>industry, we can initiate better dialogue between both parties. We want to invite the landowners and 
<br/>young </span><span>itaukei</span><span> youth, including women to venture into sugarcane farming, a sector that is becoming 
<br/>favorable with the rise of world sugar price. There is no need to struggle in searching for sugarcane 
<br/>markets as the market is already established.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had informed this august Parliament that the sugar price is currently 
<br/>quite favorable and likely to remain positive in future years as we see the global trends, therefore, I 
<br/>also encourage our landowners to take this opportunity to venture into cane farming and make use of 
<br/>their  land  for  income  generation.  And  importantly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  ready  to  provide 
<br/>assistance to them through our grant-programmes to become cane farmers of tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over 90 percent of iTLTB leases have been issued for 30 years 
<br/>and deemed short for investment in the agriculture sector, particularly, for growing of cane, which is 
<br/>a permanent crop. I am thankful that iTLTB has considered offering leases on a longer term as an 
<br/>option, especially for 50 years or 99-year lease term. This will give sufficient time for farmers to 
<br/>recoup returns for their investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am grateful that honourable Vasu had supported the issuing of leases on a longer-term lease 
<br/>for  cane  farming,  and  that  benefits  both  the  farmers  and  landowners  and  contributes  to  wider 
<br/></span><span>economic development, and I thank honourable Vasu for his vision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government had also established a Task Force on renewals, 
<br/>chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.  In September 2023, the Task Force has 
<br/>submitted its report to the Cabinet with various solutions proposed. One of the key findings was the 
<br/>difficulties faced by both sugar and non-sugar farmers in paying their outstanding lease premiums.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>849 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a request was made for the government to assist these farmers to allow them 
<br/>to continue farming. Based on Cabinet's approval, our Coalition Government has paid over $1.22m 
<br/>for 218 leases as payment for the outstanding lease premiums. Of these 218 leases, 42 leases were 
<br/>for cane farmers  and this has supported them to  increase cane production and enhance long-term 
<br/>sustainability of the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this government and my Ministry is in full support of assisting 
<br/>cane farmers whose leases expired in previous years and we will continue to support others whose 
<br/>leases are about to expire in the near future.  Consultations and dialogue are ongoing and have become 
<br/>better overtime. I fully trust that majority of the leases expiring will be renewed to allow farmers to 
<br/>carry on with sugarcane farming for the betterment of the sugarcane sector and livelihoods of nearly 
<br/>20 percent of Fiji's population.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- The honourable Minister is talking mostly about itaukei land.  Sir, what about 
<br/>those farmers who are tenants of freehold landlords and their leases have expired?  Why I am saying 
<br/>this, Sir, is because I come from Rakiraki where there is a big piece of freehold land and the tenant 
<br/>leases have expired and they are cane farmers. So, what happens in that case? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  It  is  quite  difficult  to  get  freeholders  because  they  are  owners  in 
<br/>perpetuating.  You will get me, of those parcels of land under them.  The authority rests with them, 
<br/>whether they want an extension or renewal.  Then that can be conveyed to them but I think what the 
<br/>honourable is referring to is where the Government can interact easily because of them being kind of 
<br/>a cozy government, the iTaukei Land Trust Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- It is the then laws in fact are asking for substantial amount of premium and 
<br/>that is where the problem is because these farmers are unable to pay the premium so in that case, my 
<br/>question is, is the honourable Minister or is the government going to have those farmers as well?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give examples to the honourable Member.  I was 
<br/>talking to this freehold owner, the late Mr. Uday Singh in Ba.  His families are willing to give the 
<br/>land out to the farmers and they are trying to identify farmers who is going to come and work on the 
<br/>farm and motivate.  So, it is a question between the negotiation of both parties, if they come to a 
<br/>figure and our formulas stands, honourable Member is that, about 30 percent was owned by the 500. 
<br/>That  is  the  maximum  ceiling  we  can  give  at  this  stage,  but  we  are  quite  happy  to  deal  with  any 
<br/>landowners whether it be freehold or state land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps, further to that honourable Virendra Lal, that was the great thing 
<br/></span><span>about  Agricultural  Landlord and Tenants  Act  (ALTA).  It  took  care of all  tenancies whether it is 
<br/>within freehold, State land or what.  The controlling law there was ALTA; ALTA kind of superseded 
<br/>the Native Land Trust Act.  Your Government in the past, I do not know what they have done with 
<br/>ALTA, I really do not know what is the full effect of ALTA now.  Maybe they have cushioned them 
<br/>down  or  watered  it  down,  so  that  now  affects  tenants.    They  may  be  regarded  as  ALTA  tenants 
<br/>because their predominant use is agricultural use.  That is where ALTA comes and kicks in, but now 
<br/>we do not know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It depends on the owner and the tenant. I hope I am answering that concern 
<br/>of yours. Maybe the honourable Attorney-General can explain what is the fate of  ALTA now, is it 
<br/>still in existence or not? Sorry about that honourable Alvick.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  What was actually 
<br/>discussed yesterday with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.  Let us </span><span>per se</span><span> if we had some sitting tenants 
<br/>who are actually cultivating sugar which is at the moment  State freehold and during this process, 
<br/>while the lease is still there, it gets converted to iTaukei land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No, no, just listen to the question first.  If that transpires and a premium has to be paid to 
<br/>iTLTB for a new lease under iTLTB, who actually pays for that?  Will it be the farmers or will the 
<br/>Ministry of Sugar step in to help the farmers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is why I was asking about the fate of ALTA.  You know what the 
<br/>Labour Government used to say before, you have entrenched legislation for the Fijian interest, that 
<br/>is our entrenched legislation for the cane farmers and farmers alike under ALTA.  This is the second 
<br/>time you have raised that issue, honourable Maharaj.  It is up to you honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since honourable Alvick Maharaj stood up, you have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>helped me answering a lot of questions on that, so I leave it at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on ALTA if I remember correctly, it is still in 
<br/>existence but subject to review.  The reason being, because of the situation that most of the leases 
<br/>expired from 1997; you fully understand that, Sir.  There was an urgent need to renew the leases.  
<br/>That is why the Government then went into the Committee for Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL), 
<br/>but if you look at the first CBUL paper when Parliament is  back on, we had to review ALTA.  My 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister is, it seems that now two systems are running in parallel.  You 
<br/>are still using CBUL as a mode of payment and you have just released the last payment and now it 
<br/>has  brought  up  CBUL,  the  4  percent  subsidy  to  $101  million,  but  you  still  have  another  Land 
<br/>Committee.  So, where does that leave the CBUL Taskforce that was established to look at the same 
<br/>issue - the renewal of leases? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you answer that, honourable Leader of the Opposition, the law is 
<br/>law.  If ALTA overrides Native Land Trust Act, then automatically ALTA is the ruling one.  But in 
<br/>this respect, as I have stated, I do not know, and you have answered that quite well now that it is still 
<br/>in existence.  CBUL is not ALTA, let us be clear about that.  With the expiry of leases that have gone 
<br/></span><span>through  and  nothing  was  done  to  them,  then  that  means  clearly  those  very  important  sections  of 
<br/></span><span>ALTA has also been watered down because ALTA guarantees the protection of the interest of tenants, 
<br/>whether they be under Native Land, State Land or Freehold Land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Jai Ram Reddy used to have a lot of preceding cases on testing the power of ALTA, even 
<br/>poultry farming in Vitogo, that came under ALTA, but NLTB thought it was a special commercial 
<br/>intensive use.  No, it fell under the ambit of ALTA because the courts decided in favour of Jai Ram 
<br/>Reddy’s plea.  That is the full effect of this, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sorry,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  that is  exactly my  point.   ALTA is  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>existence.  From 1997, despite the existence of ALTA, the leases were not renewed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Who was ruling in the past 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, that is not true!

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>851 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- </span><span>Oso</span><span>!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is difficult to explain this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why the under the Chaudhry Government 
<br/>(Labour Government) started the resettlement.  There was aMinistry of Sugar,  Agriculture and Land 
<br/>Resettlement.  That was why Navovo was established in Nadroga, Navudi was established in Dreketi, 
<br/>we  have  Raiwaqa,  Vakabalea  and  Valelawa  because  of  the  non-renewal  of  leases.    Again,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, ALTA was in existence, but it was the politics then that did not renew the leases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- How many leases did you people renew? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is why CBUL was just formed to renew the leases with the 
<br/>top-up subsidy from the 6 percent UCV to 10 percent to entice the landowners to quicken the process 
<br/>of the renewal of leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- But actually with CBUL coming in, it made ALTA redundant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-No,  I  am  telling  you  because  I  worked  all  my  life  in  that  particular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Let us look at the papers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you want to make some comments as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to enlighten Parliament, land under ALTA, 
<br/>when the lease expires, if you have any issue, you go to the tribunal.  So, I cannot understand why 
<br/>leases were not renewed.  There is a legal recourse there - the tribunal and still sits there.  So ALTA 
<br/>still exists, there is a recourse for tenants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will leave it at that, honourable Members.  The key Minister 
<br/></span><span>to reply to this is the Minister for Sugar, but I have tried to come in to help, and now the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has fully explained that.  The tribunal is still there.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>In  late  2022,  there  was  a  partnership  with  the  Australian  Government  and  a  flagship  programme 
<br/>which is the Partnerships for Social Protection Programme (P4SP).  We undertook the review of the 
<br/>six social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare, which you are aware of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  that  extensive  consultation,  in  May  2023,  there  was  a  technical  review  report 
<br/>produced and then endorsed by Cabinet.  Of course, that review had recommendations for changes 
<br/>that needed to happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following are some of the key achievements in the current budget year: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>An increase of the monthly benefit amounts by the Coalition Government for all those six 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>There was a conversion of the food voucher to cash to simplify the programme delivery and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also in meeting the needs of the beneficiaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>There was a reduction of voucher printing and transition to electronic payments with Post Fiji. 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>There was a review of the Standard Operating Procedures for all of the six social assistance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>We obtained Cabinet approval on the shock responsive initiative, such as the adaptive social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>protection strategy, which honourable Professor Prasad just talked about. 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>There was design and development of an interim IT Management Solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, there are currently a few activities underway by the Ministry, and we are hoping 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that there will be progress in this regard: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A consideration of the possible conversion of the Bus Fare Assistance Scheme to cash for our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pensioners and our disability beneficiaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>We are looking at the revival (as I have talked about) of the Welfare Graduation Programme 
<br/>in terms of providing a sustainable pathway, which we are working with certain Ministries 
<br/>including the Ministry of Agriculture who talked about that  in his Ministerial Statement this 
<br/>morning  on  how  to  alleviate  poverty.    We  are  identifying  those  from  the  Social  Welfare 
<br/>Scheme  or  the  Family  Assistance  Scheme  to  be  graduated  under  that  Programme  in  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>We  also  need  to  review  and  update  the  proxy  means  test,  the  test  for  Family  Assistance 
<br/>Scheme, engaging a Management Information System (MIS) firm to develop a comprehensive 
<br/>and strategic solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the core recommendations, Mr. Speaker, of the technical review, as in your question, 
<br/>is  the  Integrated  Beneficiary  Management  System.    It  is  a  more  elaborate  system  for  the  social 
<br/>assistance schemes.  This is being developed by the Ministry with the support of our development 
<br/>partners.  It will establish integration with existing databases and information systems to be managed 
<br/>by Government and other external stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once it is established, it will be addressing the following three objectives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>improve efficiency, cost savings and sustainability through the sharing of resources; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>enabling effective provision of the social protection services; and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>improving transparency and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  while  this  solution  represents  an  impressive  achievement  for  Fiji,  the  technical 
<br/>review identified gaps in the areas of data management, the digitisation of the beneficiary data and 
<br/>data protection, which all needed priority attention.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>853 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the Ministry’s online systems crashed in the year 2020 and some processes were 
<br/>reverted back to manual although trying to transition to digital.  Therefore, in 2024, we have to come 
<br/>up  with  an  interim  solution  in  order  to  digitise  that  information.  Honourable  Premila  Kumar,  is 
<br/>complaining. This is where the budget is going to the $1 million, which is the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You haven’t used the money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is part of the interim solution to this point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the interim solution includes the utilising of this budget which we engaged USP 
<br/>students to come and assist the Ministry in the different Divisions to undertake the processing from 
<br/>manual to digital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  has  been  significant  support  provided  by  DFAT,  the  Government  of 
<br/>Australia in terms of the solutions.  But, Mr. Speaker, in terms of the comprehensive solution, we do 
<br/>need to engage specialist roles which is the Principal MIS consultant, the Senior MIS Consultant, 
<br/>Developers, an IT Team Lead, Social Protection Specialist, Economists and Project Managers.  Of 
<br/>course, this has been a great saving too for the Ministry because our development partners have come 
<br/>in  to  assist.  That  is  the  answer  to  your  question,  honourable  Kumar,  in  terms  of  whether  it  is 
<br/>completely being used.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is essential, Mr. Speaker, to reserve sufficient funds, to ensure a thorough completion of 
<br/>this project. So, we have requested from the Ministry of Finance, whatever the balance that we have 
<br/>to transfer it into the new year so that we can continue to work with our development partners to be 
<br/>able to realise this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The simple answer is, Mr. Speaker, we could have utilised all of the $1 million in this current 
<br/>financial year but our development partners have come to the table, so we have shared this cost.  So, 
<br/>we are asking for the balance to be transferred into the new year with our development partners to 
<br/>continue to work on this integrated comprehensive solution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  needs  to  learn  from 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister because he answered his question so well when he was talking 
<br/>about  the  Financial  Management  System.  And  when  you  compare  her  response  to  him,  a  similar 
<br/>question about a system, she went around – beating around the bush, telling us where, what happened, 
<br/>this and that, but the simple question is, honourable Minister, that you have actually not used the 
<br/></span><span>money for the system. You have used the money for other things but not to build the system. The 
<br/></span><span>money was allocated for the system. So, that is the question. Own up!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  I  am  sorry,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  not  understand  whether  that  was  a 
<br/>question or a comment, but I do want to reiterate that the budget is being utilised in partnership with 
<br/>our development partners who have come to the table to work together. So, it has been partly used 
<br/>with our development partners because they are the ones that reviewed the system. The Government 
<br/>of Australia offered to the Ministry, so we have taken that funds with our funds working together and 
<br/>the  balance  of  it  to  be  transferred  to  next  year  to  be  used  in  partnership with  the  Government  of 
<br/></span><span>Australia to continue to develop this and to complete this integrated system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I do want to say rather than commenting that way, the 
<br/>previous Government with honourable Kumar should really take credit because this started in their 
<br/>time. So, we are just carrying out what they have put together. So, I acknowledge the good work that

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they have done, rather than attacking how the partnerships are working with our bilaterial partners to 
<br/>deliver to our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON, J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a simple question to the honourable Minister. 
<br/>When the budget was requested for $1 million allocation, it must have had a list of activities, projects 
<br/>and programmes that were associated with it. As we reach this point in time with the next budget 
<br/>around the corner, are we on track to receive 100 percent of all the things for which this money was 
<br/>allocated for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I believe I have answered that question. It has been partially utilised 
<br/>and we are requesting the Ministry of Finance that it goes into the next year. So, it is actually a bit of 
<br/>savings for us because of the support of the Government of Australia to come to the table to be able 
<br/>to contribute to the funding of this system.  That is all it is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of what they are commenting on that we have not utilised it, therefore, we are not 
<br/>delivering it, we are delivering.  It is a partnership, and they should acknowledge that. We thank the 
<br/>Government of Australia for their partnership.

<div><span>Recognition of Indigenous Arts and Craft  
<br/>(Question No. 84/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update 
<br/>Parliament on the action taken to improve the recognition of indigenous arts and craft, and 
<br/>also the contemporary art? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise to respond to honourable Vanawalu’s question, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Member for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s art sector has enormous potentials.  Yet, over the years, it has been 
<br/>the most neglected.  Our Ministry is focusing on delivering practical and impactful actions that will 
<br/>enhance this creative sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I speak our National Organising Committee based at the Fiji Arts Council is preparing a 
<br/>100  member  Fijian  delegation  made  up  of  traditional  and  contemporary  artists  and  artisans,  to 
<br/></span><span>participate at the upcoming 13</span><span>th</span><span> Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture in Hawaii on 6th June to 16th 
<br/></span><span>June,  2024.    At  this  Festival,  our  artists  and  artisans  will  achieve  maximum  exposure  at  the 
<br/>international stage, sell their works of art to international buyers and most importantly, learn from 
<br/>other artists and artisans in the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for years, our artists have been looking for homes, a space where they are 
<br/>able to express themselves freely and collaborate with fellow Fijian artists.  With Cabinet approval 
<br/>in 2023, we were able to secure the old St. Steven’s Building to be Fiji’s first National Art Galley - 
<br/>the new home for our artists and artisans.  A National Task Force made up of skilled professionals 
<br/></span><span>and technical people in the areas of arts and heritage is now working on the gallery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  acknowledge  our  past  leaders  for  establishing  a  national  institution 
<br/>responsible for art in Fiji, the Fiji Arts Council.  Established as a charitable trust with an annual grant 
<br/>received from Government, Fiji is the only Pacific Island country that has an arts council.  The Fiji 
<br/>Arts  Council  continues  to  build  on  existing  support  for  the  development  of  indigenous  and 
<br/>contemporary arts alike.

<br/>Organization (UNESCO) visual artists joined force to establish the Viti Association of Visual Artists 
<br/>(VAVA) with performing artists coming together and help create the Fiji Islands Dance Association 
<br/>(FIDA).  This is in addition to the one of the existing and oldest art collectives in Fiji, the Performing 
<br/>Rights Association (FIPRA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  collectives  are  working  with  the  Fiji  Arts  Council  to  explore  ways  to  increase 
<br/>opportunities  for  informal  sector  enterprises  and  workers  to  influence  decision-making  of 
<br/>Government and policy through a collective formalised voice.  This also includes working towards 
<br/>improved access to social safety net and professional development for artists and artisans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  regard,  the  Fiji  Arts  Council  has,  in  the  recent  past,  provided  support  letters  for 
<br/>established  art  entrepreneurs  to  access  grants  and  loans  from  credit  facilities,  like  the  Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank.  A handful have succeeded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that art is enjoyed by all, the Fiji Arts Council and its key partners 
<br/>organise community workshops on basic art skills, such as screen printing, </span><span>masi</span><span> making and visual 
<br/>arts programme for youth and children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Arts Council works with the iTaukei Institution of Language and Culture to organise 
<br/>and implement indigenous art revitalisation, such as the </span><span>tuli kuro </span><span>workshop.  The reviving of the </span><span>Wea</span><span>
<br/>Fish  Trap  used  by  the  people  of  Lasakau,  Bau;  the  </span><span>mahima  </span><span>(salt)  making  revival  workshop  in 
<br/>Nadroga, and many others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Museum also work in collaboration with the Fiji Arts Council and other partners to 
<br/>ensure that its exhibitions programme display indigenous skills in heritage and art.  In particular, the 
<br/>new  Voyages  Exhibition  at  the  Fiji  Museum  has  drawn  attention,  not  only  from  locals,  but 
<br/>international museums and visitors alike, with over 60,000 visitors visiting the Exhibition since its 
<br/>opening in December 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023, the visiting Maori Contemporary Artists from New Zealand collaborated with the 
<br/>Fiji Museum and Fiji Arts Council to organise pottery and </span><span>masi </span><span>design workshops as part of a trail 
<br/>connecting our communities through these art pieces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through partnerships with the Ministry of Women, we continue to support our women in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of their craft and its sales during the National Women’s Expo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  of  Culture  and  the  Fiji  Arts  Council  organise  ongoing 
<br/>business and entrepreneurship training for skilled artists and artisans, who would like to establish 
<br/>their own business.  We are also working with the Ministry of Education to assist our master artists 
<br/>and artisans in allowing them to teach basic art lessons in schools.  This complements the current 
<br/>move by the Ministry to ensure that indigenous skills and knowledge systems are embedded in our 
<br/>National Education Curriculum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  the  Department  of  Culture,  we  are  currently  engaging  seven  retired  Curriculum 
<br/></span><span>Advisors and former teachers to map our existing curriculum and to gauge extent with which culture, 
<br/>heritage and arts issues are reflected in learning and teaching materials used in our schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the protections of our artists is crucial, to ensure proper safeguarding of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>creative knowledge and innovation through the Ministry of Trade’s Fijian made initiative.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Art Council assesses works of art submitted by Fijians to ensure the highest of quality 
<br/>is produced before they are issued with a licence and branded ‘Fijian crafted’ sticker. This serves as 
<br/>an authentication mechanism for locally produced works of heritage and arts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our current intellectual property regimes fall short of protecting our artists’ works, especially 
<br/>those that are community owned. In this regard, the pending Traditional Knowledge and Expression 
<br/>of Culture Bill will ensure that indigenous art forms with communal genesis can be protected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, we are proposing in the new financial year to work with the Office of the 
<br/>Attorney-General,  to  undertake  a  feasibility  study  on  the  possibility  of  developing  a  specific 
<br/>legislation for art development in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> To  cover  the  works  of  the  Fiji  Arts  Council  and  gaps  that  currently  exist  in  relation  to 
<br/>protection  for  our  indigenous  and  contemporary  artists  and  artisans  alike.  In  as  far  as  policy  is 
<br/>concerned, Cabinet approved in May 2023, the adoption and implementation of the new Fiji National 
<br/>Cultural  Policy.    Priority  3  of  the  Policy  emphasises  the  need  to  establish  a  national  strategy  for 
<br/>creative industries to - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>strengthen the capacity and skills of cultural producers and practitioners; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>improve the quality and diversity of cultural products and services; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>increase the access and visibility of cultural products and services in local, regional, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>international markets; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>promote  the  recognition  and  protection  of  cultural  rights  and  intellectual  property  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cultural producers and practitioners; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>foster collaboration and coordination among stakeholders in the cultural sector, including 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, private sector, civil society and development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to support the arts and creative sector, as this can be a source of 
<br/>employment generation  for our  communities and our people. This  will boost their livelihood and 
<br/>foster economic growth and wealth for the nation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Thank you, honourable Minister. That was quite a lengthy one. I would 
<br/>like to humbly ask, honourable Ministers, when you do your replies, please, have it concise, very 
<br/>short and sweet, otherwise its more or less a statement coming up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the complementary facility or institute in our 
<br/></span><span>drive to preserve our arts is a national art gallery.  Fiji does not have a national art gallery, but other 
<br/></span><span>countries have.  Does the Ministry or the Government have plans to set up a national art gallery that 
<br/>will entice all these artisans to take their art there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  my  understanding  from  the  Fiji  Arts  Council,  the 
<br/>Gallery that we have now covers all ethnic groups and they provide assistance to all.  But, today I 
<br/>was just briefing on the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> side of the ars, but they assist all the ethnic groups in Fiji.  If you go 
<br/>there during the display, you can see all the ethnicities, all Fijians are there.  If there is a need to do 
<br/>a national art gallery, then we are looking forward to look into it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thought  in  your  explanation  that  you  have  converted  the  St.  Stevens 
<br/>Building, the old Grammar School Hostel, into that particular place, Arts Council now.  That is the 
<br/>question that honourable Naupoto raised.  We earmarked that when we were organising the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>857 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Melanesian Arts Festival some years back.  He was very   much involved in organising that.  We 
<br/>were even looking at the old St. Stevens Building. It is a potential area, but then it was housing the 
<br/>Government ICT.  But now, they have converted that into a Gallery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question relates to the protection of 
<br/>our indigenous art and craft and also contemporary art.  I know you have mentioned that you will 
<br/>shortly be having negotiations with the Attorney-General Chambers.  I am assuming that my question 
<br/>relates to your looking at trademark protection and copyright protection, which is something that has 
<br/>been done by New Zealand, Canada and some other countries really well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are you also looking at basically authenticity, because in the world without any borders, there 
<br/>is a particular area where authenticity marks, which may be done through the Ministry of Trade, et 
<br/>cetera, on how they do the Fijian organic products, but will you be looking at authenticity marks also 
<br/>with respect to our art and craft in order to protect our indigenous art and craft? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as for now, as I have stated in my brief, all art and craft 
<br/>that will be going  in  for trade and branded as  Fiji made, has come through the  Fiji  Arts  Council 
<br/>whereby they look at it, make sure the quality and everything  is in line.  But we are still working 
<br/>with the Office of the Solicitor-General with regard to how we can protect all those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is, perhaps, just a suggestion.  It works both ways.  You either have the 
<br/>law to safeguard that, or the people who make to ensure it will not end up like a sword from Suvavou 
<br/>being given out to the tourists because that is not genuine. So, what we would like to see is, it is the 
<br/>people that do that themselves. They have an appreciation that what I am doing is genuine. That is 
<br/>the question that was being raised.
