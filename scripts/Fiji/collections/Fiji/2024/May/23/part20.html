<h3>METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on 
<br/>Tuesday 21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 , I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Services  Bill  (Bill  No.  03/2024)  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debated, voted upon and passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just before you do so, Sir, first of all I would like to apologise for something 
<br/></span><span>that I mentioned that was highlighted by honourable Bala - it is one hour for each Bill. I said what 
<br/>was written on my script here, that is, one hour for the two Bills.  That has now been corrected, one 
<br/>hour for one Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of Opposition and esteemed Members of Parliament, I rise today 
<br/>to share my views and clarify the details of the Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/>that is before this august Parliament that was introduced on Tuesday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a significant milestone in Fiji’s Government Framework. It marks the first ever attempt 
<br/>to  create  a  comprehensive  governing  framework,  to  guide  and  empower  the  Department  of 
<br/>Meteorological and Hydrological Services in the provision of its services. It is designed not only to 
<br/>regulate the provision of weather forecast, meteorological and hydrological services within Fiji but 
<br/>also to recognise and extend its influence and expertise throughout the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>877 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The objectives of the Bill as already mentioned are multifaceted, recognise and empower the 
<br/>Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services, empowers the Director of Meteorological Services 
<br/>to  carry  out  his  or  her  duties  in  the  most  effective  manner  in  the  practical  provisions  of  weather 
<br/>forecast and recognise the many other services which are essential for the critical functions of Fiji’s 
<br/>Meteorological and Hydrological Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed Bill also provides the effective and efficient provision of Meteorological and 
<br/>Hydrological Services that contribute to a sustainable economic development, protection of life, and 
<br/>of course in the protection of hydrological property from meteorological and hydrological disasters 
<br/>which is a common occurrence in our region.  Sir, it also encompasses the important contribution of 
<br/>the Fiji Meteorological Services towards the Nadi flight information region, as already mentioned 
<br/>especially with  the Pacific region. It provides broadcast throughout the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also recognises the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services leading role in the 
<br/>region by providing weather forecast and warnings to smaller island neighbouring countries such as 
<br/>Tuvalu, Niue, Kiribati, Cook Islands, Tokelau and Nauru, to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had mentioned the possibilities of public private engagement in the delivery of the services. 
<br/>This  is  an  important  element  moving  forward  and  it  did  encompass  interaction  and  collaboration 
<br/>between entities from the public, private and business sector, as well as academia and civil society 
<br/>in the production and delivery of weather, climate hydrological marine and related environmental 
<br/>data, information and services which could be extended to those. Some examples of public/private 
<br/>engagements are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Private companies installing meteorological observing instruments in high rise buildings 
<br/>and exchanging meteorological data with the Meteorological Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Vessels  being  fitted  with  barometers,  anemometers  and  meteorological  data  are  then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transmitted to the Meteorological Office at regular intervals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Collaboration between research institutions and meteorological and hydrological services 
<br/>where meteorological data is supplied to research institutions who, in turn, analyse data, 
<br/>determine trends and publish scientific journals, such as the Intergovernmental Pannel on 
<br/>Climate Change (IPCC) Reports, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the proposed Bill also enables the issuance of impact days forecast which contributes to 
<br/>the broader Fiji Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems which also strengthens the linkages between 
<br/>Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services and the Natural Disaster Management Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have already stated that the regional specialised Meteorological Centre is one of the only 
<br/>six centres globally and this Bill assists in strengthening that.  Its functions include the naming of 
<br/>tropical cyclones and related alerts and warnings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, following the devastating flood of 2012 and recommendations of recognised international 
<br/>organizations, Cabinet had agreed that the sole mandated for issuing flood forecasting Fiji be moved 
<br/>from the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Water Authority of Fiji to be vested with 
<br/>the  Fiji  Meteorological  Services.  As  a  Coalition  Government,  we  continue  from  that  and  to  put 
<br/></span><span>through the legislation and regulations and, of course, to operationalise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  proposed  Bill  tends  to  mirror  similar  Acts  that  have  been  passed,  for  example,  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia, Vanuatu, Seychelles and Tonga, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Clauses of the Bill, we have already distributed that, so I will not go through each one 
<br/>but  basically  provide  for  the  definitions,  objectives  and  functions,  and  also  what  the  services  are 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>empowered to do.  It also includes technical audit functions and what the Bill empowers individuals 
<br/>such as the Ministers, in terms of making regulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key elements in terms of not only the Meteorological Services but the scientific 
<br/>technical areas in the Ministry is the high turnover and this is something we are very concerned about.  
<br/>Since my short time there, there have been two or three acting directors and they have been recruited 
<br/>by regional organisations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot compete with them, but there is room within this Bill, that maybe we could have 
<br/>some sort of MOU with them in terms of the message we could take to prevent that, or to have some 
<br/>sort of secondment from the Fiji Government to these regional organisations in order that we can 
<br/>manage some of the issues such as high turnover of very technical and experienced professional staff.  
<br/>Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>similar to the ones that we have gone over,  I also have a list given by the Whips, and the batting will 
<br/>be as follows, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. J. Usamate; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Attorney-General and Minister for Justice; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Leader of the Opposition; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister, again, and I thank you, 
<br/>Sir, for giving me the floor to speak on this Bill.  As has been mentioned previously, the Bill has 
<br/>been a long time coming.  There had been a prior Bill in 2016 and then the Bill was rejuvenated, 
<br/>again, in 2018-2019 to get it going.  Sir, I am really glad to see that it has finally come to Parliament 
<br/>after such a long time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister had talked about the history of weather forecasting and collecting 
<br/>meteorological information in Fiji, starting in the late 1800s, then we had the New Zealand Air Force, 
<br/>then the South Pacific Air Traffic Council that took place, and over the years, the Fiji Meteorological 
<br/>and Hydrological Services has continued to grow, but the fact that we now have this legislation, as 
<br/>the honourable Minister has pointed out, empowers the Director.  It gives power to the Director to be 
<br/>able to carry out their roles in the best possible way.  So, they will now have this legislative basis on 
<br/>which to build the operation into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As he has pointed out, our Fiji Meteorological Services has quite a good reputation.  It is, in 
<br/>fact,  responsible  for  the  Flight  Information  Centre  in  Nadi  and  also  has  been  recognised  as  the 
<br/>regional specialised meteorological centre.  So, it has global recognition in terms of what it does and 
<br/>it has a special status with the World Meteorological Organization.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular Bill, we are combining both of these two special arms in which we need 
<br/>good forecasting and good information, - meteorological and hydrological, because we all know that 
<br/>the biggest disasters in Fiji are not, all the time, cyclones.    It is flooding - flooding is the big one 
<br/></span><span>because even if you do not have a cyclone, if the cyclone does not pass through Fiji, flooding will 
<br/></span><span>happen, so flooding is  very, very  critical  for us.   Anything  around flooding is  very important  for 
<br/>anything that we do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking through the Bill itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see that now, for this Act, there will be no 
<br/>longer  be  a  Fiji  Meteorological  Services,  but  will  now  become  a  Fiji  Meteorological  and 
<br/>Hydrological Services, managed by a Director.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>879 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just looking through some of the parts on Clause 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the functions 
<br/>of the Service, I think they are all very good.  There is just one issue that I wanted to highlight here, 
<br/>which I think the honourable Minister and the Director Meteorological Services would have been 
<br/>engaged with and, that is, Clause 5(1)(m) that states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“arrange with any ministry, department, public agency, office or person to take and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>record meteorological observations or to record hydrological data and transmit…”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is very important – the ‘transmit’ bit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go around, you have the automatic weather stations, you have the hydrological meters 
<br/>in the rivers, but sometimes they are not transmitting. I think that is something that we need to make 
<br/>sure because if the data is there, the data is being captured but it is not being sent to the place where 
<br/>it is analysed, observed and interpreted, then there is a breakdown in the system.  Sometimes in the 
<br/>past, we were to resort to manual people to actually go there and to try to get the readings.  I think 
<br/>that is one part that struck me in my time as the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other part is this, we have very good modelling systems but sometimes, I do not think 
<br/>the modelling systems do not take into account the moisture content in the soil.  They look at the 
<br/>amount of precipitation and rainfall, but nothing seems to measure the amount of moisture content 
<br/>in the soil because if there is a lot of moisture content in the soil, then the flooding will happen very 
<br/>quickly.  So, I am hopeful that as they develop their models into the future, they will be able to take 
<br/>up ways to try to address these important issues that will even then fine tune further the very, very 
<br/>good work that has been done by the Fiji Meteorological Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister has pointed out, we lose a lot of these people – very good assets.  
<br/>There is a very short band of latitude in the world where people earn the skills to learn about tropical 
<br/>cyclones.  We are smacked in the middle of that Centre – of that place where people learn their skills 
<br/>to predict and forecast tropical cyclones because they happen, it is just this brief brand of area around 
<br/>the equator.  So, our people who come through the Centre and the training that they do, they get good 
<br/>jobs everywhere.  We have lost them to a lot of places, so I think this is going to be a challenge for 
<br/>us going into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, going to Clause 5(2), we noticed there, and it reads: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The service may provide commercial meteorological and hydrological services for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remuneration.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is also good because being able to provide something for a fee of service, will also enhance 
<br/>the reputation of the Centre and it also forces them to enhance their own abilities so that they can 
<br/>deliver the kind of information that people are willing to pay for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the future, as the honourable Minister has pointed out, they will be looking maybe at some 
<br/>time in  the future, the  Meteorological  Services  or Hydrological  Service  might  be hived off  as an 
<br/>entity on its own.  I think that is good - overall, in the development of Government, we always want 
<br/></span><span>to see Government produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government maintains the policy, the regulatory bit, but the actual operations go out, and that 
<br/>is  what  has  already  happened  in  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport, Water Authority of Fiji has gone, Fiji Roads Authority has gone, the policy is maintained 
<br/>but this has gone out.  So, I think over the long-term, that is a good development.  Ultimately, it might 
<br/>take a few more years, a lot of work might still need to be done, before we can get to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>880 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is one sticky bit that we might have with the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is around Clause 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7(1) and (2).  Clause 7(1) says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any  person  who  issues  a  weather  warning  or  alert,  including  a  flood  alert,  or 
<br/>causes the warning or alert to be issued without the prior authorisation of the Director in 
<br/>consultation with the Minister, commits an offence…”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  understand  why  this  was  put  in  the  first  place  because  under  the  World  Meteorological 
<br/>Organization in Nadi is recognised as the place where this forecasting is done.  They have been given 
<br/>the right to be the first level where they provide the basic information on predicting cyclones and 
<br/>forecasting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment also, we have a lot to agencies that do that.  We all know about </span><span>Na Draki</span><span>, so 
<br/>I think this needs to be grappled with, because we have the freedom of information issue.  How do 
<br/>we grapple with that?  Clause 7(1) says that when someone does it, issues or authorizes the issuance 
<br/>of a weather warning or alert, it is an offence and is liable on conviction.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give you one scenario.  In the Ba Market which has a lot of flooding, 
<br/>sometimes the vendors will call the Ba Market Master and say, ‘there is going to be flood’.  They are 
<br/>giving a weather warning.  Will they then be liable for conviction, when that warning has not been 
<br/>authorised by the Director?  This is a far-fetched thing, but it can happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the wording of what it actually means.  What does a weather warning or alert mean? Does 
<br/>it mean someone saying something like that because when market vendors do that, they know that it 
<br/>is something that is very important for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 10 - Indemnification from liability - maybe honourable Attorney-
<br/>General, that should be referring to ‘exclusion of liability’. The way that it is worded now, because 
<br/>at the end of that sentence at the bottom, it says, “unless it is shown that the person did not act in 
<br/>good faith or with reasonable care”.  So, I suggest maybe that, that might be considered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for your indulgence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had indicated yesterday, it is a very brief Bill, 
<br/>only 12 Clauses.  Their assets is in Clauses 5 and 6.  This is the key – the powers and the positions 
<br/>of the Director.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  4  is  the  establishment  of  the  Service;  Clause  5  is  the  functions  of  the  Service  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 is the powers of the Director.  This is the essence of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  now  codified.    Before  you  draw  from  this  legislation,  from  this 
<br/>regulation, so it makes the people at the Fiji Meteorological Services so happy and satisfied that, at 
<br/>least, it is now codified in one legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the issue about weather warnings, that is the reason why it is not put in the Act - 
<br/></span><span>it is put in the Regulations because situations has arisen in the past.  The reason why it is stated here 
<br/></span><span>is because it has arisen in the past and has caused confusion so there will be further discussion and 
<br/>that will come out in the Regulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 10 is standard where officers of the Corrections, Military and Police 
<br/>are indemnified from any civil and criminal liability. There is a standard provision, but I note what 
<br/>honourable Usamate said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>881 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this Bill brings in budget allocation, it is also a forward-looking Bill. Clause 8(c) states, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The funds of the Service consist of the following – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>income from any commercial services provided by the Service.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, we had discussed - there is a wind of change, things change, of course. So, in 
<br/>this line of work, there are some expectations that they will provide some services to other providers. 
<br/>That is why it is put there.  Where the situation arises, it is provided for by law.   The Bill allows the 
<br/>Fiji  Meteorological  Services to  continue their work but  with  confidence  with  having  a legal  base 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work of the Fiji Meteorological Services was inherited from the South 
<br/>Pacific Air Transport Council, which is a branch of New Zealand Meteorological Services. The role 
<br/>and scope of the work of the Director of the Meteorological and Hydrological Services is big and 
<br/>vital, not just for Fiji, but for the region as we there are only six centres in the world that provide 
<br/>essential tropical  cyclone-related information. This  means that we are the leading  Meteorological 
<br/>Office in the South Pacific region and, thus, the Fiji Meteorological Office names tropical cyclones 
<br/>as soon as they are detected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the legal and moral obligation to smaller countries in the Pacific who are heavily 
<br/>reliant on Fiji for aviation and weather forecasting, such as Tuvalu,  Niue, Kiribati, Cook Islands, 
<br/>Tokelau,  Nauru,  Tonga  and  Samoa.    It  is  crucial  to  have  this  Bill  passed,  given  that  we  now 
<br/>understand the importance of Meteorological and Hydrological Service and the role they play in Fiji 
<br/>and in the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  is  a  reflection  of  the  urgency  which  we  seek  to  in  order  to  establish  the 
<br/>Meteorological and Hydrological Service. Early warning leads to early action and, therefore, action 
<br/>leads to having sustainable economic development, protection of life, livelihoods and property from 
<br/>meteorological and hydrological disaster and hazards. That is the reality of what is to come, once the 
<br/>Bill is passed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend the Bill to be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Now I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU. –Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will be very brief in my contribution as well. 
<br/></span><span>As alluded to by honourable Usamate, we support the Bill, but we are making some recommendations 
<br/></span><span>as well, if it is still relevant, and maybe the Government can take it into consideration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was not so much in favour of this coming under Standing Orders 51 for one session only 
<br/>rather than not referring it to the Committee, simply because of two reasons and, again, I will explain 
<br/>it today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had alluded to the other day, when this was drafted way back in 2016, it was just about 
<br/>Meteorological Services.  When it came back, it included Hydrological Services as well, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, and I have given the history behind this Unit. This is based on experiences in the various offices 
<br/></span><span>that we have served in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first reason is the compartmentalization in work, but then on the other hand, the issue of 
<br/>overlap  and  duplication.  Now,  we  have  the  Public  Works  again.    Previously,  as  I  have  said, 
<br/>hydrological services used to be part of Water Supplies under PWD.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>882 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have hydrology functions in the Ministry of Mineral Resources, we also have Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji, so this is again, I am talking about the overlaps and even duplication but at the 
<br/>same time, the compartmentalization of this. This is why I was raising this issue again because given 
<br/>what has progressed over the years as we were drafting this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second reason and main one was on the role of Director Meteorological Services as the 
<br/>focal point for IPCC.  Again, I say that this was drafted before the Climate Change Act 2021 came 
<br/>in. The honourable Minister keeps referring to the link between Meteorological Services and Director 
<br/>NDMO, but let me read from section 69 of the Climate Change Act 2021, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “The  Director,  in  consultation  with  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Service  and  other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relevant stakeholders, may build…”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  not  read  the  rest  of  it,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  is  just  because  of  the  link  between 
<br/>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Director, Fiji Meteorological Service 
<br/>as the focal point and, of course, their link with Director Climate Change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 69(3) talks about integrated risk scenarios must be developed based on the scientific 
<br/>knowledge about climate change including relevant information published by the Intergovernmental 
<br/>Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the National Adaptation Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only reason why I am raising this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of course if it is too late now 
<br/>may be something that Government can consider for the future because we know that climate change 
<br/>is  the  biggest  existential  threat  that  we  are  facing  and  we  must  be  seen,  particularly  the  role  of 
<br/>Parliament in the development of legislations, we must make sure that all the legislation are in sync 
<br/>and of course particularly are aligned to the Conventions that we have ratified as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  history  of  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was 
<br/>established  way  back  in  1988  and  approved  by  the  General  Assembly.    It  was  between  UN 
<br/>Environment (UNEP) and World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and this is where the role of 
<br/>the Director of Fiji Meteorological Service becomes important as the focal point for science related 
<br/>issues when it comes to climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want that to be considered by Government if it is too late now to refer it to the Committee 
<br/>but probably something that is worth looking into and this is something that we also have discussed 
<br/>with Director, NDMO because when the Climate Act also was drafted, we had not had COVID back 
<br/></span><span>then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the emergency framework, these are the new developments and as we are just into 
<br/>the process of getting the new Bills now it would be good if these factors are included because it will 
<br/>save us a lot of work as well in the long term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, may  I just raise the issue  again  about  Clause 10 of the Bill,  probably  it is  just the 
<br/>wording,  honourable  Attorney-General  because  indemnification  probably  in  the  way  it  is  in  the 
<br/>context it does not fit well with the wordings that are in there. Probably, the exclusion of liability is 
<br/></span><span>the proper word rather than indemnification, Sir.  Despite those comments we support the Bill, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before this august Parliament to express my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support for the Meteorological and Hydrological Bill currently under debate.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>883 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, the National Disaster Management Office in collaboration with Fiji Meteorological 
<br/>Office has installed community based flood early warning system in the Western Division with 17 
<br/>new floodgates soon to be installed Central Division. This is achieved through the kind funding of 
<br/>NDMI Korea and the New Zealand Government. We support Section 3(b) which promotes public 
<br/>private engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Selected sites for the above stated floodgates that I have stated above are critical because the 
<br/>long data sparse areas normally referred to as black spots because of the lack of hydrological data 
<br/>from some tributaries or flood prone areas in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen the floods in Serua and that is one of the areas 
<br/>of  interest  that  we  would  like  to  install  this  floodgates  in  as  well  in  the  future.  This  system  will 
<br/>transmit  critical  flood data directly to  the Meteorological  Office to  aid  in  community-based early 
<br/>flood warning systems.  This support Section 5(1)(l) of the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  NDMO  will  implement  similar  systems  for  the  hazards,  accurate  and  timely  early 
<br/>warning from the Fiji Meteorological Office are absolutely essential for the NDMO to effectively 
<br/>prepare for and respond to disasters ensuring better decision making and quick emergency responses 
<br/>that ultimately saves lives and property.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, weather patterns have become increasingly unpredictable as we all know 
<br/>due to the impact of climate change on our island nation and the Bill that is before us will enable the 
<br/>Fiji Meteorological Office to establish robust meteorological  and hydrological systems to address 
<br/>this evolving weather conditions.  It supports the development and implementation of strategies to 
<br/>mitigate the adverse effects of Climate Change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  an  international  level  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Section  3(c)  of  the  Bill  contributes  to  the  UN 
<br/>mandate of Disaster Risk Reduction where accurate weather and water data are fundamental for risk 
<br/>assessment and management.  One key area of collaboration with the Met. Office is impact based 
<br/>forecasting where the Meteorological office provides warnings alongside exposure information and 
<br/>the NDMO analysis the risk impacts and vulnerabilities in affected areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this contributes to the broader multi-hazard early warning system of Fiji 
<br/>which is being included in the Revised Disaster Bill which I had tabled earlier and formalising this 
<br/>ongoing work with a legal framework ensures accountability to both the government offices and the 
<br/>people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  promotes  economic  resilience,  sustainability  by 
<br/>enhancing  meteorological  and  hydrological  services  which  will  benefit  various  sectors  such  as 
<br/>agriculture, water ways and infrastructural planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also mandates the Fiji Meteorological office as a sole provider as shared to us by the 
<br/>honourable Usamate and during disasters incorrect warnings can cause public panic and providing 
<br/>these legal  mandate will hold  accountable any organisation  other than Meteorological  Office that 
<br/>issues such warnings.  Thereby mitigating misinformation that can affect disaster response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Bill  will  improve  our  ability  to  predict  and  monitor 
<br/>natural  hazards  thereby,  reducing  the  risk  and  the  impact  of  disaster  such  as  floods,  storms  and 
<br/>droughts. Finally, this Bill complements the Natural Disaster Risk Bill which I tabled earlier and Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.

<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Members  for  their 
<br/>contribution and insights into this Bill and also for their positive responses.  Some of the issues raised 
<br/>are technical issues regarding the transmission of data, modelling system, et cetera, which are issues 
<br/>in  terms  of  capacity  within  the  organisation  and  that  is  something  which  this  Bill  and  also  the 
<br/>enhancement of the capacities within it can addressed together with our development partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Especially,  the  scientific  organisations,  the  issue  regarding  weather  warnings,  there  was  a 
<br/>mention of weather warnings from someone in the market but of course that is not something that we 
<br/>are referring too, it could be or it is from my understanding those who is purporting to be official 
<br/>warnings.  That is something even can be clarified through regulatory provisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Please,  address  the  Speaker.    Yes,  including  that,  if  it  is 
<br/>purporting to be official and not originating from a scientifically verified and officially recognised.  
<br/>The  overlaps  raised  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  duplication,  of  course,  that 
<br/>continues to be an issue throughout most of the ministries and from the way I see it, it is an attitude 
<br/>problem  in  leadership  but  if  you  are  a  good  leader  whether  you  are  Director  Meteorology  or 
<br/>Permanent Secretary, you should be able to communicate openly and with a good heart to resolve 
<br/>and address the issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the day what matters is how we deliver the service to the people.  Duplication 
<br/>of functions and all these should be issues which should not hinder that and of course weather and 
<br/>hydrology, we note that in terms of moving forward and trying to enhance that in order to ensure that 
<br/>there is no duplication or confusion. Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition regarding IPCC 
<br/>and the Climate Change Act 2021, ensuring that the Director Meteorological Service continues to be 
<br/>the focal point and ensuring that the Director, Climate Change or PS Climate Change will of course 
<br/>be part of that, so that we can move forward together in a coordinated manner in terms of climate 
<br/>change and other international engagements that we do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  would  just  like  to  acknowledge  our  development  partners  who  have  assisted  the 
<br/>Meteorological  Services:    Australian  DFAT,  UNDP,  Korean  Meteorological  Agency,  JICA  and 
<br/>various other scientific agencies which have assisted and continue to assist us.  I commend the Bill 
<br/>for the approval and support of the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>protection  of  livelihoods  and  property  for  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Disasters  and 
<br/>Hazards and for related matters enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. 
<br/>……. of 2024)]
