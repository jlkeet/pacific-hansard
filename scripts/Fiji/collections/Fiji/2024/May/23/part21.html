<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 131, and for the 
<br/>purposes of Section 145(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament approves - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>885 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>the increase in Government Guarantee for the Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited’s domestic 
<br/>borrowings of $75 million for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2028 which is the 
<br/>guarantee period by $20 million; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>that FSC be exempted from paying any guarantee fee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, FSC is Fiji’s Sugar Milling 
<br/>Company incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1972 to take over the milling activities from South 
<br/>Pacific Sugar Milling and CSR Limited in 1973.  The Fiji Sugar Corporation operates three sugar 
<br/>Mills; two on Viti Levu in Lautoka and Rarawai, Ba, and third in Labasa, Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has been guaranteeing FSC’s domestic and offshore borrowing 
<br/>in the past years.  The latest domestic guarantee cover was approved by Parliament on 28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/>whereby Parliament approved an additional guarantee to FSC of $75 million for a guarantee period 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2028.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FSC on 8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022 and March 2024, executed and utilised the guarantee with the 
<br/>Bank of the South Pacific Limited for a loan facility of $50 million and HFC Bank for an overdraft 
<br/>facility  of  $25  million  respectively.    The  FSC  has  fully  exhausted  the  approved  Government 
<br/>Guarantee limit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, the Government also guaranteed FSC’s offshore borrowings which was 
<br/>approved on 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2017, whereby Parliament approved the extension of the Government 
<br/>Guarantee period for the EXIM Bank of India loan of USD$50.4 million from 19</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2019 
<br/>to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2028.  Both the parliamentary approvals exempted FSC from paying the guarantee 
<br/>fee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC has been operating at 75 percent production capacity for the past years 
<br/>and the company’s operation has been adversely affected by various uncontrollable factors ranging 
<br/>from  spate of natural  disasters, volatility in  the world  sugar price, milling  inefficiencies resulting 
<br/>from the failed mill upgrade project, deteriorating cane quality and decrease in cane production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  of  May  2023,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FSC’s  total  operating  cost  is  $60.6  million,  of  which 
<br/>approximately 44 percent - $26.7 million was dispensed as salaries and wages.  This was an increase 
<br/>of about 8 percent when compared to $56 million as total operating cost in 2022 financial year, the 
<br/></span><span>increase mainly attributed to increase in salaries to staff, except the Executive Management, rise in 
<br/></span><span>fuel price and post COVID-19 recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC had continuously been carrying net losses for the past 10 years.  As at 
<br/>31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2023, FSC incurred a net loss of $23 million, compared to $44.3 million net losses for the 
<br/>2022 financial year.  FSC’s total  liabilities has acceded its total  asset based for the last 10 years, 
<br/>technically meaning it has been insolvent during that period.  This is well-known, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  2024  financial  year  2023  cane  season,  FSC  anticipates  better  results,  with  cane 
<br/></span><span>production of 1.56 million tonnes  and sugar makeup of around 139,628 tonnes, hence $240.3 million 
<br/></span><span>in total revenue was expected from sugar proceeds and molasses for the financial year.  It is projected 
<br/>that  earnings  before  interest,  excess  depreciation  armortisation  for  2024  financial  year  will  be  a 
<br/>positive $22.2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The world sugar price, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know has moved in FSC’s favour last year, 
<br/>currently hovering around US$0.90 cents per pound compared to below $0.14 cents per pound, some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two years back at the time of pricing - an increase of about 39 percent.  The price had increased over 
<br/>US$0.25 cents per pound.  Late last year, it was projected to stay closer to about $0.20 cents per 
<br/>pound.  This is projected to improve the financial position of FSC, except for natural disasters and 
<br/>other  unexpected  events.  It  is  expected,  therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  key  performance 
<br/>perimeters for the next five years will be achieved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024, FSC’s outstanding borrowings guaranteed by Government stood at 
<br/>$276.2 million, of which $200.2 million is covered by Domestic Government Guarantee, and $76 
<br/>million which is about US$32.7 million is covered by Offshore Government Guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  financial  implications  of  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  of  30</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  2024,  the  total 
<br/>Government  Guarantee  debt  stood  at  $1.03  billion  or  $1,030.8  million  or  7.8  percent  of  Gross 
<br/>Domestic Product.  With FSC accessing an additional $20 million which  is what the guarantee is 
<br/>asking, borrowings will increase the total Government Guarantee exposure to $1,050.8 million or 
<br/>$1.05 billion or 7.9 percent of GDP.  In the event of a default, the Government will be liable for the 
<br/>guarantee borrowing of the FSC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  also working  with  FSC and the Ministry of 
<br/>Sugar to monitor the restructuring efforts of the Board and Management of FSC, to ensure any fiscal 
<br/>risk that might arise and that are there are properly communicated, mitigated and managed by FSC 
<br/>with the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>similar to the previous one, I have a list of speakers in front of me, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Leader of the Opposition; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  my  understanding,  the  Assistant  Minister  in  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office  would  like  to 
<br/>participate too so you have three. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion for the Government to guarantee 
<br/></span><span>FSC’s borrowings of $75 million for the period from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August 2022 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2028 and also to 
<br/></span><span>exempt FSC from paying a guarantee fee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge the importance of the guarantee to FSC. It will help FSC 
<br/>to borrow, to ensure continuous production and export.  But we are also very concerned the manner 
<br/>in which FSC is currently operating.  That, I will discuss a little later but I want to simply say that 
<br/>guarantee is important. It will only kick in if FSC cannot pay the loan. So, let us hope that over a 
<br/>period of time, FSC improves, as the honourable Minister has highlighted, that the world sugar price 
<br/>is looking favourable and if it does that, then obviously it is very good for the Government, for the 
<br/></span><span>people and FSC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  I  must  say,  unlike  the  Opposition  of  the  past,  we  understand  that  the  role  of  the 
<br/>Opposition is not merely to oppose but also to support beneficial proposals from the Government. 
<br/>And this is one set of proposal and there are many others we have supported as you can see.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>887 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  support  the  motion  because  we  know  the  significance  of  the  sugar  industry  to  Fiji’s 
<br/>economy.  It  not only  supports export  reserves but  also  safeguards our  foreign  exchange.  During 
<br/>COVID period it was a sugar industry that was bringing in foreign exchange and keeping our foreign 
<br/>reserve intact.  Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC is the major employer in Fiji, supporting thousands of 
<br/>jobs directly and in directly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  sugarcane  farms  are  in  rural  areas  where  economic  opportunities  are  limited.  This 
<br/>morning,  we  heard  from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture.    He  was  talking  about  the 
<br/>importance of supporting agriculture to eradicate poverty. Sir, in  the same way, I also believe by 
<br/>supporting FSC, it means reducing the risk of poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a Government Guarantee, FSC could secure financing for improving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>efficiency and productivity, reduce reliance on just raw sugar exports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been and it must be noted by all of us. There has been a lot of support given directly 
<br/>or indirectly by the Government over the years with only one hope, that all players in the sugar sector 
<br/>will play their part in increasing the sugar production, and that is where the failure is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, despite the assistance, the sugar sector is not performing to its optimum.  We 
<br/>can blame one another till the cows come home.  We can start from the Lome Convention when Fiji 
<br/>was receiving preferential sugar prices and we can ask ourselves why we did not upgrade our mills 
<br/>or diversify into other products during the golden period. We can also talk about the non-renewable 
<br/>of land leases around 1997 when farmers have to find shelter in informal settlements along Suva and 
<br/>Nausori corridor.  We can also talk about large sums of loan taken from EXIM Bank in 2004-2005 
<br/>to upgrade our Mills and we know that the Mills were not upgraded to that standard.  We can also 
<br/>talk about the assistance offered by European Union that was not taken up to improve farming and 
<br/>milling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the solution of the problem is to remove politics from this industry, that is 
<br/>the only solution.  We need to build the sugar industry purely based on the business model and now 
<br/>honourable Singh is there, he has been running his business, and I am sure he will be able to bring 
<br/>that business sense into the operation of various institutions linked to the sugar sector and I believe 
<br/>this is what is missing. They have been relying too much on the Government for assistance.  I want 
<br/>to speak on the importance of diversification so that the Government does not have to guarantee FSC 
<br/>loans and how the various agencies can start moving into that direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is very little diversification of crops adopted by the sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span><span>When I am talking about diversification, it starts with farmers, the millers and also other subsidiaries 
<br/>or you can say, organisations, for example, Sugarcane Farmers Fund as well as the South Pacific 
<br/>Fertilizer company.  So, let us start with the farmers, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were quite surprised because in Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we invited all the stakeholders, we had a discussion with FSC and other stakeholders and I was 
<br/>taken aback when the Field Officers at FSC gave their opinion and they believed that if farmers start 
<br/>planting alternative crops they might move away from sugarcane.  So, they were more worried from 
<br/></span><span>that perspective.  But  on the other hand,  we have  iTLTB that says that, good husbandry must be 
<br/></span><span>practised.    The  soil  should  be  in  good  state  and  if  the  soil  is  not  looked  after,  then  there  can  be 
<br/>penalties to the farmers.  But it just does not make sense and we can see that in all these, agriculture 
<br/>is far removed. They are not anywhere near sugarcane farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me talk about FSC.  The FSC has not diversified into alternate products, 
<br/>they are producing ethanol from bagasse for their own use but they can do better than that by using 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hog fuel, et cetera, to produce more energy for electricity grid, but that is not happening to the level 
<br/>that we desire. But what else can they do?  Can they move towards refined and specialised sugars to 
<br/>better manage their revenue and cash flow risk?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, by diversifying, FSC can reduce 
<br/>reliance on just one single product.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the Sugarcane Growers Fund.  By now, it should have become a financial lender for 
<br/>all farms, generating profits for cane farmers so that cane farmers benefit from this diversification.  
<br/>We understand that the Sugarcane Growers Fund was established by cane farmers.  It does not mean 
<br/>that it should be just there for the cane farmers, they can diversify into lending and the interest they 
<br/>generate, they can also offer loans to the cane farmers at a much reduced rate. So, it is a win-win 
<br/>situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have South Pacific Fertilizer company - a subsidiary of Sugarcane Growers Fund.  Over 
<br/>the  years,  the  government  has  been  subsidising  the  cost  of  fertilizer.  But  did  the  South  Pacific 
<br/>Fertilizer make any effort to change its financial position?  Did they diversify or tried to diversify?  
<br/>They  have  not,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    They  are  still  blending  fertilizers  but  farmers  are  demanding 
<br/>fertilizers based on their soil type. They have not fully moved into becoming the supplier of fertilizers 
<br/>to the non-sugar sector.  There is an opportunity, but that opportunity has not been ceased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mechanical  harvesters  are  there  but  co-operatives  face  the  problem  of  spare  parts  and 
<br/>qualified mechanics for repairs and maintenance.  Why these services could not be provided by the 
<br/>Sugar Sector?  They had not looked at this area at all and when we go out in the field, when we meet 
<br/>farmers and the co-operatives, they have been complaining about this particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Sector should have embarked on this diversification programme 
<br/>probably decades ago.  We should have had a Sugar Refinery Company decades ago.  This merely 
<br/>depicts the lack of foresight and goodwill.  More are broadly diversifying the revenue base would 
<br/>position the Sugar Sector to offer better prices to farmers.  Our problem is, we are trying to seek 
<br/>efficiency and productivity from  institutions established during the Colonial era.  Other countries 
<br/>have moved away from these structures and modernised the law so that the Sugar Sector operates on 
<br/>a business model, and we have not done that purely because of politics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  these  institutions,  I  remember  in  one  of  our  meetings  when  I 
<br/>questioned the people around the table and my question was very simple, that you have visited so 
<br/>many countries and seen how the countries were running their sugar mill, the whole Sugar Sector.  
<br/>What can you tell us about the institutional structures they have?  Do they have the same institution 
<br/></span><span>structures that we have at the moment? Some of them actually just smiled way, but we can see there 
<br/></span><span>is a push and pull factor at this level.  While we are trying to improve the Sugar Industry, we will not 
<br/>be able to achieve unless and until we make some drastic changes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard from honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we have another 
<br/>opportunity knocking on our door. With an increase in world market price for sugar, I do not know  
<br/>how long it is going to stay but I am aware that around 2017, FSC faced a 33 percent reduction in the 
<br/>world sugar export prices, so that was quite significant.  And you can probably see that, that is the 
<br/>reason why they need assistance from the Government - to keep the company afloat.  But I believe 
<br/></span><span>that with the sugar price increase, there is an opportunity and we should grab that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the world’s largest sugar producers are moving towards ethanol 
<br/>while others are facing similar problems like Fiji where production has dropped, and a good example 
<br/>is Cuba.  India is moving towards ethanol production, which means they will be demanding more 
<br/>sugar  from  other  countries,  and  they  have  gone  into  high  value  product.    In  other  words,  if  you 
<br/>produce ethanol, you get better price than the raw sugar in the world market stage.

<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>889 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to focus on how to raise efficiency, how to raise production and 
<br/>how to build the confidence of farmers in the industry.  At the end of the day, I believe we have 
<br/>created so many structures and so many institutions, but at the end of the day, the farmers are the 
<br/>losers.  They are depending on all these institutions to work in harmony and improve the revenue so 
<br/>that they can gain from it.  But in fact, it looks like it is the other way round.  We are just trying to 
<br/>use farmer’s money to keep this institutions going but they are not getting the level of return they 
<br/>should get. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words I support the motion that was presented by the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deputy Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Premila for all her sentiments and 
<br/>suggestions for the Sugar Industry.  One thing I will have to assure this honourable Parliament is that 
<br/>the first thing that I did when I became the Minister was to get the mill Board for FSC who understood 
<br/>about the operations of the Sugar Industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One particular person I made the Chairman was Mr. Nitya Reddy because he was a former 
<br/>accountant of all the mills in Fiji, including the Ghief Accountant, before he actually migrated to 
<br/>New Zealand.  Ever since he came to the new Board, he has taken a new direction on FSC. I assure 
<br/>Parliament that ‘yes’, he is doing basically what we want and what Parliament wants and to bring the 
<br/>sugar industry back on the street.  Mr. Speaker Sir, that will of course make FSC more efficient and 
<br/>make FSC profitable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister of Finance. Sir the rationale behind this motion is to embed the unwavering confidence that 
<br/>the  Sugar  Industry  is  on  the  right  particularly  towards  a  robust  and  sustainable  future.    This 
<br/>confidence  is  based  on  serval  strategic  initiatives  and  notable  positive  developments  within  the 
<br/>industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Firstly, I would like to highlight that we have significantly expanded our support programmes 
<br/>for  the  sugar  industry.    The  number  of  programmes  have  increased  from  6  to  13  in  the  current 
<br/>financial  year,  demonstrate  our  commitment  to  the  comprehensive  support  for  all  aspects  of  the 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, we have actively  been addressing the long strategic issues of the land leases by 
<br/>providing  subsidies  on  the  premium  payments.    This  initiative  is  designed  to  elevate  financial 
<br/></span><span>background  on  the  farmers  and  ensure  that  land  remains  accessible  and  affordable  for  the  cane 
<br/></span><span>cultivations.    As  I  have  explained  this  is  written  in  the  earlier  response  to  the  question  raised  by 
<br/>honourable Virendra Lal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are engaging more with the younger farmers and promoting 
<br/>the use of mechanisation as we recognise that these elements are crucial for the future of the sugar 
<br/>industry.  By promoting the youth involvements and modern agriculture technologies we are building 
<br/>a more resilient and efficient economic sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Youth involvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J.  SINGH.-  Additionally,  we have achieved a remarkable milestone by making a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>high speed payment for the 2022 crop in the rate of $91.38 per tonne.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, just for the information of Parliament, we actually will be paying this fourth cane payment 
<br/>which comes out of Tuesday are $21.75.  This is the highest paid for the fourth cane payment but not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>

<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>only that, after paying this fourth cane payment, a total payment will be $101.08 which is higher than 
<br/>last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-    Of  course,  there  is  another  last  payment  after  that  is  called  partial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>payment that will be another $2 or $3. We are looking at... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- No money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No pride than sugar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J.  SINGH.-  We are looking at  about  $105 at  the end.  So what I am  saying,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  in  this  current  payment  we  will  be  injecting  $34.1  million  in  the  economy.    This 
<br/>significant  payment  reflects  our  commitment  to  ensuring  fair  compensation  for  our  hardworking 
<br/>farmers and providing them with the financial stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the groundwork of the Coalition Government is evident and it is clear that 
<br/>the industry is part of the rebuild. The approval of this motion will be instrumental in ensuring that 
<br/>this recovery continues unbeaten.   By increasing the Government’s guarantee and exempting from 
<br/>the guarantee fees we are providing a necessary financial support and confidence that will enable 
<br/>FSC to meets its commitment towards our hardworking farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the motion is not just a financial manoeuvrer, 
<br/>it is a strategic step towards securing the future of the Sugar industry.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I 
<br/>conclude, I would like to say what actually was the background. Every time that FSC needed funds 
<br/>because we have a sugar buyer in UK, we had to borrow a short-term fund from them which costed 
<br/>FSC about $1 million interest for the 45 days borrowing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now apart from that, the buyer was double dipping.  First, it means we have to sell our sugar 
<br/>that is currently on the fields.  They come and buy our sugar at that price and they basically tie our 
<br/>hands and legs and the gate price. First, we are losing by selling sugar at lower price, then we have 
<br/>to go back and borrow a short-term funding which was costing us a million dollars US so I am saying 
<br/>here what the idea now with the current Board of Directors we have had discussion with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us increase our Government Guarantee, let us have our local banks borrow whereby we 
<br/></span><span>can negotiate with HFC, FDB or any bank for a short-term funding and, of course, the interest rate 
<br/></span><span>that we will pay will remain in Fiji. So, this whole idea to have these kinds of facilities, that as for 
<br/>FSC, they will not use this for capital projects. This will facilitate that each time FSC needs refunding 
<br/>they can go back and apply for short term funding from local banks. So Mr. Speaker, Sir, that’s the 
<br/>whole idea of this government guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge all the members of Parliament to support this motions as it is a vital component for our 
<br/>ongoing efforts to revitalize and sustain the Sugar Industry for the benefit of all Fijians. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– I now offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition. The floor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is yours, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.  -  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I also  wish to  contribute to  the 
<br/>motion  raised  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  to  increase  the 
<br/>Government Guarantee for the Fiji Sugar Corporation Ltd domestic borrowings of $750 million for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>891 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the period of 1</span><span>st</span><span> August 2022 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May 2028 and of course that the FSC be exempted from paying 
<br/>the guarantee fee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to  by  my  colleague,  honourable  Premila  Kumar,  we  fully  support  the  motion, 
<br/>given the importance of FSC and how it benefits, not only the farmers and the people involved but 
<br/>of course how it helps us economically too as a country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again as alluded to by the honourable Minister, this government guarantee 
<br/>is something that is not new and of course the last guarantee was given on 28</span><span>th</span><span> July 2022 and we are 
<br/>just continuing with it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Of course, we will all agree that we need FSC to continue 
<br/>its work but of course with more efficiency as well and particularly profitability and that is something 
<br/>that we all hope will be achieved sometimes in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Minister, for the changes that he has stated, particularly the work that 
<br/>the Board is undertaking but of course, this requires the collective efforts of all key stakeholders and 
<br/>again, I want to emphasize that Mr. Speaker, Sir. Today, we have talked at length about land that has 
<br/>already been made available and I think the big question, particularly  in terms  of the land that is 
<br/>available is the question on utilization.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I looked at the last Annual Report for 2023 and just looking at the Labasa 640,000 tonnes of 
<br/>cane, that is well below what Vanua Levu particularly, the cane belt areas is capable of. I know during 
<br/>the heydays, it was around 2 – 3 million for Labasa alone and that’s the challenge that we all have, 
<br/>and we hope we can work together on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  still  open  to  the  Special  Committee  that  was  part  of  His 
<br/>Excellency’s opening address last year, the commitment by Government to form a Select Committee 
<br/>to look at the Sugar Industry, probably not just Sugar but of course the whole Agricultural sector, 
<br/>something  that  has  been  circulating  as  well  behind  the  scenes,  particularly  in  the  work  of  the 
<br/>Committees given the importance of agriculture and how it contributes to our national development, 
<br/>economic progress and most importantly, the need for us to diversify and broaden the economic pace 
<br/>so that we can be in a better position particularly to meet all the expectations that are there before us. 
<br/>Perhaps, the only other issue that I wish to raise I have talked about land utilisation as alluded too by 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar, these all boils down to increase production, particularly in the field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FSC, of course, is operating well below its capacity and the only way to improve apart from 
<br/>diversification I think the basic is to let us just produce more cane in all the three mills so that it will 
<br/></span><span>help not only in the financial position of FSC because that is how FSC makes its money. The more 
<br/></span><span>sugarcane it crushes the more sugar we have.  We sell and that is how it can make its operating cost 
<br/>and of course, reinvest as well something that is badly needed so that we can come away from this 
<br/>Government guarantee.  That is the key question for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sugar  Research  Institute  plays  a  very  important  role  in  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the 
<br/>identification, research, selection of the right varieties and that is something that I also wish to also 
<br/>say  in  here  with  all  due  respect  having  served  as  Commissioner  in  Vanua  Levu,  it  is  the  FSC 
<br/>extension workers. We need to shake them. They need to do more because my observation, it seems 
<br/></span><span>that they focused more on cane logistics rather than the normal extension work that is expected of 
<br/></span><span>FSC field workers. This is an area. They need to work with the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of the farmers are unsupervised. They only come and see them when its time to fix the 
<br/>road because the mill is about to open in the next few weeks. That is when you see all the vehicles 
<br/>running all over the places and so forth, so they focussed more on logistics rather than the basic work 
<br/>which is on farm extension. That is something that they really need to do to improve cane production.

<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see from  the honourable Members from  the other side that  I have to sit down now, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but that is my contribution. Again, FSC is important and let us work together to grow 
<br/>the industry to improve on its efficiency and most importantly. ensure that it goes back to a level of 
<br/>profitability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  in  support  of  the  motion  before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament for the Guarantee to the FSC borrowing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will take this from tourism and aviation perspective. In that, we need to 
<br/>ensure that FSC continues to operate viably for the production of ethanol known as the sustainable 
<br/>aviation  field  that  were  drive  aviation  in  the  future.  I  had  a  brief  Parliament  on  a  Ministerial 
<br/>Statements on the importance of SAF that we cannot do without it. It has to be part of aviation going 
<br/>forward, going hand in hand with our tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point, Mr. Speaker, indications are that we need to produce about 3.5 million tonnes 
<br/>of cane to enable us to produce ethanol at a level that we would require in this country for our aviation. 
<br/>Our production right now is around 1.6 million tonnes, for the record we have was 4.2 billion so it is 
<br/>possible, it is durable that we can get back to about 3.5 million tonnes of canes to enable us to produce 
<br/>efficient  ethanol.  The  sentiments  expressed  by  honourable  Kumar  is  very  true,  I  think  the 
<br/>fragmentation within the industry is not helping.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was a cane farmer myself.  When I was here with the Economic Affairs Committee we had 
<br/>consultations for Bill 19 and Bill 20 designed by the previous Government to revamp the industry 
<br/>and what we saw was that it is quite fragmented and if you can reconcile all those institutions within 
<br/>FSC, it can bring back the production that we want. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, there is about 40,000 hectares that are available for cane but the yield hectare is about 
<br/>47 right now.  We have farmers in this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one in Labasa that we met during 
<br/>that  time,  he  was  producing  125  tonnes  per  hectare  and  I  was  told  in  Nadi,  there  was  someone 
<br/>producing 150 tons per hectare. If you can up the yield, we can double or triple what we currently do 
<br/>today.  But it means a more cohesion within those institutions that are part of the FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On ethanol, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as indicated by honourable Kumar, some countries have gone 
<br/>into ethanol in a big way and that is somewhere Fiji should be headed to, there is of course, SAF is 
<br/></span><span>quite expensive these days but as the whole world gears up for the production of SAF because we 
<br/></span><span>want to be net zero by 2050, the aviation industry in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  support  from  the  developed  countries  at  the  COP28,  the  commitment  by  the 
<br/>developed countries to help finance developing countries like Fiji is there, technology transfer is also 
<br/>there.  Our capacity building is also there.  In the cause of trying the cost of producing SAF will come 
<br/>down, so Fiji should get itself up to produce its own ASF, it will be tragic that we have the few stocks 
<br/>through strain and then we export our fuel for aviation.  As I said there is an opportunity with ADB 
<br/>to carry out the feasibility study for FSC and Fiji Airways on the production of ethanol in Fiji and I 
<br/></span><span>have also asked them to look at cassava because cassava is also a feed stock for ethanol. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have indicated it could be transformative for Fiji when you 
<br/>go into SAF production.  Cassava has grown everywhere in the country and properly harness, it could 
<br/>transform the market for us at the village level and across the country.  Tourism is critical for the 
<br/>country and this ethanol should be produced to help our aviation and help our tourism industry hence 
<br/>the need to strengthen FSC and position it to produce SAF in the coming year.  On aviation, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>893 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, if I could just go back to what I said yesterday that tourism today is about $3.3 billion 
<br/>and in the next four years, it can be $4.3 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is quite significant and we spoke about liberalisation of aviation policy and let me just 
<br/>share with our people across the isle that we all subscribe to a restrictive aviation policy all this while 
<br/>but things have changed hence the liberalisation of our air aviation policy.  As I said yesterday, right 
<br/>now with America we can only fly to Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Fransico but we need to go 
<br/>into all the ports in the United States.  All that has changed the thinking, the Americans are saying ,  
<br/>“Liberalize your Aviation Policy and then we can talk about you coming in.”  That is why I spoke 
<br/>against open air in September last year, but I have changed my tune this year, it is for that reason - 
<br/>the reason that, if we do not do it, we do not get access to American ports where lies a huge part of 
<br/>the future of our tourism industry.  So, please, be assured that it is not a change that was made without 
<br/>the due thought process and, of course, all our negotiations, Fiji Airways was part of it.  So, we did 
<br/>not go out there and negotiate something separate from Fiji Airways, it was all there, Mr. Speaker. I 
<br/>just wanted our people on the other side to be assured that we are doing this in the best way for Fiji, 
<br/>the Tourism Industry and our national airways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for ethanol, SAF is very critical, and as I have said once, I never 
<br/>thought that one day I would be talking about FSC’s future with Fiji Airways and vice-versa.  But 
<br/>that is the way forward for Fiji, and I would like to see that we continue to support FSC for the future 
<br/>of aviation in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  in  support  of  the  motion  before  Parliament.  
<br/>Before I begin, I wish to pay tribute to the late Mr. Eliki Bomani, a former civil servant who has just 
<br/>passed away earlier this week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Bomani from Namuana, Tavuki, Kadavu, is the son of the former Alliance Party Minister, 
<br/>Mr. Solomoni Momoivalu.  He joined the Public Service straight from Marist Brothers High School 
<br/>and rose through the ranks to reach the post of the Deputy Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office 
<br/>in 2012.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We offer our warm condolences to his </span><span>Mataqali Verata</span><span>, his wife - Patricia, daughter - Letila 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Momoivalu and the </span><span>vanua </span><span>of Erauraki.  May his soul rest in peace and rise in glory. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have heard from this afternoon, there has been a lot of discussions on 
<br/>the Sugar Industry and, of course, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs in our various trips 
<br/></span><span>across the country.  We have noted that Sugar Industry is not sustainable because the small farmers 
<br/></span><span>are facing the brunt- they are not able to survive with the current small acreage that they have.  I think 
<br/>the future of the industry is to make sure that we have larger farms and more economical to produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that has been missing which I have looked through all the 
<br/>reports, is a more coherent policy which needs to be formulated.  Of course, I would like to thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister, who has come up with an idea of having this policy.  We have requested FAO, 
<br/>they will be starting in June to come up with this new policy and this new policy will lay the ground 
<br/>rules - how many farmers do we really need? How many acres do we need there on the ground?  Of 
<br/></span><span>course, where are the markets?  These will be clearly stipulated in this policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I would like to thank the honourable Minister.  He has this foresight, he has very strategic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thinking about the new way to address the challenges that we face here in this industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to emphasise the need to adequately streamline where FSC is 
<br/>sourcing its finance from.  Currently, FSC obtains the loans and finances from a number of financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>

<div><span> Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>institutions. Once we have the policy in place and a much more clear roadmap, perhaps may be it 
<br/>will be prudent for FSC to be looking at a sole financial provider. Of course, once we put together 
<br/>all  the  various  financial  sources  into  one  single  source,  we  would  benefit  from  a  single  financial 
<br/>provider that offers a preferential interest rate.  Of course there is a lot of this in the market.  I am 
<br/>sure that FSC Board will be able to look into that.  I think that is all from my side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and of course I do support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be as brief as possible.  I want 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to thank all the honourable Members for their support and some of the issues raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry including the institutions within the industry have been a big challenge. 
<br/>The signals that we have provided as a Government over the last 17 months, has seen a new sense of 
<br/>confidence amongst the sugarcane farmers, I was in Labasa last weekend, there was a first Northern 
<br/>Development Summit Innovation and Entrepreneurship  and what I was told, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the 
<br/>sense  of  confidence,  there  are  a  lot  of  farmers  a  sort  of  getting  back,  working  towards  trying  to 
<br/>increase their production and it is largely coming from the price incentive with the highest cane price 
<br/>ever  in  the  history  of  Fiji.    Last  year  was  $91,  this  year  the  fourth  cane  payment  has  just  been 
<br/>announced today of $21.75, again, the highest ever and the final price is expected to be more than 
<br/>$100.  These are price signals that are actually motivating the farmers to produce more because they 
<br/>can possibilities of better income.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government on its part, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continue with some of the programmes that 
<br/>were there including subsidies for fertilizer and weedicides.  We allocated $2 million within Ministry 
<br/>of  Sugar  Budget  for  lease  subsidies  and  in  addition  to  that  as  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar 
<br/>pointed out, the Government provided further $1.2 million for the renewal of 218 agricultural leases 
<br/>of which about 45 average.  What we have done in the last 14 to 15 months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as well 
<br/>as in the last Budget has given the signal. The honourable Leader of the Opposition made two very 
<br/>good points and I agree with him wholeheartedly. He talked about the share extension and training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji for a long time whether you talk about FSC, whether you talk about 
<br/>agriculture, probably one of the best research extension and training programmes and unfortunately 
<br/>in the last so many years that was completely dismantled and it is now being built and that is very 
<br/>important  because  if  farmers  to  do  not  get  that kind  of  attention  from  FSC  and  other  institutions 
<br/>within the industry then a lot of the issues particularly planting the right cane variety and the Minister 
<br/>talked about the wrong variety that a lot of farmers were introduced to and where the sugar content 
<br/>was much lower.  So, I think as a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are addressing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second good point that the honourable Leader of the Opposition made was about the farm 
<br/>level production and he is right.  If you do not have cane production, nothing will work., FSC will 
<br/>not  be  profitable,  no  arm  of  the  industry  will  work.  The  2006  European  Union  funding  of  $350 
<br/>million, I think honourable Members perhaps you do not need to understand that. During the late Mr. 
<br/>Qarase’s term as a Prime Minister that loan was negotiated (it is not a loan, it was a grant) which was 
<br/>going to look at three components in the industry.  They were going to look at alternative livelihood, 
<br/>it was going to look upgrading of the mills and it was going to look at Research Extension efficiency 
<br/>and effectiveness at the farm level so that farmers income was increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, we lost that in the last 15 years. No substantial funds were injected to improve in 
<br/>fact  on the other hand we lost the railways which is  been a major contributor to  the high  cost  of 
<br/>production and transportation of cane for the famers. So that is something that the Government is 
<br/>looking at and hopefully there will be some improvement.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>895 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue about the lease renewals, the honourable Leader of the Opposition said in 1997 and 
<br/>1998 in fact I want to give them some statistics.  Under the SVT government led by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister at that time in 1998, 82 percent of all the leases were renewed. And those that wanted 
<br/>to move in fact the schemes in Navua and other places were set up to do that. So we understand that 
<br/>as a Government and we have been in the last 14 months addressing that head-on and that is already 
<br/>showing positive results for the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Kumar, talked about politics. In fact, it is the other way around when politics was 
<br/>there  sugar  production  was  very  high.    There  is  a  lot  of  knowledge-sharing  between  Sugar  Cane 
<br/>Growers Councils, various institutions and the mechanisms within those institutions provided that 
<br/>but I agree with the points raised that all these institutions, there is no room for these institutions – 
<br/>the Sugar Research Institute, Sugarcane Growers Fund, FSC to be working in silos.  They need to 
<br/>come together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They need to understand that all these institutions are very important and I think the Ministry 
<br/>of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry has already made that very public statement and I hope 
<br/>that the stakeholders, particularly FSC, will look at restructuring.  As I have said before, the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance  in  working  with the Ministry of Sugar will ensure that appropriate restructuring takes 
<br/>place and that FSC manages its affairs in an official and effective manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank all the honourable Members for the support to the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
