<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move:

<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament but that one hour be given to debate the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill, with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise before this 
<br/></span><span>august Parliament today to move that the Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span><span>be moved under Standing Order 51 with the referral to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Members of this august Parliament would know, the review of the Natural 
<br/>Disaster Management Act 1998 began under the leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>who was then the Minister for Disaster Management. The review is a culmination of over a decade 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>869 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>long review process, marked by extensive consultations and incorporation of lessons learnt from past 
<br/>disasters, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the Bill that is before you 
<br/>today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  process  aims  to  streamline the time spent  deliberating on the Bill,  while ensuring its 
<br/>integrity and transparency, and it is  essential  that we balance the democratic process by allowing 
<br/>thorough  examination  of  the  Bill,  while  also  emphasising  the  urgency  of  its  endorsement.    This 
<br/>legislation  provides  a  crucial  legal  framework  needed  to  protect  our  people  from  the  devastating 
<br/>impacts of disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the prime reason for the urgency required in tabling the Natural Disaster 
<br/>Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 through Standing 51 is because of the unpredictability of 
<br/>hazards  that  we  are  now  facing  and  the  unprecedented  damage  and  losses  that  they  incur  on  our 
<br/>economy and society in general. One clear indication is of the recent flooding in the Serua area last 
<br/>week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic that swept through the country in 2019 and the back-
<br/>to-back  cyclones  of  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  and  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>  in  2021,  has  put  pressure  on  to  our  already  fragile 
<br/>environment.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these were extraordinary in terms of their nature and frequency and 
<br/>stretched our disaster management capabilities to the limit. There have been gaps identified in inter-
<br/>agency coordination and responsibilities that needed to be urgently addressed to enable effective and 
<br/>efficient disaster risk management and the timely saving of lives and livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have done the necessary consultations amongst Government agencies.  
<br/>The Bill refines our disaster risk management governance arrangements, to ensure that there is clarity 
<br/>and efficiency in the way we respond to the new hazards and disasters we are now facing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is completely contextualised to Fiji’s unique needs, while at the 
<br/>same time aligns Fiji to international standards and best practices, as outlined in global and regional 
<br/>disaster risk reduction frameworks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill is a product of constant consultations and lessons learnt from disasters and, of course, 
<br/>the good work done by my predecessor, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, during his tenure 
<br/>as Minister responsible for disaster management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our conceited opinion and as responsible stewards for the safety and 
<br/></span><span>security of our people, we must treat this Bill as a matter of utmost priority. The changing weather 
<br/></span><span>and hazards we are now facing due to the impacts of climate change means that we cannot rely on 
<br/>our past experience and lull ourselves into a false sense of security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  prompt  enactment  of  the  Bill  ensures  that  all  necessary 
<br/>protocols,  funding  and  organisational  structures  are  in  place,  to  effectively  manage  and  mitigate 
<br/>disaster  risks,  potentially  savings  lives  and  reducing  damage  before  the  start  of  the  new  cyclone 
<br/>season.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are several critical initiatives aimed at enhancing humanitarian coordination that needs 
<br/></span><span>to  be  in  place  before  the  cyclone  season  starts,  such  as  the  humanitarian  actors  registry  that  will 
<br/>control and streamline humanitarian action in the country, as well as the establishment of the disaster 
<br/>volunteer scheme that will ensure the protection of disaster volunteers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is one of Government’s policy reform actions of the joint budget 
<br/>support  operation  with  multiple  development  partners,  together  with  a  contingent  to  a  funding 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>package of over $500 million. And by expanding the Bill under Standing Order 51 with referral to 
<br/>the Standing Committee, will surely demonstrate our collective commitment to protecting foreign 
<br/>and domestic investments in the country by reassuring investors and stakeholders of the country’s 
<br/>resilience and stability, thereby, maintaining economic confidence and preventing potential financial 
<br/>losses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that this Bill be referred to the Standing 
<br/>Committee for Justice, Law and Human Rights, with the Committee to revert to Parliament in the 
<br/>July or August sitting.  I strongly urge honourable Members to support the motion that is before this 
<br/>august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick word on the Bill that is before Parliament, 
<br/>I think everyone knows that this Bill was born out of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, one of the worst disasters that we 
<br/>have ever had in this country, and we understand the urgency with which it needs to be dealt with, 
<br/>bearing in mind that we are susceptible to so much in terms of climate change and all that happens 
<br/>around the country, and it has taken a bit of time to get to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to take this opportunity, Sir, to speak for and on behalf of the Committee.  We welcome 
<br/>all the work but because of what we had mentioned earlier, Sir, our schedule would mean that we 
<br/>may not be able to bring it back in the July session.  Hopefully, the mover of the motion will agree 
<br/>that it comes in the session afterwards - in August or September.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill is quite comprehensive, it will probably not require as much consultation, as I think 
<br/>a lot of work has been done but it certainly will require a little bit of scrutiny and we have it on good 
<br/>words from our Chairman, that we will do our absolute utmost with your help, Sir, to ensure that we 
<br/>actually  get  it done before August.   It  is  very timely that we  actually  get  this done as quickly  as 
<br/>possible. For a nation like ours, it is very important that we get this done because it guides us in terms 
<br/>of NDMO and I am also under the gun because he is the former Minister, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. I have been given to understand that the honourable Minister 
<br/>has also, kind of, added something herewith a backslash August.  Am I right, honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I will leave that in your good hands for your decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, so it is August. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank everyone for all the hard work that has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done and I have no further comments to add. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> [Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 06/2024 committed to 
<br/></span><span>the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and report back in the August 
<br/>sitting of Parliament]

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>871 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Sir, just a quick clarification, unfortunately the printers 
<br/>have missed pages 58 and 59 in all the Bills, just so that the Secretary-General can be aware and get 
<br/>us the copies as quickly as possible.  I think that applies to everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  we  are  going  to  organise  that.    Thank  you  for 
<br/>notifying us, honourable Koya.  The honourable Minister has given that to us, it is just a printing 
<br/>error. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  next  two  Bills  are  for  debate  and  enactment.    I  also  remind 
<br/>honourable Members that pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 and 
<br/>on Tuesday, 21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2024 that the debate on each of the two Bills will be limited to one hour only.  
<br/>I hope I am very, very clear on that; two bills - one hour only.  This is nothing new, especially those 
<br/>sitting on this side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Bring it on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, I like that. 
<br/></span></div>
