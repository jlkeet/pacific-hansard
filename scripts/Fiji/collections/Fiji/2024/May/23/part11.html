<div><span>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please take note that there will be two Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports for tabling today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA,-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, 
<br/>2019 and 2020 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last year and early this year, the Committee undertook site visits to the Western and Northern 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Divisions to delve into the operational dynamics of the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the Committee received submissions from the Chief Executive Officer of the 
<br/>Sugar Cane Growers Fund. The Committee was made aware of the legislative challenges faced by 
<br/>the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to extend credit services to non-sugar sector and the poor financial 
<br/>performance  of  the  South  Pacific  Fertilizers  Limited  in  which  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund  has  90 
<br/>percent shares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Annual Reports provided by the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>failed to include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the periods under review.  These indicators 
<br/>are  essential  for  the  Committee  to  make  more  informed  recommendations  and  to  gauge  the 
<br/>performance of the organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  further  noted  that  various  assistance  and  programmes  provided  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Sugar other than Sugar Cane Growers Fund to assist sugarcane farmers in improving 
<br/>production and quality of cane. For example, sugarcane development and farm assistance, weedicide 
<br/>and  fertiliser  subsidy,  funding  to  improve  the  cane  access  roads,  subsidy  to  purchase  mechanical 
<br/>harvesters, grants to encourage new farmers in the sugar sector and cane cartage grant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While discussing the reports, the Committee noted that utilising rail transport for cane would 
<br/>prove  significantly  more  cost-effective  compared  to  trucks.  Trucks  rely  heavily  on  fuel  and  are 
<br/>subject to escalating fuel prices and contribute to road congestion and cause road damage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Committee expressed satisfaction with  the Sugar Cane Growers  Fund’s Annual 
<br/>Reports during the review periods, it also acknowledged areas for improvement.  This includes the 
<br/>need for improved coordination, commitment and accountability amongst all stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to extend our appreciation to all the stakeholders for their valuable input.  Finally, 
<br/>I would like to thank our Committee Members who are part of the team that produced this Report, 
<br/>namely:  Deputy  Chairperson,  honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  honourable  Premila  Kumar,  honourable 
<br/>Tomasi Tunabuna and honourable Semi Koroilavesau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019 and 2020 Review Report to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That a debate on the contents of the Report is initiated at a future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to  the  decision  of  the  Standing  Orders 
<br/>Committee, I now call on the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources to table the Committee’s 
<br/>Report.    For  the  information  of  honourable  Members,  this  should  have  been  undertaken  by  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament but since he was busy, he has, therefore, asked 
<br/>honourable Minister Vosarogo to stand in for him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Orders - Amendments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consideration and review of the practices 
<br/>and procedures of Parliament and to make recommendations for the improvement and change or for 
<br/>the  development  of  new  practices  and  procedures  are  the  mandates  of  the  Standing  Orders 
<br/>Committee.  As a living document, the Standing Orders should be regularly amended to align, of 
<br/>course, with the ever-evolving rules and procedures of any modern, democratic society.  This ensures 
<br/>that the Parliamentary processes remain relevant and practical in addressing the needs of that society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Orders Committee met on four separate occasions: on 1st  May, 
<br/>3rd May, 17th May and the 22nd May, 2024.  On these occasions, the Committee met and discussed 
<br/>the Amendments to the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed Amendments to the Standing Orders which have now been 
<br/>circulated  to  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  are  necessary  because  they  impact  the  way 
<br/>Parliament conducts itself.  These proposed Amendments relate to the performance, functions and 
<br/>the workings of Parliament.  In considering and reviewing the practices and procedures of Parliament, 
<br/>the proposed Amendments  which the Committee agreed to  are hereby presented to  Parliament as 
<br/>mandated under Standing Orders 128. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report of the Standing Orders Committee, by convention, is a functional 
<br/>document.    The  recommended  Amendments  as  well  as  the  Committee  meeting  minutes  are  also 
<br/>annexed to this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I express my appreciation to Substantive and Alternative 
<br/>Members  who contributed greatly to  the review  process: honourable Speaker as the Chairperson, 
<br/>honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau,  honourable  Alitia  Bainivalu,  honourable  Pio  Tikoduadua, 
<br/>honourable Aseri Radrodro and later the honourable Ifereimi Vasu and, of course, the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Viliame  Naupoto  and  also  the  honourable  Ratu  Rakuita  Vakalalabure  and  honourable  Alvick 
<br/></span><span>Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Orders Committee, I hereby commend this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament.
