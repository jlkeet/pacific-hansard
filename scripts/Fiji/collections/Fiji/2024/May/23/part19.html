<h3>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, I move that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 02/2024) be debated, voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- My apology, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am beginning to worry, are we coming or going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate 
<br/>the newly appointed Commissioner for Corrections Service, Dr. Jalesi Nakarawa. Dr. Nakarawa is 
<br/>also from the beautiful island of Kadavu, is a former Corrections Officer and held the position of 
<br/>Assistant Commissioner before he migrated to New Zealand.  He is one of the first group of officers 
<br/></span><span>to graduate from USP while still working as a Corrections Officer in Naboro. He graduated with a 
<br/></span><span>PhD in Law from Waikato University, returned to Fiji and served as an Assistant Professor at the Fiji 
<br/>National University.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I will be brief.  Most of the issues that are being canvassed here have already 
<br/>been  canvassed  on  Monday.    I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  of  the  Corrections  Service 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill 2024 which was tabled on Monday, 20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many  changes  have  occurred  over  the  years  with  the  operations  and 
<br/></span><span>administration of the Fiji Corrections Service. The Bill simply amends the Corrections Service Act 
<br/></span><span>2006  to  improve  the  Administration  of  the  Corrections  Service  while  plans  to  conduct  a  holistic 
<br/>review of the Act are underway.  It is important to amend the Act to extend the list of international 
<br/>standards to  include the  United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment  of Prisoners 
<br/>namely the Nelson Mandela Rules, the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners 
<br/>and the Non-custodian Measures for women offenders which is the Bangkok Rules and to ensure the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the Non-Custodian Measures for women offenders which is the Bangkok Rules and to ensure 
<br/>the well-being of the prisoners who are under the care of the Corrections Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also worth mentioning that the practice in the past years, that had Medical Officers and 
<br/>Registered Nurses are appointed by the Commissioner of the Corrections Service, thus amendment 
<br/>to that is necessary to reflect the same. One of the core roles of the medical staff is to conduct medical 
<br/>checks for all newly admitted inmates. This is to ensure that newly admitted inmates are not suffering 
<br/>from any illnesses and that they have not sustained any injuries prior to their admission. This allows 
<br/>the medical staff to address the medical needs of newly admitted inmates. Medical check-ups are 
<br/>also conducted for those who are about to be released under any of the early release schemes as well 
<br/>as for those who are being released for full discharge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Allocation and Classification Board is already in place. The practice is that the Supervisor 
<br/>of the Division closest to Headquarters sits on the Board to ensure that there are no delays in the 
<br/>work of the Board due to the geographical location of the centres. That addresses the issue raised by 
<br/>the honourable Bulitavu why the Supervisor in the Northern and Western Divisions do not sit in the 
<br/>Classification Board.  While the Bill  amends to align the current  practices, there will be room to 
<br/>create new policies after the holistic review of the Act is complete and the appointment of the new 
<br/>Commissioner  is  just  at  the  right  time.  There  has  been  consultation  with  the  team  from  the  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service and with the Office of the Solicitor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not go into the clauses of the Bill as I had touched on it on Monday, 
<br/>I hope that my colleagues on the other side, they did it in the last session where they spoke highly of 
<br/>the changes that are needed in the Fiji Corrections Service. It is only the right thing to support the 
<br/>Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, before I offer the floor, I have a list given by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. M.D. Bulitavu; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Ioane Naivalurua; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  brief.  This  side of  Parliament  fully 
<br/>supports the Bill that is before Parliament because it will include a few necessary amendments, that 
<br/></span><span>is, the Mandela Rules, Bangkok Rules and also the Tokyo Rules in terms of non-custodial sentences.  
<br/></span><span>For  the  Bangkok  Rules,  especially  for  the  treatment  of  women  prisoners  because  we  have  heard 
<br/>incidents in the past where women have been locked up with men in some of our receiving centers, 
<br/>especially the ones in Labasa and there are some incidences that happened in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  Nelson  Mandela  Rules  which  is  also  on  the  treatment  and  the  humane 
<br/>treatment of prisoners. Moving forward, we have got a special clause (clause 6) in terms of where 
<br/>officers who do not report back or to notify their senior officers for seven days, they are deemed to 
<br/>have resigned. There are many cases of Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL) regarding prison 
<br/></span><span>officers, given the lack of pay plus hoping that a job evaluation exercise comes in faster to prevent 
<br/></span><span>all those AWOLS and all those welfare for Corrections Officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  forward,  in  clause  9  in  terms  of  medical  examination,  I  think  this  is  a  timely 
<br/>intervention  through  this  particular  legislation,  given  all  prisoners  will  now  go  through  medical 
<br/>check-ups  once  they  are  brought  in  at  the  Corrections  Centre.    This  medical  check-ups  will  help 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>873 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>determine what kind of meal classes they have, whether it is “c” scale, “d” scale or “s” scale meals 
<br/>that they have given the medical conditions that they have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, on the central allocation and classification board, there is also time being given.  
<br/>In the current practice was through the Commissioner’s orders, honourable Naivaluarua might like 
<br/>to talk about that, they have a big list of composition officers who are part of that but this has been 
<br/>streamlined and will help in the classification of prisoners and  allocating them in suitable prisons 
<br/>because they are located in Suva, the West and in Labasa. They will only receive prisoners once all 
<br/>the records come to this particular Board and they will then classify them through the crimes that 
<br/>they have committed. Those who have committed rape or sexual offences will be held in a separate 
<br/>prison away from the others who have offended other offences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 15, in terms of having a psychological report, it is timely given the long process that 
<br/>is  there  for  those  prisoners  who  have  come  through  special  stage,  when  they  want  to  apply  for 
<br/>community  work  and  also  placement  for  paid  employment.  This  will  actually  quicken  the    the 
<br/>rehabilitation process that is currently there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Introduction of psychologists, to determine whether a particular prisoner is fit and healthy to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do further education and also to work outside, that is timing and also welcomed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Corrections is the inclusion of 
<br/>the Parole Board, probably you can look into the remittance of our convicts that are held in the various 
<br/>centres.  That is all Sir, this side of Parliament supports the Bill that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to stand in support of the Bill that has 
<br/>been explained this afternoon to us by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice.  I 
<br/>think we all understand, Sir, that part of our consideration here in this Parliament, we make laws, we 
<br/>change them, we amend and repeal is that once we identify that there are some regime of laws that 
<br/>need some changes, when we effect change, we ensure that the language of that amendment that we 
<br/>bring in is simple, and is readable and understandable by the general public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part of it also I think is when we look at this Bill, it is seeking to ensure that there is alignment 
<br/>and correct alignment of terminology and references which explains part of the cosmetic changes 
<br/>that this Bill seeks to introduce but more importantly, I think which is found in the beginning of the 
<br/>Bill  is  that  it  is  seeking  to  be  constitutionally  compliant  which  brings  me  to  the  point  where  the 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu had spoken about the three rules which we are seeking in this Bill to bring into 
<br/></span><span>the framework of the Prisons law -  the Mandela Rules, the Tokyo Rules as well as the Bangkok 
<br/></span><span>Rules. These are all conventions that seek to establish minimum standards of how prison and prison’s 
<br/>administration are supposed to be administered while also at the same time ensuring both the safety 
<br/>of those that are administering the prison system as well as those who are in the prison system, the 
<br/>prisoners themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the Bangkok Rules, one of the things that we probably would want to highlight 
<br/>is  that, what  I would mean is  the adoption of the 70 rules  that relates to  the safe management of 
<br/>women prisoners. This is something that I think is worthwhile in reading up on the text because it 
<br/></span><span>would provide the necessary framework, that would allow all of us to see that women prisoners would 
<br/></span><span>go into prison and serve their time, the offenders would come back and get rehabilitated back into 
<br/>society.  The last rule, of course, is ensuring that there are minimum standards that are observed for 
<br/>non-custodial prisoners, and I think this is important because when we are looking at that aspect Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>874 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we realise in our history and not just here, I think it applies everywhere 
<br/>else in the Commonwealth is that there is always a high degree and a high rate of recividism. People 
<br/>who go to prison, they do not get rehabilitated properly, they come back into society, they find the 
<br/>environment quite new, very enticing to commit any other forms of crimes, they commit it, they go 
<br/>back  to  prison  and  in  10  years  you  find  a  rap  sheet  of  people  who  have  many  many 
<br/>offendingsthroughout their lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  when  we  look  at  rehabilitation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  key  things  that 
<br/>rehabilitation programmes in our corrections and prison service is supposed to is to ensure that, that 
<br/>prisoner does not go back to prison ever again.  So, these special measures, these minimum standards, 
<br/>I think when they are brought into the framework of our prison’s department is going to help the 
<br/>prisons officers and those who administer deal with high recidivism and ensure that they no longer 
<br/>become part of those statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the Bill that is presently before the Parliament this afternoon seeks exactly to do that, 
<br/>observe the constitutional requirement for compliance and at the same time home-in on those rules 
<br/>where we can operationalise or the prisons department can operationalise the requirements of those 
<br/>rules so that we can have very good rehabilitation system, that can allow for prisoners to come into 
<br/>prison, serve their time and come back a changed man or woman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  stand  in  this  Parliament  this  afternoon,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  thanking  the  honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu for coming in support of the Bill and I am sure that the honourable Naivalurua, who is a  
<br/>former Commissioner of Prisons would also see the good that this Bill will bring into Parliament and 
<br/>ultimately be part of our laws in Fiji.  I am in support of the Bill, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Corrections Service is one of those closely 
<br/>scrutinized and monitored organisations as it should be because of the nature of the work.  But, before 
<br/>I  continue,  I  join  the  honourable  Attorney-General  in  congratulating  the  new  Commissioner  of 
<br/>Corrections, Dr. Jalesi Nakarawa, and if I may wish to add on to his profile, he is also someone from 
<br/>up Flagstaff - ex-Marist.  I just wanted to place that on record, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  I  thank  the  officers  -  men  and  women,  who  have  toiled  hard  at  the  front  line,  I  am 
<br/>referring  to  their  work  as  work  in  the  frontline.    It  is  not  only  stressful,  quite  demanding  and 
<br/>sometimes demoralising on some situations.  I also at this juncture wish to convey my appreciation 
<br/>to the Acting Commissioner, Salote Panapasa, for holding on to the fort before the appointment of 
<br/>the new Commissioner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2006, the principal Act was enacted, and it has taken the Corrections 18 
<br/>years to where we are today.  It has transformed the organisation into a better organisation, a more 
<br/>effective, more efficient and an organisation that now fully understands its primary function and role.  
<br/>I had the blessings to be there in the time it was enacted, and I can look back with pride in what this 
<br/>Act has done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like  any  other  Act  for  that  matter,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  situation  changes,  the 
<br/>environment changes, it needs to be reviewed, adjusted and amended, so therefore, the 18 clauses 
<br/></span><span>that has been presented by the honourable Attorney-General, I have examined and scrutinised it in 
<br/></span><span>line with the Act and I believe, it is a good amendment, a good change that will improve the operation 
<br/>of the organisation not only in terms of its focus but above all, its ability to deliver back to society, a 
<br/>product that is those that had been incarcerated in corrections to be a  better person, to re-join their 
<br/>families and loved ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>875 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is important aspect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the role and function of a Corrections service.  
<br/>The ability to care, look after, treat and handover again to society a better person.  That in essence is 
<br/>the role and function of the Corrections Service.  As I examined the clauses that needs to be changed, 
<br/>I commend the honourable Attorney-General and his team, especially in the area of allocation and 
<br/>the classification.  This is an important aspect of corrections.  They need to be what I call “carefully 
<br/>and correctly diagnosed” simply meaning that we need to find out the reasons why they are there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of them are deeply rooted and some of them are very difficult to understand why they 
<br/>are  there  when  we  find  out  what  has  caused  them  to  commit that  particular  offence,  then  we  are 
<br/>challenged with the ability of finding out the right treatment for this offender.  Then we are able to 
<br/>allocate them for the place where they can be cared for whether it is in the maximum, the medium, 
<br/>minimum and so forth.  This is a very important part of the work of the hierarchy in Corrections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to highlight that this is a good part of the amendment that has been done by the review 
<br/>team. I also commend the work which has always been a big administrative headache for leadership 
<br/>in Corrections.  Those that disappear and we never see them again and is now included here in this 
<br/>particular Act, so thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that I wanted to mention too, is the focus on the health care of inmates which 
<br/>is outlined in section 26, clearly articulated that everyone needs to be medically examined as you 
<br/>come in or also when you leave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the work that has been done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a great work.  It is timely and I 
<br/>think with this amendment here, it will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation 
<br/>to  be  a  robust,  focussed  organisation  that  can  deliver  service  back  to  the  community.    Looking 
<br/>forward, I would ask, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that on the second review, we go beyond Standing Order 51 
<br/>and we fully scrutinize the next review of this particular Act.  I fully support the amendment to the 
<br/>Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to hold us any longer than we 
<br/>need to. First of all, may I thank the outgoing Acting Commissioner Ms. Panapasa for the work that 
<br/>she has done all this while and also congratulate the new Commissioner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Members  who  had  spoken  before  me  including  the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  the  former  Magistrate,  former  Commissioner  of  Corrections, 
<br/>honourable  Mosese  Bulitavu  both  as  Counsel  and  also  college    graduate  and  also  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Vosarogo are more qualified than I who only for a very short-time was a Permanent Secretary for 
<br/></span><span>Justice during the time when the honourable Naivalurua was the Commissioner for Corrections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a small way, I had a very small contribution to what is being proposed in Parliament today.  
<br/>They said almost everything that needs to be said about supporting this Bill and I support this Bill 
<br/>strongly.  My argument for it is this Bill makes the inmates more human in that sense.  For those of 
<br/>us that may never been  inside either  as inmate or Corrections Officer, perhaps fail to  understand 
<br/>exactly the space that has often been referred to in a very negative fashion by members of society, so 
<br/>it is the outcasts of society that go there.  It is always a challenge to try and create an environment 
<br/></span><span>that makes them or gives them the freedom to become more human than less the freedom, to enjoy 
<br/></span><span>the freedom at least to a certain degree than they would be enjoying inside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  many  of  the  proposals  here  especially  the  mentions  of  the  different  Conventions,  the 
<br/>Constitution in terms of their rights.  These are important for us as Members of Parliament, not only 
<br/>us, but the members of our community to reflect on this and especially when the outcome, … 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>most of the Members here have spoken about, the important part is when they come out.  What they 
<br/>make of their life when they come out?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill, I think in a special way helps them to make them better people and makes them 
<br/>productive members of society when they come out. I think there are many, many successful stories 
<br/>that attest to that.  So, in that regard, I support essentially the proposal of this Bill as has been already 
<br/>moved in Parliament and also the sentiments that have been spoken by the Members who have spoken 
<br/>before me.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity and I support the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to thank each and every Member who have 
<br/>spoken. It is a good demonstration when the people of Fiji see that Members of Parliament really do 
<br/>care  about  members  of  the  society,  vulnerable,  who  sometimes  not  of  their  own  choice  but  for 
<br/>circumstances  do  end  up  in  prison  that  they  are  still  cared  for.  This  is  one  of  the  milestone 
<br/>achievements  of  the  Acting  Commissioner,  Ms.  Panapasa.    There  was  a  handing  over  ceremony 
<br/>yesterday, I salute her and the direction was given to complete this project and with the incoming 
<br/>new Commissioner, we hope to have a holistic review of the Fiji Corrections Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[A Bill for an Act to amend the Corrections Service Act 2006 (Bill No. 02/2024 enacted by 
<br/>the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.  (Act No……… of 2024)]
