<h3>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 (Bill No. 04/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill  must  be  immediately  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Human Rights;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the July Sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Upon presenting the Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must be 
<br/>debated, voted upon by Parliament but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with 
<br/>the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  begin  my  speech,  I  would  love  to  just 
<br/>acknowledge our students  that are here in  Parliament who have  come especially  to  be here to  be 
<br/>present as I present this Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to acknowledge the students from the Learning Centre, LDS Church College, Gospel 
<br/>High  School,  Yat  Sen  School,  Multiple  Intelligence  School,  Holy  Trinity  School,  William  Cross 
<br/>School,  John  Wesley  School  and  Kalabu  Primary  School.    I  also  wish  to  acknowledge  some 
<br/>children’s organisations that are here including Vision Fiji as well as the Suva Bahai Community 
<br/>and, of course, I acknowledge our staff that are here, our Permanent Secretary as well as our Director 
<br/>Children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  And the members of your constituency from Nasinu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The children are here Sir, yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; today 
<br/>we have the chance to make history here in Fiji and, indeed, yet again to lead the entire Pacific region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am immensely proud to stand before you today to introduce the Child Justice Bill 2024. This 
<br/></span><span>Bill offers us generational change, a law that will catapult us from old ways of thinking, that keep 
<br/>crime rates the same and if children without rights to a new safer Fiji. One way children in conflict 
<br/>with the law do not go on to reoffend but instead go on to become contributing members of society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the previous government under the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership of the former Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama, for having put this proposed law
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>together in the first place.  I acknowledge my predecessors in the Ministry who laid the foundation 
<br/>for this great work which I picked up and it has finally come to this point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Child Justice Bill 2024 finally responds to why children come into contact with the 
<br/>law.  The Bill draws on the research and science about what stops the children from offending.  This 
<br/>means we now have the chance to pass a law that will keep the community safer because our justice 
<br/>measures will work and over the course of the next few minutes or so, you are going to hear me use 
<br/>the words “science” and “research” a lot.  That is because the traditional ways of thinking are not 
<br/>going to get us out of where we are now, because if you always do what you have always done, you 
<br/>will always get what you have always got.  It is the research and science that is now loud and clear 
<br/>and how we can stop youth offending at its earliest.  Loud and clear on how to stop our children from 
<br/>re-offending. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research and science tells us, this Bill will work to reduce crime and break cycles of it for 
<br/>generations, but it is also based on logic.  If our interventions do not get to the heart of why children 
<br/>offend  and  instead,  we  criminalize  our  children  and  re-criminalize  them,  then  we  are  only 
<br/>perpetuating a cycle of re-offending for our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today we know that most often, children who offend have escaped unsafe homes or have no 
<br/>homes at all.  There is a deep connection between children who have no care and children who offend.  
<br/>Research  from  some  of  our  nearest  neighbours  shows  that  children  who  have  experienced  the 
<br/>psychological damage of child abuse trauma, or who had an intellectual disability make up about 90 
<br/>percent of our children that are being incarcerated, and that the crimes they commit are largely crimes 
<br/>committed in order to survive or to self-medicate this trauma.  It is only logical that we intervene to 
<br/>specifically address these issues and we will drastically reduce crime committed by children thus 
<br/>disrupting the cycle of offending.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past decade Mr. Speaker, Sir, studies conducted have consistently demonstrated that 
<br/>diversion programmes are far more effective than preventing child crime compared to charging or 
<br/>incarcerating a child.  Research indicates that with appropriate diversion measures, three-quarters of 
<br/>children do not reoffend within six months, and over half do not engage in further criminal behaviour 
<br/>within two years.  Many children have also shared how these interventions have helped them regain 
<br/>control of their lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will tell you a true story that illustrates the science at its most basic.  Let me tell you about 
<br/>a young boy we will call Sailosi.  Sailosi’s father abused Sailosi and Sailosi’s mother since he was 
<br/></span><span>born.  Sailosi’s father was unemployed and forced his mum into being a sex worker, so he would 
<br/></span><span>have money.  In order to escape the domestic violence and sexual slavery, Sailosi’s mother escaped 
<br/>to the streets, taking Sailosi with her, so Sailosi was raised by people on the streets.  He was homeless 
<br/>for his entire early childhood.  The Department of Social Welfare intervened with Sailosi was three 
<br/>years old and put him in a Children’s Home, but Sailosi’s father came and forced his way into the 
<br/>Home and took Sailosi away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his early teens, in his desperation to escape his father’s continuing abuse, Sailosi turned 
<br/>back to the streets where he grew up.  It was around this time that his mum died from cancer.  This 
<br/></span><span>meant that Sailosi had absolutely no one.  He was a young child with no one to feed or clothe him.  
<br/></span><span>With nothing to eat, no place to sleep and no one to care for him, Sailosi shoplifted food and stole 
<br/>items just to survive.  I want you to think about what comes next.  Should Sailosi be charged and 
<br/>punished for the consequences of being abused by his father and trying to survive homeless?  Should 
<br/>our  justice  system  demonise  him  for  his  life  of  being  a  child  victim?    This  was  one  case  where 
<br/>diversion was actually used.  The Minister at the time ordered Sailosi to be returned to the Children’s 
<br/>Home where he was looked after and received counselling.  He is now 14 years old, well settled and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>861 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attending secondary school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This could have been a very, very different story, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but legislative change 
<br/>could  mean  the  same  ending  for  so  many  children  in  Sailosi’s  situation,  children  who  would 
<br/>otherwise go on to live a life of misery and commit crime to survive, instead of changing paths to 
<br/>become a responsible member contributing to our society, just like Sailosi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This new law would see the Ministry involved as a matter of course in all cases just like this.  
<br/>Never before have we had laws in this country that recognises the life factors that give rise to children 
<br/>coming into conflict with the law and put clear responsibility on a welfare department to intervene 
<br/>and  address  it,  to  change  the  life  of  that  child,  thereby,  making  a  safer  Fijian  society.    So,  what 
<br/>happens if this Bill does not get passed?  Then we are stuck with the current law - the Juveniles Act 
<br/>1973.    Yes,  it  is  over  50  years  old  and  does  not  respond  to  the  long-established  criminological 
<br/>research of the last two decades and evades our international human rights obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This old Act operates on a completely outdated understanding of how and why children come 
<br/>into conflict with the law.  It lacks any approach to diversion, like the one we have just heard, and it 
<br/>lacks any approach to restorative justice.  Importantly, without any formal provisions on diversion,  
<br/>no one, not even our Ministry has the mandated responsibility to be looking into and resolving the 
<br/>broader circumstances for the child.   In fact, the Juveniles Act 1973 adopts an old British approach, 
<br/>which is even now well and truly obsolete in Britian, and globally recognised as an abuse of human 
<br/>rights, but is still in place here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, as our practices and approach to child welfare have moved to world-leading with also 
<br/>our proposed Child Care and Protection Bill 2024, which is yet to come, the Juveniles Act 1973 is 
<br/>completely out of step even with our Fijian approach to child protection and care.  This Bill was 
<br/>subject to extensive consultation across the Fijian community.  It lives up to our unabating relentless 
<br/>commitment to our children.  You will not be surprised to hear there is a strong support for this Bill, 
<br/>even from the international community and those who support Fiji so generously.  You will not be 
<br/>surprised to hear the support from our children’s organisations, even our service providers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  some  concerns  raised  about  raising  the  age  of  criminal 
<br/>responsibility from 10 years to 14 years, as we are proposing in this Bill.  What will happen to our 
<br/>children under 14 years, you might ask?  Will they go unpunished to commit more crime?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No, they will not, Mr. Speaker.  The Bill explicitly prescribes the intervention, diversion and 
<br/></span><span>care that must be taken in  relation  to  these children by our Ministry, so that  we see lives change 
<br/></span><span>direction, even lives like Sailosi.  The Bill does not propose to leave children under the age of 14 
<br/>years out on the streets to offend again. But it does come from an understanding that we do need to 
<br/>ask questions about these children.  Who are these children?  Why did they come into conflict with 
<br/>the law in the first place?  If we do not that, how can we stop it from happening again?  But do not 
<br/>listen to me, listen to the science.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extensive research across the world clearly shows that the younger a child at their first arrest, 
<br/>the  greater  their  chances  of  future  offending.    A  study  of  incarcerated  youth  found  that  children 
<br/></span><span>arrested before the age of 14 years, are three times more likely to reoffend as adults, compared to 
<br/></span><span>children arrested when they are over the age of 14 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, diverting younger children increases the chances greatly that they will not offend 
<br/>again.  This means, our community will be safer.  It means, precious police resources, precious court 
<br/>resources, precious DPP resources will all be saved.  Not only will they now not be dealing with 
<br/>children  under  14  years,  but  there  will  be  less  recidivism  and  less  crime  over  time.    But  most 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importantly, Mr. Speaker, this is our chance to change the lives of our children.  It is our chance to 
<br/>stop punishing children, like Sailosi, for living a life they did not choose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot ignore the medical science.  Doctors all over the world have come out in their 
<br/>number  to  protest  holding  10-year-old  children  criminally  responsible,  because  it  is  completely 
<br/>against medial consensus regarding brain development. Children under the age of 14 years have not 
<br/>yet developed the social, emotional and intellectual maturity necessary for criminal responsibility.  
<br/>This is why we treat our children differently in other parts of our legal system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Think about it, Mr. Speaker.  If we act like their brains are old enough at 10 years to make 
<br/>fully informed decisions about committing crime, does that not mean we should drop the age for the 
<br/>right to drink alcohol too, and the right to vote to the age of 10?  The age of criminal responsibility 
<br/>of 10 years old, out of step with these other legal rights and responsibilities.  If we punish children 
<br/>for lives of continual despair, we are not only guilty of a system that willingly abuses their human 
<br/>rights, but we create legacies of intergenerational trauma. Is that what we want for the future of Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the chance here, honourable Members, to disrupt suffering for generations to come. 
<br/>Let us not forget the fact that criminalising children under the age of 14 contravenes our commitments 
<br/>under the Convention on the Rights of a Child.</span><span> </span><span>We would all do well to remember that the science 
<br/>and human rights basis for raising the age are so</span><span> </span><span>sound, that we are becoming out of step with much 
<br/>of the world. A significant number of countries in Africa have raised the age of criminal responsibility 
<br/>to  14  years,  countries  like  Korea,  China,  Cambodia,  Kuwait,  Laos,  Kyrgyzstan,  Mongolia, 
<br/>Philippines, Timor Leste, and the list goes on and on.  These countries have a minimum age criminal 
<br/>responsibility of 14 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  some  misplaced  ideas  that  with  increasing  criminal  responsibility  to  14  years, 
<br/>children will be used as drug mules; that this will not curb younger children taking drugs. Again, 
<br/>honourable Members, let me bore you with the science because you are about to discover that this 
<br/>Bill is what we need to reduce</span><span> </span><span>drug-taking in our children.  Young people who have experienced 
<br/>childhood trauma are six times more likely to abuse marijuana and nine times more likely to use 
<br/>hard drugs. The science is clear that these children are looking for any escape from their traumatic 
<br/>memories.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Being charged by Police and then being imprisoned with children who have suffered the 
<br/>same fate will not change that. But proper intervention, care and diversion will. It is the chance to 
<br/>actually  get  these  children  off  the  treadmill  of  drug  abuse  and  deal  with  their  trauma  to  stop  it 
<br/></span><span>happening again. What, of the vulnerability of younger children to be used as drug mules? This Bill 
<br/></span><span>is designed to reduce the number of children who need to live a life of crime in order to survive, 
<br/>and therefore be vulnerable to drug trafficking just to survive. In its place, this Bill sees a direct 
<br/>intervention and diversion that will mean these children are no longer 'easy prey'.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importantly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  deep  concerns  about  the  younger  age  at  which 
<br/>children sexually offend. These things is what has driven this legislation which is legislation for 
<br/>change.  When children sexually offend against other children, statistics show this is most often 
<br/>precipitated by the fact that they themselves were victims of sexual abuse at a very young age, often 
<br/></span><span>at the hands of their own family. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this does not mean that every 
<br/></span><span>victim of child sexual abuse will go on to offend, but amongst children who do sexually offend, 
<br/>this experience is prevalent. Research in our own region shows that if you intervene early enough, 
<br/>you can change the trajectory of offending permanently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this new Bill gives that opportunity. Our old law or the law in place today, 
<br/>does not.  I do not believe that any of us here in this Parliament does not care for children. But think 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>863 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about  the  money  we  throw  away  in  policing,  our  court  system,  our  DPP,  if  we  continue  these 
<br/>processes, it will only see children before the justice system again, and again, and again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  adopts  all  the  rich,  uncontroverted  knowledge  that  will  see 
<br/>children in this country thrive, and keep our community safe. Surely, we know too much from the 
<br/>science to persist with outdated, old ways that keep us from progressing. This is our chance, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to move our society forward, to activate generational change in an unprecedented way. 
<br/>It is in your hands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  honourable  Members,  I  commend  this  Bill  to  Parliament  under 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a short contribution on the Bill that 
<br/>is before Parliament.  I thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 
<br/>for the Bill and also acknowledging the previous FijiFirst Government who had done the executive 
<br/>consultation, and we thank you for carrying this Bill forward and tabling it to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all agree to the motion that is before Parliament and that is going through Standing Order 
<br/>51 but to Committees. In place of the motion, she had specified July to come to Parliament, probably 
<br/>that will be upon your discretion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the July sitting is always prioritised for 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once the Bill is referred by you to Committees and probably from the honourable Chairman,  
<br/>communication can be made to the office in terms of probably an extension for an August sitting. 
<br/>There is also a ruling by you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Committees sittings too are to be due by 29</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>June, 2024.  Those are some of the administrative issues that we might face as Committee while we 
<br/>deliberate because it is quite a thick Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the various stakeholders too that we would like to engage, the consultants, 
<br/>the terms of reference, probably from the honourable Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General’s 
<br/>Office and the executive consultation report, first brough by the FijiFirst Government in 2021 and 
<br/>2022.  The consultation report would be very thick and the various venues that they have conducting 
<br/>consultations in, that will enable the Committees to put its alternative workplan on the timelines that 
<br/>they will need to work on very strictly before we come back to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, in regard to the content and the substance of the Bill, again, on child justice, we do 
<br/></span><span>not have any issues on that.  We leave that when we come to deliberation in the Committees and we 
<br/>will  bring  back  a  substantive  report  to  Parliament.    Without  further  more  to  say,  we  support  the 
<br/>motion and the Bill before Parliament and the procedure and the manner that the honourable mover 
<br/>has moved it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  bringing  this  Bill  to  the  floor.  I  do  recall  when  we  were  going  around  the  country  doing  
<br/>consultation  on  the  Registration  of  Sex  Offenders  Bill,  that  was  one  of  the  times  where  the  
<br/></span><span>Committees did realise that children under the age of 18 when they commit those kind of offences, 
<br/></span><span>there was a lot of loopholes in the laws and we needed to ensure how we can bring them back to the 
<br/>community,  because  a  minor  creating  an  offence  and  then  getting  his  whole  life  disrupted  by  an 
<br/>offence that was committed during his age when he was not even 18 years was something that was 
<br/>brought  forward  before  the  Committee.  Though  it  is  under  Standing  Order  51  but  it  is  going  to 
<br/>Committees.  It will be scrutinised well and this is something that we will need to protect our children

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in this era.  Currently, we have the Juveniles Act which is quite old and was due for review.  So, I 
<br/>would like to commend the honourable Minister for bringing this Bill and sending it to Committees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their 
<br/>contribution to the debate.  Certainly, in terms of when it will return to Parliament, that is something 
<br/>for Parliament to consider, we are certainly open to August. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that 
<br/>was the timeframe too for the Anti-Doping Bill that is going to Committees so it is certainly open to 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to thank you all and I thank all our children and parents 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are here to be present for this historic Bill being tabled in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Child Justice Bill 2024 (Bill No. 04/2024) committed to the Standing Committee on Justice, 
<br/>Law and Human Rights and to report back in the August sitting of Parliament] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea.  We will resume when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the bell is sounded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.46 p.m.
