<div><span>The Duavata Partnership and Bilateral Relationship with New Zealand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Good  morning,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Ministers  and 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament.  I 
<br/>also  bid  a  very  good  morning  to  our  visitors  to  the  Parliament  this  morning,  students  and  our 
<br/>honourable Member visitor from Vanuatu and all of you ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you very much 
<br/>for your interest in the proceedings of the Parliament of Fiji and all those who are tuning in to the 
<br/></span><span>live broadcast of today’s proceedings and those listening to the radio.  </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka, namaste 
<br/></span><span>and a very good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  deliver  my  Ministerial  Statement  elaborating  on  Fiji’s 
<br/>bilateral relationship with New Zealand and our </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Partnership Agreement.  Sir, New Zealand 
<br/>is  one  of  our  oldest partners  and  friends  in  the  region. It  is  one  of  the  first  countries  that  
<br/>Fiji established diplomatic relationships with upon independence in 1970.  We share more than just 
<br/>our geographic location, we share a rich historic, political, cultural and people-to-people links that 
<br/>informs our relationship on all fronts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even as a colony, we stood together in times of crisis, as we did with our other allies.  Our 
<br/>service personnel stood together in the Pacific during WWII, in the Solomons, in Bougainville and 
<br/>later  on  in  Malaya.   And  in  recent  times,  in  peacekeeping missions  in  Lebanon,  Sinai,  with  the 
<br/>South Pacific  Peacekeeping  Forces  in  Bougainville, Timor  Leste,  and  again  in  the  Solomons 
<br/>under the Regional Assistance Mission Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outside  the  military  front,  we  stand together  in  times  of  natural  disasters  and  at the 
<br/>humanitarian  emergency  front.   The  relationship  between  Fiji  and  New Zealand  assumed  a  new 
<br/>frame  with  the signing  of  the </span><span>Duavata</span><span>  Partnership Agreement  in  2022.    Sir,  under  the  </span><span>Duavata</span><span>
<br/>Partnership, Fiji and New Zealand collaborate on the following areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Economic  Resilience; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Security; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Social Well-Being; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Climate Change and Resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Partnership covers the period 2022 – 2025 and we are now looking at review of 
<br/>the agreement to identify opportunities for further collaboration in the key sectors.  On the invitation 
<br/>of the then Prime Minister in New Zealand, honourable Christopher Hipkins I undertook an official 
<br/>visit to New Zealand from 5</span><span>th</span><span> June to 8</span><span>th</span><span> June last year.  It was a first official visit of a Fijian Prime 
<br/>Minister to New Zealand in 16 years and my first official visit after 25 years since I last visited as 
<br/>Prime Minister in 1998. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the visit involved a number of high-level engagements with key government and non-
<br/>government stakeholders.  I met with the then Prime Minister Hipkins and we discussed a range of 
<br/>issue including the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>growing geo-strategic interest in the region;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Pacific regionalism; and 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the importance of building longer term capabilities so that Fiji and Pacific Island Countries 
<br/>are self-reliant and how New Zealand can help us in that journey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand and Fiji alongside other Pacific Island forum leaders share an 
<br/>ambitious vision for the social, cultural, economic and environmental </span><span>resilience of the region where we 
<br/>are  strong,  prosperous  and secure.   We  are  stronger  when  we  combine  our efforts  and  focus  on  Pacific 
<br/>regionalism and the priorities of the Blue Pacific continent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  share  a  strong  focus  on regionalism,  including  upholding  Pacific Islands 
<br/>Forum unity; support for the University of South Pacific; and working with other traditional partners, 
<br/>such as Australia, on defence and security measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also discussed our long history of close sporting, cultural, and people-to-people links and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work we are doing in the spirit of our </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Partnership Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Fiji and New Zealand are connected by the depth of our cooperation across a broad 
<br/>range of sectors, including policing, health, trade and industry, education and fisheries, to name a few. I 
<br/>also  told  the then honourable  Prime Minister that the People's Coalition Government  is serious about 
<br/>growing  our  economy  and that  we  are  keen  to  work  harder  to  boost Fiji's  export  capacity  to  New 
<br/>Zealand. The then Prime Minister also expressed gratitude for the deployment to New Zealand of our 
<br/>emergency and RFMF personnel following </span><span>Cyclone Gabrielle</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The then honourable Prime Minister and I also discussed a Defence</span><span> </span><span>Cooperation Agreement that 
<br/>will allow defence officials to undertake engagement in different areas, including capacity building and 
<br/>upskilling and  exposure  to  new  technologies, interoperability  and  technical  support, among  other 
<br/>matters. The  Agreement  will  also  strengthen maritime  security  and  improve  the  disaster and 
<br/>humanitarian response co-ordination between our two nations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that Defence Cooperation Agreement was signed the following week between our 
<br/>two Defence Ministers in Suva on 14th June, 2023. Most of the former military officers in this august 
<br/>Parliament  were  beneficiaries  of  the  then  Defence  Cooperation  Programme  or  Military  Assistance 
<br/>Programme with New Zealand during our times in service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On meeting with thenForeign Minister, honourable Nanaia Mahuta, we delved into our economic 
<br/>recovery  after  the  pandemic, and  the  challenges  that  climate  change poses  to  our  development 
<br/>aspirations. We agreed that climate change remains the single greatest threat to lives and livelihoods in 
<br/>the  Pacific  region.   After  that  meeting,  honourable  Mahuta announced  the  additional  support  of 
<br/>NZ$11.1</span><span> </span><span>million to assist our response to the impacts of climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  welcomed  the  boost  which  will  support the  implementation  of  renewable  energy projects, 
<br/>infrastructure resilience, and climate policy. At the meeting with honourable Mahuta, I also raised the 
<br/>possibility of the grant of visa on arrival for Fiji citizens. This is an issue that we will continue to raise 
<br/>with the New Zealand government. I also had the opportunity to meet with the then Minister for Climate 
<br/>Change, honourable James Shaw. We discussed opportunities where Fiji and New Zealand can work 
<br/>together  at  the multilateral  level  and  in  particular  at  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP) 
<br/>negotiations. We also discussed the need for public- private sector cooperation and the importance of 
<br/>new technologies in moving us forward to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  New  Zealand  has  been  a long-term  proactive  partner  in  supporting Fiji's 
<br/>ongoing efforts to manage the increasingly detrimental impacts of climate change. New Zealand has 
<br/>provided  NZ$20</span><span> </span><span>million  in  flexible  climate  finance,  along  with capacity  support  and  technical 
<br/>assistance to  support  Fiji  in  delivering  on  our  national climate  change  priorities. New  Zealand  also 
<br/>continues  to  support  the National  Disaster  Management  Office, including  the  prepositioning 
<br/>of emergency supplies in Fiji to assist during times of disaster, as and when needed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand remains one of our most important trade and investment partners 
<br/>with  two-way  trade between  New  Zealand  and  Fiji  reaching  an all-time  high  of  NZ$1.36</span><span> </span><span>billion  in 
<br/>2023.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  New  Zealand  has  also  been supporting  Fiji  with  trade  negotiations capacity 
<br/>support. This includes a grant of NZ$800,000, to support ongoing training for our trade officials. We 
<br/>continue  to  collaborate  on  trade  issues including  for  the  Indo-Pacific</span><span> </span><span>Economic Framework  for</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Prosperity (IPEF) which this august Parliament has resolved to ratify earlier this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While in New Zealand, I also met with the Fiji-New Zealand Business Council. The event was 
<br/></span><span>attended by up to 100 members of the Fiji-New Zealand Business Council and I record with regret that 
<br/>some of those very distinguished former Fiji citizens were there at that meeting are now no longer with 
<br/>us.  I raised with our private sector partners the importance of continuing to invest in Fiji, highlighting 
<br/>Fiji's positive economic growth, following the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the Government’s 
<br/>investment target of NZ$2 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also expressed my support towards the revival of the Fiji-NZ Business Council as an avenue 
<br/>to  open  up  further  opportunities  of investment  to  Fiji. I  am  happy  to  see  the  next  Fiji-New Zealand 
<br/></span><span>Business Council meeting being hosted here in Fiji in June.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I also made sure to take time to visit members of the Fiji diaspora living in 
<br/>both  Auckland  and  Wellington. We  were  able  to  share  with  the  Fijian Community  our  national 
<br/>development priorities, the upward trajectory of growth and development. In particular, I conveyed to 
<br/>them our appreciation for their continued support through remittances received from New Zealand.  As 
<br/>you may be  aware,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  personal  remittances  to  Fiji  reached  $1.25 billion in  2023,  an 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase of 20.4 percent over the figure in 2022. Our people abroad make valuable contributions and I 
<br/>urged  the  diaspora community  to  continue  to  be  good Ambassadors  of  Fiji  to  New  Zealand..  I  also 
<br/>urged them to be law abiding contributors to the New Zealand economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In concluding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to thank the New Zealand Government for the 
<br/>protocols and courtesies accorded to me during my visit. Please allow me to express my gratitude to 
<br/>the people and Government of New Zealand for the support and assistance we continue to receive under 
<br/>the </span><span>Duavata </span><span>Partnership. </span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>updating us on the </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Partnership that we have with New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular partnership that was born in 2022 was done to elevate the 
<br/>relationship to a new level and we are happy to hear that it is now being reviewed and taken to another 
<br/>level by the honourable Prime Minister only for the betterment of Fiji. It has a new level of expanded 
<br/>strategic cooperation and also in the years to come, it is also based on the shared values that we have 
<br/>with  New  Zealand,  Sir,  and  an  equal  partnership.    A  lot  of  it  actually  comes  through  trust  and 
<br/>cooperation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, of course, have our shared identity as the honourable Prime Minister has pointed out.  
<br/>We have mutual respect, we have historical connections and these are things that are important to 
<br/>this particular </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Partnership.  The goals are fairly much the same, but I want to also take this 
<br/>opportunity to say thank you also to New Zealand for all the tremendous support that they have given 
<br/>us  during  times  that  have  been  hard  and  also  during  COVID-19  and  whenever  we  have  natural 
<br/>disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also as a shared vision for our  work 
<br/>that we do in improving the lives of our citizens and people and also for the planet, Sir.  I think, when 
<br/>this agreement actually started, they took notice of our 5-Year and 20-Year Development Plans, I 
<br/>know it is being reviewed at the moment, I hope that all of that also forms a part of the review that is 
<br/>currently happening.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the honourable Leader of the Opposition that there was a 
<br/>tremendous amount of support given to our dairy industry.  I think it was about $12 million that came, 
<br/>it was very handy because majority part of it was given to take care of brucellosis and tuberculosis 
<br/>issues that we had in the dairy industry.  It is also a good opportunity and a time to say thank you to 
<br/></span><span>New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  partnership  also  looked  at  the  democracy  and  its  values,  economic  resilience  as  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister has pointed out,  and  also  with  respect  to  security  and the tremendous 
<br/>amount of help and assistance that have been given by New Zealand in terms of defence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regionally speaking, they have stood up at a time of need of our Pacific neighbours where 
<br/>they  uplifted  our  soldiers,  et  cetera,  whenever  we  have  come  to  the  aid  of  our  Pacific  Island 
<br/>neighbours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has also been a lot of strengthening of institutional capacity and Fiji’s 
<br/>governance bodies in terms of the judiciary, defence and security forces so that the rule of law is 
<br/>consistently  upheld  and  this  is  very  important.    I  think  sometimes  we  miss  what  we  have  in  our 
<br/>partnership, but it needs to be said and it is a very important aspect of this particular agreement.  The 
<br/>social well-being also in terms of coordinating preparedness for natural disasters, like COVID-19 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>819 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that actually came along, Mr. Speaker, all of these things have come out of it and born out of that 
<br/>particular partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important things that the honourable Prime Minister pointed out, and again  
<br/>we  have  a  total  support  with  respect  to  this  partnership  is  climate  change.    I  think  New  Zealand 
<br/>recognises this so much with respect to Fiji’s position, where we are and how we have actually gone 
<br/>ahead and been able to do a lot in that particular space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this particular partnership is based on trust, respect and openness. It 
<br/>is  certainly  an  example  to  the  rest  of  the  world  on  how  you  can  operate  in  a  region  and  we  are 
<br/>extremely confident and happy that this particular agreement will be taken forward in the direction 
<br/>that it has from 2022, as we have a very strong relationship with New Zealand.  They have always 
<br/>stood by us in times of need.  I think a lot has been said by the honourable Prime Minister that has 
<br/>covered  a  lot  and  I  wish  you  well  in  the  review,  et  cetera  that  has  gone  on,  Sir,  and  may  this 
<br/>relationship prosper with our neighbours and our brothers and sisters in New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One small point, I do not think there is any one in this room that does not have a relative in 
<br/>New Zealand.  There are quite a few of our diaspora that live there.  May this relationship prosper, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fight Against Poverty Through Active Agriculture Production 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies 
<br/>and gentlemen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I want to join the honourable Prime Ministers in welcoming the 
<br/>Year 8 students of Marist Brothers Primary School and I am proud to say that it includes my youngest 
<br/>son, Joshua Rayalu.  I hope that his visit to Parliament will alleviate all his questions because he 
<br/>keeps asking me, “what do you do in that House”, and that he will one day join his father, grandfather 
<br/>and great grandfather as a Member of this august Parliament and serve the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  before  this  august  Parliament  to  outline  a  vision  on  the  use  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agriculture as a tool in Fiji’s fight against poverty and the associated social ills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we understand, poverty leads to many other social ills such as drug and 
<br/></span><span>substance abuse, domestic violence, suicide and exploitation of children, to name a few.  Poverty is 
<br/></span><span>a cancer that is eating away at the very flesh and muscle and bones of society that must be addressed 
<br/>head-on by Government in partnership with relevant stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) for the period 2019 
<br/>to  2020  estimated  that  the  national  incidence  of  poverty  in  Fiji  impacted  24.1  percent  of  our 
<br/>population.  Poverty is a bottleneck to socio-economic development, thus if we are to improve the 
<br/>quality of people’s lives in Fiji, greater efforts must be made by Government to fight and reduce 
<br/>poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must understand that the fight against poverty in reality is a fight against 
<br/>drug and substance abuse, particularly against our youth, fight against domestic violence against our 
<br/>women and fight against the exploitation of our children among the many other social ills brought 
<br/>about by poverty.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  last  National  Agricultural  Census  Report,  close  to  40 
<br/>percent of households in Fiji are involved in agriculture, yet they are often constrained by limited 
<br/>access  to  resources,  services,  technologies,  markets  and  economic  opportunities  that  lower 
<br/>agricultural productivity and income levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s objective to realise the full potential of Agriculture as a tool 
<br/>for  socio-economic  development  and  growth  has  led  to  the  formulation  of  a  5-year  Strategic 
<br/>Development Plan (SDP) for 2024-2028 that aligns with Government’s National Development Plan 
<br/>(NDP) and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals to develop and transform agriculture 
<br/>in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Priority areas in the National Development Plan that align with the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Waterways Strategic Development Plan include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Food and Nutrition Security; 
<br/>Health and Medical Services through the one health strategy; 
<br/>Social inclusion and empowerment;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Women and youth empowerment and development through agriculture; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Support large scale agriculture production to achieve economies of scale; and 
<br/>Support the development of Small and Medium Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the short term, the Ministry’s SDP provides a roadmap to fulfill the Fijian Governments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>call for agriculture to drive sustainable development and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government through the Ministry of Agriculture has already embarked on 
<br/>consultations with other Ministries, Civil Society Organisations and Non-Government Organisations 
<br/>(NGOs) on the use of agriculture as a tool to fight poverty.  Government will use a multi-sectoral 
<br/>approach to  address  social, economic and political  challenges that are often faced by individuals, 
<br/>marginalised groups and communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the multi-sectoral approach will work towards: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Identifying and assisting the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in Fiji, in actual fact 
<br/>this project will target the poorest of the poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Relocation and training for the identified families and individuals to utilise identified idle 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lands for active agriculture production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Targeting women and youth to get involved in active agriculture production with the renewed 
<br/></span><span>interest  and  gradually  elevating  them  to  be  agricultural  entrepreneurs  through  SME 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Putting  in  the  necessary  financial  investment  to  build  rural  infrastructure,  especially  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>energy, transport, water and sanitation in collaboration with other sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Addressing  structural  constraints  faced  by  the  poor  agricultural  households  through 
<br/>increasing their access to government assistance, as an example, the farm road development 
<br/>and other programmes that currently run within the Ministry. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Improving their capacity to manage risks and increase their agricultural productivity. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Group small-scale farmers into cooperatives and link them directly to markets and improve 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the food systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Creation of decent off-farm employment for the poor in agriculture and the rural non-farm 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economy, including fostering entrepreneurship and providing occupational skills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Building of human capital, in particular, access to basic social services such as health and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>education, as well as occupational skills and organisation capacity.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that the agriculture sector has a great potential to contribute to 
<br/>sustainable development and fight against poverty and its social ills.  This, however, will need the 
<br/>support and collaboration of other Government ministries and stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  potential  for  the  sector  to  grow  during  challenging  times  has  been  proven  during  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, that is, when other sectors remained stagnant, the agriculture sector 
<br/>grew its agriculture production by 7 percent in the 2020-2021 period and by 16 percent in the 2021-
<br/>2022 period.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, poverty issues related to rural urban-drift, rise in informal settlements and 
<br/>crime were previously addressed by the Pacific Community Network (PCN) in a project that was 
<br/>supported  by  the  Ministry  of  Housing  between  2016-2017.  This  involved  the  relocation  of  poor 
<br/>households from informal settlements to settle on agricultural leased land and engaged in productive 
<br/>agriculture activities and small businesses. There were five families relocated to Lomaivuna and five 
<br/>were relocated to Waidina.  To-date the five families in Lomaivuna have developed from a hopeless 
<br/>situation living in informal settlements to a life full of hope where they have thrived in agriculture, 
<br/>ensured  their  food  security  and  livelihoods  requirements  and  are  able  to  send  their  children  to 
<br/>universities.  The other five families in Waidina, however, did not survive as the support services ran 
<br/>out when the programme was shelved in 2018 by the Ministry of Housing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways staff through consultations with 
<br/>other government ministries has received wide support to jointly address the issue of poverty using 
<br/>the mandates of each ministry. We have also drafted a Cabinet paper for endorsement and requested 
<br/>a budget for this work under the 2024-2025 financial year.  The outcomes from the consultations 
<br/>have taken note of the issues faced and lessons learnt from the PCN Project in 2016 and government 
<br/>through the Ministry of Agriculture will take the lead in the implementation of the upcoming project 
<br/>to use agriculture as a tool to alleviate poverty beginning with the poorest of the poor in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  based  on  the  estimation  for  population  for  the  year  2020  and  the  last 
<br/>Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (HIES)  Report  for  the  2019-2020,  there  are 
<br/>approximately 55,000 households in Fiji who are living in poverty. This project will commence after 
<br/>identifying the poorest of the poor within these households to start off with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, I ask this august Parliament to support this initiative on the 
<br/>use of agriculture as a tool to alleviate poverty and other related social ills in Fiji.  We look forward 
<br/>to  further  discussions,  collaboration  and  coordination  with  other  Government  ministries,  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition included and relevant stakeholders and partners that work within this space. God bless 
<br/></span><span>Fiji.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his 
<br/>designate for their response, I am intending to adjourn Parliament for tea, at the same time, I would 
<br/>like to invite the school children of Marist Brothers Primary School who are here and also members 
<br/>of the public in the gallery to, please, join your parliamentarians when we break for tea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this issue of poverty, just a small contribution from the Chair, as you go up towards Lami 
<br/></span><span>and crossing the Tamavua-i-Wai Bridge, when you look to the left when you travelling towards Lami, 
<br/></span><span>you will notice the old Suva Dump that used to be the rubbish dump before.  It is now covered with 
<br/>bush, strangely there are patches of plantations there now; cassava, dalo and everything. That  has 
<br/>happened on their own volition addressing the issue that the honourable Minister has raised, that is, 
<br/>food security.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of these people come from the islands, they have land in their islands but out here, they 
<br/>will come across whether it is a dump site or whether that dump site is emitting gas, gas will kind of 
<br/>poison  the  food,  they  do  not  know  that.    We  look  on  without  giving  proper  advice  there  as  it  is 
<br/>allowable or not and further up, there is a clearance of </span><span>tiri </span><span>or </span><span>dogo </span><span>land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There grows  another kind of weed known locally as  </span><span>karisi  ni  Jaina  </span><span>(watercress).   That  is 
<br/>another variety and you see women in numbers sitting there pulling the </span><span>karisi </span><span>out, bundling it and 
<br/>selling.  I do not know whether they sell it in the Delainavesi market out there in the streets, but these 
<br/>are things that are happening before our eyes for food security and how they want to address poverty.  
<br/>They are taking their own initiatives here.  That is all I just wanted to share, so we do not look far, 
<br/>just look immediately around us and you will notice this happening .

<div><span>We intend to adjourn Parliament now.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.33 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we move on, I would just like to acknowledge the presence of the 
<br/>University of Fiji Journalism students who are seated in the gallery with their lecturer, Mr. Matai 
<br/>Niumataiwalu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I welcome the students and of course, our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>colleague Mr. Niumataiwalu into Parliament this morning.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  make  a  contribution  to  the  Ministerial  Statement  made  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture.  Again honourable Minister, be assured there is always support 
<br/>from  the  Opposition  on  agriculture,  not  only  on  agriculture,  but  on  key  sectors  as  well  because 
<br/>agriculture is important for us in terms of food security and economic empowerment as well, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I am  thankful  to  the honourable Minister for bringing again  the poverty 
<br/>incident level according to the 2019 and 2020 HIES Report because that 24.1 percent is something 
<br/>that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance has always not agreed to and he 
<br/>has his own figures.  But that was pre-there before elections, honourable Minister.  I know he has 
<br/>changed  and  accepted  that  figure  as  official  now.    The  incidence  of  poverty  level  stands  at  24.1 
<br/>percent.  Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  just  refer  as  I  have  stated,  totally  agree  to  almost 
<br/>everything  that  the  honourable  Minister  had  stated.    Of  course,  thank  you  for  your  strategic 
<br/>development  plan,  we  from  the  Opposition  have  also  requested  for  a  copy  of  the  plan,  given  the 
<br/>importance of the sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a quick comment, again, I think I have raised it a few times, I have talked about food and 
<br/>nutrition security, I keep asking about the Food and Nutrition Security Policy that was drafted way 
<br/>back in 2017 but still has not made its way even perhaps to Cabinet.  I do not know where it is but 
<br/>that is a very important document given our commitment to FAO in Rome in 2016 when we received 
<br/>our award based on our achievements on the MDGs then.  So that is a key document for Government 
<br/>because we made that commitment to the Director General FAO in Rome.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the recent Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants Congress, I was in a 
<br/>session with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka on alternative tourism and I spoke very 
<br/>passionately again, not only on agriculture but on the resource-based sector.  I  started by referring 
<br/></span><span>to the country private sector diagnostics that was done by World Bank and IFC.  One of the key areas 
<br/></span><span>that was highlighted in as far as Fiji’s economy and our post COVID-19 recovery is on agri-logistics.  
<br/>It is not only about the agriculture itself but, of course, the value chain as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is very important for us in terms of the way forward.  We have to create the environment 
<br/>and therefore, the three levels of investment, particularly on the resource-based and I am talking here 
<br/>particularly for agriculture, private sector investment because part of that report too,  I am sure the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  is  aware,  is  on  infrastructure,  land 
<br/>access, air access, seaport access and even communications and energy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are all important enablers for agriculture to go to the next level, particularly in terms 
<br/>of cold storage because is perishable.  I will not talk more on that but perhaps, the other one that I 
<br/>raised and caught the attention of most of the participants is, classic economics tells us about land, 
<br/>labor and capital but in some of the research that I did, for us to go to the next level, we add another 
<br/>three to land, labour and capital; science, technology and entrepreneurship.  That will elevate us the 
<br/>next level and it is time now that we sit together, look at the strategic development plan, I saw in last

<div><span>week’s paper about tissue culture in banana; that is good.  That is science and technology but we 
<br/>need to take it to the dairy sector, we need to take it to fisheries, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps the suggestion that I will always make here, something that Government needs to 
<br/>consider  seriously  is  about  getting  specialists  from  abroad  in  capacities  where  we  are  lack  in.  
<br/>Science,  technology  and  entrepreneurship  will  help  us  in  moving,  not  only  agriculture  but  the 
<br/>resource-based sector forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Once again, I fully support it and we will continue 
<br/>to provide the necessary advice as well to the other side of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of  the  Government  in  Parliament,  you had  asked to 
<br/>speak last and now, you have changed your mind again.  You sent a message and I accepted it that 
<br/>you wanted to speak the last.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Fiji’s Participation at IMO 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, I can speak the last.  The honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  esteemed  Members  of  Parliament,  fellow 
<br/>Fijians joining via the Parliament livestream; I stand before you today to discuss an important aspect 
<br/>of our nation’s maritime policy, the establishment of an International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
<br/>Regional Presence Office (RPO), and our active participation in key IMO meetings.  These efforts 
<br/>are  integral  to  safeguard  our  marine  environment,  enhancing  maritime  safety  and  promoting 
<br/>sustainable development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the international shipping industry is responsible for transporting 90 percent 
<br/>of the world’s commodities.  It not only the most cost-effective option for international import an 
<br/>export, but also the safest and most eco-friendly mode of transport as emphasised by Ocean Insights.  
<br/>It is employing approximately 1.5 million individuals worldwide, the shipping industry is significant 
<br/>source of employment.  However, it is predominantly male with females making up only 2 percent 
<br/>of all seafarers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our region, the maritime shipping industry plays a critical role, serving as the back bone of 
<br/>transportation of Pacific Island countries and their communities by moving of majority people, goods 
<br/>and resources.  This sector is vital for fostering trade and economic growth, influencing nearly every 
<br/>aspect of the development initiatives.  In terms of the establishment of the IMO or RPO, as Fiji has 
<br/>long recognised the pivotal role that IMO plays in the global maritime industry, the establishment of 
<br/>an RPO endorsed by the Government in our region, is a testament to our commitment to supporting 
<br/></span><span>IMOs initiatives and ensuring that the unique needs of Pacific Island countries are addressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RPO will serve as a hub for regional cooperation providing technical assistance, capacity 
<br/>building and facilitating the implementation of IMO conventions and standards.  It will also enhance 
<br/>our ability to respond effectively to maritime challenges, including environment protection, safety 
<br/>and security.  By having a regional office, we can ensure that our maritime policies are aligned with 
<br/>the regulations, standards and best practices, while also tailoring them to a specific regional context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 18</span><span>th</span><span> March 2024, during the margins of the Marine Environment Protection Committee, 
<br/></span><span>(MEPC 81), I had the honour of signing an MOU on the RPO on behalf of the Government of the 
<br/></span><span>Republic of Fiji with the IMO Secretary-General, Mr. Arsenio Dominguez, on behalf of the IMO.  
<br/>The  MOU  outlines  the  framework  for  establishing  the  IMOs  RPO  in  Fiji,  designed  to  enhance 
<br/>maritime development in the region, including some of the objectives to bridge the gap in maritime 
<br/>development  needs  and  execution,  the  continued  support  in  terms  of  IMO  support  to  the  region, 
<br/>especially, in standards and regulations in alignment with the international norms.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was also discussion on the IMO Green House Gas (GHG) emissions 
<br/>reduction negotiations.  The gravity of climate crisis cannot be overstated.  It is imperative for us to 
<br/>take resolute and decisive measures to alleviate its impacts.  Fiji is part of the lines of high ambition 
<br/>states when we call ourselves in that group, the six pack, that have been actively participating the 
<br/>IMO GHG emission reduction negotiations.  The Pacific’s role is well recognised as being catalytic 
<br/>to achieving the high levels of ambition agreed in the 2023 Revised IMO Strategy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2023  Revised  IMO  GHG  Strategy  represent  a  comprehensive  and 
<br/>ambitious  plan  to  address  climate  change  by  significantly  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of  the 
<br/>maritime industry.  For the information of this august Parliament, the revised  IMO GHG Strategy 
<br/>sets ambitious targets for the maritime sector to reduce its emissions, aligning with the broader goal 
<br/>of limiting global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  key  targets  under  the  revised  strategy  include  achieving  a  reduction  of  the  carbon 
<br/>intensity of international shipping as measured by carbon dioxide emissions per transport work by, 
<br/>at least, 40 percent by 2030 and 70 percent by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. Moreover, the strategy 
<br/>aims for the total GHG emissions from international shipping to be reduced by, at least, 50 percent 
<br/>by 2050, also compared to 2008 levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These targets represent a significant step towards decarbonisation of the sector with further 
<br/>discussions anticipated in  setting  a pathway towards full carbonisation by the end of the century.  
<br/>Having  agreed  on  the  2023  strategy  negotiations  on  GHG  reduction  for  shipping  at  IMO  will 
<br/>culminate in 2025 in agreement of a basket of measures to achieve the IMO’s 2023 strategy for the 
<br/>decarbonisation  of  shipping  by  2050,  including  an  economic  measure  that  puts  a  price  on  GHG 
<br/>emissions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) in October 2024 through to MEPC 
<br/>83  next  May  is  the  critical  period  for  negotiating  of  the  detail  of  the  proposed  measures  and 
<br/>disbursement of revenues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Alliance  have  previously  submitted  that  the  measures  to  be  adopted  should 
<br/>comprise a simple Global Fuel Standard (GFS) and a universal mandatory levy of all international 
<br/>maritime GHG emissions with an entry price of $150 per tonne, CO2 equivalent. Global fuel standard 
<br/>seeks  to  promote  the  use  of  cleaner  more  environmentally  friendly  fuels  to  minimise  the 
<br/>environmental impact of shipping.  I am happy to say that there is a growing consensus around a 
<br/>universal levy as the leading contender from many states at the IMO meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Pacific Alliance has successfully inserted the concept of an equitable transition into a 
<br/>strategy and has called for at least 50 percent of revenues to flow to the Global South, in particular 
<br/>the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and the Least Developing Countries (LDCs).  Potential 
<br/>revenues  from  IMO  measures  could  be  as  high  as  $100  billion  per  annum.    The  earliest  these 
<br/>measures will flow in any real quantity in 2027 if we do our homework and also push for this, if our 
<br/>negotiators  are  successful  in  confirming  the  basket  of  measures  and  revenue  disbursement 
<br/>architecture by 2025, today, I am also committed to this highly ambitious timelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two critical negotiation rounds at IMO in September and October 2024 and April 
<br/></span><span>2025 with submission deadlines in early 2024 and February 2025 respectively.  The Pacific will need 
<br/>to make multiple submissions to both rounds with a content dependent on the outcome of ongoing 
<br/>bilateral negotiations with multiple partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, active participation at IMO is crucial for advancing our national interest and 
<br/>contributing  to  global  maritime  governance  in  addition  to  the  basket  of  measures  and  also  the

<div><span>financial rewards for our island countries as highly affected by climate change. Fiji has been vocal 
<br/>and proactive member in the IMO and we have reaffirmed our commitment to reducing greenhouse 
<br/>gas emissions and we advocate for stronger measures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  also  highlighted  the  need  for  financial  mechanisms  to  support  our  developing 
<br/>countries and which will continue to participate in various international working groups, focussing 
<br/>on specific issues such as reduction of sulphur oxide emissions, developing of low carbon and zero 
<br/>carbon  fuels  and  the  protection  of  vulnerable  marine  ecosystems.  Our  experts  have  consistently 
<br/>provided valuable insights and best practices from our regional experiences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has mentioned the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnerships and, of 
<br/>course, my predecessor honourable Usamate and the Leader of the Opposition and again this is an 
<br/>important initiative which we will continue to support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Domestic shipping had no profile a decade ago today and partly due to the success of the 
<br/>Pacific Alliance, the significant understanding amongst donors and Fiji and RMI agreed to co-chair 
<br/>the  Pacific  Blue  Shipping  Partnership  which  calls  for  an  investment  for  $500  million  in  climate 
<br/>financing across six Pacific Island States. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  reaffirmed  Fiji’s  commitment  to  the  Pacific  Blue 
<br/>Shipping Partnerships at the margins of COP 28 in terms of green shipping leading the global energy 
<br/>transition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Marshall Island is a key partner and we will continue to 
<br/>liaise closely with them and the RMI Special Envoy for Maritime Decarbonization, His Excellency 
<br/>Ambassador Ishoda, has invited Fiji to join him in hosting a Ministerial Donor Council in Korea mid-
<br/>year with the intention of bringing together Pacific Ministers with our major bilateral partners and 
<br/>the Global Climate Fund to bring focus and high level political support to this initiative and to ensure 
<br/>it remains firmly under country control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This would be the first major multi-country application to the GCF of its kind, Ministers from 
<br/>Tuvalu and Vanuatu have already signaled their commitment to support this approach and the EU &amp; 
<br/>Government of Netherlands have been approached to support.  This proposal would fit well with the 
<br/>existing Fijian initiatives in particular the Agreement with Australia for the Revitalizations of Ship 
<br/>Building and Ship Repair in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given our position as a major transshipment hub, Fiji’s best position for the PBSP countries 
<br/></span><span>to act as the region’s technology transfer hub with numerous multipliers of Fiji’s engineering ship 
<br/>repair, maintenance industries, its maritime facilities and financing an insurance sub-sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our engagement with IMO is not just about compliance with international 
<br/>regulations, it is about shaping the future and ensuring that we have the best outcomes for our nation 
<br/>in Fiji and for our people.  Fiji is committed to being a leader in sustainable maritime development 
<br/>and  ensuring  that  our  maritime  industry  contributes  effectively  to  our  economy  and  our  global 
<br/>community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the establishment of the IMO Regional Office and 
<br/>our active participation in terms of all the contributions of all the officials and our regional partner 
<br/>countries and I thank the honourable Prime Minister for reaffirming out stance at the IMO when he 
<br/>met the Secretary-General in his recent visit to the UK.

<div><span>I  also  acknowledge  and  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  my  predecessor, 
<br/>honourable Jone Usamate for their contributions in the area of climate change and the previous work 
<br/>done in terms of the IMO and our negotiations, and we as a Coalition Government will continue to 
<br/>build upon the work of past governments prior to us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on the engagements with the IMO and on the opening up of the Regional Office 
<br/>in the Pacific and also the further developments that have taken place in order to implement and make 
<br/>operational some of the commitments that have been made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, in the Pacific are just small dots in the ocean and we are, indeed, maritime organisation, 
<br/>maritime  countries  and  anything  to  do  with  the  ocean  is  always  very  important  for  us.    I  must 
<br/>congratulate the honourable Minister for the signing with the IMO for the opening of the office here 
<br/>in the Pacific.  The regional office which once again enhances our image as the hub for the Pacific 
<br/>and  it  also  allows  us  to  be  very  closely  involved  with  all  the  things  that  will  be  taking  place  in 
<br/>anything to do with oceans in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things I was talking about, I think yesterday in relation to the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister’s Address, one of the key things in terms of the greenhouse gas emission 
<br/>strategy for the IMO. The first of the strategies was implemented in 2018 and I was a part of those 
<br/>initial discussions and now we have the new 2023 which provided a lot more details and these targets 
<br/>that we have are not easy targets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The target for 2030 is to reduce emissions by 40 percent within six years.  This is a huge 
<br/>target, and I am glad to hear from the Minister that he has talked about the various ways in which we 
<br/>try to approach this, through the Pacific Blue Shipping and access to the funding, different ways of 
<br/>getting  that  funding  but  also,  I  am  glad  to  hear  of  the  first  multi-country  approach  to  the  Green 
<br/>Climate Fund (GCF) which is a group of small island nations and I think this is very innovative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  the  small  island  nations  of  the  Pacific  are  very  innovative  in  anything  to  do  with 
<br/>oceans to try to get that fund because if I just stated an example, for here in Fiji, our largest vessels 
<br/>in the country are the ro-ro vessels.  They are old fleets and big ships, but they are very old, and we 
<br/>have seen the incidents that have taken place over the past few years.  You always have the balance 
<br/>between trying to decarbonize these fleets and not realizing that everything to do with trade depends 
<br/>on our shipping fleets, especially as they travel across the country, so we have very old boats.  I think 
<br/>we need to find ways to get newer boats into the system and I am not too sure how that can be done, 
<br/></span><span>because to decarbonize old boats, the only thing you can do is to get rid of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The huge challenge there and as I look at the target again, I think the target was to decarbonize 
<br/>80 percent of all our boats by the year 2040 and I am looking forward for us being able to progress 
<br/>this well so we can achieve this target.  I am glad to hear the initiatives that the Minister has made 
<br/>together with the other party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that come to my mind, if we are going to have a levy, I am not too sure 
<br/>about this universal levy.  I am glad to hear that most of the money that is raised from the revenue of 
<br/></span><span>this levy will come to the Global South; will come to the Small Island Developing States.  But in my 
<br/></span><span>mind, I am wondering if we still have old ships, does that mean that we also pay a higher fine for the 
<br/>fact that we have high gas emitting vessels?  I hope that that is an issue that can be addressed into the 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We obviously need support for our shipping sector and I know that this has been something 
<br/>that has been discussed regionally,  at  the global level  and I am  glad to  hear about  the innovative

<div><span>measures that are taking place now to try to push this forward and I look forward to the events for 
<br/>success, so we can really decarbonize our ships in the Pacific so we can join this fight against climate 
<br/>change in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was also reading up and I noticed that we also entered into some agreements with the United 
<br/>States to establishing a green shipping corridor where they will be providing technical cooperations 
<br/>to help us in the early adaption of zero emission fuels.  I think eventually that is where we will be 
<br/>going into the future, but once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his speech 
<br/>and on this side, we will be in full support on anything to do with the greenhouse gas emissions and 
<br/>the support for the maritime sector in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening the Fight Against Corruption - FICAC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers, fellow honourable Members of this august Parliament and members of the public in the 
<br/>gallery and those watching and joining us virtually; good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I believe it is fitting at this juncture to pay tribute to the late 
<br/>Joji Washington Dumukoro, the Acting Deputy Secretary for Home Affairs who will be laid to rest 
<br/>today.  Mr. Dumukoro is from Kadavu, he joined me at the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2000 when 
<br/>the staff of PSC and Parliament were transferred as a result of the events of 2000.  Since then, we 
<br/>have become friends, he is probably one of the only staff who has worked there for, I believe, a good 
<br/>24 years.  May his soul rest in peace.  It says in Deuteronomy 16:19 and I quote: “They are not to be 
<br/>unjust or show partiality in their judgments; and they are not to accept bribes, for gifts blind the eyes 
<br/>even of wise and honest men, and cause them to give wrong decisions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise today to address this esteemed Parliament on the important role and achievements of 
<br/>the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC).  At the outset, I would like to state 
<br/>that corruption in any form undermines the rule of law, disturbs economic growth, and erodes public 
<br/>trust.  The </span><span>Bible</span><span> like every other religious book, they all denounce corruption. II Peter 2:19 states 
<br/>and I quote: “They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of destructive habits - for 
<br/>we are slaves of anything that has conquered us.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand here today for this Parliament to create a legacy.  A legacy that all of 
<br/>us will denounce corruption, just like going to fight for poverty as we heard this morning, just like 
<br/>going to fight for drugs, all of us, not only this side of Parliament, I ask our colleagues from the other 
<br/></span><span>side, as we go out, if anything let us be untied …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. P.K. BALA.- Same here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  …  to  fight  corruption.  There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  solution  to 
<br/>combating corruption, as it is a complex issue and often requires a multi-functional approach. A key 
<br/>strategy for preventing corruption is strengthening the anti-corruption laws, enacting and enforcing 
<br/>robust anti-corruption laws to deter corrupt activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The  primary  role  of  FICAC  is  to  investigate,  institute  and  conduct  criminal  proceedings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>against corruption, a mandate it has carried out with distinction since its establishment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  primary  objective  of  the  Commission  guided  by  section  12  of  the  Fiji  Independent 
<br/>Commission Against Corruption Act No.11 of 2007 is to eradicate corruption. Given the above, the 
<br/>following  are  objectives  adopted  by  the  Commission  to  successfully  carry  out  its  mandated 
<br/>responsibilities:

<br/>Effective education and corruption prevention programmes with the presentation of 
<br/>relevant data; and  
<br/>Successful formulation of anti-corruption policies through a series of effective and 
<br/>efficient prevention programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Commission  is  continuously  challenged  to  sustain  the  fight  against 
<br/>corruption through greater empowerment and visibility.  I wish to highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes at 
<br/>one point this side of Parliament had some issues about FICAC.  The reason being, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>because it was promulgated when Parliament was not sitting.  A law was brought in  first in  2007, 
<br/>there was no wider consultation, yes, but has come over time, there has been set up, there has been 
<br/>awareness, there has been successful prosecutions and today as parliamentarians  our role is to fully 
<br/>support the work of FICAC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  accomplish  the  desired  standards,  the  current  systems,  processes  and 
<br/>procedures of the institution needs to be consistently reviewed and strengthened. In view of the above, 
<br/>the Commission anticipates an extension to its organisational growth and expansion in the future. As 
<br/>such, the Commission foresees its future to have ascertained stronger brand image and position with 
<br/>its partners and stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It must align itself to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030 (SDGs) set by the 
<br/>United  Nations  (UN),  the  Commission  envisions  to  strongly  uphold  its  key  responsibilities  in 
<br/>preventing and combating corruption in the country and assisting the nation to accomplish the set 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission desires to be an institution which is resourceful and well equipped with 
<br/>tangible and intangible necessities to lead the fight against corruption. Also, it envisages sanctioning 
<br/>the Fijian Constitution in terms of the prevention and the minimisation to assist the Government to 
<br/>rapidly adapt and comply with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since its inception, FICAC has conducted a number of corruption prevention activities, national 
<br/>and  regional  initiatives,  investigated  a  number  of  complaints  received,  successfully  prosecuted  and 
<br/>appealed cases in the High Court, including the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is important to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of our 
<br/>dedicated officers who strive daily to prevent and combat corruption in our nation. It is also significant 
<br/>to ensure the morale and performance of these officers and their IK for.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2018, there had been no salary increments for the staff members of 
<br/>FICAC. This prolonged period without financial recognition of their effort was a cause of concern.  
<br/>However, this situation saw a positive change with the new Acting Deputy Commissioner assumed 
<br/>the role in 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the unwavering support of the Coalition Government, a much needed salary adjustment 
<br/></span><span>was implemented, ensuring that the hardworking staff members received their deserved increments.  
<br/></span><span>This decisive action was important in acknowledging and valuing the contributions of the officers, 
<br/>thereby, fostering a more motivated and dedicated workforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  salary  increment  was  indeed  a  great  news  for  the  staff,  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Commission  is  committed  to  ensure  that  the  staff  are  well  catered  for.    Part  of  the  policy  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Commission in terms of its staff welfare, a comprehensive health insurance covers for officers and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their  families;  ample  opportunities  for  growth  within  the  organisation  and  relevant  professional 
<br/>training and development programmes.   These initiatives are essential in retaining the talented staff 
<br/>members and preventing brain drain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most prevalent forms of corruption among public officials have been 
<br/>identified as Causing a Loss and Abuse of Office.  In quarter 3 alone, the Commission received 203 
<br/>complaints  across  its  office  in  Suva,  Lautoka  and  Labasa.    There  were  168  complaints  from  the 
<br/>Central and Eastern Divisions - 14 from the Western and 21 in the Northern Division.  Each of these 
<br/>complaint is thoroughly assessed by the State Counsel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  an  effort  to  provide  even  a  better  service  to  the  people  of  Fiji,  FICAC  expanded  its 
<br/>Investigation Department and the Legal Department in terms of its manpower and resources.  The 
<br/>Investigation  Department  has  branched  out  to  Lautoka  and  Labasa  offices,  while  the  Legal 
<br/>Department remain centralised with plans to expand to these branches in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the launch of its Strategic Plan, FICAC has established the Economic 
<br/>Crime Unit to expedite and investigate cases involving proceeds of crime, unexplained wealth and 
<br/>civil forfeiture matters.  Yesterday, we talked about transnational crimes, that is why it is important 
<br/>for this unit to be set up, to ensure that those cases are properly investigated.  This unit is specifically 
<br/>tasked with investigating offences under the Cybercrime Act 2021, in addition to the Proceeds of 
<br/>Crime Act 1997 and unexplained wealth under the Prevention of Bribery Act No. 12 of 2007.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last quarter, the Commission’s Investigation Department handled a total of 151 cases.  
<br/>Of these, seven cases were charged and taken to court; three cases were submitted for legal opinion; 
<br/>eight cases were submitted for closure and the remining 133 cases are still under investigation.  As 
<br/>we delve deeper into the intricacies of combating corruption, it becomes increasingly evident that 
<br/>this battle requires and united front.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corruption  is  an  evil  multi-faceted  and  multi-dimensional  problem  that  requires  a 
<br/>comprehensive approach, but only in an environment of transparency, accountability and integrity, 
<br/>which the Coalition strives to uphold duly.  The Commission needs collaboration, innovation and 
<br/>incentive systems that facilitates cross-sectoral incentives and shared accountability across different 
<br/>Ministries,  agencies,  levels  of  Government  and  non-Government  stakeholders.  All  are  required, 
<br/>including the private sector, non-state actors and the general public at large.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to shed some light on the progress made and the challenges that 
<br/></span><span>lie ahead.  The Commission’s commitment to this cause is exemplified through its education and 
<br/></span><span>prevention programme.  As such, we must recognise that education and prevention efforts are crucial, 
<br/>not  only  for  promoting  transparency,  accountability  and  integrity,  but  they  accelerate  progress  in 
<br/>meeting development goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  engaging  robustly  with  the  stakeholders  across  the  spectrum,  from  Government 
<br/>institutions to private enterprises, from communities to youth groups and clubs, from primary schools 
<br/>to tertiary institutions, as well as NGOs and civil society organisations.  As technology continues to 
<br/>shape our world, the Commission remains proactive in adapting to these changes.  The key initiatives 
<br/></span><span>such as the development of an online recruitment portal and online appraisal are being explored to 
<br/></span><span>enhance efficiency and address potential delays.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Commission  acknowledge  it  cannot  tackle  corruptions  single 
<br/>handily the fight against corruption is everyone civic duty. Therefore, stressing the important fact 
<br/>that  comparing  corruption  was  the  active  participation  of  all  members  of  society  to  ensure  more 
<br/>transparent, efficient and equitable world together with the support of involvement of all stakeholders

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we can strive towards our society free from the cycles of corruptions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission needs sufficient funding to sustain its operation and accommodate changes 
<br/>for  the  next  five  years,  as  highlighted  in  the  Commission  Strategic  Plan  which  was  launched  in 
<br/>February of this year. We also agreed to assist individual officers in different departments their efforts 
<br/>to drive to achieve their KPIs Annual Corporate Plan for 2024-2025.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government place a great emphasis on the importance of never forgetting the 
<br/>grass  root  communities  and  those  at  the  outer  islands.  And,  yes,  the  Coalition  Government  has 
<br/>positively shown its support towards the Commission in carrying out this role and functions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  unlike  the  previous  Government  which  often  interfered  with  how  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission carried out its roles and functions …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  …causing  officers  to  work  under  constant  fear  of  termination  or 
<br/>dismissal  the  Coalition  Government  takes  a  different  approach..  With  the  Coalition  Government, 
<br/>there is commitment to allow independent statutory institutions like FICAC to operate autonomously 
<br/>without interference in a day to day operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government respect the staff of these organisations  enforce an environment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where they can carry out their duties effectively and without undue influence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will refer back to the </span><span>Bible</span><span>. Galatians 6:8, states and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If you plant in the field of your natural desires, from it you will gather the harvest of 
<br/>death; if you plant in the field of the spirit, from the spirit you will gather the harvest of 
<br/>eternal life.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to address this august Parliament, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my response  to the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General and the statement on the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember during campaign this is the very Government that wanted to 
<br/></span><span>abolish FICAC. We have seen this but again he is now praising FICAC. Yesterday, the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka wanted to talk about the open skies.  Few months back he said all 
<br/>this kind of flip-flop politics coming from the other side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, can we have this wind of change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But, again, FICAC was created by 
<br/></span><span>back then in the previous administration and I thank the honourable Attorney-General that his eyes 
<br/>is open today to acknowledge the good work of the previous Government.  His duty is to continue 
<br/>that good work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister the other day, a new Government needs to 
<br/>build on the success of the previous government and that has to be the culture. The honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister specifically said no Government is forever.  The good work done by FICAC, the only thing 
<br/>that  FICAC  needs  is  more  funding.  The  honourable  Attorney-General  can  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance for more funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the honourable Attorney-General was talking about increment to FICAC officials,  I 
<br/>saw the honourable Minister for Finance smiling away. But again, I am not saying that because some 
<br/>from the other side are under investigation too but again we need to support the institution. We need 
<br/>to practice what we preach, especially coming from the honourable Attorney-General as the Minister 
<br/>responsible for FICAC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, public knowledge, the honourable Attorney-General too is under investigation under 
<br/>FICAC. But again, if we are to practice what we preach, the </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse that he had read to us a while 
<br/>ago, we have to stick to the text of the Word.  If I were the honourable Attorney-General and Minister 
<br/>responsible for FICAC, I would have given that portfolio away to probably honourable Tikoduadua 
<br/>or  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  after  my  investigation  is  completed,  then  that  particular 
<br/>portfolio can come back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  obligations  under  FICAC.  FICAC  is  an  international 
<br/>obligation under the</span><span> </span><span>United Nations Convention against Corruption</span><span> </span><span>(UNCAC) and I spoke the</span><span> </span><span>other 
<br/>day about the Annual Report for FICAC on the Periodic Review – The Peer Reporting, and I think it 
<br/>is due in June, honourable Attorney-General.  I think we need to make our report on the whole review; 
<br/>how are we going to review FICAC and whether FICAC is relevant and how are we going to develop 
<br/>FICAC to combat the objectives that FICAC were made with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On education and other programmes that are happening, awareness, corruption is everywhere 
<br/>and any government that comes in will be blamed by any Opposition that that particular government, 
<br/>to borrow your words honourable Attorney-General will try to “weaponize” this kind of institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I hope you do not weaponize these kinds of institutions and let it grow so that we 
<br/>eradicate  the  very  principles  that  this  particular  organisation  fights  for  and  that  is  to  combat 
<br/>corruption.  I thank the honourable Attorney-General again and Minister responsible for FICAC for 
<br/>acknowledging the good works that has been done by the past and also moving forward on why  this 
<br/>particular organisation needs to be strengthened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>for Fisheries and Forestry to make his Statement, I would like to acknowledge the presence of a tribe 
<br/>from New Zealand in the North Island known as Ngāpuhi.  Their land comprises the areas that were 
<br/>part of the Waitangi Treaty, I am told. So, they are here for some visitation, and we acknowledge 
<br/>your presence here, ladies and gentlemen.

<div><span>matter,  I  wish  to  take  a  short  moment  to  address  honourable  Usamate's  question  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament on Monday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members have  raised and  I summarise the issue that we 
<br/>were to address our vessels that were tied up along the foreshore here in Suva, due to their parent 
<br/>business becoming non-operational.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji national long line fleet, one of the last standing domestic fleets in 
<br/>the region, is fully operational within Fiji's EEZ and in areas beyond national jurisdictions, that is the 
<br/>high seas and my Ministry is moving to develop the various capacities needed to take the industry 
<br/>into the near future, the element that I have raised in this august Parliament on Monday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The vessels that the honourable Minister is alluding into Suva's foreshore are foreign vessels 
<br/>that  have  come  to  utilise  many  services  that  Fiji  has  to  offer,  such  as  bunkering  and  provision 
<br/>services, scheduled slipway engagements for repairs and maintenance and also to await the change 
<br/>in vessel crews, amidst enjoying the vibrant environment, agriculture that Fiji has to offer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate that my Ministry is moving to play its part well with the relevant 
<br/>line agencies and industry stakeholders in order to meet this Coalition Government’s processes to 
<br/>develop Fiji as a regional hub, poised at meeting these demands and ensuring that they are met more 
<br/>efficiently into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to now transit and deliver a statement 
<br/>on  the  recent  achievement  that  is  foreseen  to  improve  and  boost  Fiji’s  capability  within  the 
<br/>aquaculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could I just interrupt you for a while there, honourable Minister?  What 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you have just stated is that the ships out here are waiting for the change around of the crews?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It has really taken a long while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Some are waiting for maintenance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Qo e wawa veisau tiko qo se veisau na kai waqa? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, some are waiting for maintenance and the slipway to be cleared 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then their turns are up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Usamate, that answers your concern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  your  permission,  I  would  like  to  transit  and 
<br/>deliver a statement on the recent achievement that is foreseen to improve and boost Fiji’s capability 
<br/>within the aquaculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe  we  are  all  aware  of  the  current  assistance  rendered  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Government through the Ministry of Fisheries as part of the collaboration with the Government and 
<br/>People of Japan.  Through this assistance, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries received three excavators 
<br/>and  three  trucks,  made  possible  by  the  Japanese  Official  Development  Assistance  through  this 
<br/>International Cooperation System. Like any responsible Government, our commitment underpins our 
<br/>willingness to improve the livelihood of our people, our economy and our resources.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I took up office, recognizing the status of existing projects.  Through the 
<br/>commitment of the Coalition Government, helped lead to the work of the Ministry of Fisheries to 
<br/>achieve the needed outcomes.  The result is now measured with the successful procurement of the 
<br/>excavators and trucks which will boost and drive the achievement of aquaculture aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, allow me to shed light on past aquaculture practices and 
<br/>how the procurement of the Japanese aided machinery address challenges that once affected Fiji’s 
<br/>aquaculture growth.  Sir, in the past, our service to the aquaculture sector was measured by our ability 
<br/>to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Provide technical support; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Funding of pond construction and start up; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Feeding supply; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hatchery production for pond stocking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While these targets and goals seem viable on paper, the Ministry of Fisheries continue to face 
<br/>challenges in operationalizing the aquaculture work plan.  One of the underlying reasons was the 
<br/>high cost of pond construction and maintenance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries has close to 500 aquaculture farmers around Fiji.  
<br/>The  hiring  of  an  excavator  and  trucks  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  ponds  cost  around 
<br/>$10,000.  The high cost incurred in the pond works, often result in the high cost of pond management 
<br/>and production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ideally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is more viable to divert and utilize the funds allocated for pond 
<br/>construction and maintenance to the operational needs and farm management.  The re-allocated funds 
<br/>can  be  used  for  hatchery  production,  feed  purchases,  market  access  and  product  enhancement 
<br/>therefore, providing the needed support to enhance the development of aquaculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  benefits  envisaged  are  widespread.    The  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has 
<br/>developed  a  robust  plan  to  ensure  that we  maximise  the  utilisation  of  these  Japanese-aided 
<br/>machineries. First is the strategic placement of excavators and trucks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as aquaculture farms are dispersed across our main geographical divisions, 
<br/>we  have  developed  a  relocation  plan to  have  the  excavators  and  trucks  relocated  to  our 
<br/>main aquaculture clusters in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions.  This approach will result 
<br/>in the quick turn-around time for pond constructions, enhance the expansion and commercialisation 
<br/>of aquaculture farms, reduce operating costs incurred by current farmers and address the issue of 
<br/>loss of farming interest that lead to dormant ponds and enable the aquaculture farmers to meet local 
<br/>demand and in future, supply the export market, all of which are key development steps, critical to 
<br/>the survival of further development of the aquaculture sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just the beginning. The future looks extremely bright, with lots of 
<br/>big possibilities. I am committed to progress the aquaculture sector towards the realisation of these 
<br/>big possibilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With our collective effort and commitment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will serve our people's needs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>provide a reliable source of protein and essential nutrients, contributing to our nation's 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>food security;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>boost economic growth through significant progress from subsistence to semi commercial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and fully commercialised aquaculture farms;

<div><span>Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was deeply honoured to have officiated at the handing 
<br/>over  ceremony.  It  is  a  milestone  I  always dreamt  about  and  have  now  come  to  realise  as  a 
<br/>Minister.  Therefore, I would like to re-emphasise our appreciation to the Government and the People 
<br/>of  Japan  for  their  continued  partnership  and  support.   It  is  certainly  onwards  and  upwards  from 
<br/>here. The onus is now on our people: the team I work with in fisheries and our wide stakeholders and 
<br/>partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are committed to take the aquaculture sector to bigger heights. Through our 
<br/>commitment, the Ministry of Fisheries is determined to steer Fiji towards a robust aquaculture sector 
<br/>that serves our people, addresses our needs and safeguards our economy  for our sustenance  and the 
<br/>survival of our future generation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fisheries and Forestry for his Statement this morning on aquaculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Sir,  the  discussions  on  the  provision  of  machinery  for  aquaculture  emanated  from  the 
<br/>discussions that the machines were brought in from Japan was supposed to be divided between the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Ministry  of  Fisheries.  Unfortunately,  in  the 
<br/>formation of the Ministry of Waterways, all the machineries were diverted to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The machinery as the honourable Minister has stated will be critical for the development of 
<br/>aquaculture.  Basically, we ask that it comes with a flat top truck so the digger can be loaded on to 
<br/>the flat top truck and taken to various areas in the Western, Northern and Central Divisions.  This is 
<br/>to help new and existing aquaculture farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to encourage the honourable Minister to try and continue the discussions with 
<br/>Korea who had initially agreed to provide a US$10 million for the development of mariculture in 
<br/></span><span>Makogai.  These basically to farm non-migratory species, like </span><span>donu</span><span> and </span><span>kawakawa </span><span>for the benefit of 
<br/></span><span>the maritime islands.  Basically, cage farming will also provide the possibility of spawning for high 
<br/>value species like </span><span>donu </span><span>and </span><span>kawakawa.</span><span>  I am not really sure whether the discussions with Korea is 
<br/>at the moment, but they had initially given the green light for the US$10 million for the development 
<br/>of Makogai,  not only for the maritime islands, but also the coastal islands of Vanua Levu with these 
<br/>high value species.  This will greatly develop the stock within our reef system if they spawn within.  
<br/>This  is  basically  practised  in  South-East  Asia  and  commonly  called  as  cage  farming.    I  would 
<br/>encourage the honourable Minister to try and pursue that because not only it will help, the Japanese 
<br/>Government has helped the Northern, Central and Eastern and Western Divisions, this will help the 
<br/>small islands in the maritime zone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aquaculture is quite a difficult venture to go into; there has been a lot of 
<br/>failures.  We had tried milk fish, we had tried </span><span>nuqa </span><span>and </span><span>kawakawa</span><span> in Ra and it is progressing very 
<br/>well. I encourage the honourable Minister so that he continues to develop that. We had a technician 
<br/></span><span>who  had  been  with  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  for  five  years.    Unfortunately,  he  has  left,  but  I 
<br/></span><span>understand  that  he  had  been  replaced.    Aquaculture  in  this  modern  world  where  there  is  climate

<div><span>change, and interruption to the normal system within our waters, pollution is a very good alternative 
<br/>to  natural  species  that  live  within  our  waters.  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and 
<br/>Forestry  for  encouraging  and  continuing  with  the  work  within  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  for 
<br/>aquaculture farmers in Fiji.
