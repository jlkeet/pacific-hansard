<h3>REVIEW REPORT –STANDING ORDERS OF PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>STANDING ORDERS OF PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That the Amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in its Report 
<br/>in the Review of the Standing Orders of Parliament to the Republic of Fiji be adopted today 
<br/>by Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity 
<br/>to  speak  and  debate  the  Amendment  as  recommended  by  the  Standing  Orders  Committee  in  the 
<br/>review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament to the Republic of Fiji as we undertaken in the last 
<br/>couple of meetings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I tabled the report of the Standing Order Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this morning after careful deliberation between the honourable Members of the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  had  alluded  to  when  I  tabled  the  report  of  the  Standing  Orders 
<br/>Committee this morning, I informed the Parliament that the Standing Orders Committee met on four 
<br/>separate occasions.  On 1st May, 3rd May, 17th May and finally yesterday the 22nd of May, 2024 
<br/>during lunch break.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On those occasions the Committee met and discussed Amendments to the Standing Orders. 
<br/>There were Amendments proposed by the Opposition which were missed during the Amendments to 
<br/>the Standing Orders last year, for obvious reasons as well as from the secretariat upon discussions 
<br/>with the UNDP consultant, Mr. Kevin Deveaux.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I must convey my real appreciation on the extensive deliberation and work 
<br/>undertaken by the Standing Orders Committee and for reaching agreements on the Amendments. In 
<br/>that  regard,  I  seek  the  honourable  Members  support  for  the  motion  this  evening  to  enable  the 
<br/>proposed Amendments by the Committee to be adopted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee agreed to the following to allow the secretariat to finalise 
<br/>the minutes of the meetings and draft of the Amended Standing Orders as well as the Committee’s 
<br/>Report on these documents were subsequently then conveyed to the Committee members for their 
<br/>perusal, their comments and finalisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  proposed  Amendments  to  the  Standing  Orders  which  have  been 
<br/>circulated  to  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  are  necessary  because  they  impact  the  way 
<br/>Parliament  conducts  itself  now  and  in  moving  forward.  These  proposed  Amendment  relate  to 
<br/>performance, functions and the workings of our Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  considering  and  reviewing  the  practices  and  procedures  of  Parliament,  the  proposed 
<br/>amendments  which the Committee agreed to during its meetings on the four separate occasions as 
<br/>mentioned earlier in terms of the review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji  I  hereby  present  it  to  Parliament  as  mandated  by  Standing  Order  128  which  all  honourable 
<br/>Members have hopefully received a hard as well as an e-copy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now proceed to the proposed amendments and these are only in the 
<br/>following  provisions  which  relate  to  Standing  Orders  37,  42,  45,  110,  122,  126,  127  and  137 
<br/>respectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  amendments  for  Standing  Order  37,  where  it  is  proposed  to  have  a  new 
<br/>insertion in the current provision where “when a petition is moved, it should be seconded and debated 
<br/>before  the  honourable  Speaker  proposes  a  question  on  the  motion”  to  Parliament  before  it  is 
<br/>considered whether it would be referred to the relevant Standing Committee or otherwise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Standing  Order  42,  it  is  proposed  amendment  to  increase  Oral  Questions  to  10  by 
<br/></span><span>increasing the Opposition Oral Questions to five and by increasing the Government’s Oral Questions 
<br/></span><span>to five as opposed to the current eight questions that we now presently practice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Standing  Order  45,  it  is  proposed  as  an  amendment  to  the  timing  on  asking  Oral  and 
<br/>Supplementary Questions to one minute and the responses by the Ministers must be ten minutes for 
<br/>the  Oral  Questions  however  the  responses  to  the  supplementary  questions  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Ministers would be from five minutes to 10 minutes.  That is the first set of amendments. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next set of amendments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are relating to Committee issues on Standing 
<br/></span><span>Orders 109(2)(b), 110(3), 112, 126 and 127. The proposed amendment pursuant to Standing Order 
<br/>109(2)(b) was the inclusion of the word “aviation” as part of the mandate of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Social Affairs as well as the proposed amendment to Standing Order 110 in terms of enquiry or 
<br/>intention  to  investigate  component  of  the  Standing  Committees  where  terms  of  references  would 
<br/>have to be provided by the Chairpersons but the terms of preference by, Mr. Speaker, would be used 
<br/>by the relevant Committee wanting to do enquiries.

<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>897 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also on the proposed amendment on Standing Order 122 was in regards to 
<br/>a  resolution  on  the  appointment  of  the  appointing  of  sub-committees  outlining  its  membership 
<br/>component and voting rights will spark of the sub-committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendment to Standing Order 126 is on the Whips of each 
<br/>Party to be included as Members to the House Committee because of the roles all Whips play in each 
<br/>of our political parties in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as well as the proposed amendment to Standing Order 127, that before a 
<br/>Member  is  referred  to  the  Privileges  Committee,  they  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  give  a 
<br/>personal explanation pursuant to Standing Order 80 and at the discretion of the honourable Speaker, 
<br/>the matter may or may not be referred to the Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  proposed  amendment  to  Standing  Order  137(2)  where  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>correct amendment to the number is visible and is to be adopted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion and as you would have known that by Convention, the Report 
<br/>of the Standing Orders Committee is a functional document, recommended amendments are reflected 
<br/>in Annexure 1 of the Report and the Minutes of the proceedings of the Committee are reflected in 
<br/>the Annexure 2 of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  to  earlier,  I  convey  much  appreciation  on  the  extensive 
<br/>deliberation that was conducted and work undertaken by the Standing Orders Committee on a very 
<br/>bipartisan  level.  I  thank  the  Members  and  the  Standing  Orders  Committee  from  both  sides  of 
<br/>Parliament and I hereby commend these amendments to Parliament and respectfully seek each of our 
<br/>Members  of  Parliaments’  support  for  the  adoption  of  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  Standing 
<br/>Orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also have a list of speakers in front of me, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. A.A. Maharaj; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Naupoto.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Vosarogo for 
<br/></span><span>presenting  this  particular  report  that  had  some  extensive  deliberation  when  the  Committee  was 
<br/></span><span>sitting.  I would like to thank the Committee, even though  a bit late, but the submission that was 
<br/>actually submitted by Opposition was finely discussed by the Committee and I am grateful to say 
<br/>that at least from our recommendation, four recommendations did make through which was quite 
<br/>substantial, especially being outnumbered in Standing Order Committee when we have five sitting 
<br/>from the Government side and only one representing the Opposition.  I think that is something that 
<br/>we need to look atin the future as to how we can change the membership of the Standing Orders 
<br/>Committee to make it a bit bipartisan in nature.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  first  one  that  I  would  like  to  discuss  a  bit  on  is  Standing  Order  37 
<br/></span><span>whereby a debate can be carried out by Members, we do know that most of the time  Opposition 
<br/>Members bring in petitions .  However, as discussed in the Committee stage, there would be other 
<br/>members who might actually hail from that particular location where the subject matter is from and 
<br/>they would like to contribute as it is their constituency as well and they represent the people from 
<br/>that place so they should be given a chance to speak before an informed decision is made by the 
<br/>Members whether they want to actually vote in favour of the petition or not.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, there are 10 questions and additional question coming to Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next one is, Whips to be included in the House Committee. We have seen the Whips are the 
<br/>ones who are communicating basically with all the staff and House Committee is looking after the 
<br/>wellbeing and welfare of all the Members.  It is appropriate for the Whips to be sitting on the House 
<br/>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we propose and we are happy that is passed and part of the 
<br/>Standing Committees whereby a Member of Parliament is given a chance to explain himself, if there 
<br/>is a matter of privilege.  We are dealing with honourable Members and I think it is only right that the 
<br/>Member is heard in public before a decision is made by the honourable Speaker, whether a Member 
<br/>should be sent to Privileges Committee or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for being on our side when we were having  a 
<br/>discussion because you also provided us some very fruitful contribution and that is one of the reasons 
<br/>why these matters were accepted by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are certain things that I would like to bring the attention that were not 
<br/>accepted by the Committee and as the saying goes, we should practice what we preach.   If we are 
<br/>given a chance to change what is not being practiced, it would be a good opportunity for people to 
<br/>have and use that moment to change what you have been preaching about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- One of them was the use of Standing Order 51, as stated in the 
<br/>meeting as well.  We have nothing against the use of Standing Order 51, the Constitution allows it, 
<br/>the Standing Order allows it but our concern was if a Bill is lly brought under Standing Order 51 and 
<br/>to  be  debated  and  passed  in  a  single  sitting  and  is  not  referred  to  any  particular  Committee,  the 
<br/>Members should not be restricted with any timeframe to scrutinize that particular Bill.  At least in 
<br/>this Parliament, we should not actually have a timeframe whereby we restrict the Members to one 
<br/>hour or half an hour or two hours, especially if it is not being scrutinize by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, we should practice what we preach.  The Opposition has been preaching this 
<br/>for the past eight years so it was a time for them to change the practice but unfortunately, they did 
<br/>not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  thing  that  we  requested  was  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Get it right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- … to be 10 minutes.  During the past eight years, there were two 
<br/>parties  in  Opposition,  so  they  were  actually  given  five  minutes  each  which  accumulated  to  10 
<br/></span><span>minutes.  I am not too sure what Government is afraid of, of giving us that 10 minutes to actually 
<br/></span><span>response to their Ministerial Statement but unfortunately did not go through and we are still stuck 
<br/>with five minutes.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know by the time we stand up and get ready, two and 
<br/>half minutes has gone, by the time we come to the subject, the bell rings.  So, if you want some 
<br/>fruitful and very important discussion with regards to the Ministerial Statement, I think we should 
<br/>have gone with the 10 minutes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>899 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we have some gentlemen agreement now as part of the Committee was, 
<br/>that Parliament be given precedence. I know it is not part of the Standing Orders, it was supposed to 
<br/>be amended in such a way that we can actually have Members to give precedence to Parliament.  One 
<br/>of the reasons why we brought this one was, either you are Member of a Committee, either you are 
<br/>an Assistant Minister, Minister or Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost is, we are Members of Parliament, you are given that position just because 
<br/>you are Member of Parliament. So if you are in Parliament, your responsibility is to Parliament and 
<br/>to the people who have voted us because we have actually seen in Committee stages,  even  in the 
<br/>Select Committee or Standing Committee whereby Members they do not appear in Committees and 
<br/>the normal work of the Committees cannot go through either it be a Select Committee or Standing 
<br/>Committee.    That  was  the  request  from  our  side  to  be  incorporated  unfortunately,  it  did  not  go 
<br/>through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did recommend and we thought that the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister  would  take  this  happily  after  years  of  experience  in  Parliament  of  having  a  30-minute 
<br/>question and answer session for Prime Minister but unfortunately, that was declined as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- But literally, we thought that would be taken onboard as well but 
<br/>unfortunately,  it  is  not.  Nevertheless,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  support  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament and we do support the changes that are coming to the Standing Order Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Levu na vosa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Minister for moving 
<br/>this motion and the contribution so far, particularly from my respective colleague, the former Whip 
<br/>for the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed amendments as being articulated by the honourable Minister for Lands and I 
<br/>think that is actually quite clear to all of us, there is really no need to go too long into the details. But 
<br/>I would just like to make some clarifications on some of the issues raised by honourable Maharaj. 
<br/>We do not share anything in the  Government, we are the Government after all. But I think, what I 
<br/>quite like Mr. Speaker, Sir, about the discussions in the Standing Orders Committee that there was 
<br/>enough  goodwill  on  the  part  of  the  Government  to  accommodate  some  of  the  wishes,  and  these 
<br/></span><span>wishes as you very rightfully enforced in the Committee are good for democracy and also good for 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and our people.  I have been in the Standing Orders Committee since the inception of all 
<br/>these sessions of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have never enjoyed this environment of reaching consensus and I think it is quite a good 
<br/>spirit to enhance and I think the more we do this, I actually suggested this to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>as Chair of the Committee, that none of these orders are cast in stone. There is always provision for 
<br/>it to be changed as we go along. And as we mature as a Parliament, I am sure that a lot of these 
<br/>Standing Orders that has been the cause for concern over all this while will eventually be out the 
<br/></span><span>window, so as to allow much greater room for discussion, whether you be on this side of Parliament 
<br/></span><span>or that side, it is Parliament that actually reigns at the end of the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just on the matter of Standing Order 51, I have heard what honourable Maharaj has said but 
<br/>I know that I have moved the position of the Government to keep the order as it were. But I think as 
<br/>we go through developing maturity on the side of the Government that only really on matters that are 
<br/>really urgent that we need to use this order.  Otherwise, I believe one of the steps that we are taking, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly these Bills that were passed today that had to go into Committee, first thing we need to 
<br/>continue  to  develop,  allow  more  time  for  speaking  and  allow  more  time  for  scrutiny  by  the 
<br/>Committee.    That  can  only  be  good  for  Parliament  and  the  people  but  for  now  I  think,  the  way 
<br/>Standing Order 51 is worded is adequate enough to accommodate all of our wishes until such time 
<br/>that we make it more liberal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Precedence of parliamentary business, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had spoke at 
<br/>length about this, particularly my opposition to the fact to actually write in the Standing Order the 
<br/>issue about precedence of Parliament. One of the main reasons for that, is that, Parliament must take 
<br/>precedence  over  everything,  where  it  is  necessary  that  either  Members  of  the  Opposition  or 
<br/>Government  must  attend.  I  think  it  is  quite  clear  that  every  once  in  a  while,  particularly  in 
<br/>Government, there are times that we cannot be here. It means no disrespect but  I think it is good 
<br/>Parliament practice that if you are not able to attend, you must seek the leave of the Speaker to be 
<br/>excused  from  Parliament  and  I  think  that  is  good  practice  and  that  is  why  we  had  asked  for  the 
<br/>provision not to be included.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime  Minister’s  question  time  and  urgent  question,  I  think  the  provision  of  urgent  oral 
<br/>questions to be posed to Government takes care of a lot of the urgent issues, so I believe at this time, 
<br/>the need for the Prime Minister’s question time and all the circus that encompasses it. I think we have 
<br/>been to the parliaments in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, you watch question time, it is just 
<br/>like a movie.  It does not really augur well for the spirit of the Fijian Parliament which is part of the 
<br/>reason we think that maybe that should be kept in the back burner for a while.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, I would really like to thank the contribution of the Government in this process 
<br/>and also my honourable colleagues from the other side in the discussions that we reached and I would 
<br/>like to re-emphasise the fact that the more this Parliament becomes mature, I think that will gives us 
<br/>the opportunity to continue to review  these set of orders for what is best for this Parliament and best 
<br/>for our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a document that guides the work 
<br/>of this Parliament, the People’s House as we come in here and do the work of the people.  It is quite 
<br/>an important document.  When I went in to the first meeting, Sir, I realised I was the only one sitting 
<br/>on one side, all the other side was full and I thought to myself, “man, this is so unfair, I represent 26 
<br/>seats and I get outnumbered all the time” my thought was, I am representing the Opposition and then 
<br/>it dawned on me that that was the wrong thought.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think that the right thinking when we go to amend this document is just to make sure that 
<br/></span><span>we the representatives of the people, when we come into this Parliament to do the work of the people 
<br/>that these documents allows us to do so and do so fairly.   I think that in the past and maybe now, 
<br/>there is still this thinking of writing this document to benefit either that side of Parliament or this 
<br/>side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it should be written to benefit Parliament to ensure that both sides function properly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to allow us to do the work of the people properly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All the recommendations that are in the document now, in my view are recommendations that 
<br/></span><span>will allow us to do our job as representatives of the people better, not good for the Opposition or 
<br/>good for Government, it is good for the Parliament as a whole for us to do the job as representatives 
<br/>of the people in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  hope,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  as  we  go  forward  in  looking  at  this  document  under  your 
<br/>leadership, governs what we do in this the House of the People, that we will move away a little bit 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>901 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from whether this benefits the Opposition or it benefits the Government, and you look at it as, “Okay, 
<br/>this document allows the Parliament of Fiji to do their job and do their properly.” I think that some 
<br/>of the changes that the honourable Minister was alluding to maybe will begin to go out and shape 
<br/>this document into one that is really focused on the work that we do as the representatives of the 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  support  all  the  changes  that  are  here,  it  reflects  that  need  to  have  those  changes  in  this 
<br/>document  so  that  we  are  able  to  do  our  job  properly.  If  we  can  move  away  from  whether  this 
<br/>document  benefits  Opposition  or  Government  more,  I  think  we  will  come  up  with  a  very  good 
<br/>document that will in the end allow us to do our job better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the changes in these amendments that we have come through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament  who  have  contributed  to  the  motion  on  the  Standing  Orders  which  we  have  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament this morning and we are seeking to have it passage through tonight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is interesting, I have never considered it to be of that meaning when I was 
<br/>reading through yesterday and today - the reference to the Standing Orders being a living document.  
<br/>Sir, just when I was hearing my colleagues in Parliament share their experience, I realise that it is 
<br/>actually  a  document  that  is  designed  to  grow,  change  overtime  as  our  collective  experience  and 
<br/>advancing Parliament changes with time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I think some of the suggestions that have been suggested in this Parliament, the  one that 
<br/>have been referred to in his speech by the honourable Alvick Maharaj, they were the same ones that 
<br/>have been referred to by the Opposition in 2014 to 2022 but you know, they did not do anything 
<br/>about it. We are doing something.  The point that we wanted to make is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>come half-way, they need to work the other half. That is the way Parliament is supposed to work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relations to the privilege, I thought that it was going to be mentioned by the honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua being an ex-privileged Member, it provides for an opportunity and it is the sort of right 
<br/>environment  that should be given. When someone is  cited  for privilege,  this  amendment  actually 
<br/>gives …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And the honourable Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- … and of course the honourable Speaker.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These amendments actually provides the privileged Member an opportunity to speak to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allegation before the complaint is referred to the Privileges Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  an  opportunity  that  was  never  there  before.  I  am  sure  it  is  an  opportunity  as  we  had 
<br/>discussed also at the Committee level is, it provides the people of Fiji an opportunity for the person 
<br/>who has been privileged to be heard in open Parliament and to be heard by people who are going to 
<br/>be  watching  before  everything  else  goes  back  and  before  it  comes  back  to  Parliament  with 
<br/></span><span>recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So that is the sort of fairness  that we were quite  prepared as Government side to  concede 
<br/>because we think that it is the most fairest thing to do.  Of course, I want to take this opportunity, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, to thank you for your guidance through the four meetings that has culminated in the adoption 
<br/>of what to be adopted amendments today. We thank you for your foresight and your timeless advice 
<br/>during the meetings in Committee.

<div><span> Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, I wanted to say that now we are beginning to see shapes of the Standing Orders more 
<br/>into becoming the document that will ultimately and ultimately serve the interest of the people of 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  that brings  us to  the end of the sitting today and 
<br/>before I go further in adjourning Parliament, I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and 
<br/>every one of you, especially the honourable Prime Minister, in providing his vision as well by way 
<br/>of the support that he gave that enabled us to visit Australia. This is the Standing Orders Committee 
<br/>and in doing so, we are also encouraged by his support that some of the new provisions that we have 
<br/>now will allow us to do oversight and scrutiny and also more importantly how we are going to better 
<br/>utilise the services of the 12 Members of Parliament in the Opposition, who do not belong to any 
<br/>Standing Committee or to be a Member of any Standing Committee as there are only six.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we are grateful that through this hard work by the support from the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister in allowing us to continue with that purpose, it has come to fruition now by seeing 
<br/>that is now part of the Standing Orders, and those Committees will be part of the sub-Committees of 
<br/>Standing Committees, and they can engage themselves in the work of the sub-Committees’ Standing 
<br/>Committees, but when it comes to the vote, it is the substantive Standing Committees will be doing 
<br/>the vote.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this, honourable Members will only be heavily participating in all the work required by 
<br/>the terms of reference that is going to be provided for them to look in the scrutiny and oversight of 
<br/>the Bills.  But, when it comes to the vote, it goes back to the substantive Standing Committee to make 
<br/>the  vote.    From  that  way,  we  protect  the  numbers  from  both  from  the  Government  and  from  the 
<br/>Opposition  and  also  through  the  Standing  Orders,  you  may  find  that  we  are  very  careful  in  the 
<br/>provision of the terms of reference to ensure we do not go beyond the perimeters of where we should 
<br/>be confining ourselves to in terms of scrutiny and oversight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  to  allow the sub-Committee of Standing Committees to  do their  work but  without 
<br/>intruding, trespassing or going beyond what we are supposed to confine ourselves to, but ensuring 
<br/></span><span>that we are mindful of the perimeters of  existing  Government  policies  and more importantly, the 
<br/></span><span>legislations.  So those are the few things I wish to highlight, and I wish to thank each and every one 
<br/>of you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The result of this has come about through our great work and like I said earlier on in some of 
<br/>our meetings, when we are seated in this august Parliament, I only look to each and every one of you 
<br/>who have taken the oath to be represented in this Parliament under the Constitution and simply equal 
<br/>in  front  of  me,  the  Speaker,  by  being  Members  of  Parliament.    So,  when  we  leave  this  august 
<br/>Parliament and go out, we are all Members of Parliament, and when we travel together, we should 
<br/></span><span>show solidarity there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some of our overseas trips, in coming back. the way the protocol officers of Parliament 
<br/>organise their trips by going, is no problem.  We are all traveling as one, but into returning, some of 
<br/>us do not have any seats.  They had suggested to me, if they can fly to Sydney and back to Fiji.  I 
<br/>said no, “We travel as one, we come back as one.”  I think that is very important.  Then, we will be 
<br/>projecting the image that we are all equal here - 55 Members of Parliament, period, no more, no less.
