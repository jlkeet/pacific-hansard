<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Preservation of Levuka’s Historical Monuments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 72/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  work  that  has  been  undertaken  during  this  financial  year  to  preserve 
<br/>historical monuments in Levuka? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable  Kumar for the question. Earlier this 
<br/>year, we visited Levuka. We have looked at the heritage areas. We have a good discussions with 
<br/>stakeholders there in Levuka and from that discussions, we have formed a committee to review and 
<br/>have a look at the heritage sites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from this year’s operational budget of $19,000 and the rollover from 2022-
<br/>2023 and 2023-2024 was $1.5 million which happens to renovate the Levuka Community Centre. 
<br/>From the brief that  was  given to  me yesterday, it  should be completed by the end of this  month. 
<br/>Unfortunately, the funds is not enough to fully equip the Centre and we might need additional funds 
<br/>for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the Deed of Cession site, the first phase was supposed to be fencing and walkway 
<br/>and the second one was supposed to be the walls and the drainage, we decided to change it around, 
<br/>so do the walls and drainage first so that the foundation is compact before we carry out the fencing 
<br/>and the walkway. They have already got quotations for contractors. We have provided Levuka Town 
<br/>Councils $50,000 that we supposed to provide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has also reviewed the reports that was done after </span><span>TC Winston.</span><span> They have just 
<br/></span><span>picked those who urgently need the repair. Those ones will try and propose it for next year’s budget 
<br/>for funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>his response.  My only concern at this stage is that the honourable Minister has not been briefed very 
<br/>well.  That is why, perhaps, we are not able to carry on with the work because, again, you are forming 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>793 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a committee, discussions and we are not able to use the money allocated for the year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  work  had  already  started  with  the  Heritage  Architect.    We  have  only  one  heritage 
<br/>architect - Setoki is his name and I have forgotten the company, and he had already planned all the 
<br/>heritage sites and what needs to be done.  One had to use this $150,000 to continue with one activity 
<br/>at a time to complete that.  So, I just wanted to brief the honourable Minister so that he can pick it up 
<br/>from there and move on with the heritage works that we started.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- She is just briefing you, Sir, so we will rest it there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when UNESCO actually declares a particular site as a 
<br/>World Heritage Site, one of the conditions attached to it is that you must have a buffer zone.  So, in 
<br/>your work that you are currently doing, honourable Minister, are you also ensuring because what it 
<br/>is,  is  these  sites  are  outstanding  universal  value.    That  is  why  we  have  these  buffer  zones.    My 
<br/>question really is, when you do this particular work, are you also ensuring that the buffer zone is 
<br/>protected and looked after so that we are in compliance with the UNESCO requirements?  Because 
<br/>these things, if not done, we may lose the status of World Heritage Listing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reports that I received from the new team, they have 
<br/>highlighted the issue about the buffer zone that needs to be addressed.  I have been briefed on that 
<br/>one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Forgive me for my ignorance on this issue, honourable Minister, 
<br/>but is the old Levuka Hospital part of the heritage?  Because it is an eyesore and this has been raised 
<br/>continuously  by  the  Lomaiviti  Provincial  Council,  especially  the  </span><span>Mata  ni  Tikina</span><span>  from  Levuka 
<br/>Vakaviti. So, what is the plan about the Levuka Hospital, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Yes,  it  is  under  the  heritage  site.    In  our  discussions  yesterday,  I  have 
<br/>directed the Board for National Trust to have a look at the buildings there at the hospital.  Those that 
<br/>cannot be repaired, if they can recommend that for condemnation so that they can write to Levuka 
<br/>Town Council and advise them that those buildings, you cannot do any more thing about it when I 
<br/>looked at it.  It is just an eyesore, you are correct. We just have to condemn then we clear it.  If they 
<br/>need  to  build  another  building  there,  then  they  have  to  follow  the  structure  that  is  out  there,  that 
<br/>should be followed and be in line with the heritage recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  Being a military engineer, he knows his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>area of the woods very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Volunteer Service &amp; School Employment Exposure Programme  
<br/>(Question No. 73/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on the Fiji Volunteer Service established under the National Employment 
<br/></span><span>Centre Act 2009 and the joint School Employment Exposure Programme (SEEP)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I wish to thank the honourable Assistant Minister for 
<br/>the  question.    The  Volunteer  Service  was  established  under  Part  10  of  the  National  Employment 
<br/>Centre Act 2009, to promote a strong sense of service and civic pride amongst the people of the Fiji 
<br/>Islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, volunteering is considered one of the best and productive means or forms 
<br/>of personal and professional development, richly adding value to society in the most cost-effective 
<br/>and  caring  ways  through  contribution  of  effort,  skills  and  time  in  charitable  ventures  and 
<br/>humanitarian assistance to the less fortunate people in society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Only yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, did we hear from the honourable Minister for Youth and 
<br/>Sports regarding the various activities our youth are going to get into. We have in the past, had our 
<br/>Boys Scouts, Girl Guides, St. Johns, and so many others, Duke of Edinburgh, all these were very 
<br/>good training and development programmes for our youth. Somewhere along the line, we kind of 
<br/>lost them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it has now additionally become a means of training and entry into the job market of our 
<br/>new  graduates  as  well.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  scheme,  last  year  a  total  of  111  graduate 
<br/>volunteers were engaged with the local employers, including Government Ministries.  For the current 
<br/>financial year, a total of 122 graduate employees are engaged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry also reviewed the volunteer allowance from the previous $120 
<br/>per week. As an incentive to support volunteerism where graduate volunteers are now paid a weekly 
<br/>allowance of $180. And out of this, 50 percent or $90 is paid by the host employer and the balance 
<br/>is paid by the Ministry. So that is for graduates or those who are degree holders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  attachment  for  certificate  levels  and  diploma  levels  are  now  paid  $150  per  week 
<br/>compared to the previous $100 per week where 50 percent again is paid by the host employer and 
<br/>the other 50 percent paid by the Ministry.  A large number of employers are able to benefit from this 
<br/>and it is mutual where new graduates are able to acquire training attachments and at the end of that 
<br/>there are those that are actually employed fulltime by the same employer and the period is between 
<br/>three to six months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other scheme is the Student Employment Exposure Programme (SEEP).  
<br/>It is spearheaded through smooth transition of students from schools into the world of work, into 
<br/>decent jobs and employment growth, based on students’ subject combination, skills and potentials in 
<br/>line with their interests.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  SEEP  programme  was  initially  launched  in  November  2018  in  the 
<br/>Central Division before it was launched in the West and later in the North in 2019.  This Programme 
<br/>was later shelved following the onset of COVID in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  whole  practical  exercise  is  an  early  intervention  for  students  to 
<br/>experience work readiness and to help students nurture their employability skills needed in any work 
<br/>environment. This is highlighted in the National Employment Policy - Policy Priority Number One: 
<br/>to create more opportunities for young people aged 15 years to 24 years to follow clear pathways 
<br/>from education to employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The objective is for education and training providers to have a closer link with employers, 
<br/>and  I  firmly  believe  that  the  SEEP  programme  will  go  a  long  way  towards  fulfilling  the  policy 
<br/></span><span>priority. The opportunity will provide hands-on experience in the world of work and allow students 
<br/></span><span>the opportunity to make decisions on their career pathways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 28 secondary schools in the Central Division participated in this 
<br/>year’s programme, with a total of 163 Year 11 students.  For the first time, we have schools from 
<br/>rural  areas,  including  Waidina  Secondary  School  and  Wainimala  Secondary  School  from  the 
<br/>Province of Naitasir,i and Nuku Secondary School from the Province of Serua.  These students, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>795 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were hosted by 12 private organisations and eight Government Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for schools in the Central Division that missed out, my Ministry intends to 
<br/>continue this collaboration in the next school holiday with other schools in the West before moving 
<br/>to the North.  When these students are attached to these workplaces, they are paid a small pocket 
<br/>allowance of $20 a day and their bus fares are taken care of by the Ministry of Education through the 
<br/>topping up their cards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  acknowledge  our  partners  from  the  Ministry  of  Education,  the 
<br/>International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation (FCEF) 
<br/>for this collaboration, which could bridge the gaps between the education system and our world of 
<br/>work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable 
<br/>Minister brief and share with this august Parliament what was the response and the feedback on the 
<br/>shift from schools that participated - the students and the employers that engaged them during the 
<br/>two weeks holiday? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and again I wish to thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>the question.  The feedback that we have received from the Ministry of Education and other social 
<br/>partners including the ILO and Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation has been overwhelming 
<br/>with positive feedback.  My team has been inundated with queries on why other schools missed out 
<br/>and when will be the next round. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  feedback  from  our  team,  students  participated  have  actually  shown 
<br/>remarkable adaptability and enthusiasm diving into the new work environment, for instance, we had 
<br/>science students from various schools who initially were apprehensive about working in non-science 
<br/>settings such as administrative office or retail outlets.  However, once immersed in the environment, 
<br/>very quickly they adapted and showcased their soft skills  such as  communication,  teamwork and 
<br/>problem-solving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  students  with  backgrounds  in  agriculture  surprised  us  with  their  versatility  and 
<br/>willingness to learn the embraced opportunities to work in the diverse sectors including hospitality 
<br/>and  customer  service  where  they  effectively  apply  their  knowledge  and  sustainable  practices  and 
<br/>agriculture  practices  to  their  roles.    For  example,  we  had  students  from  agricultural  background 
<br/>excelled in roles that require them to educate customers about organic produce or assist in garden 
<br/>maintenance at resorts.  There are numerous other examples of that nature, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  BPO  sector,  it  is  an  evolving  industry  and  has  been  particularly  encouraging.    The 
<br/>company  has  provided  the  students  with  exposure  to  a  dynamic  and  technology-driven  work 
<br/>environment.  Despite being unfamiliar with the industry, students quickly adapted to tasks such as 
<br/>data entry, customer support and digital marketing.   Their eagerness to learn and adapt to newer 
<br/>technologies impressed employers demonstrating their potential to excel in this emerging industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary, the SEEP initiative has provided the students with valuable 
<br/></span><span>opportunity to develop and showcase their soft skills regardless of their academic backgrounds.  Their 
<br/></span><span>involvement  in  diverse  industries  highlight  their  adaptability  and  readiness  to  embrace  new 
<br/>challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  feedback  from  employers  that  hosted  them  during  the  school  holidays 
<br/>praised these students for their dedication and I must acknowledge all the organisations, including 
<br/>Government Ministries that hosted these students.  Employers were excited about the programme 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and look forward to assisting students in engaging them in the upcoming holidays.  They were also 
<br/>to pay students additional allowances as part of the two-week performance assessment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, this programme, as I have stated earlier, is going to be an ongoing one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because of the success that we have noted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>explanation of the National  Volunteer Service.   I was listening and  I hear that the volunteers  are 
<br/>continuing to do their diplomas, people with diplomas and degrees.  I am just wondering about those 
<br/>that do not rise to that level of qualification. There are a lot of people who do certificates in trade, 
<br/>people do in dance and other things like music.  Is there any thought from the Ministry to grow this 
<br/>volunteer service not just for the people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think a lot of people who do straight office type jobs.  They are the ones who do the diplomas 
<br/>and degrees, and they are getting into the service but is there any thought about those others who do 
<br/>not have the opportunity to do diplomas and degrees. They attend a lot of these schools around the 
<br/>place, some of them are registered under the Fiji Higher Education Commission. Is there any scope 
<br/>to also give these people the opportunity under the Fiji Volunteer Scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question.  I may have missed, my apology.  The Certificate holders are included with the Diploma 
<br/>holders. The others is food for thought that we could take into consideration.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before, I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I thank 
<br/>you for your replies honourable Minister.  But I detect that there are some  similarities in the way 
<br/>supplementary questions are being raised, I mean, the questions and the answers.  It is beginning to 
<br/>look like what was displayed by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and honourable Ratu Niudamu 
<br/>because when he read out his reply to the supplementary question which is just to elucidate, he went 
<br/>on to about three or four pages.  Yes, just a comment on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Minister on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fiji Volunteer Service.  I know that when this was established, there was a National Register.    
<br/>Then  for  those  who  are  not  particularly  close  to  the  main  centres,  they  had  problems  in  getting 
<br/>registered in the National Register.  Has that changed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for 
<br/>the question.  All the officers of the Ministry nationwide are able to register.  So they can go to any 
<br/>of our offices  and register and we are now digitising the whole process to be able to get them to 
<br/>register online as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  I  really  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  this  Voluntary 
<br/>Programme and it is crucial that the programme is thoroughly evaluated, to ensure that it delivers the 
<br/>practical  benefit  without  compromising  the  overall  learning  experience.    My  question  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister; since you said that it is going to be ongoing, do you get them to register into 
<br/>the Voluntary FNPF Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question or more like a suggestion, that initiative is now under discussion, Sir.
