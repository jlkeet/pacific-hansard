<h3>CONVENTION ON CYBERCRIME</h3>
<div><span>CONVENTION ON CYBERCRIME 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that for the purposes of Section 51 of the 
<br/>Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 130(4): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament approves the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
<br/>Defence tabled its report on the review of the Convention on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, noting full support for 
<br/>Fiji to accede to the Convention.  As a matter of background, the Convention of Cybercrime, also 
<br/>known as the Budapest Convention, was tabled in this august Parliament on 1</span><span>st</span><span> September, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  that  Parliament  dissolved  in  October  that  year,  the  work  on  the  report  could  not 
<br/>progress.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
<br/>and Defence and all those involved in the process.  We assure the work was progressed with further 
<br/>tremendous work, and finalising and tabling of the report on the review of the Budapest Convention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The use of cybercrime is no longer an emerging issue, but rather it is one of the ways in 
<br/>which criminal offences are committed.  It is evident that technology advances at a rapid rate.  Online 
<br/>platforms and e-transactions are norm of the society, with daily communication and the provision of 
<br/>services.  This extends to matter before the courts and our laws.  It is in this light that being part of a 
<br/>bigger network becomes essential a country like Fiji with our limited resources and expertise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cybercrime Act 2021 was enacted in February 2021, but for one section, 
<br/>commenced on 14</span><span>th</span><span> November 2022.  Prior to this, the Crimes Act 2009 was the only law that dealt 
<br/>with  computer  offences,  the  provision  of  which  was  no  longer  sufficient  to  accommodate  the 
<br/>evolving the nature of computer offences and computer related offence committed worldwide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cybercrime  offence  are  transboundary  offences.  By  this,  I  mean  that  with  the  use  of  a 
<br/>technology or computer system an individual may be able to hack into a computer system that is in 
<br/>another country and causes the serious inclusion across jurisdictions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cybercrime offence in fact are now in strategically part of the other traditional transboundary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offences such as trafficking of persons and of illicit drugs, to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to provide in this august Parliament the type of offences that is currently been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dealt by the Fiji Police Force:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Complaint on dishonest obtaining or dealing in personal financial information; 
<br/>Unauthorised modification or restricted data held in computer; 
<br/>Traffic in obscene publications; and 
<br/>Phonography activities or explicit presentation of sexual activity in images or in writing 
<br/>involve a juveniles posting an intimate visual recording and closing up by posting electronic 
<br/>communication.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We see here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nature of the offences now and what we can anticipate in 
<br/>the future. What is alarming is the need to educate and advocate for sensible online behaviour and 
<br/>practices. This is not purely a matter for criminal law. In this one that requires everyone’s effort in 
<br/>combating cyber and related offences. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>799 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can start, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by being part of a bigger network of countries whose progress 
<br/>is based upon actual ex-prisoners and assistance received from bigger pool of expertise and resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Article 39 of the Convention provides for the purpose of present Convention 
<br/>is to supplement applicable multilateral and bilateral treaties or arrangement as between the parties, 
<br/>including the provision of: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>European Convention on Extradition; 
<br/>European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matters; and 
<br/>The  additional Protocol to the  European Convention  on Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
<br/>Matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provides for a substantive criminal offences, procedural 
<br/>measures and international corporation provision requires for its member States to domesticates. To 
<br/>become a member of a Convention entails the following advantages for Fiji has highlighted in the 
<br/>Report: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Convention provides a legal framework for cyber offences. 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>It creates a harmonised effect on similar offences across member State jurisdiction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter  2  of  the  Convention  in  particular  provides  general  and  specific  provisions  for 
<br/>International Corporation amongst members States. Not only with respect to Cybercrime offences 
<br/>and again by means of computer but with respect to crime involving electronic devices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Partisan Convention engaged with each other in trusted and efficient corporation which will 
<br/>benefit  Smaller  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS)  like  Fiji  in  terms  of  capacity  building  and 
<br/>international engagement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It promotes effective and efficient communication, detection, investigation and prosecution 
<br/>of perpetrators of cyber related offences both nationally and internationally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  promotes  corporation  between  the  private  sector  and  criminal  justice  authorities  for 
<br/>members  of  the  Convention.  It  gives  that  member  the  need  to  have  a  domestic  legal 
<br/>framework on Cybercrime and electronic evidence in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  mentioned  the  Cybercrime  Act  2021  commenced  on  the  14</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>November, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another, it provide access to capacity building programmes, technical assistance is necessary 
<br/>to  facilitate  a  full  implementation  of  the  Convention  and  to  enhance  the  ability  to  corporate 
<br/>internationally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji as a member State we also participate in the negotiation of future instruments and for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>evolution of the Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Article 37 of the Convention, provides </span><span>inter alia</span><span> that in respect of any State 
<br/></span><span>acceding to the Convention, that Convention antic to force on the first day of the month following 
<br/>the expiration for a period of three months after the date of deposit of the instrument accession with 
<br/>the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Subject  to  Parliamentary  approval,  proper  steps  will  be  taken  to  ensure  the  instrument  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accession will be deposited in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.

<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have come a long way in our preparation, advocacy and 
<br/>awareness measures particularly with the line Ministry, the Ministry of Communication to reach this 
<br/>stage we can assess for our cybercrime offenses need to be tackled with the proper understanding, 
<br/>framework, planning and resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  is  ready.  It  is  recommended  that  Fiji  accedes  to  the  Convention  on 
<br/>Cybercrime,  and  I  strongly  urge  Members  of  Parliament  to  support  the  motion.  Thank  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before I offer the floor, I have a list of speakers from the Whips.  The batting will be led off by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Premila Kumar;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-opertatives and Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Faiyaz Koya;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Viliame Naupoto; and rounded off by  
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development,  and  Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion that Fiji accedes to the Budapest 
<br/>Convention on Cybercrime, and I thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense for guiding 
<br/>Parliament with their very comprehensive Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our lives revolve around computers, laptops, smartphones and many other 
<br/>technologies  that  are  available  in  the  market.    We  spend  more  time  online  in  our  social  and 
<br/>professional world. We shop, work, bank, conduct financial transactions, play, and access various 
<br/>services that are available online.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Governments  around the world  are  also  moving their services online for  convenience and 
<br/>efficiency.  We  have  seen  nations  moving  towards  cashless  society.    With  such  convenience,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  comes  the  increasing  threat  of  cybercrime  to  consumers,  businesses,  and  even 
<br/>governments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the beginning of 2023, 87.7 percent of Fiji’s population were active online 
<br/>users, 59 percent of Fiji’s population are social media users, and 1.28 million mobile connections are 
<br/>active online. These numbers must have increased by now because we are in 2024, and the mobile 
<br/>user number if you look at it, it is more than our population, so it is quite big.  That means people 
<br/>have smart phone in the palm of their hand and they can use this anytime anywhere, to conduct any 
<br/>financial transaction, or to do anything they want to with that phone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is no wonder that so many people are affected by cybercrimes, causing 
<br/>consumers and business owners immense financial, emotional distress, and psychological harm.  Fiji, 
<br/>like many other developing countries, is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and harmful online activities 
<br/></span><span>such as cyberbullying, online shouting, harassment, stalking, as well as the use of internet for criminal 
<br/></span><span>activities such as romance scams, and financial and investment scams, to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, according to the Global State of Scams Report 2023, because scam is so common in 
<br/>Fiji, the financial loss due to scams amounts to a staggering $1 trillion, equivalent to 1 percent of the 
<br/>global  GDP  and  only  7  percent  of  the  victims  recover  their  lost  funds,  that  is  what  I  want  to 
<br/>emphasize.  Only 7 percent are able to recover their funds, that means all other money goes into the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>801 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>into the hands of criminals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one is immune to online crimes, and we are well versed with the most 
<br/>recent eBay scam in Fiji, costing unsuspecting consumers more than $3.6 million. The recovery of 
<br/>lost fund remains a problem for Fiji Consumers, just like what we have seen globally, and equally 
<br/>disappointing is the pace at which perpetrators are punished for swindling Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have assisted many victims of cybercrime in my previous role as the CEO 
<br/>of  the  Consumer  Council.  I  have  seen  helpless  victims  knocking  on  the  doors  of  agencies  for 
<br/>assistance to recover their lost fund, and even those victims who were used as money-mule in money 
<br/>laundering activities.  At that time, Fiji had no mechanism in place to assist the victims. We were at 
<br/>the mercy of the banks, asking the banks if they can assist, but there was no other way to help the 
<br/>victims. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that the economic cost of cybercrime is huge. Cybercrime makes 
<br/>more  money  when  compared  to  the  national  economy.  It  is  estimated  that  cybercrime  will  make 
<br/>around $10 trillion by 2025.  No wonder a single nation cannot fight the crime in isolation!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rise in cybercrime is an issue that knows no borders and spares no nation.  
<br/>We need a collective effort to fight this crime.  It is for this reason that we must ratify the Budapest 
<br/>Convention for international cooperation.  All big mighty companies, such as Facebook, You Tube, 
<br/>Instagram, Tik Tok,</span><span> </span><span>you name it, are all housed in America.  For a small country like ours, it will be 
<br/>difficult to collect electronic evidence without this global co-operation.  It is a bitter truth that much 
<br/>of our critical data and infrastructure resides in private hands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, embracing an international framework, like the Budapest Convention, not 
<br/>only strengthens our cybersecurity capabilities but also integrates us into a global network dedicated 
<br/>to combating cybercrimes.  The FijiFirst Government has put in place several measures to combat 
<br/>cybercrime, for example, the Online Safety Act 2018 and Cybercrime Act 2021.  So, Fiji is already 
<br/>ahead, even without acceding to Budapest Convention.  Ratifying this Convention will only help Fiji 
<br/>improve its current legislation to international standards, if it is not already done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits of ratifying the Budapest Convention open the door to capacity 
<br/>building initiative. It will equip our law enforcement agencies with technical expertise and tools for 
<br/>investigation and prosecution, and Fiji can be part of evidence-sharing mechanism.  Being a party to 
<br/>this Convention will also give access to a global network of experts to ensure justice is swift and 
<br/>certain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard from honourable Kamikamica this morning about connecting the unconnected 
<br/>and giving our people equal opportunity to access digital space.  The more people come online, the 
<br/>crime becomes bigger and bigger and with the amount of money criminals collect, they become more 
<br/>smarter, and they can invest in more tools to counteract what the countries try and put to protect its 
<br/>people.  So, this is the fight between most powerful people, whether it is the technology providers or 
<br/>the criminals, against a country with only limited amount of funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budapest  Convention  will  definitely  create  a  safer  and  more  secure 
<br/></span><span>digital space for consumers and businesses, therefore, I recommend and support the motion before 
<br/>Parliament, and  I sincerely  hope that we are able to  move on with  this Convention very quickly.  
<br/>There has been a huge delay, it was quite disappointing.  The honourable Attorney-General has been 
<br/>talking  about  efficiency,  Sir,  and  I  hope  he  should  have  been  more  efficient  for  this  particular 
<br/>convention because it is so much needed right now. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in full support of the motion tabled 
<br/>by  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Justice,  that  Parliament  approves  the  Fiji’s 
<br/>accession  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  or  most  commonly  referred  to  as  the  Budapest 
<br/>Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  bolstering  cyber-security  posture,  including  combating  cybercrime,  is 
<br/>paramount  as  we  move  into  a  more  integrated  digital  economy.    In  order  to  effectively  do  this, 
<br/>enhancing global cooperation is needed and the Convention on Cybercrime plays a tangible role in 
<br/>addressing the complexities of cybercrime and electronic evidence, a domain that knows no borders 
<br/>in reach and impact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Convention applies to any crime committed via the internet and any 
<br/>other  computer  network,  dealing  particularly  with  infringement  of  copyrights,  computer-related 
<br/>fraud, child pornography and violations of network security.  Any crime that has electronic evidence, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, be it a text message, email, CCTV footage, audio, IP Address or call log, can benefit 
<br/>from the SWIFT International Corporation provisions of the Budapest Convention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament’s endorsement of the Fiji accession to the Budapest Convention 
<br/>further signifies our global commitment to ensuring a safe and secure cyberspace for our people.   Sir, 
<br/>I  would  like  to  share  some  statistics  on  the  cyber  threat  landscape  which  demonstrates  why  this 
<br/>motion needs to be supported by all honourable Members in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Security  Outlook  Report  2023-2024  highlighted  that  the  activity  of 
<br/>cybercriminals and State-sponsored threat actors have increased globally, and the direct and indirect 
<br/>targeting of Pacific individuals, businesses, e-commerce systems and government systems remain a 
<br/>threat.  It mentions the three most important cyber threats in the region were phishing, ransomware 
<br/>and malware attacks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The earlier edition of the Report of 2022-2023 provide examples of the increased of cyber-
<br/>attacks in the region, namely, in one of the region’s largest ever cyber-attacks.  Papua New Guinea’s 
<br/>Ministry of Finance Government pay system was targeted by ransomware of cyberattack in October 
<br/>2021.  Criminals attacked the Department of Finance’s Integrated Financial Management System, 
<br/>seeking a payment in bitcoin for restoration of services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, Australia was affected by ransomware attack on a critical emergency, surgical and 
<br/>other  healthcare  services.    In  March  2022,  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands’  National 
<br/>Telecommunications  Authority  experienced  major  distributed  denial  of  services  cyber-attack  that 
<br/>disrupted internet for about 10 days.  Furthermore, the World Economic Forum, in its Global Risks 
<br/>Report  2024  stated,  that  out  of  the  10  risks  within  a  two-year  projection,  cyber  insecurity  is  the 
<br/>number four global threat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Microsoft  estimates  that  the  global  impact  of  cyberattacks  is  predicted  to  reach  over  $10 
<br/>billion  per  annum  by  next  year.    These  are  further  exacerbated  by  the  shortage  of  the  necessary 
<br/>workforce. This is the reality that we are facing,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, but it is not bleak, if we work 
<br/>together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are putting together the necessary foundational elements and working 
<br/>closely  with  the  many  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  we  are  in  a  position  to  combat  these  new  and 
<br/>emerging threats.  This cannot be handled alone by one Ministry, it cannot be handled alone by the 
<br/>Government, it requires all of us.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>803 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within  Government  we  are  strengthening  areas  of  collaboration  between  Ministries  and 
<br/>partner agencies and ensuring that we are building capacity amongst relevant stakeholders.  This is 
<br/>to ensure that we are not duplicating work, and we are streamlining and leveraging existing regional 
<br/>and global efforts.  All of these adds up to the many layers of protection and resilience that we need, 
<br/>to ensure a more sustainable digital economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would now like to turn briefly to outline our efforts in preparing to accede to and become a 
<br/>party to the Budapest Convention.  We have partnered with the Council of Europe in this journey, 
<br/>from our Cybersecurity Crime Act that is aligned to the Budapest Convention, to enhancing capacity 
<br/>of our criminal justice authorities and partners on electronic evidence and fostering collaboration on 
<br/>the 24/7 Network. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an observer, Fiji joins the 72 Parties to the Convention, the 20 Observer 
<br/>countries and other like-minded countries in harmonising our laws, to ensure prompt and efficient 
<br/>international cooperation to criminalise and prosecute cyber offences.  One key action item for Fiji 
<br/>is the designation of the 24/7 Network POC.  We have been focusing our efforts on ensuring that this 
<br/>is done properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  support  of  the  Council  of  Europe,  we  have  been  holding  numerous  interagency 
<br/>sessions to deepen our understanding on the 24/7 Network POC, and in order to collectively identify 
<br/>the competent national 24/7 Network POC, which is a requirement of the Budapest Convention and 
<br/>the Cybercrime Act.  The interagency 24/7 Network POC stakeholders included the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Police Force; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Office of the Attorney-General; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption; 
<br/>Fiji Intelligence Unit; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of the 24/7 Network POC sessions with other countries and better understanding 
<br/>the models that they were using and operating, this has enabled the Interagency Committee to be able 
<br/>to collectively identify which agencies are best equipped to become part of the network.  The POC 
<br/>is to provide immediate assistance for the purpose of investigations of cybercrimes or the collection 
<br/>of electronic evidence of cybercrime for any of the Budapest Convention Signatory States and is the 
<br/>focal point to request for the same type of assistance from any of our Budapest Convention State 
<br/>members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tangible benefit of being part of the 24/7 Network was shared by one of 
<br/>the  member  countries  where  previously,  it  would  take  three  months  to  process  a  request  from  a 
<br/>different country to preserve electronic evidence through the usual diplomatic process.  Under the 
<br/>24/7 Network, the timeline was shortened to five days for a similar request.  This was due to the 
<br/>immediate response afforded under the 24/7 Network.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will give much needed boost to the capabilities of our law enforcement 
<br/>and prosecution agencies and, therefore, similar to other State members to the Convention, our 24/7 
<br/>Network POC will be the Fiji Police Force and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We 
<br/>are finalising this legal designation with the Office of the Attorney-General.

<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had earlier referred to the work that is being done to build capacity across 
<br/>our different agencies.  The Government has facilitated dedicated capacity, building workshops for 
<br/>criminal  justice  authorities,  including  the  judiciary,  prosecution,  law  enforcement  and  policy 
<br/>agencies, as we continue to prioritise these efforts.  We are building capacities that are sustainable, 
<br/>such  as  the  Train  the  Trainer  initiatives  in  the  design  and  development  of  electronic  evidence 
<br/>curriculum for the first responders, such as our Police Officers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, additional dedicated workshops, sessions and conferences are being planned 
<br/>for  the  prosecution,  judiciary,  law  enforcement  and  the  Ministries,  according  to  their  identified 
<br/>priorities.  These will be done under the Council of Europe’s capacity building programme, known 
<br/>as Global Action on Cybercrime Extended (GLACY-e) initiative, whereby Fiji as an observer, is the 
<br/>only Pacific recipient to benefit from this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are already seeing this cooperation in action with electronic evidence workshops for the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force Officials, that was successfully conducted earlier this year.  Next month, the Office 
<br/>of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be convening a national conference on cybercrime and e-
<br/>evidence for prosecutors, which is also being supported under the GLACY-e programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for capacity building, it is not necessarily about the number of workshops 
<br/>or seminars that are organised.  It is about providing the appropriate resources to the right agency 
<br/>that  has  the  expertise  and  mandate  to  carry  out  a  task  successfully,  and  that  is  the  focus  of  our 
<br/>international partnerships. For example, in December 2023, in partnership with the World Bank and 
<br/>the Korean Internet and Security Agency, the Ministry organised a workshop which was attended by 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  on  bolstering  our  cybersecurity  efforts  for  critical  information  and 
<br/>infrastructure, including Government infrastructure.  We have also closed the tender for the holistic 
<br/>review of the Department of ITC Services that will work with partners to bolster the capabilities of 
<br/>the agency that looks after Government networks and systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is an active contributor to the ICT regional and international forums, 
<br/>notwithstanding our constrained resources and we have seen the value in progressing our national 
<br/>and common priorities, which ultimately shapes ICT development.  Last year, alongside my fellow 
<br/>ICT Ministers, we convened to discuss the common challenges and opportunities that existed.  This 
<br/>resulted  in  the  signing  of  the  </span><span>Lagatoi  Declaration</span><span>,  which  outlined  six  priorities,  including 
<br/>cybersecurity. This  builds  on the 2050 Strategy  for the Blue Pacific Continent  and the 2018 Boe 
<br/>Declaration.  Fiji  also  hosted  the  Inaugural  Pacific  Cyber  Security  Capacity  Building  and 
<br/>Coordination Conference last October that provided a platform for the region to discuss the status 
<br/>and roadmap for cybersecurity capacity building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you can recall, as mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister, the highlight 
<br/>as well of our efforts was the signing of the MOU between the honourable Prime Minister and the 
<br/>Prime  Minister  of  Australia  on  cybersecurity.  This  demonstrates  the  priority  that  Government 
<br/>attaches  to  this,  with  the  laser  focus  on  bolstering  cybersecurity  through  a  dedicated  strategy  of 
<br/>policies, human resourcing, national search co-operation and online safety efforts.  The Ambassador 
<br/>for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology has already commenced discussions on an implementation 
<br/>plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Fiji is also actively participating at the United Nations Open Ended Working 
<br/>Group in the development of ICT in the context of international security, or commonly known as the 
<br/>OEWG, which is the only UN forum on cybersecurity and norms of responsible state behaviour in 
<br/>the cyberspace.

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>805 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our longstanding partner, the Council of Europe, is standing ready to provide 
<br/>further workshops and awareness sessions, including our legislature.  It is important that as Members 
<br/>of Parliament, we are briefed on how the Convention functions with the evolving threat landscape 
<br/>and the malicious use of technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  short  answer  is  that,  approximately  23  years  since  the  Convention  was  opened  for 
<br/>signature, the Budapest Convention is still the only international treaty on this topic, and it is still 
<br/>applicable as it was drafted to be technology-neutral and there are guidance notes for member States 
<br/>that are released to address evolving threats, such as ransomware and malware.  There are also two 
<br/>new  Protocols  to  the  Convention.  Fiji  can  explore  these  Protocols,  once  we  have  acceded  to  the 
<br/>Budapest Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge all honourable Members to support this motion in recognising the Budapest Convention 
<br/>as it is pivotal in safeguarding our nation and the region against evolving threats.  I thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to say ‘thank you’ to the 
<br/>Committee for a very comprehensive Report that has been put before us.  This Report coming to us 
<br/>has been long overdue, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee have recommended that we ratify the Convention without 
<br/>reservations.  Of course, it has our support in making sure that this is done.  I had mentioned earlier 
<br/>this morning, Sir, that in Fiji, we are in a particular position in the region where we are one of the 
<br/>most developed economies in the Pacific in terms of ICT and ICT infrastructure, and we spoke about 
<br/>it this morning.  We actually have a global ranking, and we are placed 107 out of 176 odd nations in 
<br/>ICT Development Index.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, what that effectively means is that it puts us in a different space, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>When I say different space, it is not actually just a good space, it is also the space that needs nurturing, 
<br/>it means looking after, et cetera, and this helps us in terms of cybersecurity.  As I have said earlier 
<br/>on this morning, Sir, the studies along the region have said that by doing all of these, by having more 
<br/>increased connectivity, et cetera, we are also at risk in terms of cybersecurity and the region is also 
<br/>at  risk,  and  the  potential  to  cause  a  lot  of  harm  whether  it  is  financial  or  unauthorized  access  to 
<br/>banking, et cetera, as well as harm to the wellbeing of our citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are few things that need to be spelt out and I think in the Report, you will see that the 
<br/>Fiji  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  (FFIU)  has  actually  reported  that  some  $90,000  was  lost  due  to 
<br/>cybercrime and this is where Fijians were sending money across to, I think, somewhere in Africa. 
<br/>So, it has a big bearing on us, Sir, it is very important for us to ratify this particular Convention.  
<br/>What it does also, it provides a legal framework for international cooperation for us and in terms of 
<br/>cybercrime and electronic evidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to relay (it is actually in the Report, it is good to read this, and 
<br/>everyone  should  read  this)  the  experience  that  they  had  in  Tonga.    Tonga  adopted  its  Computer 
<br/>Crimes Act 2019 and it covered all of the provisions in the Budapest Convention.  Tonga requested 
<br/></span><span>accession to the Budapest Convention in 2017 and then it became a party, so they beat us to it.  But 
<br/></span><span>following the request, Sir, Tonga immediately became a priority country for the Global Action on 
<br/>Cybercrime  (GLACY)  and  it  extended  to  Global  Action  on  Cybercrime  Extended  (GLACY  +) 
<br/>Project, a joint project with the European Union. So, you can see the benefits that can be derived out 
<br/>of us acceding to this particular Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>806 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  whole  host  of  recommendations  that  have  been  given  by  the 
<br/>Committee.  The kind of cybercrimes and we are all aware of it, but I think we need reminding, is in 
<br/>terms of ATM scheming that is happening, email spoofing, business emails being compromised, et 
<br/>cetera, that is now a part of the landscape of ICT.  So, we have to deal with it so by adhering to and 
<br/>actually acceding to the actual Convention, we are doing something that is good for all Fijians.  The 
<br/>figure that I was talking about earlier with respect to people sending money to Benin in Africa is 
<br/>$98,658 lost because of cybercrime.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Deputy Prime and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives 
<br/>and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has also mentioned about PIFS being very 
<br/>supportive and I think the Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the Declaration also recognise 
<br/>the challenges that have been posed by this.  This is phenomenal for the security of our people, Sir, 
<br/>and it is a critical infrastructure, it is also a protection of data and information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  international  convention,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ratifying  this Convention  can  only 
<br/>enhance Fiji’s ability to combat cybercrime through international cooperation.  It actually could lead 
<br/>to  more  effective  prevention  and  of  actual  prosecution  of  cybercrime.    I  will  just  speak  on  the 
<br/>prosecution  part  in  just  a  few  minutes,  Sir,  but  it  also  helps  us  in  terms  of  capacity  building.    It 
<br/>actually could provide access for technical assistance and training programmes and strengthening our 
<br/>response to cybercrime.  It will actually provide the comprehensive legal framework for international 
<br/>cooperation on cybercrime.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  will  also  need  to  ensure  that  our  domestic  laws  and  amendments  are  in  place  and 
<br/>ratification  may  require  some  amendments  to  take  place,  and  I  think  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-
<br/>General will give very wise and are probably on to it already, in terms of the Cybercrime Act and 
<br/>also juveniles, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implications of these amendments can be farfetched and have very long tentacles, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. We have to really, really think about how we do it. And in doing these legislations, we 
<br/>have the ability to access our development partners in terms of how it can be done best for a better 
<br/>future for all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The resource allocation also, honourable Minister of Finance, in the next Budget, maybe we 
<br/>need to start looking into this also as more resources will be needed by the Ministry to ensure that 
<br/>we are compliant also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of education, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this is an area that we probably also need to 
<br/>ensure that there is a whole lot more public awareness. Awareness is important, eveyone is savvy in 
<br/>terms  of  being  able  to  use  these  things  and  I  am  going  to  say  something  that  maybe  is  not  very 
<br/>parliamentary, but when it actually goes all wonky and of order, no one knows what to do and how 
<br/>to get that justice again. So, it requires education at all levels and that very ICT network that we have 
<br/>can be used to ensure that we make sure that we educate all parts of our population, whether it is in 
<br/>the rural area or not, or it is actually in city-based places.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public  awareness,  as  I  have  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  campaigns  need  to  happen.  We  have 
<br/></span><span>phenomenal billboards around Fiji, and these are great ways to actually make public aware, and we 
<br/></span><span>have changing billboards, et cetera, that happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of gender-based violence, we have been speaking about it, there is 
<br/>a lot that actually happens, and I think Fiji also needs to pay heed and also pay attention to the fact 
<br/>that there is another convention - the Istanbul Convention, that deals with women, children and girls, 
<br/>et cetera, and this offers additional protections online for them. It is something that we probably need 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>807 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to fast-track, honourable Attorney General, and bring to the fore and see if we could actually accede 
<br/>that also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are emerging developments happening on a daily basis with respect to this particular 
<br/>area, there is a new UN Convention actually coming forth soon, and I understand the benefits of this 
<br/>Convention should be considered alongside the actual Convention that we are signing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to explain a little bit about the Istanbul Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It prevents 
<br/>violence, protects victims and it also ends the impunity of perpetrators, especially when it comes to 
<br/>women, and it is a form of violation of human rights, et cetera. Now this is something very important 
<br/>that  we  need  to  look  at  and  this  probably  needs  to  go  hand  in  hand  in  terms  of  us  ratifying  this 
<br/>particular  Convention.  I  think  on  28</span><span>th  </span><span>June,  2023,  the  European  Union  ratified  the  Istanbul 
<br/>Convention so it is something that we need to look at. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  in  all,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  it  is  a  good  thing  that  we  are  doing.    I  think  the 
<br/>recommendations that have come through from the Committee are very, very important and I think 
<br/>eveyone should make sure that they read the recommendations.  Most of all,  Sir, I think that what 
<br/>they have actually pointed out with respect to the recommendations is that the budgetary resources 
<br/>need to be allocated in trainings, advocacy, and they have spoken about the national laws, they have 
<br/>spoken about the roles and responsibility of the existing laws and they have also mentioned that we 
<br/>should anticipate the release of a new United Nations Convention on Counting the Use of Information 
<br/>and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are very important recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I think Parliament should 
<br/>be very aware of what these are and make sure they read up on it because it is important to us and I 
<br/>think this ratification will put us in a better space. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the time and I fully 
<br/>support it, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also rise in support of the motion that 
<br/>is before Parliament and I want to say ‘thank you’, on behalf of those of us in the Committee, to all 
<br/>the speakers who have spoken before me. I know that honourable Koya has pretty much covered the 
<br/>Report, but I also want to make mention that Fiji, like many developing nations, is confronted with 
<br/>an ever-evolving cyber landscape and we no longer function in isolation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the extreme effects of global cyber threats and 
<br/>attacks  on  critical  infrastructure,  including  e-government  infrastructure,  becoming  a  party  to  this 
<br/>Convention will enhance Fiji’s ability to combat cybercrime, as we have all heard today with the 
<br/>international  support  and  assistance  from  the  base  where  this  Convention  is  deposited.    This, 
<br/>especially, is in relation to continued capacity building to better equip Fiji’s criminal justice system, 
<br/>including the Judiciary, Prosecution and Law Enforcement Agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Undoubtedly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budapest  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  the  most 
<br/>comprehensive and coherent international agreement on cybercrime and electronic evidence to-date.  
<br/>Just  going  to  the  Report  from  the  Committee  on  page  15,  I  also  want  to  repeat  something  that 
<br/>honourable Koya mentioned that acceding to the Convention is not just in Fiji’s interest, but it is in 
<br/></span><span>the  region’s  interest  also  and  some  honourable  Members  may  not  realise  that  from  the  region, 
<br/></span><span>Australia and Tonga have acceded to the Convention already, while New Zealand and Vanuatu have 
<br/>been invited to accede, as Fiji has done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  has  strongly  recommended  that  Fiji  ratifies  the  Convention  without 
<br/>reservation, but I also wanted to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that apart from the main recommendations, 
<br/>there  are  other  recommendations  in  the  Report  that  need  consideration.    And  one  of  the  many 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>808 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations is for Fiji to consider other Conventions, as honourable Koya has mentioned, the 
<br/>Istanbul Convention to work hand in hand with the Budapest Convention because of the recognition 
<br/>of  online  gender-based  violence,  being  a  violation  of  a  woman’s  human  right.    So,  the  Budapest 
<br/>Convention will, indeed, help Fiji become a harder target for cybercrime and cyber criminals, and I 
<br/>have no reservation in recommending this motion before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, at the outset, I thank the Government 
<br/>through the honourable Attorney-General, for bringing this back to Parliament for approval.  It closes 
<br/>the loop in the process of treaties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Treaty  has  come  a  long  way.    It  started  by  the  previous  Government  -  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, in a different parliamentary term also and then it came to this Parliament under the new 
<br/>Government.  I understand the length it took, given that this Convention fell on to your lap and you 
<br/>have taken it on.  You have allocated this to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, 
<br/>we have come back, and the loop is now closed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are creating a little bit of history, in a sense that this is the first Treaty 
<br/>in this Parliament sitting that we have dealt with.  Normally, according to the Standing Orders, we 
<br/>learn on how we do this, as we go forward, if there are further treaties that will come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know a lot has been said by my colleagues that have spoken before, but 
<br/>there  is  no  doubt  that  the  cyber  space/cyber  domain  where  cyber  criminals  operate  is  man-made 
<br/>construct.    The  more  we  connect,  the  more  space  we  give  for  people  to  be  able  to  commit  those 
<br/>crimes through the cyberspace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may quote you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you spoke to us during that workshop in Nadi in 
<br/>May on the Regional Pacific Islands Parliamentary Workshop on Cyber Crime, you told us, and I 
<br/>quote;  “Our  vulnerability  to  cybercrime  increases  as  we  continually  move  towards  new  online 
<br/>technologies and services.”  You added that, “This is good, but it also comes with risks”.  And if you 
<br/>connect  your  statement  to  what  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  very  noble  move  to 
<br/>connect those that are unconnected is good for our people and apply what you have said, it means 
<br/>that  we  should  not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  as  we  connect,  we  extend  the  space  and  reach  for 
<br/>criminals to commit cybercrime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  cyberspace  dominates  an  influence,  as  mentioned  by  honourable 
<br/>Premila  Kumar,  and  some  of  our  speakers  who  have  spoken  before,  from  home,  to  schools, 
<br/>workplaces, and it is also on a much bigger scale influence the way we fight wars now.  It has headed 
<br/>on in the battle space, as in before, it is just the land, the sea, air and space but now, there is a battle 
<br/>space called the cyber battle space and we now have Military Units in developed countries that are 
<br/>formed just to prepare for that battle in the cyberspace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because  of  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  really  makes  very  good  sense  to  sign  up  to  this 
<br/>Convention - the only one that is there in the world right now, and partner with those that are at the 
<br/>forefront of this battle of fighting cybercrime.  I think that as a small nation with a small economy 
<br/>like ours, it is important and makes very good sense for us to sign up and partner with those countries 
<br/></span><span>that are very well developed, they have been through this and are at the forefront, as I have said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to conclude that as we connect, and we have heard that 
<br/>Google</span><span> </span><span>and Starlink are coming, and when we give them licence, they provide us with the cyberspace.  
<br/>I was just thinking of an idea that may be, for those who come and provide us with that, that perhaps 
<br/>there could be a levy or fee that we can charge them as part of their licence and that fee is used to 
<br/>advertise against cybercrime - little videos on television.  We saw one during a workshop, where they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>809 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did one in Samoa - advertisements on radio, billboards, and I am sure Google, Starlink and Vodafone, 
<br/>those that provide the spaces can perhaps, be levied and provide funds and we advertise this criminal 
<br/>activity that is happening in cyberspace. It is just an idea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the motion that is before Parliament. Thank you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.R.  VOCEA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  join  my  fellow  colleagues  and  rise  to  offer  my 
<br/>support  to  the  motion  that  is  before  Parliament  that  Fiji  ratifies  the  Budapest  Convention  on 
<br/>Cybercrime. So much has been said by those who have spoken before me, all supporting, willingness 
<br/>to join the effort that we are trying to discuss in Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did receive a lot of submisions as a Member of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence.    There  was  plethora  of  submissions  from  a  wide  range  of 
<br/>backgrounds,  including  Government  agencies,  regional  bodies,  Non-Government  Organisations 
<br/>(NGOs),  private  ICT  companies,  private  individuals,  Fiji  Financial  Intelligence  Unit,  Legal 
<br/>Practitioners,  et  cetera,  and  they  all  showed  their  support  for  Fiji  to  accede  to  this  Budapest 
<br/>Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  mention  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  I  was  part  of  the  Parliamentary 
<br/>delegation that you led attending the Regional Workshop on Cybercrime at the Tanoa Hotel in Nadi, 
<br/>as alluded to by honourable Naupoto, on 6</span><span>th</span><span> May to 7</span><span>th</span><span> May.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During that workshop, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we really learned from experiences across the Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the effect of cybercrime in their various jurisdictions and domain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outgoing Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Mr. Henry Puna, also briefed 
<br/>the participants about PIFS’s stance about the cybercrime in the region.  PIFS has highlighted in its 
<br/>submission that they want the region to be a hard target for cyber criminals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  PIFS  in  their  2015  Strategy  for  Blue  Pacific  Continent  in  the  </span><span>BOE 
<br/>Declaration</span><span>, recognises the challenge posed by cyber criminals and the importance of cyber security 
<br/>across the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think honourable Koya has touched on the gender analysis.  If Fiji decides to accede or ratify 
<br/>the  Convention,  then  we  urge  that  Fiji  integrates  a  gender  perspective  in  the  implementation  and 
<br/>enforcement of the Convention in our domestic context.  This will help us to create effective laws, 
<br/>policies and procedures to efficiently prevent and combat cybercrime.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also urge that Fiji considers other Conventions which offer more protection to women 
<br/>and  girls,  such  as  the  Convention  on  Preventing  and  Combatting  Violence  Against  Women  and 
<br/>Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), to work hand in hand with the Budapest Convention, to 
<br/>ensure protection of our  women and girls  and the recognition  of online gender-based violence  as 
<br/>being a violation of a woman’s human right.  There were a lot of recommendations that were included 
<br/>in the Committee Report, and I hope that it had all been all spelt out properly by those who have 
<br/></span><span>spoken before me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  threat  of  cybercrime  in  our  domestic  and  regional  space  and  our 
<br/>international border, tantamount to the uncontrolled drugs entering our shores.  If we are not careful, 
<br/>surely it will ruin our economy and our people.  We must act decisively now.  We cannot do it alone 
<br/>and we need our international partners and instruments to combat it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the 
<br/>motion before Parliament, and I render my full support that Fiji ratifies and accedes to the Budapest 
<br/>Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, what we have done today is not paying 
<br/>lip service to our international partnership.  In this space, we have actually enacted the Cybercrime 
<br/>Act before the ratification.   There will be incremental changes in terms of our legislative reform as 
<br/>highlighted - there are a number of other subsequent changes that will be made.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do note the issues that are covered here.  What concerns me, when I look 
<br/>at the statistics provided by the Police, is the low number of reported cases.  Just allow me, Sir, if I 
<br/>may, to give you examples. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For dishonesty - obtaining or dealing with personal financial information, there was only one 
<br/>case in 2019 but none from 2020 to 2023.  On unauthorised modification of restricted data held in 
<br/>computer  -  32  cases  in  2019,  but  none  in  2020 to  2023.    On  reported  cases  of  traffic  in  obscene 
<br/>publication which normally occurs there were three cases in 2019, three cases in 2020, two cases in 
<br/>2021, three cases in 2022 and four cases in 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pattern in this is the same.  It is the lack of awareness for members of public to report 
<br/>this matter to the authorities.  What we see is that a lot of these are being published online, but they 
<br/>are not pushed to where they supposed to be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For online safety, no report of causing harm by posting electronic communication from 2019 
<br/>to 2023.  For posting an intimate visual recording, only one case in 2021, none from 2019 to 2023.  
<br/>What I urge is, for those members of the public who are listening in and for Members of Parliament, 
<br/>it is our responsibility to inform the members of the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In part of my consultation awareness, there is a team that normally accompanies me in terms 
<br/>of telling the people.  As honourable Koya said, “Yes, we all have a phone, but how to use the phone 
<br/>is what we lack.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  pay  homage  to  the  members  of  the  former  Committee  who  had  actually  started  the 
<br/>work.  I  have  read  all  through  the  communications  and  the  brief,  indeed,  thank  you,  honourable 
<br/>Naupoto and the Committee, and for the recommendations that is before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other than that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we fully endorse the acceding of this Budapest Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to also echo my big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to 
<br/>the Committee for bringing this up, and even to the honourable and learned Attorney-General.  We 
<br/>did  follow  up  by  letter  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  through  to  the  honourable  and  learned 
<br/></span><span>honourable Attorney-General, if they could fast-track the Treaty to be endorsed by Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So much has been said, we have been placed on record where we have been asked to accede 
<br/>to  this Convention. The mention  of the two  Protocols  that accompany this  Convention is another 
<br/>important issue because then, it allows us to interact right across our border to other countries, so this 
<br/>is a cross-border problem and now, we can access through those two Protocols, all the help that we 
<br/>can get from international countries right up to the United States, et cetera.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on Cybercrime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>811 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  I  am  thankful  to  the  fast-tracking  of  the  Treaty  to  be  endorsed  by  our  Parliament 
<br/>through you, honourable and learned Attorney-General. I thank each and every one of you for the 
<br/>endorsement  of  this  Convention.    Even  though  Kiribati  has  also  endorsed  it,  Tonga  is  already 
<br/>recognised, being part of the region, apart from Australia and New Zealand, that have endorsed the 
<br/>Treaty.  They are accessible to the help of the Council in Europe and that is what we are aiming for. 
<br/>Once we ratify and send our endorsement to the Council in Europe, then everything takes its course 
<br/>from there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you once more for all the hard work by the previous Government in getting the Cyber 
<br/>Act approved - endorsed by Parliament and enacted as well, but this is the most important one. Even 
<br/>for me in attending that workshop, I knew very little about this, almost nothing. I thought it was to 
<br/>do with some outer space thing and then I was surprised in sitting there, most of us who were there - 
<br/>the Senior Deputy Speaker of Vanuatu, also indicated that when he came to the meeting, he could 
<br/>not understand what he was going into, until we met.  Then through interaction, we managed to learn 
<br/>a lot of things and I was a bit taken aback because of the time taken to reach the endorsement you 
<br/>have just done quite a while ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were so many issues.  The Government of the day then, fast-tracked the Cybercrime 
<br/>Act, et cetera, and that is good.  But we, in the Opposition - the SODELPA, at that very time, we 
<br/>were suspended from Parliament for six months, that saw to this time length been totally affected and 
<br/>that is why our lack of knowledge of this particular Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am kind of reiterating this to you, honourable Members, because these are some of the things 
<br/>that came our way, that saw to the delay in the endorsement of this Convention, especially by our 
<br/>very own Parliament.  Then now, seeing that this has received support from each and every one of 
<br/>you, or Parliament as a whole, I am so grateful for that because I, and the Secretariat, do not want to 
<br/>be pointed at, that we were delaying this.  That is the reason for that letter to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and then to you, Sir, but probably the letter was still coming when your Treaty was pushed 
<br/>forward to be endorsed today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all that I wanted to add because this has been a new learning experience for most of 
<br/>us.  I only remember quite vividly that when we attended meetings abroad on IPU, et cetera, it was 
<br/>the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  who  took  an  interest  in  all  these  -  cybercrime,  et  cetera.    To  me, 
<br/>cyberspace and cybercrime are foreign words.  I said to myself, “What the hack are we talking about 
<br/>here!”  I thought it was to do with some outer space thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, when the Senior Deputy Speaker of the Vanuatu Parliament raised in our workshop, 
<br/>“Have you come across some problems? Can you give some examples?”  Luckily, I looked towards 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Speaker  because  she  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Police  regarding  certain 
<br/>information  that  was  put  out  in  the  social  media  that  was  so  damaging  to  her.    I  asked  for  her 
<br/>forgiveness when I opened my mouth and said that, but she felt at ease again.  But the Deputy Speaker 
<br/>of Vanuatu learnt a big lesson there, especially for the two Protocols that are part of this Treaty.  It 
<br/>is there, waiting for us to endorse it.  Once again, thank you so much and a big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to 
<br/>each and every one of you, especially to the Committee and to you, honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of today’s sitting and I thank you for all your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributions once more.  Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 5.48 p.m.
