<div><span>LTA’s Safe Operating System 
<br/>(Question No. 66/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform Parliament on the security measures taken by the Land Transport Authority to ensure 
<br/>its  Operating  System  is  safe  and  protected  from  possible  hacking,  tampering  and 
<br/>manipulation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Tuinaceva  for  the 
<br/>question.  I rise to provide this august Parliament a response to that question regarding the security 
<br/>measures  taken  by  Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA)  to  ensure  its  operation  system  is  safe  and 
<br/>protected from possible hacking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the LTA has, in place, an operating system that is user friendly and provide its essential 
<br/>services and daily operations of the organisation.  The use of this system operation helps increase 
<br/>productivity and efficiency, conducts security multiple tasks simultaneously to ease the workflow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the years, it has been upgrading this operating systems according to its competencies 
<br/>and to enhance business processes.  However, the more developed and advanced as we get in terms 
<br/>of technology, we need to ensure that the risks of manipulation and hacking is prevented or reduced, 
<br/>especially  with  great  impact  particularly  those  who  depend  on  these  services  for  their  daily 
<br/>businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  LTA  system  is  no  exception.    To  address  this  issue,  Sir,  the  LTA  through  its  IT 
<br/>Department has implemented the following measures to protect its systems and data from hacking, 
<br/>tampering or manipulation: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Network  Perimeter  Firewalls  that  scans,  and  authorizes  network  data  traffic,  stops 
<br/>unauthorised any intrusive access into LTA systems and data by blocking or mitigating 
<br/>potential security threats in real time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Anti-virus and Anti-malware software that manages all end-user devices and service 
<br/>systems to detect and remove malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans and 
<br/>spyware from the system.  This is backed up by Malservice that monitors all events and 
<br/>alerts,  generated  24/7,  ensuring  proactive  and  remediation  applied  as  and  when 
<br/>necessary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Email security is another big issue where all incoming emails are scanned to protect 
<br/></span><span>against  malware,  ransomware  and  phishing  scams.  All  emails  that  are  suspicious  or 
<br/>present anomalies are blocked or mitigated in terms of securities in real time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conducting preventative maintenance to regularly apply security patches and updates 
<br/>provided by the operating system to address known vulnerabilities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing ongoing in terms of the 
<br/>network  and  the  websites.    So,  a  detailed  report  and  remediation  is  then  followed 
<br/>through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementing  stronger  user  authentication  mechanisms,  such  as  complex  password 
<br/>requirements, mandatory changing of passwords at intervals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conducting access audits to ensure authorised users have access to the appropriate data 
<br/>and systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Authority has plans to further enhance its security cautions and evaluate the following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tools, such as web application firewalls, security operation center with log management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the protective measures to the LTA’s operating system, LTA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also has in place the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Policies  and  Standards  of  Procedures,  governing  its  business  processes  in  its  daily 
<br/>operations.    These  are  reviewed  regularly  to  ensure  regulatory  compliance  and,  of 
<br/>course, accommodate any necessary changes and challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Audit investigations is an ongoing process, particularly in high risk areas in terms of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>risk control and mitigation. 
<br/>Reconciliations are carried out  regularly  in order to  ensure accuracy in  the financial 
<br/>statements, data, stocks and other data which is provided to the customers.  Thank you, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.    Can  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister confirm that due to system failure, that permits were still being illegally issued when the 
<br/>permit freeze was still in place? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not sure whether I can comment on it because currently 
<br/>it is with the courts.  So, I prefer not to comment in case it might prejudice the investigation because 
<br/>your question borders on the processes involved which also involves certain staff who have been 
<br/>taken to task at the moment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to clarify,  the question was simple.  Can 
<br/>he confirm whether there were permits still illegally issued when the permit freeze was on because 
<br/>of the system?  It is a yes or no answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The freeze is currently on and that happened while the freeze 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was still on, so it happened during the freeze. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in the first part of the question, I think there are a 
<br/>couple  of  things.    You  are  talking  about  hacking,  tampering  and  manipulation.    In  terms  of 
<br/>manipulation, can you tell Parliament, if a truck comes in to get weighed and if it is overweight, is it 
<br/>connected  to  headquarters  so  that  headquarters  knows  that  a  particular  truck  has  come  in  and  its 
<br/></span><span>overweight and an alarm bell rings?  Is it connected yet or not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have that information with me but 
<br/>what I know is that when the truck comes in, the printout is done there.   I will need to verify that and 
<br/>get back to you. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA. - In that case, if you do not know, is that not something that leads to

<div><span>corruption and should that not be something that you immediately deal with? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU. -  Yes, that is a possibility. At the moment, we have budgeted 
<br/>for upgrading all our IT systems so that they are, I suppose, interconnected. That is currently ongoing, 
<br/>and  we  aim  to  have  those  systems  interrelated  and  I  suppose  talking  to  each  other  in  the  current 
<br/>project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.  -  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  the  honourable  Minister  inform  Parliament  what 
<br/>measures are in place to ensure that LTA employees are adequately trained and are aware of the cyber 
<br/>security threats? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.  -    Yes,  of  course,  in  terms  of  training,  that  is  an  ongoing 
<br/>exercise in all organizations, including LTA.  They have also done their own training needs analysis 
<br/>as part of their HR strategy which includes what you have raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultation on Crown Grants and Native Grants 
<br/>(Question No. 67/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs  ad  and  Culture,  Heritage,  and  Arts 
<br/>update  Parliament  on  the  consultation  iTLTB  is  undertaking  on  Crown  grants  and  Native 
<br/>grants? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  posed  by  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vocea and I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question, let me assure Parliament and the general 
<br/>public, that this consultation is a normal process  that has always been carried out by the Reserve 
<br/>Commissioner. When it receives any claimant, it needs to go and carry out consultations - to have a 
<br/>feel on the ground and the truth about the claimants that have been sent to iTLTB. This process was 
<br/>stopped in 2010. I want to assure the general public that this consultation does not affect the current 
<br/>tenant and there is no need to worry.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me, first, provide some background.  State freehold land originated from 
<br/></span><span>either a Crown Grant or a Native Grant title.  Some parcels have retained the freehold title and are 
<br/></span><span>known as State freehold land, while some have cancelled titles and are now known as State freehold 
<br/>land without title.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Crown grant was given the title for land that were sold prior to the Deed of Cession.  The sale 
<br/>of these land was  validated by the Land Claims Commission of 1876, after the public hearing of 
<br/>individual cases.  A total of 1,582 Crown Grants, covering an area of 152,850 hectares, were 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>registered because of the Commission’s work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Native Grant is the land that was purchased under the Native Land Acquisition Ordinance 
<br/>1905, after the then Governor Imthurn reopened the sale of the land.  Under that legislation, a total 
<br/>of 206 Native Grants, covering an area of approximately 42,440 hectares, were issued before the land 
<br/>sale was finally stopped.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the need to claim State land for reserve and reversion, before Cession, the sale of iTaukei 
<br/>land was rampant and was not controlled by any central authority.  After the Deed of Cession was 
<br/>executed in 1874, the Governor then, Sir Arthur Gordon, discontinued all sale of iTaukei land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years,  grievances  over  the  sale  of  iTaukei  land  began  to  surface  from  iTaukei 
<br/>landowning units.  When unsolved, these grievances led to widespread disillusionment and ongoing 
<br/>disputes between landowners, tenants, Government and iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei Lands Commission records revealed that 223 landowning units (</span><span>mataqali</span><span> and 
<br/></span><span>tokatoka</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>are dependent units that do not own any land and the following are the reasons why they 
<br/>lost their land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They were sold and became freehold land.  Tribal land were sold by some chiefs without 
<br/>their knowledge and are now classified as freehold through Crown Grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They were absent during the Land Commission Inquiry.  The original landowners were 
<br/>not present to lay their claims at the time of the Native Lands Commission land inquiry 
<br/>held soon after Cession, thus their land were taken up by the State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  1905  Native  Land  Ordinance  reopened  the  sale  of  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>land  which  is  now 
<br/>freehold land known as Native Grant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  sale  of  land  owned  by  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>  landowners  with  a  declining  population,  were 
<br/>aligned and recorded under other landowning units.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1905, the Native Land Ordinance allowed for acquisition of unused </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land by 
<br/>Government for long-term leasing where some were for 999 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two legislations used to process the claims are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands Act, under section 8, dealing with reversion, states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Where any </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land has been acquired by the State for any public purpose 
<br/>under the provision of the State Acquisition of Lands Act or any other written 
<br/>law,  is  no  longer  required  for  such  purposes.  The  Minister  (for  Lands)  after 
<br/>consultation with Cabinet may, by order, declare such land to be </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land 
<br/>and  such  declaration  shall  be  recorded  in  the  Unit  from  which  the  land  was 
<br/>acquired in the register of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei Land Trust Act, under section 18, dealing with reservation, states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If  the  Minister  (for  iTaukei  Affairs)  is  satisfied  that  land  belonging  to  any 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> is insufficient for their use, maintenance and support of its members, it 
<br/></span><span>shall be lawful for the Minister by proclamation to set aside such State land or 
<br/></span><span>land acquired for and on behalf of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>by purchase as in his opinion may

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be required for the use and maintenance and support of such </span><span>mataqali</span><span>.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the reversion and reservation processes of State Land 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the two legislations I have mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  iTLTB,  through  the  Reserves  Commission,  carries  out  consultations  with  the 
<br/>claimants through formal inquiries and inspection of their </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land holdings.  The 
<br/>Commission  also  gathers  other  evidence  to  support  the  claims  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A  report  with  supporting  evidence  and  recommendations  is  submitted  to  the  iTLTB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Board of Trustees for consideration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Upon  approval,  the  Board  resolution  is  conveyed  to  the  Ministry  of  Lands  for  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>verification and approval.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Minister for Lands, upon completion of the verification process, will then table a 
<br/>paper before Cabinet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Upon Cabinet approval -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>▪</span><span> </span><span>For reservation cases under section 18 of the iTaukei Land Trust Act, the Minister 
<br/>for iTaukei Affairs will publish a proclamation notice by gazette and the claimed 
<br/>land will then become an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> reserve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>▪</span><span> </span><span>For reversion case under section 8 of the State Lands Act, the Minister for Lands 
<br/>will publish an order by gazette and the claimed land will become </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reserve seating schedule published by the  </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> on 27</span><span>th</span><span> February, 
<br/>2024, was to  inform  the public that the Reserve  Commission  intended to  hold  consultations with 
<br/>iTaukei landowning units who had submitted their claims over State freehold land.  These claims 
<br/>which had been pending since 2010, naturally resulted in a long list.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Reserve  Commission  was  mobilised  to  investigate  the  claims.    The  reserve  sittings 
<br/>commenced on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024, and was scheduled to be completed on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024.  
<br/>The sittings were to be held in various </span><span>Vanua - </span><span>in the province of Tailevu, Rewa, Naitasiri, Serua, 
<br/>Ra, Ba, Nadroga, Lomaiviti, Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  sittings  were  suspended  on  9</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  2024,  to  enable  a  recent  Cabinet-mandated 
<br/>Committee on the issue, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives 
<br/>and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, to re-asses the framework and propose to 
<br/>Cabinet the next steps to be taken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, continued work was reported on social media and local dailies which twisted 
<br/>the  intention  of  the  Reserve  Commission’s  hearing  on  Crown  Grant  and  Native  Grant  claims.  
<br/></span><span>Everything was done above board.  The Reserve Commission’s work on this is not new.  The Crown 
<br/></span><span>Grants and Native Grants have been returned before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have already mentioned, the long list of claims was due to Government’s decision in 
<br/>2010  not  to  entertain  such  claims  again.    That  was  a  gross  injustice  to  the  claimants.    We  have 
<br/>reversed this for justice for the landowners.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since I have only one minute, however, I am worried 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the poor lessees.  What will happen to them?  If it is converted into Native land, what will 
<br/>happen? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Just listen to me!  Listen to me!  I am explaining something, and you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are just jumping.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once the term of the lease expires, then what will happen?  On State land when renewal is 
<br/>done, there is no premium charged.  So, when it is converted into Native and when you renew the 
<br/>lease, will there be any premium charged on the lands   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what I am worried about.  The lessees will suffer, sugar production will go down, and 
<br/>that is what I am worried about.  I am asking the honourable Minister to tell this Parliament that once 
<br/>the lease is expired, whether the term of the lease will be given for 99 years and whether they will 
<br/>charge any premium when you convert that into Native lease?  That is what I am asking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the lease expires, that will be determined by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Lands, who covers the freehold land, in consultation with the iTLTB.  As I 
<br/>have already mentioned, for now, there is no need to worry.  The Government has set up a Committee, 
<br/>we are looking at the overall picture of the concerns from the public and we will take care of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if a land is converted into </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, how will you 
<br/>then consult with the honourable Minister for Lands when it has already gone to iTaukei Land Trust 
<br/>Board?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  That  is  the  problem.    They  have  less  knowledge  about  land.    I  am 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>asking, once a land lease has expired, when it is converted into Native lease, what will then happen?   
<br/>He will not be able to discuss with the honourable Minister for Lands because the land has already 
<br/>gone to the iTaukei Land Trust Board. That is my question which he does not understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Oqoo koya na qele sa</span><span> identify-</span><span>taki me na lako me qai qele vaka-i-taukei 
<br/>vei ira era sa kerekere tu</span><span>. </span><span>E taroga tiko qo o</span><span> honourable Kirpal, </span><span>ena vaka evei o ira oya? Esa na mai 
<br/>veisau me qele vaka- i-taukei ka a qele tu mai vakamatanitu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Committee’s decision is approved by Cabinet, then 
<br/>it will really be a balance - it will take care of the landowners and those who lease on the land. If that 
<br/>is the case, then we will follow.  It has already been transferred as </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, so it will go through 
<br/>the process at iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Kirpal is raising a very valid question.  The other element of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his question, honourable Minister, is, will premium be paid since it is now Native land? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- It is the policy for  iTLTB at that time.  If they need to pay the premium, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then it has to apply to everyone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is where the Government comes in, in paying for premiums of renewal

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of leases and all.  I stand to be corrected on that as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  we  are  speaking  about  premium,  just  a 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs. The Ministry of Local Government acquired 
<br/>a development lease and a premium was paid at that point in time. I will give a typical example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land was acquired at Solove, Labasa. The land was acquired, development lease given to 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government, premium was paid to the</span><span> mataqali</span><span> by the Government back then and 
<br/>now it is only supposed to be releasing the leases. Now, iTLTB is asking for another premium, when 
<br/>Government actually paid the premium in the first place before acquiring a development lease for 
<br/>this piece of land where the residents are sitting.  There are sitting tenants.  They are supposed to 
<br/>receive the lease, but they have been asked to pay additional premium of $18,000 before the lease is 
<br/>issued.  Why are we requesting for another premium to be paid when Government has already paid 
<br/>a premium before acquiring the development lease? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just to inform this august Parliament, there is a lot of 
<br/>concern in regards to premium. We have now formed a Committee just to have a look at how the 
<br/>premium is being worked out and we will have to discuss with iTLTB to address the concerns of 
<br/>those who are leasing the land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to the question regarding the one that has already paid the premium by the Ministry 
<br/>of Local Government, I am willing to discuss it with the iTLTB and I might have to come back with 
<br/>it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is Solove, Sir, in Labasa? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The premium was not paid by the Ministry of Local Government but by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  Government  paid  the  premium  through  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government. A typical example would be Vunivau whereby more than $1 million was paid to the 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> owners to acquire development lease. Everything is now done, it was just supposed to be 
<br/>distributed with the lease, but now iTLTB stepping in again to tell them to pay another premium 
<br/>because they do not recognise the premium that was paid by the Government to iTLTB back then 
<br/>and now they will have to pay another premium before they receive their proper lease. That is all, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-Thank you, honourable Maharaj, I am trying to make an attempt to clarify 
<br/>this to the honourable Minister. All  the mode of payments that goes regarding  Native land either 
<br/>comes through the Ministry of Lands to  Native Land or straight to  Native Land.  I do not  know, 
<br/>maybe the system has changed then.  Now, you are mentioning the Ministry of Local Government, 
<br/>that is quite news to me, but I stand to be corrected there, but we will take it from there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has agreed and if you could just write down the particulars of the 
<br/></span><span>land  -  Solove  and  Vunivau.    </span><span>Oqo  e  tamani  vanua  vakaitamera  orau  ruarua  oqo,  na  vanua  vaka

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you do not agree with what iTLTB has provided to you, 
<br/>you can provide a counteroffer.  You can explain to them that the Government has already paid the 
<br/>premium, that there is no need for the individual to pay their own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Who is to do that, Sir, honourable Maharaj? He is just raising the question.

<div><span>Leasehold Market Value 
<br/>(Question No. 68/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  inform  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether the Leasehold Market Value is regulated by any Act or Regulations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Kirpal is all firing this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>afternoon.  He has already tried to get you Mr. Speaker, on his sight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  simple  answer  to  a  simple  question,  is  whether  Leasehold  Market  Value  (LMV)  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regulated by an Act or by Regulations, as it is regulated by neither.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as honourable Minister for Lands is aware, most of 
<br/>the State lessees in agricultural land have more than one family living in their house.  So, the LMV 
<br/>is a burden and makes it difficult for them to subdivide and get a registered lease because they have 
<br/>to pay 20 percent of the difference in value and also pay the surveyor’s fees and other related costs.  
<br/>My question is, can the honourable Minister for Lands consider that LMV be waived from all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>789 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rezoning of State land? If not, can it be waived from agriculture land which lessees want to rezone to 
<br/>residential for their own use? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, a good example is the marginal lots. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  That  is  why  we  had  that  conversation  during  the  Business 
<br/>Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I know that the real question was coming behind the question that was 
<br/>on the paper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member understands very well the origins of how LMV as 
<br/>a  feature  of  State  leases  originated  in  1995.    I  think  you  were  there.    Also,  on  the  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament, there are two former Ministers for Lands who, I am sure, throughout their tenure, they 
<br/>would have approved and agreed on the imposition of those fees for payment.  I think what it does 
<br/>or the intent behind it is to ensure that when people move the original lease use to a higher yield use, 
<br/>it is at somewhere that the State also gets the benefit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What it is suggesting is, we, the Ministry of Lands understand, and I am sure that he also 
<br/>understands from the time when he was with the Ministry that there is a real need for the State to also 
<br/>capitalize on something that we understand, is going to cause a gain to those who currently hold those 
<br/>leases.  When they subdivide, for example, and I have some figures here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  a  piece  of  land  that  was  originally  given  an  agriculture  lease  is  now  sought  to  be 
<br/>rezoned and subdivided into residential, there is a lot of economic gain to the developer.  Someone 
<br/>who pays us $35,000 on LMV goes on to earn a lot far more than that, close to three-quarter of a 
<br/>million dollars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a strong public policy or reason why we should maintain the LMV, even though it is 
<br/>a policy of the Ministry.  It is not on the Act, it is not in the regulations, and it is a strong policy that 
<br/>holds water, and it should be maintained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the answer to the honourable Member is that we deal with applications on a case-by-
<br/>case basis but we often always look towards what is the economic component of that application 
<br/>before the imposition of the 20 percent is left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Kirpal,  I hope you are satisfied with  that reply  because if  I 
<br/>may, many at times it has changed.  The laws that we used to base our decisions on at that time when 
<br/>we  were  both  working  together,  is  quite  different  because  for  our  marginal  lots,  we  allow  the 
<br/>relaxation  of  Town  &amp;  Country  Planning.    Instead  of  paying  surveyed  lots,  we  just  went  for  the 
<br/>occupation.  We cut one lot into two residential leases and then we give out agreement to leases based 
<br/>on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But now since the previous Government had decided to go straight into giving out registered 
<br/>leases and will require a proper survey of the land.  That is what you have been asking to be taken 
<br/>away - the survey fees, and they are expensive.  But, again, the decision in policy making and all of 
<br/>that have changed a lot.  What we see out there in Malolo, that is the same thing that I was asking 
<br/></span><span>here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Government maintained that it wants to give registered leases.  So, by going for 
<br/>registered leases, it is quite expensive. Maybe the previous Government thought that the Government 
<br/>could foot the Bill. But with this present Government that is what has been stated by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands. Thank you.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will move on to the next Oral Question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question has been withdrawn.  I have advised the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secretariat that the question has been withdrawn.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will take that. You have advised the Secretary-General, on my note, it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>does not show any change so that is why I raise the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will move on to the fifth Oral Question for today. Honourable Members, I have received 
<br/>notification  from  the  honourable  Opposition  Whip  that  honourable  Ketan  Lal  has  withdrawn  his 
<br/>question as well.

<div><span>Update – National Minimum Wage Regulations 
<br/>(Question No. 71/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on the approved review of the National Minimum Wage and the 10 sectoral 
<br/>minimum  Wages  Regulation,  including  the  proposal  of  new  job  classifications  within  the 
<br/>current Wages Regulation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  provide  an  update  on  the  National  Minimum  Wage  and  the  10 
<br/>sectoral  MinimumWages  Regulations  including  new  job  classifications  which  was  endorsed  by 
<br/>Cabinet on 9</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minium Wage Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928 (No. 26) which Fiji 
<br/>ratified  on  19</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  1974,  states  in  Article  1  Part  1,  “that  members  of the  International  Labour 
<br/>Organization (ILO) that have ratified the Convention are to create or maintain a machinery whereby 
<br/>minimum rates of wages can be fixed for workers employed in certain trades, or parts of trades”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has secured a team of four consultants through an Expression 
<br/>of  Interest.  (EIO).  The  lead  consultant,  Professor  Anand  Chand,  is  actually  the  Acting  Associate 
<br/>Dean, Research and Innovations at the Fiji National University, and together with him in the team 
<br/>are:  Dr. Janesh Sami, Dr. Jone Lako and Dr. Maureen Karan, who are from USP.  The team members 
<br/>are currently undertaking a comprehensive Minimum Wage Review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  review  process,  the  Ministry  through  the  appointed 
<br/>consultants, ensured that all relevant stakeholders are fully consulted. The team has travelled around 
<br/>Viti Levu and Labasa and has also received written submissions.  The team has also consulted the 
<br/></span><span>two major social partners - the Fiji Trades Union Congress and the Fiji Commerce and Employers 
<br/></span><span>Federation, as well as the Chambers of Commerce and the rest of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  proposal  of  new  job  classifications  within  the  current  Wage 
<br/>Regulations, the Ministry has appointed 10 wages Councils, together with a common chairperson 
<br/>who will be undertaking the review of the current job classifications.

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Employment  Relations  Advisory  Board  will  them  meet  and  make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations to the Minister, and the final decision, of course, will be made, together in 
<br/>consultation with the Ministry of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Coalition Government took office, the work to review the National 
<br/>Minimum Wage and the 10 Wage Regulations had been part of our commitment from day one.  The 
<br/>Ministry will ensure that the due processes are adhered to for a fair and just minimum wage that will 
<br/>benefit all Fijians and the national economy as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the honourable Minister elaborate on the specific 
<br/>factors and considerations that are being taken into account in the review of the National Minimum 
<br/>Wage?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why I am asking this is because in the recent weeks, the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance was in Labasa.  There were concerns raised by the employers about the $6.  I would also like 
<br/>to know whether $6 is in place, is it being reviewed, is it from the Union or from is it the Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated very clearly …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought he was  only passing a statement. I never heard him, or have you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>changed it to a question now?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got his question.  I can read his body language as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  stated  earlier,  the  process  is  ongoing  now.    Consultations  are  taking  place.  
<br/>Submissions are being made by various stakeholders.  The Fiji Trades Union Congress has made a 
<br/>statement that they would like the minimum wage to be $6, others have made other submissions.  
<br/>Once all the submissions are considered by the consultants, then the review process will take place 
<br/>from there.  Nothing has been determined, that is what I want to advise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, is there any timeline for this process, or is it going to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>take a year or something? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, we have earlier stated that the review will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completed and an announcement will be made during the National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  concern  is  for  the  small  and  medium 
<br/>enterprises.  What measures are being taken by the Coalition Government to consider mitigating the 
<br/>impacts of the increase of minimum wages for the small businesses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, at the expense of repetition, let me state 
<br/>in this august Parliament that consultations are in progress, and SMEs are also being consulted.  No 
<br/>stakeholder is being left out.  So, all submissions will be considered and then a recommendation will 
<br/>be made by this group of consultants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- On housekeeping, for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders in 
<br/>respect  to  sitting  times,  I  now  call  upon  the  Leader  of  the  Government  in  Parliament  to  move  a 
<br/>suspension motion.
