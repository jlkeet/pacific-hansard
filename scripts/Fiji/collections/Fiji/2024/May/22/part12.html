<div><span>Vanua Levu Road Upgrade Project 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  very  good  morning  to  you.    The  honourable 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>broadcast of today’s Parliamentary Sitting; </span><span>ni sa bula vina’a, </span><span>namaste and good morning to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement on the Vanua Levu Road Upgrade 
<br/>Project. The Project is to be funded by a grant from the People’s Republic of China through the China 
<br/>International Development Co-operation Agency (CIDCA).  It is anticipated that the road upgrade 
<br/>will stimulate development of tourism, renewable energy projects, including hydro power facilities 
<br/>and  the  transport  and  movement  of  people,  including  through  the  planned  Nabouwalu  township 
<br/>which is the main transport link to Vitilevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  “One  China  Policy”  has  been  the  firm  foundation  of  the  Fiji-China 
<br/>diplomatic relations, founded some 49 years ago.  As you are aware, Sir, I met President Xi Jinping 
<br/>on  the  margins  of  the  Asia  Pacific  Economic  Co-operation  (APEC)  held  in  San  Francisco  in 
<br/>November  last  year.    The  key  deliberations  during  our  meeting  centered  around  China’s  global 
<br/>development initiatives, with a specific focus on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  BRI  is  designed  to  foster  economic  connectivity,  trade,  and  cultural 
<br/>exchange,  particularly  through  infrastructure  development.  This  also  resonates  with  our  national 
<br/>development  objectives.  The  BRI  aligns  with  Fiji’s  agenda,  emphasizing  shared  goals  of  policy 
<br/>coordination, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation and financial integration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the BRI in 2018, bilateral 
<br/>and economic  co-operation and people-to-people exchanges have yielded fruitful results. Fiji will 
<br/>continue to promote the cooperation with China under the framework of the BRI in areas such as 
<br/>infrastructure construction, renewable energy, agriculture and fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In talks with President Xi, I emphasised Fiji and China’s strong historical ties, underpinned 
<br/>by shared aspirations and common interests, fostering a comprehensive strategic partnership rooted 
<br/>in mutual trust and respect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The multifaceted collaboration between Fiji and China spans people-to-people relations and 
<br/>cooperation  across  sectors  such  as  agriculture,  education,  health,  trade  and  investment,  poverty 
<br/>reduction, infrastructure and climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>President Xi and I also discussed practical matters, including Fiji’s concessional loan with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>China, as well as the Vanualevu Road Upgrading Project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Minister responsible for Climate Change, I expressed our interest in collaborating with 
<br/>China  on  recycling  initiatives,  recognising  the  potential  for  economic  incentives  derived  from 
<br/>China’s experience in industrial recycling processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Sir, I wish to cordially thank the Ambassador Zhou Jian for our continuing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussions on the prospects for future cooperation in the areas of socio-economic development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the China Aid Project will improve the following roads in Vanualevu: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Part of the Nabouwalu-Makolei Road in Bua; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Natewa-West Coast in Cakaudrove (unfortunately, it does not go to my village); and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Nabalebale-Naviavia/Dawara Roads in Cakaudrove. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project is estimated to cost FJ$300 million and will be the flagship project under China’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Belt and Road Initiative in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanualevu has an area of 5,581.1 square kilometres or 2,157.2 square miles, and a population 
<br/>of 135,965, as  confirmed by the 2019-2020  National  Household  Income  and Expenditure Survey 
<br/>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The roads being upgraded are currently still unpaved gravel that connect rural village roads 
<br/>and  need  to  be  paved.    Such  road  conditions  increase  travelling  time,  damage  transported 
<br/>commodities  and  goods,  are  insufficient  for  current  traffic  loads,  and  restrict  socio-economic 
<br/>development in general.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tabulated below are villages, schools and health facilities that will benefit from the 82 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kilometre road upgrade.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  project  will  fulfill  our  objectives  to  promote  economic  growth,  foster  fair  distribution  of 
<br/>development gains to the population and improving social conditions, particularly in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, remote rural and island communities in Fiji are relatively 
<br/>poor and isolated from economic opportunities and social services, particularly when rural access 
<br/>roads and jetties are in poor condition. Further, our country is prone to disruptive natural events, such 
<br/>as tropical cyclones and resultant flooding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s topography has restricted the 11,000 kilometre road network to spine or circumferential 
<br/>main roads with feeder roads, leaving few route alternatives. In the main urban areas, lower-level 
<br/>municipal  roads  are  neglected,  rough,  and  sometimes  impassable.    Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>transport infrastructure and services are key to promoting economic growth and social development.  
<br/>Further,  rural  industries  such  as  sugarcane  farming,  forestry  and  tourism  rely  on  road  access,  for 
<br/>example, from plantations to processing plants and to our ports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  project  will  also  facilitate  better  access  to  health  facilities  for  those  in  districts  of 
<br/>Vaturova, Koroalau, Wailevu, Solevu, Vuya and Nabouwalu, with  a population  of approximately 
<br/>10,000. The upgrading and sealing of these rural roads will also enable better access to banks and 
<br/>financial institutions to boost the culture of savings, as well as to micro and small businesses.  Further, 
<br/>the provision  of good quality  roads will ensure  better transportation and linkages of quality  farm 
<br/>produce to markets, middlemen, traders and processing plants for export purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural communities residing along the roads being upgraded will also have better access to 
<br/>Government services and offices. In fact, there are 12 Health Facilities and 15 Government Stations 
<br/>along these three roads currently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current poor road conditions greatly affect operations for rural service providers. Poor 
<br/>road quality hinders access, and it is costly for those residing in the districts of Nadi, Solevu and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vuya.  The project will complete a major link in the strategic network and provide a faster route for 
<br/>traffic around the island of Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the project, a feasibility study was carried out earlier this year by 
<br/>a  technical  team  from  China.  The  team  conducted  a  thorough  investigation  on  road  traffic  and 
<br/>conditions.  Ambassador  Zhou  Zian  and  I  visited  the  team  during  the  Study  to  discuss  their 
<br/>preliminary findings, and I was pleased to host the team at Drekeniwai (my village) for afternoon 
<br/>tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Feasibility Report is now being finalised and will be studied by the China International 
<br/>Development Cooperation (CIDCA) before work commences. This project prioritizes areas requiring 
<br/>upgrading,  such  as  this  portion  of  Vanua  Levu,  previously  overlooked.    The  project  seamlessly 
<br/>continues the Fiji Roads Upgrading Programme (FRUP), which commenced soon after Independence 
<br/>by the Alliance Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FRUP  was  continued  by  the  SVT  Coalition  Government  in  the  1990s  and  SDL 
<br/>Government in early 2006.  This project connects the previous iterations of FRUP.  In the past, the 
<br/>chiefs  and  leaders  of  Cakaudrove  politely  deferred  road  development  to  areas  facing  greater 
<br/>challenges  in  other  parts  of  Fiji,  “</span><span>Me  ra  liu  mada  o  ira  qore,  Tu‘aqu,  ‘tou  qai  muri  o  ‘edatou”.  
<br/></span><span>However, it is now time to address neglect and ensure we also improve road conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, the Fiji Road Upgrading Projects (FRUP1, FRUP2, FRUP3) saw upgrades of the 
<br/>national highways on Viti Levu.  These upgrades were based on the identified need and demand for 
<br/>transport and economic activities to be supported to benefit the large populations in those areas.  This 
<br/>is also the case with this Vanua Levu Road Upgrading Projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, future road upgrading plans will see round the island roads completed on 
<br/>the  larger  islands  as  infrastructure  development  projects  flow  to  the  remaining  large  islands  and 
<br/>maritime provinces.  The project is expected to commence in 2025.  It is anticipated to be completed 
<br/>within 24 months to 36 months after completion of necessary technical work.  Sir, I would like to 
<br/>express  the  Government’s  appreciation  to  the  people  and  the  Government  of  China  for  their 
<br/>continued assistance and support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to deliver this Ministerial Statement on the Vanua Levu 
<br/>Roads Project.  I thank the Government of China who are willing to come on board since we were 
<br/>isolated after the events of 1987, 2000 and 2006.  They decided to stay with us, and we changed our 
<br/>policies.  We introduced the Look North Policy, and they have been there since, when others are 
<br/>saying that the new Chinese influence has come into the region when they are only filling a vacuum 
<br/>left when our traditional partners at that time turned away from us.  </span><span>Vina’a vaalevu, dhanyavaad </span><span>and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  I  will  be  very  diplomatic  in  refraining  myself  from  making  any 
<br/>comments.  Maybe, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be providing us with the necessary 
<br/>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought for a moment there that the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deputy Prime Minister was going to reply.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>759 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>Ministerial  Statement  today,  talking  about  the  planned  developments  on  Vanua  Levu.    I  think 
<br/>everyone in Vanua Levu looks forward to it, and it is a progressive development of all the things that 
<br/>had been done in the past, as pointed out under FRUP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, during the time that we were in office, we took the Look North Policy a step further 
<br/>forward.    We  developed  the  Northern  Development  Programme,  and  we  saw  some  major 
<br/>developments such as the paving of the road from Nabouwalu up to Dreketi, the road to Bagasau and 
<br/>all developments in Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There continued to be a lot of challenges in Vanua Levu.  When we came in, we found out 
<br/>that it was the second largest island in Fiji but still had a lot of major infrastructure challenges.  During 
<br/>that time, there was quite a lot of development that was undertaken, and I am glad to see that this is 
<br/>now moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  express  our  appreciation  to  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  for  their 
<br/>assistance to us, as their Prime Minister has been a good friend to Fiji through thick and thin.  When 
<br/>others were not beside us, they were there to help us along during the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also been seeing part of this Belt and Road Initiative.  We are glad to see that this 
<br/>road is going to have an impact on road upgrades in various parts of Vanua Levu.  A lot of us in 
<br/>Parliament have links to the Natewa-West Coast Road, villages along the coast of Saqani and all 
<br/>those  areas  are  all  looking  forward  to  that  assistance.    There  are  a  lot  of  industrial  activities  and 
<br/>agriculture take place in this area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, on the road from Naibalebale to Naviavia, down to Dawara, and also from Nabouwalu 
<br/>to Makolei.  These are places where there are very good agricultural sites.  A lot of work have been 
<br/>done there.  With the port up in Nabouwalu, the passage of this road will allow production to increase 
<br/>and people to have good access to markets.  As the honourable Prime Minister has pointed out, this 
<br/>will also allow access to schools and health facilities for the people who live along those roads. Sir, 
<br/>I congratulate this particular aspect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there are still some concerns. I think the Government needs to take note of some 
<br/>of the major issues that we need on roads in Vanua Levu.  One, of course, is the major road that we 
<br/>have from Nayarabale to Vanuavou.  This is a major access where people can cut across from the 
<br/>bay, moving quickly across to Labasa.  This is a road that, once done, will open up a lot of economic 
<br/>opportunities for people in that particular area.  There is a road also from Sevaci to Korotasere, that 
<br/>is the road that needs to be upgraded.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one very important one that cuts across from the South end of Vanua Levu 
<br/>that links up to Labasa is the Daria Road.  That particular road still has splash crossings, and a lot of 
<br/>people travel on this road and move cargo to get to Labasa faster. I think that is a very important one 
<br/>that we need to address.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the road towards the other side of Vanua Levu, the Tukavesi/Napuka, Sir, that road will 
<br/></span><span>also require a lot of other repairs.  There are a few other roads in Vanua Levu that I would like to 
<br/></span><span>mention for the Government to consider: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been a pilot cut in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> </span><span>o</span><span> </span><span>Navakasiga</span><span> to the village of Naivaka. It is still 
<br/>a pilot cut. I would urge Government to see how that pilot cut can be completed so that 
<br/>that road is actually completed.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also a road that was mentioned by FRA, the road from Nasasa in Nadogo going 
<br/>up to Valevoni Village which is in Saqani.  That is a road too that I am hoping that the 
<br/>people will be able to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the completion of the extension of the road from Naqolotu to linkup 
<br/>to Nabukelevu to complete the loop around the South end of Kadavu. I think that one 
<br/>will  come  in  very  handy  for  the  people  in  that  area,  especially  for  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>A lot of needs for roaders in the upper reach of Naitisiri.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one that I am mentioning is the Hibiscus Highway.  I was there two weeks ago. 
<br/>I have never seen it in the state that it is in now.  I know that there is a planned project 
<br/>that exists, but I have never ever seen it in this state.  I hope that that road will need to 
<br/>be  ripped  and  remade  because  of  the  huge  potholes.    So,  I  am  hopeful  that  the 
<br/>Government and the Minister responsible is aware of it.  I know that there is a project 
<br/>plan in place but I just wanted to raise this because that is very critical for our tourism 
<br/>in that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once  again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- At this juncture, I would also like to acknowledge the presence of a very 
<br/>senior partner of a big contractor in road making up in the North, Mr. Wise, who is sitting in the 
<br/>gallery and is in red shirt.  He is a partner of RPA - a major contractor up there in the North.  Welcome, 
<br/>Mr. Wise.  Also, for those who I have not mentioned, we welcome you to today’s sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, we have heard from the Opposition the roads – he has jumped from Vanua Levu to 
<br/>Kadavu, and that is what we are here for.  We have to highlight all these to bring the attention of the 
<br/>Government of the day to the plight that the people are encountering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ICT Development - Starlink Satellite Technology 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you and apologies for the premature 
<br/>rise, but I suppose I am probably as good as any authority on Vanua Levu being a </span><span>vasu</span><span> from Vanua 
<br/>Levu that I am, I did not stop the new development.  The Opposition was wanting to stand up as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, leaving that aside, on behalf of this august Parliament, let me welcome the students from 
<br/>Marist Brothers Primary School.  It was a rival school to my school, which is Suva Methodist Primary 
<br/>School.  We welcome you here today and hope you will learn something from your Parliament.  In 
<br/>Parliament, sometimes we are a bit loud but trust me, it is done in the spirit of trying to serve our 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today to provide an update in terms of the efforts being 
<br/></span><span>undertaken regarding ICT development by the ‘do nothing’ Government, Sir, including the recent 
<br/>announcement  of  Starlink  officially  commencing  its  services  in  Fiji.    This  marks  a  significant 
<br/>milestone for our nation, as the highly anticipated introduction of Starlink Satellite Technology is, 
<br/>indeed,  a  game  changer,  particularly  in  further  empowering  remote,  maritime  and  underserved 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>761 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This also demonstrates the increased confidence of global companies in Fiji and in the region, 
<br/>as  evidenced  by  Google’s  extension  of  subsea  cable  connections  to  Fiji  and  the  region.    These 
<br/>strategic engagements and developments tangibly contribute to the Coalition Government’s goal of 
<br/>diversifying  the  economy  of  Fiji,  rebuilding  the  economic  architecture  of  Fiji,  progressing  into  a 
<br/>more digital economy and cementing Fiji as the hub of the Pacific.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to 
<br/>inform this august Parliament that we are making more progress in this regard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding Starlink and to provide some background, in November last year, 
<br/>Starlink was issued with  a Spectrum  Licence by the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small  and 
<br/>Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications,  and  a  Telecommunications  Licence  by 
<br/>the 
<br/>Telecommunications  Authority  of  Fiji  (TAF).    Following  that,  Starlink  was  then  to  carry  out  the 
<br/>necessary compliance procedures and arrangements to operationalise in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of satellite technology is not new, as our service providers have been 
<br/>employing  the  use  of  satellite  technology  through  partnerships  with  Oneweb,  International 
<br/>Telecommunications  Satellite  Organization  (Intelsat)  and  Kacific,  to  progressively  connect  our 
<br/>unconnected rural  communities.   But what  is new is  that now, our people can directly utilise the 
<br/>services of a satellite provider and currently, only Starlink has acquired a licence to do that in Fiji.  If 
<br/>you like, Sir, as we say in Tailevu, it is the democratisation of communications globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will also hear me throughout this Statement reference LEW, which is 
<br/>the acronym for a category of satellites, known as Low Earth Orbiting Satellites.  This category of 
<br/>satellites,  as  the  name  suggests,  fly  closer  to  earth  compared  to  other  satellites  (at  around  200 
<br/>kilometres above the earth as opposed to 1200 kilometres above the earth).  Starlink and Oneweb are 
<br/>LEOs.  The Kacific, which is also used in Fiji by our service providers, is part of another category of 
<br/>satellites known as Geostationary Orbit Satellites (GEOs).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The benefits of LEOs extend beyond high-speed internet.  Its resilience during emergencies 
<br/>and capacity for rapid disaster recovery are particularly noteworthy and in the Fiji context, this is 
<br/>quite  significant.  Unlike  traditional  land-based  infrastructure,  which  can  be  severely  damaged  by 
<br/>natural  disasters,  LEO  satellites  network  remain  generally  unaffected.  This  was  demonstrated 
<br/>firsthand when Starlink reconnected our neighbours Tonga after the 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption 
<br/>which severed over 200 kilometres of its vital undersea cable communications, cutting off its link to 
<br/>the world.  The length of the severed cable link was roughly the distance between Suva and Nadi 
<br/>through the Queen’s Highway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to announce that as of 20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, our people can now 
<br/>directly subscribe to Starlink’s services via their company’s website. We had anticipated that this 
<br/>news  would  come  earlier,  Sir,  however,  due  to  some  logistical  and  operational  challenges  in 
<br/>preparing to operationalise, there was a delay between the approval and them starting on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  regulatory  front,  I  understand  that  during  this  period,  some 
<br/>individuals and businesses had purchased Starlink kits from abroad and Starlink is currently working 
<br/>with TAF, to ensure that all Starlink devices and services operating in Fiji are compliant with our 
<br/>regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see from the Starlink website that there are packages available for personal and business use 
<br/>already, and I am sure that this will catapult the internet in our underserved regions, providing new 
<br/>opportunities for education, health, business and personal communication. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would  also  like to  urge our local  telecommunications operators to  take advantage of the 
<br/>opportunities presented by Starlink’s entry into our market.  I understand that our providers have

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been  partnering  with  other  satellite  providers  to  provide  this  connectivity  to  remote  and  rural 
<br/>communities.    By  leveraging  this  technology,  operators  have  further  options  to  provide  backhaul 
<br/>services  to  areas  that  were  previously  unreachable  or  prohibitively  expensive  to  connect.    This 
<br/>collaboration  will  further  enhance  our  national  connectivity  and  will  contribute  to  ensure  that  no 
<br/>region is left behind in our digital transformation journey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  important  to  note  that  satellite  internet  connectivity 
<br/>through  LEOs  is  not  a  panacea  to  all  our  challenges  in  providing  meaningful  connectivity  to  our 
<br/>people. Like everything in life, Sir, it has its advantages and disadvantages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While satellite connectivity has a pivotal role, particularly in reaching the most remote areas 
<br/>and  especially  in  disaster  management,  terrestrial  communication  technologies  play  an  equally 
<br/>critical role in our national connectivity.  Terrestrial communication technologies, such as fibre optic 
<br/>networks and cellular infrastructure, are advancing rapidly.  Two of our service providers are making 
<br/>significant strides in this area and are continuing their 5G testing right now and providing live user 
<br/>trials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  November  last  year,  I  briefed  Parliament  on  Google’s  South  Pacific 
<br/>Connect  initiative  in  Fiji  and  today,  I  would  like  to  share  an  update  on  the  ongoing  efforts.  The 
<br/>Ministry, through our Trade Commission in San Francisco and the team at Investment Fiji, have been 
<br/>working  closely  with  Google,  to  ensure  that  adequate  assistance  is  provided  as  Google  works  to 
<br/>complete regulatory compliances and further their engagements in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had recently led a Trade Mission to North America as part of the North America Business 
<br/>Mission where key members of the Fiji Delegation met with representatives of the Google Network 
<br/>Infrastructure for a project update.  Google’s Vice President of Global Network Infrastructure was 
<br/>one of the keynote speakers at the North America Business Forum that was held in San Francisco on 
<br/>8</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, and this shows the company's commitment, not only in its investment in Fiji but also 
<br/>being a reputable partner, showcasing Fiji's capabilities to potential investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alongside this, our Director-General Digital Government Transformation, Cybersecurity and 
<br/>Communications  was  attending  the  Cyber  and  Tech  Retreat  and  was  initiating  discussions  with 
<br/>Google's  Vice  President,  Government  Affairs  and  Public  Policy  on  other  areas  of  collaboration, 
<br/>utilising  new  and  emerging  technologies  and  also  artificial  intelligence.  These  demonstrate,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, a coordinated and extensive approach that we</span><span> </span><span>are taking. I am looking forward to many 
<br/>more collaborative and strategic partnerships and initiatives as a result of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the Honomoana and Tabua subsea cables that was recently announced, Google 
<br/>has  also  announced  that  it  will  deliver  two  new  intra-Pacific  cables,  namely,  the  Bulikula  and 
<br/>Halaihai, in collaboration with Amalgamated Telecom Holdings (ATH), APTelecom and Telstra, to 
<br/>increase digital connectivity in the Central Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bulikula cable will connect Guam with Fiji and potentially onward to South-East Asia, 
<br/>while the second cable will link Guam, French Polynesia through to Fiji and onward potentially to 
<br/>South America.   This will form a ring between Guam, French Polynesia and Fiji, while connecting 
<br/></span><span>Fiji to Australia and the United States. The ring will also include pre-positioned branching units, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, that will allow other Pacific Island countries to set up connections - a second connection. 
<br/>This  will  make  Fiji  truly  the  hub  of  the  Pacific  and  continue  this  Government's  desire  to  create 
<br/>benefits for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to share the promising future that subsea internet investment 
<br/>has for our nation. According to a report titled, "Connecting Fiji: The opportunity for growth and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>763 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperity from subsea cable internet investment" by a company called Access Partnership, the new 
<br/>subsea  cable  infrastructure  is  set  to  significantly  enhance  our  economic  output  through  increased 
<br/>internet usage by reducing IP transit prices and network latency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  more  dynamic  local  subsea  cable  market  is  projected  to  lower  IP  transit  prices  by  1.4 
<br/>percent annually, spurring higher internet data traffic growth by, at least, 0.9 percent each year.  These 
<br/>advancements are estimated to boost our global GDP by US$295 million by 2030, and create nearly 
<br/>3,600 jobs, representing 1 percent of our 2019 figures. Investing in subsea internet  
<br/>infrastructure is a significant step towards a more prosperous and connected Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  initiatives  reiterate  the  Coalition  Government's  understanding  that  a  resilient  and 
<br/>modern ICT infrastructure is the backbone of any digital transformation effort in Fiji. Therefore, we 
<br/>have earmarked various key Government services to be digitised through our ongoing Business Now 
<br/>Project.  Phase 1 will involve digitising several "Starting a Business" services and Phase 2 involves 
<br/>automating the approval through Town and Country Planning.  This will truly transform how the 
<br/>technology  is  being  used  in  Government  and  the  good  news  is  we  would  not  be  stopping  there.  
<br/>Through the platform  that  is  being  provided which is  called  Fiji  Integrated Licences  and Permits 
<br/>Approval System (FILPAS), we will be able to digitise more of the licensing processes and permits 
<br/>across all the Ministries quite rapidly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a National Digital Strategy being developed for 
<br/>Fiji.  In fact, next week, we are holding the validation workshop for the strategy.  That is how fast, 
<br/>Sir, we are moving in terms of digital transformation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also planning at the commencement of the  Budget to fully announce our desire to 
<br/>connect the unconnected around the country. We have a bit of money in the Trust Accounts, and we 
<br/>will  put  that  to  good  use,  also  inviting  some  development  partners  to  top  it  up to  ensure  that  we 
<br/>connect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  things  that  is  becoming  obvious  as  well  is  that,  with  this  improved  ICT 
<br/>infrastructure or enhanced ICT infrastructure, we will need to position the education curriculum to 
<br/>be able to capture the benefits from this new emerging restructure of the Fijian economy.  To the 
<br/>students of Marist Brothers, start looking for jobs in IT and technology.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the vast adoption of digital technologies by our people, we are also 
<br/>mindful that this will also increase the threat landscape. Therefore, we are undertaking parallel efforts 
<br/>to bolster our cybersecurity efforts, and I will speak more on this in my response to the motion that 
<br/>the honourable Attorney General will be tabling today on the adoption of the Budapest Convention. 
<br/>One thing is clear, Sir, these ICT developments reiterate the need for Government to accede to the 
<br/>Budapest  Convention  as  it  is  the  only  international  treaty  that  is  dealing  with  cybercrime  and 
<br/>electronic evidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, the entry of Starlink into Fiji’s market, as well as Google’s ongoing 
<br/>project and our digitalization efforts, marks an exciting new chapter in our efforts to expand internet access, 
<br/>improve connectivity and make services accessible for all. These initiatives underscore our commitment to 
<br/></span><span>bridging the digital divide and ensuring that all our people have the tools and opportunities to succeed in the 
<br/></span><span>digital age. The Coalition Government remains dedicated to supporting and fostering such advancements, 
<br/>and we look forward to the numerous benefits that these ICT developments will bring to our nation, and to 
<br/>the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, together, we are building a more connected, inclusive, and prosperous Fiji, and by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extension, a prosperous Pacific region. Thank you for this opportunity, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.29 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we have only five minutes, I will try and be as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quick as possible, with all the information that I have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I take my hat off to the honourable Minister with respect to moving the ICT 
<br/>section forward and doing so much work, in terms of continuity also in terms of growing Fiji.  As we 
<br/>all  know,  Sir,  Fiji,  despite  our  geographical  challenges,  we  remain  one  of  the  most  developed 
<br/>countries in terms of ICT in our region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I took a cursory glance over a report that was done by the Department of Commerce from 
<br/>USA, and this is coming from the International Trade Administration.  They have done a thorough 
<br/>examination of our system - this is for investors to have a look at and there are some very good bits 
<br/>of  critical  information  that  have  come  up.    So,  in  that  report,  they  have mentioned  how  we  have 
<br/>benefitted  from  it  and  this  is  totally  independent  of  what  we  may  say  from  different  sides  of 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It basically spelt out how we benefitted from an extensive submarine cable networking which 
<br/>connects Fiji to neighbouring Pacific islands, we have operators, like Vodafone Fiji, Amalgamated 
<br/>Telecom Holdings (ATH), Telecom Fiji Limited, Digicel Fiji, and now we have Starlink as part of 
<br/>the whole ICT landscape.  We still have a small issue regarding 5 percent of our country still not 
<br/>having mobile network coverage, but this inclusion by Starlink will benefit our rural communities.  
<br/>The only thing that I see, and I had a chat with the honourable Minister about this, it may be a little 
<br/>cost prohibitive, at the moment, for our rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my five minutes, I want to emphasize here, and I hope the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>will  support  the  honourable  Minister  for  Trade  in  may  be  looking  at  an  avenue  where  we  can 
<br/>subsidise  this  so  that  our  communities  are  able  to  access  this  particular  Starlink  services  being 
<br/>provided because right now, it is very cost prohibitive, and it is in its infancy status.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister of Finance, on behalf of the rural people, I think we both speak the same 
<br/>language so, please, ensure and maybe there is some subsidy to our rural communities with respect 
<br/>to the service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our ICT platform, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been fantastic.  We have got mobile money which 
<br/>was introduced to us in Fiji where we can pay our bills, we can deposit, and we can also withdraw.  
<br/>It is actually a phenomenal platform to build on. But there are things that we must open our eyes to 
<br/>and be very careful about and I think the report itself actually says it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are recent regional studies that have been done that have said that with the increased 
<br/>connectivity that we have, the region faces risks, and these particular risks are cyber-attacks.  When 
<br/>you get into this particular space, you are also getting into the illegal space where you are actually 
<br/>going to be very, very vulnerable.  The potential for this to cause financial loss and harm is actually 
<br/>great, fraud in terms of unauthorized access to banking, et cetera, all of those things, and the well-
<br/>being of our citizens is at stake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we do this, whilst we open up and whilst we make this landscape modern in terms of 
<br/>a modern nation State and look at it like that, we must be very wary of these particular cyber-attacks 
<br/>that actually happen.  Mobile security applications and software applications will also be increasingly 
<br/>in demand.

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it helps our business process outsourcing area and that was an area that we 
<br/>looked at which was going to be a phenomenal amount of business for Fiji.  Also in the cyber-security 
<br/>operations, we could actually benefit out of all of this.  As I  have said, Telecom Fiji Limited is a 
<br/>regulator and that is something that we would need to look at, honourable Attorney-General, in terms 
<br/>of the regulations or laws that need to be put into this space.  The modernization of these laws is a 
<br/>very important area but, at the same time, we must not have blinkers on, we must look at it in terms 
<br/>of how we can protect it and make sure that we protect our citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have only got 15 seconds left but I did promise the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that I was being supportive of this.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Logging Operations in the Maritime Islands 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable  Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and 
<br/>gentlemen; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the progress of our logging operation in the 
<br/>maritime islands, a vital project that contributes to our economy and supports our local communities, 
<br/>a project where Government has also re-strategised and invested heavily in since this financial year, 
<br/>recognising and addressing the plight of our resource owners on these islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total area of pine to be harvested in Muani, Kadavu, for this project 
<br/>amounts  to  83  hectares  -  a  significant  undertaking  that  requires  careful  planning,  considerable 
<br/>logistics and inter-agency coordination before execution.  I am pleased to announce that $600,000 
<br/>was released last Friday from the Ministry of Finance to meet the barge costs for Muani. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  groundwork  costs,  including  field  verification  for  stocktaking  as  a 
<br/>requirement for harvesting licence and Muani Jetty scoping works came to a total of $13,500.  The 
<br/>barge grant of $600,000 will cover the transportation of six barge loads, each carrying 2,000 tonnes 
<br/>from Muani to Lautoka Port.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  report  that  the  logging  companies,  Drelaga  Holdings 
<br/>Limited and Burning Bush Pte Limited, are currently conducting logging in Muani.  The expected 
<br/>first load is scheduled for 1</span><span>st</span><span> June, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to highlight the details of the machines that make up the 
<br/>logging fleet currently in Muani - a total of four John Deer Skidders, three CAT Bell Loaders, one 
<br/>CAT Front loader, one CAT Bulldozer and three trucks – one 12-wheeler and two 10 wheelers.  In 
<br/>addition,  four  twin  cabs  are  used  as  standby  vehicles  on  site.    These  machines  and  vehicles  are 
<br/>essential  for  the  successful  transportation,  stacking  and  stockpiling  of  logs  at  every  stage  of  our 
<br/>operation as per standard requirement of harvesting plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The harvesting crew consists of 30 dedicated contractors, each with their own specific roles, 
<br/>from machine operators to chainsaw operators, all working together to ensure the smooth operation 
<br/></span><span>of  our  harvesting  project.    These  workers  are  currently  camping  in  the  village  of  Muani,  with 
<br/></span><span>accommodation provided by the landowners for the comfort and convenience of the contractors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With guidance from the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), the port construction is anticipated to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be completed on 24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, subject to favourable weather conditions.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, importantly, the landowners will be paid by Tropik Wood Industries Ltd at 
<br/>the rate of $60 per tonne, resulting in an expected total payout of $0.8 million. This financial support 
<br/>will  not  only  benefit  the  landowners  but  also  underlines  our  commitment  to  fostering  positive 
<br/>relationships with our communities who are relying on Government for technical support towards 
<br/>investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same initiative has been projected for Lakeba whereby another $250,000 
<br/>has been released as an additional grant to Fiji Pine Trust from the Ministry of Finance.  This will be 
<br/>for the construction of a port in Wainiyabia, Lakeba in consultation with the Fiji Roads Authority.  
<br/>The Forest Power House, a company that will be contracted to construct the Lakeba Port is expected 
<br/>to  start  before  the  month  end.    The  harvesting  licence  is  currently  being  progressed  to  ensure  all 
<br/>requirements are complied with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the expected return for the landowners in Lakeba will be $960,000 for the 
<br/>initial licence area of 83 hectares.  The total area stocked in Lakeba is about 700 hectares and licences 
<br/>will be progressively determined based on current levels of compliance and preparation of harvesting 
<br/>plans for identified viable areas suitable for harvesting.   The Ministry is working closely with the 
<br/>Fiji Pine Trust in developing a 20-Year Forest Management Plan with harvesting schedules for all 
<br/>pine schemes in the maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Narocake Pine Scheme in Gau has also been assisted through Forestry’s 
<br/>Pine Development Capital Project in processing pine posts.  The Ministry has committed a total of 
<br/>$25,000 and produced a volume of 79 cubic metres worth of $59,724.75 from these sales.  With these 
<br/>funds, the Narocake Pine Scheme also was able to purchase a three-tonne canopy truck together with 
<br/>the assistance from the Ministry of Trade and Co-operatives, the Scheme managed to develop the 
<br/>Narocake Co-operative Limited as part of our Community Development Programme for Fiji Pine 
<br/>Trust grant and Head 32 - Maritime Pine Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  Head  50,  Moala  and  Lakeba  had  been  assisted  in  the  Housing 
<br/>Rehabilitation Programme.  A total of 82.5 cubic metres for Moala, which is equivalent to 15 house 
<br/>frames and 60.5 cubic metres for Lakeba, which is equivalent to 11 house frames were funded.  The 
<br/>value of timber harvested and processed for Lakeba house frames is $66,550 and $90,750 for Moala.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are various measurable outputs and outcomes from these maritime 
<br/>project  support  and  beneficiaries,  including  the  communities,  private  sectors  and  the  nation  as  a 
<br/>whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the communities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial benefits:  This includes the payment of $60 per tonne to landowners, resulting in 
<br/>a total payout of $0.8 million.  This direct financial support will enhance the livelihoods of 
<br/>the local landowners and their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Employment  opportunities  for  the  communities:    The  project  will  create  numerous  job 
<br/>opportunities  in  logging,  transportation,  and  pot  operations,  leading  to  increased 
<br/></span><span>employment in the local communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure development:  The construction and upgrading of port facilities, guided by 
<br/>the Fiji Roads Authority will improve local infrastructure, providing long-term benefits to 
<br/>the communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the private sector will also benefit through:

<div><span>Business  opportunities:    The  logistics  and  transportation  sectors  will  benefit  from  the 
<br/>movement of six barge loads, each carrying 2000 tonnes of logs, creating new business 
<br/>opportunities and partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable practice:  By adhering to sustainable logging practice the private sector can 
<br/>demonstrate its commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate social responsibility, 
<br/>enhancing its reputation to ensuring a long-term viability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the nation as a whole, there will be:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Expected economic growth:  The overall economic contribution of this logging operation, 
<br/>including job-creation and business opportunities will support national economic growth.   
<br/>- 
<br/>Sustainable  Development:    the  project  aligns  with  our  national  goals  of  promoting 
<br/>sustainable practices ensuring that our natural resources are managed responsibly for future 
<br/>generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enhanced Infrastructure: the improvements in port facilities and related infrastructure will 
<br/>have lasting positive impacts on national logistics and capabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the cooperation and assistance of our financial and investment partners 
<br/>we  are  confident  that  this  long  overdue  harvesting  of  matured  maritime  pine  project  will  yield 
<br/>positive  outcomes  for  all  stakeholders  involved.    Together,  we  can  continue  to  drive  economic 
<br/>growth, promote sustainable practices, ensure improved livelihoods and support the wellbeing of our 
<br/>people.  Thank you for this opportunity, </span><span>vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to 
<br/>respond to the honourable Minister’s Statement.  I also wish to thank the honourable Minister for this 
<br/>initiative in cultivating the pine plantations in the maritime islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of these pine trees have been standing from 40 to 50 years and most have been destroyed 
<br/></span><span>by cyclone or fire.  So, the holdings now that are available for logging will be much lesser than what 
<br/>was initially planted 40 years ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  Government  for  responding  to  the  request.    Most  of  these  pine 
<br/>plantations run under the scheme of landowners.  The planting of the pine was done on an ad hoc 
<br/>basis where the advice to the landowners who were providing the labourers to actually plant the pine 
<br/>seedlings in the initial stage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, planting  of the pine were done on an  </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> basis and I mean some of the pine were 
<br/></span><span>planted on the hillside which the landowners now find difficulty in accessing them.  I can say that 
<br/>around Ono in Kadavu the landowners introduced bullocks to pull pine logs, but they had difficulty, 
<br/>and  I  am  thankful  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  initiating  this  plan  to  try  and  harvest  this  pine 
<br/>scheme.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>769 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister stated that they have allocated $250,000 for a jetty at Wainiyabia.  I 
<br/>would urge him to check that amount if it will be able to build a jetty. I know for a fact that deep 
<br/>waters in Wainiyabia is about 200 metres from the shoreline, $250,000, I think is at the lower end of 
<br/>the scale.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with the honourable Minister that the development on the infrastructure, roads and 
<br/>wharves to be built to access this pine logging would give access to other natural resources, farmers 
<br/>will be able to access their farms and will provide the impetus for them to farm and sell their products 
<br/>to the market.  I think that is a positive outlook that can be reached out of this scheme that is going 
<br/>on now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  understand  if  the  logs  are  left  to  stand  without  this  assistance,  these  logs  will  finally  be 
<br/>destroyed.    The  landowners  do  not  have  the  capacity  nor  the  financial  background  to  be  able  to 
<br/>harvest even though they had laboured in the past 40 years not only to plant these pine plantations 
<br/>but also to look after them during all these years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a positive move and I urge the Government to provide more assistance to the Fiji Pine 
<br/>Trust which has been looking after this pine plantation for the last 30 years.  I understand that Fiji 
<br/>Pine initiated this move but found out that it was uneconomical midway 20 years or 30 years ago and 
<br/>abandoned the initiative and that responsibility was given to the Fiji Pine Trust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would urge that more funding is given to the Fiji Pine Trust to assist them to assist all the 
<br/>landowners who are owners of these pine schemes. They are isolated and with the distance from the 
<br/>market,  it  is  quite  difficult  for  them  to  transport  to  either  Lautoka  or  the  other  markets  that  are 
<br/>available to resale these commodities to merchants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for realistic and I hope that this initiative 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will go to the other islands in the maritime zone of Lomaiviti, Lau and in Kadavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s Transition to Open Skies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; I am honored to enlighten this distinguished Parliament regarding the Open 
<br/>Skies Air Services Agreements in relation to Fiji’s Aviation Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji's  aviation  sector  is  pivotal,  linking  Fijians  globally,  bolstering  tourism,  trade  and 
<br/>employment,  and  serving  our  Pacific  communities.  It  is  a  cornerstone  of  economic  activity,  with 
<br/>various metrics highlighting its significance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has endorsed amending the Civil Aviation Policy 
<br/>to adopt open skies on a case-by-case basis, recognising both global benefits and regional challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  industry  is  a  global  connector,  fostering  interactions  among  people,  cultures,  and 
<br/>businesses. It is a substantial economic contributor, with the International Air Transport Association 
<br/></span><span>(IATA) reporting that Fiji's air transport, including airlines and their supply chain, supports US$465 
<br/></span><span>billion of GDP, with foreign tourism adding US$1.7 billion, totaling 43 percent of the nation's GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the challenges, aviation has shown resilience and growth, doubling in size every 15 
<br/>years.  Fiji's  aviation  policy  framework  aims  to  enhance  connectivity,  ensuring  efficient  market 
<br/>access,  air  navigation,  aircraft  and  airport  systems,  and  security,  yielding  benefits  like  improved 
<br/>travel experiences, economic growth, and increased traffic.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the aviation industry's access to markets worldwide relies heavily on the Air 
<br/>Services Agreement (ASA). Also known as air transport agreements or bilateral and multilateral air 
<br/>agreements,  these  contracts  between  countries  set  the  terms  and  regulations  for  international  air 
<br/>transport  services.    They  provide  the  framework  for  airlines  from  participating  countries  to  offer 
<br/>passenger and cargo services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an illustration, Fiji has 27 traditional bilateral ASAs with other nations.  For instance, our 
<br/>current ASA with the United States permits Fiji Airways to fly to Honolulu, San Francisco, and Los 
<br/>Angeles.  Any expansion to additional US destinations would require further negotiations between 
<br/>the Fijian and US Governments.  Efforts over the past few years to amend this Agreement with the 
<br/>United States have been  
<br/>unsuccessful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The United States is a leader in Open Skies ASAs and has always viewed Fiji Aviation Policy 
<br/>as  restrictive.  Traditional  ASAs  govern  several  critical  areas,  including  airline  designation, 
<br/>ownership  and  control,  routes  and  capacity,  tariffs  and  pricing,  safety  and  security,  customs  and 
<br/>immigration, as well as code-sharing and alliances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, traditional bilateral  ASAs often involved reciprocal  benefits,  where each 
<br/>country secured advantages for their carriers, sometimes neglecting consumer interests. Increasing 
<br/>international market access for air service providers is crucial for maximizing the air transport sector's 
<br/>economic  contribution.  Liberalization,  as  seen  in  open-skies  agreements,  reduces  regulations  on 
<br/>capacity and frequency, fostering competition, promoting travel and trade, and boosting productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Open skies agreements allow unlimited commercial services by designated airlines without 
<br/>needing  explicit  ministerial  approval  for  routes,  capacity,  frequency  and  pricing.  Sovereignty  is 
<br/>preserved,  with  interventions  limited  to  safety  and  security.  These  agreements  liberalize  and 
<br/>deregulate  the  international  aviation  market.  Key  features  include  no  route  restrictions,  unlimited 
<br/>frequency and capacity, and deregulated pricing, where airlines set fares based on market conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the degree of "sky openness" is determined by the nine "freedoms of the air" 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outlined in the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First Freedom: Fly across a country without landing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1. 
<br/>2.   Second Freedom: Land for non-traffic purposes. 
<br/>3.   Third Freedom: Drop off passengers from the airline's home country. 
<br/>4.   Fourth Freedom: Pick up passengers to take to the airline's home country. 
<br/>5.   Fifth Freedom: Carry passengers between two foreign countries during flights that also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>touch the airline's home country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond these, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) considers the additional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>freedoms "so-called" as they are not widely recognised by treaty: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sixth Freedom: Carry passengers between two foreign countries via the airline’s home 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.   Seventh Freedom: Operate flights between two foreign countries without touching the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>airline's home country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.   Eighth  Freedom:  Transport  cabotage  traffic  between  two  points  within  a  foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country, as part of a flight to/from the home country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.   Ninth Freedom: Transport cabotage traffic entirely within a foreign country. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>771 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, bilateral Open Skies ASAs provide unrestricted market access, including 
<br/>Third Freedom, Fourth Freedom and Fifth Freedom traffic rights, capacity, frequencies, code-sharing 
<br/>and tariffs. The first Agreement was signed in 1992 between the Netherlands and the United States. 
<br/>Since then, over 300 such Agreements have been signed involving more than 150 countries, with the 
<br/>US leading with 119 Agreements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many countries have  also  signed  Open Skies  Agreements  with  the  European  Union or its 
<br/>members. Open Skies Agreements have driven the continuous growth of air traffic. These measures 
<br/>enhance market and capital access, leading to better connectivity, sustainable economic development, 
<br/>and stronger, more passenger-friendly carriers and airports. Opening the air transport market results 
<br/>in more efficient airspace utilisation, competitive fares and more travel choices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liberalisation positively impacts tourism, employment and the economy. Improved air cargo 
<br/>connectivity  boosts  productivity,  opens  new  markets,  enhances  exports  and  increases  domestic 
<br/>market competition from foreign producers. The push for regulatory convergence on liberalisation 
<br/>and competition at bilateral and regional levels underscores its importance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we are now embracing open skies boldly. The Maldives, similar to other 
<br/>Small Island Developing States, like Fiji, faces limitations due to small land mass and high transport 
<br/>costs.  However, its open skies policy has eliminated isolation issues, ensuring good connections to 
<br/>labour and markets.   In  2023, the Maldives welcomed 1,878,537 visitors, a 12.1 percent increase 
<br/>from 2022, showing the benefits of open skies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our neighbours Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, have adopted open skies 
<br/>policies, reaping benefits such as increased travel and trade, enhanced productivity and high-quality 
<br/>job creation. We must envision a future without constraints. While Fiji previously believed that open 
<br/>skies were unsuitable for small economies, this has not been tested. Our Coalition Government is 
<br/>now promoting and adopting open skies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  with  liberalisation,  discussions  are  underway  with  the  United  States  to 
<br/>finalize an Open Skies Agreement, allowing our national airline to operate to various US destinations, 
<br/>thereby boosting trade and tourism.  We support our national airline and are committed to elevating 
<br/>our economic growth through enhanced air connectivity, competition and better consumer choices.  
<br/>We have embraced open skies in our Aviation Policy, to ensure Fiji is not left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  fully  supports  our  national  airline's  network 
<br/>diversification plans to enhance profitability through the open skies policies.  We believe Open Skies 
<br/>Agreements  will  enable  airlines  to  operate  commercially,  allocate  capital  efficiently  and  adapt  to 
<br/>changes.  This  policy  will  help  our  national  airline  expand,  optimise  capacity  and  ownership,  and 
<br/>improve return on investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will, however, closely monitor global open skies trends to ensure no negative impact on 
<br/>our national airline. We have taken a balanced approach to liberalisation, providing flexibility and 
<br/>freedom, while ensuring local air transport remains profitable and continuous.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  commits  to  evaluating  Open  Skies  Agreements  individually,  considering  economic, 
<br/></span><span>strategic and operational factors. We support this transition to open skies, working with stakeholders 
<br/>to ensure it aligns with national objectives.  This policy balances global open skies trends with Fiji's 
<br/>unique context, emphasising flexibility, pragmatism and national interests.  For tourism, Fiji achieved 
<br/>a  significant  milestone  by  welcoming  a  record  929,740  visitors  in  2023.  This  surge  in  tourism 
<br/>contributed to over FJ$3.3 billion in revenue, exceeding our financial goals a year ahead of schedule.

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking forward into 2024, we expect a steady growth in visitor arrivals, projected to increase 
<br/>by  2  percent  to  5  percent,  compared  to  the  previous  year.  With  improved  airline  capacity,  we 
<br/>anticipate better accessibility to our islands at an average of 8 percent to 12 percent increase in flights. 
<br/>The thriving investment environment in Fiji, marked by the opening of new resorts and the launch of 
<br/>significant developments, signals a strong investment scene, promising a bright future for our tourism 
<br/>sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  next  four  years,  we  plan  to  grow  our  visitor  economy  by  an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>additional $1 billion and that is very exciting, indeed, for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was horrified by the poor attitude shown by honourable Maharaj towards Tourism.  He said 
<br/>on  Monday,  and  I  quote,  “Vanua  Levu  economy  does  not  depend  on  tourism,  we  do  not  rely  on 
<br/>tourism”.  Mr. Speaker, Vanua Levu has huge potential for tourism and tourists increase its share for 
<br/>the billions in tourism and help make more billions from tourism for Fiji.  He scoffed at the US$200 
<br/>billion  that  will  be  deployed  in  Vanua  Levu  to  improve  the  infrastructure  and  improve  the 
<br/>opportunities for tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very poor, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is $447 million, Mr. Speaker.  I wish you would all agree that 
<br/>tourism is important also for Vanua Levu, and for the Coalition Government, we are plying apply 
<br/>about US$200 million to create an environment conducive to the tourism industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-   $10 million hotel development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I know, Mr. Speaker, that the air fare is still high in Vanua Levu, but 
<br/>with  these  improved  investments,  improve  in  infrastructure,  with  ATR    landing  in  Taveuni  and 
<br/>Labasa and better connectivity in Savusavu with frequency and volume, the air fares will come down.  
<br/>It is simple economics, so we are getting there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You have no idea, no idea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- With more frequency and more volume, the air fare will come down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is not aggressively/drastically stopping at all these programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Open Skies policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to significantly enhance Fiji’s tourism 
<br/>industry,  a  major  source  of  revenue  and  employment.    This  policy  change,  is  set  to  create  new 
<br/>opportunities for Fiji’s tourism and aviation industries, improve connectivity and potentially increase 
<br/>visitor numbers, which are crucial for the island nation’s economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Open  Skies  offer  significant  economic  benefits  for 
<br/>consumers, airlines, airports, communities and economies.  Increasing international market access to 
<br/>our national airline is crucial for maximising the air transport sector’s economic contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us unite in support of Fiji Airways and allow it to thrive under the Open Skies Policy.

<div><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I want to reiterate, I have only got five minutes 
<br/>but  I want  to start  off with the quote from a message delivered by  the honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation on 7</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023, which is a good date to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remember because 7</span><span>th</span><span> is my birthday, and I quote:  “For a small country like Fiji, you cannot go for 
<br/>open skies because when you go for open skies, the big boys … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Case by case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Not case by case, just listen. This was only 12 months ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “When  you  go  for  open  skies,  the  big  boys  can  come  and  compete  with  our  national 
<br/>airlines and that will be damaging for us, and we need our airlines to survive.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- 12 months ago he said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- There are many things.  We all support tourism… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It’s on a one-on-one basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  But  remember  this,  open  skies  could  be  the  death  warrant  for  Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airways, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  two  of  the  most  important  people  in  the  industry  would  be  the  Minister 
<br/>responsible for Tourism and Civil Aviation and the CEO of Fiji Airways.  Let me quote about what 
<br/>the CEO for Fiji Airways, Mr. Andre Viljoen, actually said in June 2018.  He expressed concerns 
<br/>about the impact of open skies policy on a small national carrier, like Fiji Airways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what you call, ‘flipping and flopping’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  the  same  CEO,  and  he  warned  that  while 
<br/>increased competition might lower airfares, it could also lead to the demise of the national airlines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, this very airline saved our behind during COVID-19, so we 
<br/>must protect it at all costs, Sir.  If we start even thinking about Open Skies, he spoke about all the 
<br/>different freedoms, Mr. Speaker, we are asking for trouble if we really go down the road because his 
<br/>narrative now, his open skies, what can we do for Fiji?  Sir, we have not even done our homework 
<br/>with respect to that at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He mentioned Maldives very proudly.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, Maldives  does not  even have an 
<br/>international  airline anymore because of this  Open  Skies Policy.   He is buried and dead, Sir.  We 
<br/></span><span>cannot, we must not, and we should not ever go down this road where we are actually going to write 
<br/></span><span>and basically write a death warrant for Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what changed in the last 12 months? What has actually changed? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, no, he has changed.  The CEO of Fiji Airways has changed.  Do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wave because I do not think you know anything about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Countries that have adopted Open Skies policy, invariably, what happens is that the larger 
<br/>airlines actually come in and cannibalise the local airlines.  Sir, we cannot  compete, but we have 
<br/>done this in such a sustainable fashion uptil now.  Why can we not continue to do so? We cannot 
<br/>even cater for more tourists, at the moment, because we do not have the necessary hotels.  We need 
<br/>to concentrate on building more hotels, so that is probably what the target should be, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking about Open Skies now should be something at a very much later 
<br/>stage.  We need to put more rooms on the ground.  Investments and policies need to be created for 
<br/>that.  We have had office from the Emirates, the US, so why are we now pandering to all those things 
<br/>that we should not  be doing  right now, because the necessary infrastructure with  respect  to  more 
<br/>tourists in Fiji is not on the ground yet?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want tourism to grow, I am telling you, honourable Minister.  Of course, we want tourism 
<br/>to grow.  We want tourism to grow in the North, we want tourism to grow in my side of the country 
<br/>- the West even more, Sir, but we cannot do this in an unsustainable fashion.  We must always ensure 
<br/>that when we speak, we check every single word that we actually say.  He only said this 12 months 
<br/>ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you sign this ASA agreement, there are Fifth and Sixth Freedoms, et 
<br/>cetera, that he actually spoke about.  You must be very wise about how you do this.  The previous 
<br/>Permanent  Secretaries  at  Civil  Aviation  have  also  spoken  about  this,  Andre  Viljoen  himself  has 
<br/>actually spoken about this, he himself has spoken about this, the former Minister for Civil Aviation 
<br/>has spoken  about  this  -  all were on the same page.   Why is  he changing now, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  
<br/>Please, honourable Minister, be very careful where you tread with respect to Open Skies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! No running commentaries, honourable Members.  The speaker has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spoken and that is it.

<div><span>Financial Management Information System 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin my Ministerial Statement, I 
<br/>think honourable Koya was a bit more excited than I thought he would be.  I think the idea of Open 
<br/>Skies  ASA  is  actually  a  contractual  framework  between  a  service  provider  and  a  client,  which 
<br/>specifies a number of different aspects of how it is going to be done.   So, all that hoo-haa about Open 
<br/>Skies and suddenly things will end is not going to happen because the Agreement itself is going to 
<br/>be looked at carefully. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me provide an update on the replacement of the Government’s Financial 
<br/></span><span>Management Information System, which is scheduled to go live on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024.  What is the 
<br/>Financial Management System and Payroll System?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  been  undergoing  numerous  reforms  to 
<br/>modernise its IT systems and processes and had embarked on a major IT project to replace the current 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>775 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two-decade  old  Financial  Management  Information  System  (FMIS)  and  the  40-year-old  payroll 
<br/>system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIS system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the accounting system for the whole of Government.  
<br/>So, each year, when the Budget is prepared and approved by Parliament, the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>uploads  the  entire  Budget  Appropriation  on  FMIS.    Funds  are  allocated  to  individual  Heads  of 
<br/>appropriations,  which  is  managed  by  the  respective  Permanent  Secretaries  who  are  the  Chief 
<br/>Accounting Officers for their Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the financial year when a Ministry wants to procure an item, the accounting staff of 
<br/>that agency will get on to FMIS and make a commitment to issue an LPO.   Once the item is supplied 
<br/>and the invoice is issued by the supplier, the LPO will be closed in the FMIS, and a payment will be 
<br/>generated online with funds transferred to the respective bank account of the vendor.  This, then, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, creates an accounting transaction which gets recorded in the FMIS.  Such transactions 
<br/>happen daily in different agencies throughout the financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart  from  this,  there  are  other  known  expenditure  and  accounting  processes  including 
<br/>Request  to  Incur  Expenditure  (RIE),  virements,  cashflow  adjustments,  excess  approvals, 
<br/>reconciliations, redeployments and procurement processes that continue throughout the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once  the  financial  year  is  completed,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FMIS  is  used  to  generate  all 
<br/>financial  reports  that  are  then  audited  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General,  submitted  back  to 
<br/>Parliament for further debate and scrutiny on the use of public funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these processes used to be done manually around 20 years ago.  However, 
<br/>the former SDL Government, led by the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase, then instituted a major financial 
<br/>reform between 2004 to 2006, which included the roll out of the current FMIS system that we are 
<br/>using.    I  think  it  was  a  forward-looking  strategy  and  thinking  and  system  change  by  the  SDL 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back then, the size of the budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was only around 25 percent of the current 
<br/>Government  spending.  The  number  of  users  were  also  significantly  lower,  and  the  volume  of 
<br/>transactions were also small.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, we also had a "stand-alone" Payroll System which used to pay the salaries of all 
<br/>civil servants, including Parliamentarians like us. This system is centrally managed by the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance to pay the salaries of about 35,000 civil servants. This payroll system was not integrated 
<br/>with the FMIS. In layman's language, the two systems, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were not talking to each 
<br/>other.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we came into Government 17 months ago, the Permanent Secretary 
<br/>for Finance and his team provided me a briefing on the state of the economy and public finances, on 
<br/>the current systems and processes of the Ministry of Finance, the legislations and policies that guide 
<br/>the operations of the Ministry, and our major deliverables and plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During that briefing, I was quite shocked when they highlighted to me about the challenges 
<br/></span><span>with  the  current  FMIS  system  and  a  very  desperate  and  shocking  situation  with  the  40-year-old 
<br/>Payroll System.  This was highlighted as the highest operational and accountability risk, not only for 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Finance,  but  for  the  whole  of  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Since  then  and 
<br/>immediately after that, we made that as one of our top priorities and, with the approval of Parliament, 
<br/>for a total budget of about $14 million for a new FMIS which will have an inbuilt payroll system.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance, in fact, Mr. Speaker, did a very good job, together with the support 
<br/>from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (all the technical support was provided by ADB), and we 
<br/>embarked on developing a new system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me start with the Payroll System, Mr. Speaker, because it is important for me to explain 
<br/>what was there.  The existing payroll system was tailor-made for the Fijian Government and had been 
<br/>in existence for over 40 years since 1984.  This system was developed by a local company called 
<br/>"Solutions for Business", which was managed and operated by an individual named Mr. Barry Kay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I pay tribute to this great gentleman, who passed away later last year at the age of 86.  He was 
<br/>the only person, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who, over the years, was providing the technical backup, despite 
<br/>all the challenges and hiccups that the Ministry of Finance staff, at the back end of the activities, 
<br/>were trying to handle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this Payroll System was developed 40 years ago, it served the purpose 
<br/>at that time but, over the years, piecemeal changes were made, and the system had lagged behind and 
<br/>it was not what ought to be a modern Payroll System.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were a number of challenges that the Payroll System created for the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>staff, for the Office of the Auditor-General, for the timely production of Annual Reports and activities 
<br/>because the Payroll System was not integrated with the FMIS which was rolled out in 2006, as I have 
<br/>said, by the SDL Government. This meant that the payroll activity is actually not available on the 
<br/>FMIS on a real time basis. This lack of integration and control has led to the overspending on their 
<br/>salary budget by many agencies, year after year, and if you look at the Reports of the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, every year that issue has been highlighted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are several processes that have to be manually input into the system with no provision 
<br/>of uploads and attachments that could have brought out efficiency. Third and the most critical issue 
<br/>was that the payroll software was managed, as I had said, by a single person, who was getting on in 
<br/>his life, his health was not very good and at one point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were panicking that if 
<br/>something happens to him and the system collapses, there was no one who had been trained, except 
<br/>one person that we identified and we quickly hired her to come as a consultant and provide some 
<br/>support in case there was a disaster.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FMIS  system  had  also  become  quite  outdated  with  a  number  of 
<br/>challenges in terms of controls, reporting, efficiency and system security.  Reports had to be manually 
<br/>extracted, and part of the reason why Ministries were not able to produce annual reports on time was 
<br/>that  the  system  was  not  generating  all  these  reports  easily,  and  they  used  to  spend  a  lot  of  time 
<br/>manually extracting the information and basically, the capabilities were not there as a modern system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was, obviously, a little or no provision available to upgrade the system to meet our 
<br/>accounting  needs  which  has  evolved  and  become  more  complex  over  time.    Apart  from  this,  the 
<br/>current FMIS is only accessible through GOVNET, which means that staff cannot directly access 
<br/>FMIS from homes or other locations if they want to work and look at how the challenges could be 
<br/>met.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The engagement of ADB, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provided us with a lot of technical support, with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the experience that the ADB had in putting in place this, sort of, systems around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ADB’s technical assessment, as a first step, it was very clear that the 
<br/>current FMIS and the Payroll System cannot be brought together in any technical way and, therefore, 
<br/>there was a need for a new system. We immediately made sure that we went through an international 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>777 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>local  tender  process,  and  this  went  through  a  technical  evaluation  committee  and  the  tender  was 
<br/>approved, chaired by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives 
<br/>and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  international  company  called  Bisan  Solutions  which  specialises  in 
<br/>government  Public Financial Management Systems  which has done this  in  countries such as US, 
<br/>Belgium and many others around the world, including Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The total cost 
<br/>is  estimated  to  be  around  $12  million,  and  when  everything  is  fully  operational,  the  backup  and 
<br/>service fee would be covered as part of that budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  say  that  after  14  months,  immediately  after  that  briefing,  we 
<br/>embarked on to it, and it has taken us 14 months of hard work to get this system ready. The training 
<br/>is all done now, to GO LIVE on 1st August - the start of the new financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the benefits of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Once we GO LIVE, the new system will 
<br/>bring about greater efficiency in our accounting processes, improve financial reporting, strengthen 
<br/>internal controls and audit trails and enhance the security of the system which will also be web-based.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  financial  processing  and  reporting  will  be  enhanced  with  real-time  transaction 
<br/>updates which is useful for management decision-making and policy formulation.  Apart from this, 
<br/>Financial Statements will be directly extracted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the system with significant 
<br/>improvements  in  timelines  for  Ministries  and Departments  in  preparation  of  accounts,  audit  and 
<br/>presentation.  In fact, Sir, we think that this will create real time production of accounts, time for 
<br/>audits and timely presentation of reports to Parliament, as it happens in many other countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also undertaking work to integrate the new FMIS with the Budget 
<br/>and Debt Management System, in fact, the whole budget process.  In fact, I was also surprised when 
<br/>I came in last year that the whole budget process is excel-based.  The Ministry of Finance is also 
<br/>working  towards  a  budget  software  which  will  be integrated  with  the  new  FMIS  at  a  later  stage 
<br/>because it is almost like doing the whole budget process manually.  That was a big concern to me in 
<br/>this day and age of technology.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new FMIS will also eliminate any manual intervention, like data punching, and majority 
<br/>of the payroll=related calculations will be possible through the new system, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It will 
<br/>also be easier to generate </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> reports and customize reports with new parameters to suit the needs 
<br/>of the users and decision-making process.  For example, we had a written question from honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar.  Those sorts of reports, Sir, is not easy right now with the current system for us to 
<br/>generate and this is why all this kind of information was always available as part of annual reports 
<br/>or audit reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that this new system, apart from making so much 
<br/>easier for the staff, for the Office of the Auditor-General or audit trails, it will also provide better 
<br/>analytics which will allow us to desegregate financial and accounting data to categories, like climate 
<br/>change, gender-based activities, simply with a click of a button. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  major  transformative  project  to  modernize  the 
<br/></span><span>Government  Financial  Management  Information  System  and  this  fits  in  well  with  all  the  major 
<br/>financial  management  reforms  that  the  Ministry has  undertaken.    I  want  to  just  quickly  highlight 
<br/>some of those: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  various  legislative  amendments  to  the  Financial  Management  Act,  Financial 
<br/>Instructions, Procurement Regulations, Audit Act, Statistics Act, with the objective to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improve  financial  management  and  governance,  including  improved  transparency, 
<br/>accountability, external oversight and greater independence to our Audit and Statistics 
<br/>Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  strengthening  of  the  budget  formulation  process  with  the  new  Public  Sector 
<br/>Investment Programme Guidelines that improves the appraisal and selection of capital 
<br/>projects with a better value for money and effectiveness in achieving the outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>We established the Strategic Planning Office which is now a fully-fledged Office within 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance, which was always there, which is also currently formulating 
<br/>the new National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Debt Management Strategy which is focused on reducing the Debt-to-GDP 
<br/>ratio, reducing the cost of debt by accessing more concessional loans to multilateral, 
<br/>bilateral  and  other  effective  liability  management  options,  and  rests  on  timely  data 
<br/>assessment and analysis that can inform policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  said,  this  is  one  of  the  major  transformative  reforms  that  the 
<br/>Government has undertaken and this should be a legacy of the Coalition Government - to provide a 
<br/>system  that  will  improve  accountability,  transparency,  audit,  timely  submission  of  reports  to 
<br/>Parliament, as well as to the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to thank the entire FMIS Team.  There are 
<br/>20 people from within the Ministry of Finance who were working almost full time, day and night, 
<br/>led by the Head of Treasury, Mr. Atin Chand, and all the staff across Government agency, for all the 
<br/>hard work because without them, we would not have got all the processes and systems aligned with 
<br/>the technical aspects of the system.  I want to really thank them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I want to thank my Permanent Secretary, Mr. Shiri Gounder, for his leadership and the 
<br/>hard  work  and  many  hours  of  late-night  work  towards  this  project  and  various  other  financial 
<br/>management reforms that we have been able to undertake in the last 17 months since we came into 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we are on schedule for a new FMIS to GO LIVE on 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024, which is the start of a new financial year.  Let me say that we are now working on 
<br/>the Budget and once we are able to add to the current system, the process of Budget  will become so 
<br/>much easier for the Government and the Ministry of Finance and all the staff, not only the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance but throughout the Government, to be able to access, produce reports, and ensure that it 
<br/>is done in a timely manner.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finance for his Ministerial Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we are living in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century, technology is very important, no doubt about it.  We 
<br/>need technology, we need a new system, and the system needs to be upgraded in order to actually 
<br/></span><span>have  some  better  controls.  There  have  been  a  lot  of  attempts  previously  under  the  digitalFIJI 
<br/></span><span>Programme  as  well,  whereby  the  honourable  Minister  would  now  know  that  our  systems  are  not 
<br/>talking to each other, especially when we have a budget of more than $4 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the system from one Ministry is not talking to another Ministry’s system, it becomes 
<br/>very difficult for Ministry of Finance to account for the money that was given to the Ministry, and 
<br/>the amount of money that is being utilised by the Ministry.  All these systems need to be talking to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>779 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each other.  We need to have a centralised system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very good step forward, we are trying to develop something because 
<br/>if we look at the system nowadays, especially when it comes to commercial companies, there are 
<br/>three aspects - there is an Accounting System, an Inventory Management and there is Payroll.  All 
<br/>these systems talk to each other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have seen in Government for decades, there is a huge disconnect.  
<br/>For example, at the moment, as the honourable Minister was saying is implementing that particular 
<br/>component in the Ministry of Finance.  If we look at Ministry of Health and the Fiji Pharmaceutical 
<br/>and  Biomedical  Services  (FPBS),  these  two  systems  are  not  linked  to  each  other.    Government 
<br/>Pharmacy, being one of the major buyers of Government, spends almost close to $60 million but 
<br/>there is no systematic way of reporting back to the Ministry of Finance when it comes to the reporting 
<br/>system through a particular software, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a very good move by the Ministry of Finance that they are trying to implement.  What I 
<br/>would like to suggest is, there are certain entities, such as Municipal Councils, Provincial Councils, 
<br/>where we need to implement the software.  Very rightfully said, things are done on manual basis and 
<br/>when things are done manually, the records go missing.  People are leaving, there is no proper record 
<br/>of receipts, and the reports get delayed, before it is presented to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I have a suggestion, if we can expand this particular programme to all other Ministries 
<br/>and anywhere, particularly where the Government grant is going.  I  have mentioned the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and FPBS is one of the major spenders with almost $60 million, likewise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the Ministry of Education where Government  gives huge amounts as grants to schools but, again, 
<br/>there  is  no  proper  recording  system  or  there  is  no  proper  way  to  report  back  to  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education on how the grant is actually utilised because that is taxpayers’ money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to go to that extent because I believe close to $250 million to $300 million is given 
<br/>to high schools and primary schools as grant, so we need to be accountable. If that can be done and 
<br/>very rightfully said by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, we now have 
<br/>Starlink  that  will  provide  connectivity  throughout  Fiji,  we  can  actually  have  systems  in  schools 
<br/>hooking up to this networking system where they can use the software to report back to the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell, I would like to say, this is a very good programme.  Succession plan is very 
<br/>important.  We need to train the right people and retain them within the Ministry to look after that.  
<br/>Rightfully, Sir, if we actually rely on one person and if he is no longer there, the system can collapse.  
<br/>If we are actually looking at a payroll system, we might be dealing with close to 30,000 civil servants 
<br/>who will be affected, including Members of Parliament and Ministers as well.  So, we need to have 
<br/>some backup plans and to have backup servers whereby we can actually keep this data.  We do not 
<br/>want a system which transpired some years ago, that collapsed, and we did not have a backup system.  
<br/>So, we need to work on these kinds of issues in order to implement, and I would like to thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister for taking this initiative and project on board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Ministry of Health, as you have highlighted, is not part and parcel of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what they are trying.  Now, they are bringing in the Ministry of Health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you look back at past Governments’ decisions, beginning from SDL, they kind of lack 
<br/>that.  For example, the Ministry of Health run on their own, they did their own pay rise, et cetera.  
<br/>But when it came to the future governments like FijiFirst, they did likewise too.  They increased the 
<br/>pay of the doctors without aligning to what has been recommended now.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have reached a stage where even the Ministry of Home Affairs is having trouble 
<br/>with running their own payroll.  Now, we need to converge them together and see, like you have 
<br/>stated, there is accountability and transparency into how decisions are going to be made.  It comes 
<br/>right down to the recruitment process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may recall that when we were in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, we asked 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance, “What is the problem with this?”  The usual answer from the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary then, a Rotuman lady, “We do not have the capacity.”  But they have been tasked with that 
<br/>responsibility, the Permanent Secretaries.  Hopefully, having been reassured by your support and the 
<br/>support of the Opposition to this Government initiative, we hope things would turn out for the better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now since the Standing Order Executive 
<br/>Committee would be meeting in the Small Committee Room to discuss issues that have been pending, 
<br/>so that we may address things rather quickly when Parliament is still in session.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are going to adjourn now, and we will resume at about 3.00 p.m. or 3.15 p.m., when the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bell is sounded.
