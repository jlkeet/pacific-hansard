<div><span>Consolidated Review Report –  
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2018 to 2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Natural Resources, I hereby present the Standing Committee’s Consolidated Review Report on 
<br/>the Annual Report of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for the years 2018 to 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has undertaken its scrutiny on the Ministry’s Annual  Reports for the said 
<br/>period under review and noted the overall performance of the Ministry through the hard work of the 
<br/>staff.  The Committee noted that the Annual Reports clearly defined the roles of the two Departments 
<br/>within the Ministry.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  the  Committee  noted  the  delay  in  the  submission  of  the  said  Annual  Reports,  the 
<br/>Committee appreciated the initiatives undertaken by the Ministry to address the delays in submitting 
<br/>Annual Reports.  The Annual Reports clearly articulated the Ministry's role, annual targets, strategic 
<br/>priorities, achievements, responsibilities, challenges faced and way forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Ministry is involved in a lot of technical areas of operation, 
<br/>pertaining  to  Mineral  Resources,  Land  Use,  GIS  Survey,  Geological  Survey,  Valuation,  Ground 
<br/>Water Exploration, Drilling, Mining, et cetera.  The Ministry has had to deal with the constraints, 
<br/>such as lack of resources in all the specialised areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  has  proposed  a  few  recommendations  to  the  Ministry  for  the  purposes  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improving its services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to  extend my appreciation  to the  Executive  and  staff of the Ministry of Lands  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mineral Resources for their hard work and dedication.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members who were involved 
<br/>in the production of this bipartisan Report, namely, honourable Jone Usamate as Deputy Chairperson, 
<br/>honourable Ratu Isikeli Tuiwailevu, honourable Iliesa Vanawalu and honourable Joseph Nand as an 
<br/>Alternate Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Report to Parliament.

<div><span>(Report handed to Secretary-General)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move a motion without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989 and  
<br/>Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Special Committee on Emoluments was formed 
<br/>by a resolution of Parliament on Wednesday 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023.  However, due to the non-inclusion of 
<br/>other Offices, such as the Office of the President and Office of the Speaker, and the review of the 
<br/>Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989, an amended motion was later moved to rectify the 
<br/>anomalies that were previously not included.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, a new motion for the review of all the Offices mentioned above, was moved 
<br/>by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, seconded and debated, and was passed 
<br/>as a Resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.  The Committee was required to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>review the salaries, allowances and benefits of the Members of Parliament, the President 
<br/>and Speaker, as provided for under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014; 
<br/>review the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>must report back to Parliament at a later sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee initiated its first meeting on 24</span><span>th</span><span> July 2023, and collectively agreed to call for 
<br/>submissions  from  all  the  respective  Political  Parties  represented  in  Parliament.    The  Committee 
<br/>subsequently  received  submissions  from  SODELPA,  the  FijiFirst  Party,  the  National  Federation 
<br/>Party and the People’s Alliance Party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  receiving  submissions  from  respective  Parties,  the  Committee  felt  that  it  was 
<br/>appropriate to engage an independent consultant to review the salaries, allowances and benefits of 
<br/>the  Members  of  Parliament,  the  President  and  the  Speaker,  and  then  submit  a  report  back  to  the 
<br/>Committee.  To this end, an advertisement for an independent consultant was published in the dailies 
<br/>but, unfortunately, there were no applicants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, through the support of the Parliamentary Support Project, the Committee reached 
<br/>out to the UNDP with the same mandate, to put a call out for an independent consultant to undertake 
<br/>this  work.    Through  that  process,  we  were  able  to  identify  an  independent  consultant,  who  had 
<br/></span><span>actually carried out work before for the same Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  unanimously  reached  a  general  consensus  of  all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  proposed 
<br/>recommendations from the independent consultant and the amendments to the Act which are outlined 
<br/>in the matrix enclosed in the Report to be tabled today.  So, I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, that this 
<br/>is truly a bipartisan Report.

<br/>Committee, namely, honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau, honourable Aseri Radrodro, honourable Alvick 
<br/>Maharaj and honourable Mosese Bulitavu, for their hard work and dedication in the many meetings 
<br/>that we have had, and also the work of our independent consultant through UNDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hereby commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to Secretary-General)

<br/>notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That a debate on the contents and the adoption of this Report is to be initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting.
