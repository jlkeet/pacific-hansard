<h3>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Anti-Doping Bill 2024 (Bill No. 01/2024) be considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rights;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Standing Committee must report on the Bill at a later sitting of Parliament; and 
<br/>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Upon presentation of the Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must 
<br/>be debated and voted upon by Parliament, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, 
<br/>with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I 
<br/>rise today to address this esteemed assembly on a matter of utmost importance to the integrity and 
<br/>fairness of our nation’s sports landscape – the national Anti-Doping Bill 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  gather  here,  it  is  imperative  that  we  re-affirm  our  commitment  to  upholding  the 
<br/>principles of fair play, integrity and athlete welfare in sports.  Doping not only undermines these 
<br/>principles  but  also  poses  serious  health  risks  to  athletes  and  tarnishes  the  reputation  of  sporting 
<br/>competitions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of doping in sports has plagued the integrity of competitions globally. Recognising 
<br/>the  importance  of  fair  play  and  safeguarding  the  health  of  athletes,  our  nation  has  long  been 
<br/>committed to combating doping in sports.  However, the existing legislative framework, such as the 
<br/>National Anti-Doping Policy requires enhancement to address emerging challenges and align with 
<br/>international standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  national  Anti-Doping  Bill  which  we  are  proposing  is  a  pivotal  step 
<br/>towards strengthening our nation’s anti-doping efforts, which seeks to consolidate and enhance our 
<br/>existing legislative framework to effectively combat doping practices in sports.  By aligning with 
<br/>international standards set forth by organisations like the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), we 
<br/>demonstrate our commitment to being at the forefront of the global fight against doping.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after Fiji’s success at the Olympics, WADA changed our status from a Tier 
<br/>3 nation to a Tier 2. While this is good news, it does represent some immediate challenges as a Tier 
<br/>2 country is required to be much more independent than Tier 3. And Fiji cannot continue to rely upon 
<br/>support  of  Oceania  Regional  Anti-Doping  Organisations  (ORADO)  as  much.  Hence,  the  Bill 
<br/>proposes the need and guidelines to establish the National Anti-Doping Organisation (NADO).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the above, Fiji will need to be compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code and to that 
<br/></span><span>end, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Office of the Solicitor-General and Drug Free Sport Fiji 
<br/>(DFSF)  has  been  working  on  a  corrective  action  report  since  4</span><span>th</span><span>  November,  2022,  to  ensure  that 
<br/>compliance and noting the establishment of NADO is a critical component of the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  should  Fiji  fail  to  address  the  non-conformities,  WADA’s  compliance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taskforce will further report our case for potential non-compliance to the WADA Executive 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>653 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee and, perhaps, result in a non-participation of Fiji in all international sporting events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The enactment of this Bill is crucial for several reasons, as follows:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  reaffirms  our  commitment  to  upholding  the  integrity  of  sports  and  promoting  clean 
<br/>competition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It establishes a National Anti-Doping Agency, tasked with coordinating and implementing 
<br/>Anti-Doping Programmes, adopts stringent testing protocol, and introduces strict penalties 
<br/>for offenders. By deterring doping through stringent regulations and penalties, we aim to 
<br/>provide a level playing field and fair competition, while protecting the rights of athletes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It addresses the evolving landscape of doping practices, including the misuse of emerging 
<br/>substances  and  technologies.  By  empowering  regulatory  authorities  with  the  necessary 
<br/>tools and powers to investigate and prosecute offenders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  by  aligning  our  legislation  with  international  standards,  we  strengthen  our 
<br/>position in the global fight against doping and enhance our credibility as a responsible member of 
<br/>the international sports community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  an  unprecedented  development,  not  only  for  Fiji  but  for  the  Pacific. 
<br/>Without a centralised specialised organisation to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies 
<br/>in Fiji, the sports sector will remain vulnerable to the use of performance enhancing drugs.  With Fiji 
<br/>taking the lead in sports development in the Pacific region, establishing the National Anti-Doping 
<br/>Platform will enhance our position and reach to the Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in supporting this Bill, we not only safeguard the integrity of sports, but also 
<br/>uphold  the  rights  of  clean  athletes  who  compete  with  honour  and  integrity.  It  is  our  collective 
<br/>responsibility to ensure that our sporting competitions are fair, transparent and free from the scouts 
<br/>of  doping.  Therefore,  I  urge  all  honourable  Members  of  this  august  Parliament  to  lend  their  full 
<br/>support to the National Anti-Doping Bill 2024. Let us stand united in our commitment to preserving 
<br/>the integrity of sports and promoting a level playing field for all athletes. Thank you ,Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I just want to reiterate, Sir, that from this side of 
<br/>Parliament, we will be supporting the Bill.  There are a couple of questions that may also just need 
<br/>to be answered and I am happy to note that it is actually coming before the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Justice, Law and Human Rights so that we can thoroughly vet it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  just  a  quick  question  on  it  that  perhaps,  would  be  food  for  thought  for  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, I see there is a component in here with respect to the Drug Free Sport 
<br/>Fiji (DFSF), whereby in Clause 5, it actually talks about the functions of DFSF and in Clause 5(1)(f), 
<br/>to coordinate with the Fiji Police Force.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If this component that is actually being put in there with respect to the Fiji Police Force, are 
<br/>there going to be consequential legislation amendments or is it for purposes of assistance only, or is 
<br/>it going to be a criminal offence, which will mean that some part of it maybe a criminal offence, that 
<br/>will mean that we will have to change some of the laws in our criminal law?  That is currently the 
<br/>only question, Sir, but you will get the support from this side of Parliament for it. I think it is a good 
<br/>thing, especially in light of the fact that we are internationally well recognised as a sport loving nation  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we must make sure that we are always clean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the day, I think it is also good for our children who will partake in sports as that 
<br/>also needs to be addressed from the educational perspective, because sports is big business, as you 
<br/>know, Sir.  Many have lost contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, especially because they 
<br/>were not drug free.  Gold medals in the Olympics have been lost because of it, and in light of the fact 
<br/>that we have a drug epidemic in Fiji already, that is something that is important.  This is important, 
<br/>and it is important for the future of our sports in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got quite a few speakers, not for today but later on, maybe in support of it.  It is just 
<br/>that one question, honourable Attorney-General.  If it is, I am not sure what the purpose is for the Fiji 
<br/>Police Force or in terms of the coordination with the Fiji Police Force.  The Fiji Revenue and Customs 
<br/>Service,  I  can  understand,  local  sports  and  entities,  et  cetera,  and  how  it  comes  in  but  is  there  a 
<br/>criminal component if you get busted?  Is there a criminal component to it that will be added to our 
<br/>criminal law act?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  when  you  make  your  reply,  then  you  answer  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question that has been raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Youth and Sports for a well presented and articulated presentation this afternoon.  Fiji 
<br/>is a sports nation and for someone that has been involved in sports, not only at the national level but 
<br/>also at the regional level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is long outstanding, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is something that we have always wanted 
<br/>to have something like this, that not only is in compliance with the international norm, but is also in 
<br/>line with the development and progress of sports here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support this Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is good news to athletes and sporting federation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and bodies that are listening out there.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  to  by  honourable  Koya  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Naivalurua, we support the Bill as it is going to the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you  very  much,  honourable  Minister  for  Sports.    You  have  done  well  than  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General in moving Bills through Standing Order 51.  Just two things I would 
<br/>like to request from the honourable Minister, given they have done the executive consultation on the 
<br/>Bill, if it comes through with the various consultations that has been done because it will help the 
<br/>Committee  in  doing  its  Parliamentary  oversight  in  terms  of  moving  around  with  the  various 
<br/>consultations that are done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  the  Bill  was  done  by  a  Consultant  from  UNESCO,  probably  that  assisted  the 
<br/>Ministry with drafting.  Could that be made available too when it comes to the Committee where we 
<br/>are able to sit with the Consultant and also the leading drafter at the Office of the Solicitor-General, 
<br/>given that there should  be cooperation, plus the  Terms of Reference of the Bill,  which would be 
<br/></span><span>helpful to the Committee?  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Youth and Sports for being the first person to bring a Bill that is not under Standing Order 51.  
<br/>Congratulations, Mr. Attorney-General! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a good one. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>655 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  At  one  point  in  time,  honourable  Members,  Parliament  had  been 
<br/>loaded with questions relating to drugs, et cetera.  The very important role that the Minister plays in 
<br/>sports is to ensure that we are free from doping.  He has brought this, and we are grateful that the 
<br/>response is positive, even though questions have been raised.  But I leave that to you, honourable 
<br/>Minister, if you want to speak in reply, especially to the questions raised by honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  all  those  Members  who  have 
<br/>contributed  to  the  Bill  so  far.    Yes,  we  will  be  assisting  the  Committee  with  all  that  they  need 
<br/>regarding the Bill.  We will be supporting you on that.  I have nothing further to add, Sir.
