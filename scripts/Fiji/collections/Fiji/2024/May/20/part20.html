<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>FIJI NATIONAL SPORTS COMMISSION 2020-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament debates the Consolidated Review  Report of the Fiji National  Sports 
<br/>Commission Annual Report 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 which was tabled on 16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, and honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; the  Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) was established under the Fiji 
<br/>National Sports Commission Act 2013, with the aim to enrich and empower the lives and health of 
<br/>all Fijians through physical activity and sports at all levels.  The years under review are 2020 to 2021 
<br/>and  2021  to  2022.    These  reporting  years  were  faced  by  the  continued  effects  of  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, with its ongoing impacts on sports and recreational activities in Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>this did not affect the works of the FNSC, as it had to rely on its available resources to mitigate the 
<br/>ever-recurring challenges of the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNSC continues to work closely with the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical  Services in  safeguarding the safety  of  all stakeholders in  the sporting and 
<br/>recreational activities sector, which has resulted in the establishment of safe sport protocols of the 
<br/>highest standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had identified seven recommendations and hopes that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission takes these recommendations into account.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  that  note,  I  urge  honourable  Members  to  take  note  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations, and I support the motion before Parliament. </span><span>Vinaka saka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  on  the  motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similar to the last two Motions, I also have a list of speakers with me, and the batting is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Pillay; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Naupoto; and 
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise to contribute to the motion on the Fiji National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports Commission Annual Report 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) on its achievements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during those challenging times marked by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Despite these hurdles, the
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>675 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FNSC  displayed  continued  commitment  to  promoting  sports  participation  and  healthy  lifestyles 
<br/>across Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initiatives  such  as,kits  in  community  sports  and  wellness,  deserve  recognition  for  their 
<br/>positive impacts.   
<br/>Additionally, the increased funding allocated to disability sports programmes 
<br/>reflects  FNSC’s  dedication  to  inclusivity.    However,  the  Committee  also  identified  areas  for 
<br/>improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  recognise  the  need  to  further  strengthen  the  FNSC’s  operations.    We  encourage  the 
<br/>continuing efforts to improve national sporting organisations, capacity for grant applications through 
<br/>workshops and capacity building programmes.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee strongly supports the finalisation of the safety in sports policy and the drug 
<br/>free sports and urges collaboration with relevant stakeholders to achieve these goals.  Furthermore, 
<br/>we believe fostering strong partnerships is crucial.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee applauds FNSC’s commitment to working alongside the Ministry of Youth 
<br/>and Sports, Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education to address Physical Education Teacher 
<br/>shortages and integrate sports effectively into the national curriculum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  also  commends  FNSC’s  interest  in  aligning  its  programme  with  the  UN 
<br/>Sustainable  Development  Goals.    We  believe  incorporating  all  the  17  SDGs  into  the  reporting 
<br/>framework, is a valuable step.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee encourages FNSC to explore ways to integrate these goals into programme 
<br/>design, monitoring and evaluation, maximising sports and positive impacts on areas, such as health 
<br/>and wellbeing, and gender equality.  The FNSC plays a pivotal role in enriching Fijians lives and 
<br/>empowering the communities through sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  is  confident  that  by  addressing  the  identified  challenges,  fostering  strong 
<br/>partnerships and aligning efforts with the SDGs, the FNSC can make even greater contribution to 
<br/>Fiji’s social and economic development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  Chairperson  and  the  Committee  for 
<br/>deliberating  on  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  Annual 
<br/>Report 2020-2021 and 2021-2022.  My response will be very short, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission 
<br/>(FNSC)  2020-2021  and  2021-2022,  we  acknowledge  and  support  the  recommendations  of  the 
<br/>Standing  Committee’  and  wishes  to  express  the  need  for  additional  funding  to  meet  our 
<br/>recommendations and for the sustainability to continue sports for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the request for grants in the past five years against grants given, a total of 
<br/>$88,409,444  was  requested  and  the  grant  given  was  $35,925,424  million  with  a  shortfall  of  $52 
<br/>million  that  could  have  gone  to  support  many  programmes  and  grants  for  national  sporting 
<br/></span><span>organisations.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  aspiration  of  leaving  no  one  behind  and 
<br/></span><span>maximising the contribution of sports, it has made Fiji’s economy for a better Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports  will  continue  to  advance  development  as  a  powerful  enabler  in  areas  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations for the United Nations SDGs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4.1 - Capacity building exercises for national sporting organisations and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>676 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clubs to improve their level of compliance for grants. We need more programmes and having a closer 
<br/>relationship with national sporting organisations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4.2 – increase in grants given to disability sports programme.  This, again, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is dependant on grant funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  4.3  -  review  current  sponsorship  for  sports  equipment  and  corporate 
<br/>sponsorship. We have concerns from smaller sponsorship based as to if the Commission receives this 
<br/>sponsorship, it will mean less for smaller NSOs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4.4 - when working with sporting organisations on their recruitment of best 
<br/>available  coaches  to  maximise  performance  of  athletes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  NSOs  have  the 
<br/>opportunity to apply for grants for international qualified coaches. The Sports Commission cannot 
<br/>be seen to be nominating coaches but can only facilitate funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  4.5  -  addressing  the  shortage  of  Physical  Education  teachers,  consulting 
<br/>through the Ministry of Youth and Sports with the Ministry of Education.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is 
<br/>being actively pursued. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4.6 - working with the sports facilities for ease of payment.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, this is ongoing but the cost of maintaining facilities is getting higher.  Owners require a return 
<br/>on investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4.7 - all our reporting has been made against relevant SDGs as identified 
<br/>sports and in line with the recommendation given, we endeavour to include all SDGs in our future 
<br/>reporting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  again,  we  thank  the  Committee  for  their  due  diligence  and  a  good 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report that has been forwarded to the Government and I wish them well in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, let me thank the Committee for the 
<br/>Report that they have presented today and I would also like to register my appreciation to the Board 
<br/>and staff of the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) for the work that they do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission has been in operation now for a little over a decade, I think 
<br/>they are going into their eleventh year now.  Before the Commission was set up, the Government 
<br/>funded two sporting federations, mainly channeled through the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Now, 
<br/>it is channeled through the FNSC and I think in the process, a lot more funding is made available 
<br/>there for our sporting organisations, sporting bodies and sporting federations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the benefits of having the Sports Commission is to buffer Government from being 
<br/>blamed on interfering with sporting federations.  This is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third principle of the 
<br/>overall  Olympic  movement  and  the  third  working  principle  is  autonomy  and  good  governance.  
<br/>Sometimes, there is this contentious issue of Government interfering with sporting bodies that violate 
<br/>this working principle. So, now we have the Sports Commission in between to do that job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission has bore fruit, in my view.  One of the initiatives that was started off by the 
<br/>last Government and is  continuing now is the provision of that  funding that allows Fiji to recruit 
<br/>international expatriate coaches, if we do not have local coaches, and that has resulted in our first 
<br/>gold medal in 2016.  I think the second one in 2020, again, through that funding and getting those 
<br/>coaches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>677 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has even progressed well into  paying our local coaches for our national teams.  I know that 
<br/>when I was Chairman of the Rugby League, we applied, and the Sports Commission paid for our 
<br/>local coach when we went to the World Cup a few years ago.  I know that the coach for the Women’s 
<br/>Sevens Team, a local, was also paid for from there and they also got a bronze medal in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  can  just  add  on  to  what  the  honourable  Minister  had  said  on 
<br/>recommendation 4.5, which is this recommendation to get more PE teachers for our schools, I hope 
<br/>that the Ministries that are mentioned in the recommendation take heed of this by the Committee but 
<br/>I think equally important is not only getting PE teachers but also to resource them properly with the 
<br/>right training equipment that they will need to make sure that our PE teachers cater for the different 
<br/>levels of students in primary school and secondary school. Not only a whistle and a ball, but they get 
<br/>to be resourced well so that PE becomes fun for our children.  Fun is the point that tickles their mind 
<br/>into a lot more physical activity and as we know, it is also a ‘big weapon’, if I may use those words, 
<br/>to tackle NCDs also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Mr. Speaker, Sir, is my contribution to the debate and I support the motion that is before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Chairperson and Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs for their Report.  We note the issues and recommendations 
<br/>highlighted in the Review Report, hence I would like to make some comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  (FNSC)  was  established  in  Fiji  under  the  National 
<br/>Sports Commission Act 2013.  The primary goal of the Commission is to improve the lives and health 
<br/>of all Fijians through the promotion of physical activity and sports at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sports  Commission  is  responsible  for  guiding  and  enhancing  the  delivery  of  sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outreach programme across Fiji through a coordinated approach in partnership with stakeholders, 
<br/>such as the Government, statutory bodies and community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also has a major role to play in establishing a high standard of excellence 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in all phases of sports delivery and in physical activities throughout the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  supports  the  Commission  through  an  annual  budgetary  provision.    This 
<br/>includes  funding  as  allocated  to  assist  the  Commission  to  actively  advance  the  development  of 
<br/>freedom sports at all levels, from the beginner to elite level, by supporting national supporting bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period 2014 to 2023, the 2024 fiscal years, Government had provided 
<br/>a total annual grant of over $9.9 million to the Commission to carry out its core activities in the field 
<br/>of sports.  The actual utilisation of this budget was $9.4 million, and the rate of utilisation was 96 
<br/>percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  statutory  body,  the  Commission  is  granted  full  discretion  under  the  Financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management Act to exercise its power to spend its annual grant effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Financial  Management  Budget  (Amendment)  Act  2017  governs  the 
<br/></span><span>financial  operation  of  the  Commission  and  in  ensuring  the  effective,  efficient  and  economic 
<br/>management of its finance, and the maintenance of effective systems to internal control of money 
<br/>and its prerogative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission  has  made  a  significant  stride  in  promoting  sports 
<br/>participation across all demographic areas from grassroot to elite levels, which includes community 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>engagement, successful implementing the programme that endanger the community and engage all, 
<br/>particularly in the rural and underserved areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On talent development, to identify and nurturing young talent, preparing them for national 
<br/>and international competition.  The international achievements supporting athletes’ participation in 
<br/>global events which has brought pride and recognition to Fiji in the challenges and future direction 
<br/>for all our athletes across Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The impact of COVID-19 pandemic has disturbed the sports activities, affecting schedules 
<br/>and revenue.  The Commission has taken adaptive measures but continued support is essential for its 
<br/>recovery.  Strategic planning for new and improved facility is vital for maintaining high standards 
<br/>and hosting international events. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  has  shown 
<br/>commendable efforts and achievements, despite facing challenges.  The Government continues to 
<br/>support  strategic  investments  and  collaborative  approach  that  will  be  essential  to  build  on  the 
<br/>successes and ensuring the growth and sustainable of sports in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
