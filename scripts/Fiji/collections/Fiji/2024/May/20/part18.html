<h3>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINSTCORRUPTION 1STAUGUST, 2017 TO 31STJULY, 2018 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINST  
<br/>CORRUPTION 1</span><span>ST</span><span> AUGUST, 2017 TO 31</span><span>ST</span><span> JULY, 2018 ANNUAL REPORT  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr. Chairman for the presentation of the Report.  
<br/>I just wanted to add a few comments to what he has already suggested.  Some of the issues that we 
<br/>raised in the recommendations, even in the Report were relatively, firstly, to SDGs.   What we had 
<br/>deliberated upon and this is on the back of what you had suggested to us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many 
<br/>moons ago now, about ensuring that we were always SDG compliant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we found also post, even actually writing the recommendations, as a matter of fact, and 
<br/>this is coming on at the back of UNDP Report that came out on SDGs is that we are way, way behind 
<br/>in terms of compliance and in terms of us being ready by 2030.  As a matter of fact, the date that has 
<br/>been given by UNDP, we are nowhere near that and we will only be achieving our obligations in 
<br/>terms of the SDGs by 2065. Many of us may not be part of this Parliament then, but that is what the 
<br/>target is now for achieving the SDG goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  we  thought  as  a  Committee  was,  “Alright,  this  is  actually  something  good”  and  we 
<br/>included it in our recommendations and I hope Parliament will gladly and willingly accept this, is 
<br/>that for all Committees, not just this particular Committee, not just the report on FICAC, that the 
<br/>SDG component must be a part as a compulsion for all future reports so that we can keep a track, 
<br/>Parliament can keep a track of how much compliance there is in terms of all SDGs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things also we discussed, Sir, and this is something that concerns our smaller 
<br/>communities,  the  recommendations  that  also  came,  that  we  do  ensure  that  communities  such  as 
<br/>Rotuma, Rabi, Kioa and the Melanesian communities also be visited annually to conduct trainings.  
<br/>This is one shortfall that we found that there were other communities that were not touched and the 
<br/>questions that were asked in this particular recommendation, I will address in a few minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The translation also with respect to the vernacular languages in Fiji but not limited to any, is 
<br/>also a must and necessary in light of today.  One of the other things that is a compulsion and  will 
<br/>require concerted effort on the part of many other Ministries was the education portion.  Education 
<br/>on corruption is very important to us, but it has to be at all levels, not just the senior level, not just in 
<br/>the workforce, but also in terms of high school and primary schools, and we need to ensure that it is 
<br/>actually in the curriculum so that everyone is aware of how rotten an issue it is in terms of corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that I wanted to highlight, Sir, is the UNDP Report where it actually spoke 
<br/>about gender inequality, et cetera, which as way, way behind.  So, we, in the Pacific, are not by any 
<br/>means, any close to where we should be in terms of making sure that there is compliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, there should be some compulsion in terms of the reports that are being made 
<br/>to  Parliament.    One  of  the  complaints  that  came  out  of  it  was  the  lack  of  equality  in  the  law, 
<br/>inconsistent gaps in terms of many issues, gender-based violence, et cetera, and all of these issues 
<br/>were there and these things need to be addressed in our Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC is an institution that must now be looked at as one of our major 
<br/>institutions and it forms an integral part of our legal landscape.  We must ensure that it is resourced 
<br/>very well and there is a reason why.  It is a constitutional requirement, and it is also important in 
<br/>terms of the whole legal structure.  But more importantly, we are signatories to many things that 
<br/>requires FICAC, basically a regular check on FICAC and see how we deal with corruption.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>659 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It does not just relate to the law, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  will 
<br/>know that he is  about  to sign  off on  Indo-Pacific Economic  Framework (IPEF).   That also  has a 
<br/>component in it with respect to corruption, and it comes out of them having a look at what our status 
<br/>is in terms of FICAC.  So, it becomes an institution that is actively engaged in many things.  In terms 
<br/>of reporting, when these institutions report back to Parliament to scrutinise, all of these things must 
<br/>be part of the Report and it is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, it forms an integral part of the whole legal framework.  When we look at it, 
<br/>we must ensure that we resource FICAC very well and make sure that it is an independent institution, 
<br/>that it is not interfered with in any way whatsoever, and basically looked after so that we are making 
<br/>sure that all those things that we sign and become a party to, we are actually being compliant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the last things, Sir, that I wanted to talk about, there is a particular provision in our 
<br/>Standing Orders with respect to presentation of reports.  Once a Standing Committee has actually 
<br/>done its report and I am referring to Standing Order 121(b) in relation to any other matter apart from 
<br/>Bills, once it is referred to or initiated by the Committee, as soon as it has completed its consideration 
<br/>and deliberations, it must table one or more interim reports.  The tabling has been done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  provision  there,  Sir,  which  says  that  ‘once  the  motion  is  adopted’,  so  if  this 
<br/>particular motion  is  adopted, then the report of the Standing Committee  shall be delivered to  the 
<br/>relevant Government Department by the Secretary-General within 14 days.  So, today, once we  adopt 
<br/>it,  then  it  is  being  given  to  the  relevant  Government  Department  and  that  would  be  Attorney-
<br/>General’s Chambers.  Then the Minister responsible for the relevant Government Department must 
<br/>table  a  substantive  response  to  the  Standing  Committee’s  report  within  21  days  of  receiving  the 
<br/>report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Attorney-General,  I  know  in  your  fervour  to  get  this  done,  before  it  is  even 
<br/>adopted, we have received a letter back from your office with respect to the recommendations that 
<br/>actually had been passed on.  In those recommendations, it has been duly acknowledged, et cetera, 
<br/>and currently it is in its confidential status that was sent to us, we acknowledge that.  But, please, 
<br/>remember this needs to be sent to us post the actual motion going through Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are certain things in terms of the issues that have been raised by FICAC, and as the 
<br/>Minister  responsible,  he  has  responded  to  it  but  just  a  quick  check  on  that.    In  conclusion,  the 
<br/>recommendations  before  Parliament  were  thoroughly  deliberated  on.    The  FICAC  was  very 
<br/>compliant in terms of making sure that they had answered all the questions.  It is a very bipartisan 
<br/>report by the Committee and I think probably the most bipartisan Committee that sits in terms of 
<br/>getting these recommendations.  I fully commend the motion to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make my comments, allow me to formally 
<br/>acknowledge  and  pass  my  congratulations  to  the  </span><span>Turaga  na  Tui  Levuka</span><span>  who  will  be  installed 
<br/>tomorrow by the 12 Districts of Lomaiviti. I pray that God’s Blessings will be on his installation and 
<br/>his leadership of the </span><span>Vanua of Levuka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The first recommendation deals with the timely submission of this 
<br/>Annual  Report  to  Parliament.  Section  17  of  the  Fiji  Independent  Against  Corruption  Act  2017 
<br/>provides  that  the  Commissioner  of  FICAC  must  submit  an  Annual  Report  to  His  Excellency  the 
<br/>President and the responsible Minister must submit within three months of the end of the financial 
<br/>year.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are dealing here with the Report of 2017 and 2018.  It is really not a 
<br/>good  reflection  of  the  then  Minister  for  Justice  and  Attorney-General.  There  has  to  be  timely 
<br/>submission of the Annual Report whether it is important oversight and accountability mechanism to 
<br/>a normal Parliamentary process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a democratic nation, the tabling of the Annual Report allows for scrutiny at the highest 
<br/>level  for  inspection  of  the  statutory  institution’s  performance,  financial  management  and  in 
<br/>compliance  with  laws  governing  it.    It  also  enforces  public  trust  by  highlighting  dedication  to 
<br/>responsible resource management and sound governance.  It is useful for planning purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no explanation as to why a report was not tabled all these years.  
<br/>Unfortunately, the former Commissioner has left. We have the Acting Deputy Commissioner who is 
<br/>currently out of the country and no one from FICAC can provide a feasible explanation to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I must commend the Acting Commissioner of FICAC who was appointed late last 
<br/>year, in her short stint, has devised a strategic plan for 2024 to 2029, including its Annual Corporate 
<br/>Plan for 2024 and 2025, which captures the very key indicator of submission to be timely, which is 
<br/>inclusive of Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I want to stress here is at the end of the day, it is the issue of leadership.  
<br/>Leadership from the Minister, leadership from whoever is in charge of FICAC, and then it strickles 
<br/>down to the Managers so that they comply with their statutory obligations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the revised structure in place, the FICAC Management is aware of what is required of 
<br/>the institution under the laws and regulations, to provide timely submission of its Annual Reports, 
<br/>henceforth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More importantly, is Recommendation 2 in terms of compliance with the SDGs. I am proud 
<br/>to  say  that  the  FICAC  observes  the  importance  of  incorporating  formal  sustainable  development 
<br/>goals complied in FICAC’s Annual Report.  It clearly outlines the organisation’s efforts and progress 
<br/>towards  achieving  sustainable  development  targets.  The  inclusion  of  a  formal  SDG  compliance 
<br/>component in the Annual Report will not only enhance the credibility and relevance of reporting, but 
<br/>also drives positive changes towards a more sustainable and equitable future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FICAC  Anti-Corruption  Plan  and  work  is  aligned  with  SDG  16  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>promotion  of  peaceful  and  inclusive  societies,  providing  access  to  justice  for  all  and  building  an 
<br/>effective, accountable and inclusive institution at all levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  the submission  of  the FICAC Report, FICAC  has expanded its  work in  its effort to 
<br/>reducing corruption, bribery, and strengthening the very institution in Fiji which is inclusive of the 
<br/>private sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to highlight that the FICAC of yesterday has gone.  Under the leadership 
<br/>of the Coalition Government, it has the new image of FICAC where they are given full independence 
<br/>to operate. There is no political interference. Staff are encouraged to do due diligence in terms of 
<br/></span><span>their investigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  one  troubling  factor  that  came  up  recently,  while  in  discussion  with  the  Acting 
<br/>Director,  was  that  some  of  the  files  from  previous  years  were  only  found  when  the  previous 
<br/>Commissioner left. Most recently, one of the senior officers who was part of the Administration from 
<br/>day  one,  when  she  was  asked  questions  about  a  particular  complaint,  she  could  not  provide  any 
<br/>explanation. She was asked to go on leave only, so after she was sent on leave that they found another 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>661 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bundle of investigation files. This is the clean-up that the Coalition Government promised to do in 
<br/>this nation, and we will continue to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  recommendations  is  in  terms  of  reaching  out  to  members  of  the  community, 
<br/>particularly reaching out to Rotuma, Rabi and Kioa. We observed the important role of FICAC of 
<br/>being at the forefront of Government’s anticorruption efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In combating corruption, section 12 sets out that FICAC must educate the public against the 
<br/>evil of corruption.  It is a key component of FICAC’s Strategic Plan 2024-2029 and also for the 2024-
<br/>2025 Annual Corporate Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a Corruption Prevention Department at FICAC, and its main focus is to deliver anti-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>corruption programmes and training to interior areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In one of the awareness that I have been to, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is heartening to listen to the 
<br/>officer advising the members of public that one can get into trouble if they do not manage the projects 
<br/>whether  at  the  village  level  and  district  level  in  terms  of  being  caught  by  FICAC.  They  are  very 
<br/>comprehensive, very clear and at the end of the day, both sides of Parliament should support the work 
<br/>of FICAC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our nation is at a crossroad where the very fabric of our society has been attacked. Drug has 
<br/>been the subject of last week’s discussion, but corruptions has always been there.  Any responsible 
<br/>government like the Coalition Government will take it upon itself to ensure that any preventative 
<br/>measures in terms of awareness reach out to every community out there, whether it is in Vanua Levu, 
<br/>Lau or Kadavu and we must try to ensure that people are fully abreast with preventative measures 
<br/>and that they do not get into trouble.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are planned visits to the island of Rabi, Kioa, Rotuma, as well as Kadavu and the Lau 
<br/>Group at the end of the year. These visits will be conducted annually and will also be reflected in the 
<br/>Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, there  have been  positive feedback from various sectors and communities. There is 
<br/>also notable rise in complaints received by FICAC, which indicates the effectiveness and succession 
<br/>of such trainings and workshops.  Another area of the recommendation noted by the Committee is 
<br/>for training information to be translated into vernacular languages in Fiji and it is not to be limited to 
<br/>one. This is only very basic and to conduct a successful training, vernacular language is important, 
<br/>and staff are currently working on this project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another recommendation is that the Committee recommends that anti-corruption education 
<br/>be emphasised at all education levels from primary to tertiary and need to be part of the curriculum. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that there is a consultation with the Ministry of Education. Also, 
<br/>the teams go out to schools, so in future, we will see that most of these are reflected in the education 
<br/>curriculum. I am aware that there are curriculum reviews so we should be seeing some changes next 
<br/>year or the year after.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 16 primary schools and 60 secondary schools from the three major Divisions were 
<br/></span><span>recipients of the NACC during the piloting phase.  It is imperative to note that the NACC is not a 
<br/>standalone one, rather it is an indicative approach based on selected subjects to be integrated into the 
<br/>current national education forum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the recommendations by the Committee.

<div><span> Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my short contribution to the motion 
<br/>that  is  before  Parliament  and  it  is  on  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption  2018 
<br/>Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  of  the  issues  that  was  recommended  by  the  Committee  has  been  addressed  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister responsible for FICAC - the honourable Attorney-General, and the point that 
<br/>was raised by honourable Koya earlier in terms of Standing Order 121(6) where in this case we are 
<br/>fortunate that the reply to our recommendation has come before this particular debate.  In most cases, 
<br/>once the Committee Report is adopted, then that 14 days that is in Standing Order 121(6) comes in 
<br/>where the Secretary-General will refer the recommendation of the Committee to the line Ministry 
<br/>before they are given 21 days to submit  but, in this case, the honourable Minister responsible for 
<br/>FICAC  has  provided  the  response  to  the  recommendation  before  this  debate.    I  actually  read  the 
<br/>whole response that was tabled to the Committee last week and we thank him for that punctuality.  
<br/>We look forward to him being consistent every time with other reports that will be coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he had referred to some cases and some bundle of files that 
<br/>were there when he came that he found those files.  So, make sure that when you leave, your successor 
<br/>too does not find any files too around there, so we need to set the standard and if it is a promise, you 
<br/>have to keep that while moving forward. This particular organisation needs more funding in terms of 
<br/>training its investigators and we hope that the honourable Minister of Finance will give more funding 
<br/>to this independent institution established under the 2013 Constitution, so that they would be able to 
<br/>conduct further awareness and also advocacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General  has  alluded to  the National  Anti-Corruption Curriculum 
<br/>(NACC)  which  is  also  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Education’s  budgetary  submission.    Sir,  FICAC  is 
<br/>going to roll out this programme in the new financial year.  We we hope that this curriculum will be 
<br/>adopted by all schools, that necessary funding will be approved for the Ministry of Education, which 
<br/>will help them implement this programme for students and that it will be compulsory to have this 
<br/>anti-corruption classes in the school curriculum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  that  was  recommended  by  the  Committee  to  FICAC  which  they  did  not 
<br/>respond  to  was  the  peer  reporting  under  the  United  Nations  Convention  Against  Corruption 
<br/>(UNCAC).  I think there was a two cycle periodic review - one was done in 2009 to 2015 and Fiji 
<br/>had complied to that.  We are awaiting the second periodic cycle review that is due in June 2024, and 
<br/>we look forward, honourable Attorney-General and Minister responsible for FICAC, to our status on 
<br/>UNCAC and how this particular institution is complying with international standards.  Also, now, 
<br/>that  Fiji  is  combatting  corruption,  given  that  FICAC  has  been  there  since  2008  and  before  the 
<br/>establishment of the 2013 Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are a few things that I would like to raise.  I am also suggesting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>probably the Standing Orders Committee of which you are the Chair, could also take on board an 
<br/>amendment to the Standing Orders in terms of Standing Order 121.  If there is an extra clause to be 
<br/>included so that when we give recommendation in a Committee’s Review Report, that a timeline 
<br/>probably in the Standing Orders, be given to those Ministries so that they can back on time and allow 
<br/>standing Committee to review those recommendations. That will give an opportunity for the Standing 
<br/></span><span>Committees  to  amend  and  respond  to  a  recommendation  during  the  debate.    That  is  something  I 
<br/></span><span>would like to put forward in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  can  also  include  a  clause  to  empower  the  Committee  to  also  follow  up  a  particular 
<br/>Ministry because some of the Ministries, after their report has been tabled and debated, they do not 
<br/>come back to the Committee, like the way the honourable Attorney-General has done when he came 
<br/>back to our Committee.  There has to be a standard adopted by all the Ministries.    Thank you.

<div><span> Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>663 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Bulitavu.  We have taken note of your comments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the timeline to be set.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I take this opportunity to thank the 
<br/>Standing Committee who have gone through this Report, although it is an outdated Report.  They 
<br/>have done their job.  Some recommendations that have come up from the Committee Report is, I 
<br/>suppose,  useful  gauge  for  the  onward  operation  of  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against 
<br/>Corruption (FICAC).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  morning,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  been  given  some  figures  from  the  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister of Finance from its inception in 2007 up until this year.  The Fiji Government 
<br/>has supported the operations and capital expense of FICAC to the tune of $120 million in 17 years.  
<br/>That is how much public purse has gone to the operation and the capital expenses of FICAC.  It goes 
<br/>towards what people’s expectation will be, because while spending the public purse so the confidence 
<br/>level that the people and this Parliament, obviously, will have to give to this organisation is going to 
<br/>be dependent on the level of independence that it is able to exude and show to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We say that, Sir, because as has been noted by the honourable Attorney-General, the level of 
<br/>independence that this Government has now shown and given to FICAC to do, to provide the latitude 
<br/>and provide the environment for FICAC to do, especially for the FICAC Deputy Commissioner to 
<br/>do her job and do her job very well and not to be placed in a position where she feels that the role 
<br/>that she plays and the work that she does is going to face any form of repercussions if she decides on 
<br/>cases.    That  is  entirely  the  work  that  is  allocated  to  her,  and  we  were  assured  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General this morning that her work is going to be independently operated by her and her 
<br/>alone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are grateful also to note from the Report, Mr. Speaker, that the guidelines that standardises 
<br/>the organisation derived out of the UN Convention Against Corruption which is, of course, the key 
<br/>treaty that Fiji had signed up to.  Honourable Bulitavu had spoken about the review and, of course, 
<br/>we have been peer reviewed by Samoa in the last cycle and the next cycle, of course, is going to be 
<br/>due very shortly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the other observations that have been spoken about in this Parliament by the three 
<br/>previous speakers, perhaps I will pick up on the one that I feel is the most important. That is when 
<br/>cases are being “nollied” or when the process of investigation and prosecution gets to a point where 
<br/>the FICAC Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner or whoever the officer may be, makes a decision 
<br/>that it is no longer worthy to be prosecuted.  I say that because I think it is very important that we 
<br/>understand that when cases ultimately gets “nollied”, behind it is a whole host of expenses being 
<br/>incurred.  So there are expenses that are incurred out of public purse, of course, from investigation, 
<br/>from the laying of charges, right throughout the cases on mentions and up until when it is decided to 
<br/>go  on  trial  and  then  ultimately,  we  get  decisions  that  say,  “Well,  we  no  longer  have  witnesses 
<br/>available because they are no longer alive” or “that document has been misplaced or are no longer 
<br/>found”.  Those decisions, and I am not talking about decisions where there is no evidence at all.  I 
<br/>think those cases quite rightly should be nollied.  But this is where cases exist and it really have been

<div><span>It is important that we also understand that one of the measures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this 
<br/>Government  has  brought  into  force  recently to  ensure  the cases  do  not  take  too  long,  is  we  have
