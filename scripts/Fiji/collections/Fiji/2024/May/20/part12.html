<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament and ladies and gentlemen; a very good morning to you all.  Please, allow me  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>615 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to also greet our citizens watching the proceedings in this august Parliament via television or live 
<br/>streaming or listening via radio or the </span><span>Walesi </span><span>app. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement on recent developments relating 
<br/>to the elevated and renewed Vuvale Partnership between Fiji and Australia.  On 20</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, 
<br/>the Prime Minister of Australia, honourable Anthony Albanese, and I, agreed and signed a renewed 
<br/>and elevated Vuvale Partnership, reflecting the growing maturity of the bilateral relationship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  acknowledge  the  previous  Government  and  my 
<br/>predecessor, for the Vuvale Partnership which was first signed in 2019.  The latest development on 
<br/>that was the commissioning of the RFNS patrol boat/ship </span><span>Puamau</span><span> on Saturday.  Before going to the 
<br/>commissioning, I asked the Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service if I could go and pay a courtesy 
<br/>visit to the former Prime Minister, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama, and I did tell him that I was doing the 
<br/>commissioning the following morning, acknowledging the great work that he had done in restoring 
<br/>and furthering this Vuvale Partnership during his time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Vuvale, our longstanding relationship has not always been smooth sailing.  It started in 
<br/>1987 when there was a jolt, and we spent the following years repairing and trying to re-establish the 
<br/>relationships we had.  In 2000 and 2006, there were further disturbances to our relationship.  So what 
<br/>we are doing now is to just continue to improve on whatever we have had and also introduce new 
<br/>elements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In September 2023, a review of the Vuvale Partnership was carried out by senior officials of 
<br/>the two Governments.  The objective of the review was to realign the approach, the contents and the 
<br/>desired outcomes of the Fiji and Australia relationship by reflecting on the vision, goals and priorities 
<br/>of the new Governments of both nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“</span><span>Vuvale</span><span>”, we all know, means “family” in </span><span>Vosa Vakaviti</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>so the partnership recognises our 
<br/>respect for each other.  The Prime Minister of Australia, honourable Albanese, and I, then signed the 
<br/>renewed  and  updated  Vuvale  Partnership  on  20</span><span>th</span><span>  October,  2023.    On  the  day  of  signing  the  new 
<br/>Vuvale Partnership, Australia granted Fiji FJ$100 million in budget support.  This is in addition to 
<br/>the earlier budget support of FJ$81 million for the 2023-2024 Fiji National Budget in June 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an existing Fiji Programme Support Facility for 2016-2025 to the 
<br/>amount of $154.4 million, for supporting Australia’s delivery of education, health, governance and 
<br/>scholarship programmes in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  renewed  Vuvale  Partnership,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  elevates  our  shared  commitment  to 
<br/>tackling  climate  change  and  strengthening  our  economic  and  trade  partnership.    These  were  the 
<br/>elements  and  the  question  would  be  asked  today  and  probably  be  ruled  out  now  because  of  this 
<br/>Ministerial Statement.  It also has an increased focus on human development, First Nation’s people 
<br/>and culture, skills development and cyber security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following five pillars provide the bedrock for our commitment to pass down to the next 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generation a partnership they will be proud to inherit.  The five pillars are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthening our people-to-people links, which is what makes us </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> or family; 
<br/>deepening our economic relationship to achieve greater prosperity for our people; 
<br/>enhancing  our  security  cooperation  to  meet  common  challenges  and  maintain  a 
<br/>peaceful, prosperous and resilient region; 
<br/>building  our  cooperation  on  international  and  regional  issues,  as  we  safeguard  our 
<br/>region as a zone of peace against a changing climate and geostrategic contest, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>representing the Pacific and its interests on the world stage; and 
<br/>partnering  to  enable  sustainable  human  development  in  areas  such  as  healthcare, 
<br/>education, gender equality, social inclusion and poverty reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, we are looking at the possibility of evacuating Fiji’s citizens from New 
<br/>Caledonia with the cooperation of Australia and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vuvale Partnership Agreement is online for those who wish to read that 
<br/>in detail.  Under each pillar, there are detailed priority areas of engagement.  However, these are not 
<br/>exhaustive, and the partnership will continue to be responsive to emerging priorities and issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Pillar One - strengthening our people-to-people links, we have committed 
<br/>to  frequent  high-level  consultations  between  our  Government  and  Parliaments,  as  well  as  annual 
<br/>ministerial consultations between our Foreign and Defence Ministers and senior officials’ meetings.  
<br/>We are also committed to facilitating easier two-way travel through the Pacific Engagement Visa 
<br/>Program and to foster engagement between First Nations’ people, recognising the shared culture and 
<br/>kinship of the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  Vuvale  Partnership,  ongoing  sports  diplomacy  initiatives  are 
<br/>continuing, including assistance to the Fijian Drua who, I once again, congratulate for their fantastic 
<br/>nail-biting win over the Queensland Reds in the weekend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sports diplomacy assistance is truly fantastic, I have seen the gyms and 
<br/>facilities for men and women as they train there in Sydney. The Aus-Pacific Sports Programme is a 
<br/>boost not only for rugby, but also for netball, hockey and other sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Pillar Two, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on deepening our economic relationship, the Partnership 
<br/>will expand opportunities for two-way investments and support for private sector growth.  Further, 
<br/>the Labour Mobility Scheme continues to expand with the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) 
<br/>Visa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Partnership, the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) 
<br/>will  continue  to  support  financing  for  quality,  sustainable  and  transformative  infrastructure 
<br/>development.    In  addition,  Sir,  under  Pillar  Two,  support  for  agriculture  and  fisheries  sectors 
<br/>continues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Pillar Three on security cooperation, it reaffirms our joint commitment to 
<br/></span><span>closer  defense,  border  security,  policing,  cybersecurity,  maritime  security,  law  and  justice  and 
<br/>intelligence cooperation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our defense relationships had been enduring but in stops and 
<br/>starts.  Training at Military Staff Colleges is a key and essential component for the RFMF Officers 
<br/>cadre, and the suspension of this and other defence assistance due to political disruptions has been a 
<br/>challenge for the RFMF.  I have been glad to see the reopening of this opportunity in recent years 
<br/>and the recent appointment of a senior RFMF Officer to a command position in one of their Brigades 
<br/></span><span>was a big move.  Unfortunately, that had to be revised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  we  signed  the  elevated  Vuvale  Partnership  in  last  October,  Sir,  I  visited  the  8</span><span>th</span><span>/9</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment (9/9 RAR) in Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane.  We were 
<br/>given a guided tour of the facility and had the opportunity to experience an operational demonstration 
<br/>in  the field  inside bushmasters.  The Australian Government has donated 14 additional Protected 
<br/>Mobility Vehicles (Bushmasters) to support Fiji’s international peacekeeping operations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>617 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Pillar Four, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to cooperate on regional and international 
<br/>issues.  Both Fiji and Australia agree on the need to tackling the challenges facing the Blue Pacific 
<br/>Continent and commit to work together to ensure a zone of peace and to maximise the benefits of 
<br/>Pacific led solutions to Pacific issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, both countries commit to implement the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific 
<br/>Continent  and  the  </span><span>Boe  Declaration</span><span>  on  regional  security.    We  reaffirm  our  joint  commitment  to 
<br/>bilateral, regional and global action on climate change and building climate resilient societies in both, 
<br/>Australia  and  Fiji.    Our  partnership  will  see  joint  training,  knowledge  sharing  and  technical 
<br/>assistance, particularly in  relation  to  energy transition,  carbon markets,  access  to  climate finance, 
<br/>sustainable agri-food systems and marine resources.  Under the Partnership, we agree to support each 
<br/>other following significant disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also been committed to work together to uphold international law 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and principles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Pillar Five which is a joint commitment to sustainable 
<br/>human development.  The first commitment in Pillar Five is to strengthen health systems.  We have 
<br/>seen this recently with the signing of the agreement for direct funding of $14.7 million to fund a 
<br/>comprehensive infrastructure masterplan for the Colonial War Memorial Hospital.  The master plan 
<br/>means Australia and Fiji will work in partnership to comprehensively chart the course towards Fiji’s 
<br/>new hospital.  The master plan is the critical first step in planning out what a new hospital for Fiji 
<br/>will look like.  While the new hospital will take time, much is being done to ensure the continuity of 
<br/>care at CWM Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Pillar Five, Sir, we will strengthen cooperation between our education systems.   In 
<br/>addition,  to  promote  the  participation  of  women  in  political,  economic  and  social  life,  as  well  as 
<br/>implement  national  action  plans  to  end  violence  against  women  and  girls.    Another  important 
<br/>component of Pillar Five is strengthening our social protection programmes to improve the wellbeing 
<br/>of the most vulnerable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to now elaborate on the two MOUs recently signed under 
<br/>the elevated Vuvale Partnership.  These are the MOU on Port Development and the MOU on Cyber 
<br/>Security Cooperation signed three weeks ago on 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 in Lautoka.  The MOU on Port 
<br/>Infrastructure and Services provides the framework for cooperation on future investments to support 
<br/>Fiji’s current and future maritime needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our ports play an essential role in our economy, where 
<br/>95 percent of Fiji’s trade is exchanged through the Ports of Suva and Lautoka.  Bringing immediate 
<br/>effect to the MOU, a grant agreement was then signed with His Excellency Ewen McDonald, the 
<br/>Australian High Commissioner, for the development of a master plan for the Lautoka Port.  This will 
<br/>upgrade Lautoka Port and enhance its international and domestic port operations, to meet ongoing 
<br/>and changing customer needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia  will  also  support  Fiji’s  ambitions  to  revitalize  our  shipbuilding  and  ship  repair 
<br/></span><span>facilities through the MOU.  There is even word that we may have the facility to be able to provide 
<br/></span><span>maintenance support for the new patrol boat programmes.  This is in line with the “Ocean of Peace 
<br/>Concept” proposed as a vision for the Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to acknowledge the tremendous support provided by the 
<br/>AIFFP to help Fiji revitalize its shipbuilding industry.  The assistance from the AIFFP will help us 
<br/>to  realise  the  vision  for  Fiji  to  become  the  hub  of  the  Pacific  as  a  major  port  of  entry  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transshipment, with the potential for increased job opportunities, specialised skillsets and ultimately 
<br/>stimulation of investment and economic activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the impact of Australia’s assistance will advance shipping services for Fiji as a 
<br/>major  port  of  entry  and,  thereby,  enhance  overall  regional  shipping  services.    The  MOU  on  Port 
<br/>Infrastructure and Services is valued at AU$380,000 (FJ$556,000), to initiate the preparatory work 
<br/>for  the  redevelopment  of  the  Lautoka  foreshore  and  AU$115,000  (FJ$167,000)  to  support  the 
<br/>Lautoka Master Plan.  The total amount is FJ$723,000 as at April 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, at the signing, Australia announced its agreement for the servicing and maintenance 
<br/>of all patrol boats under the Pacific Patrol Boat Programme and honourable Naupoto will be very 
<br/>happy with that to be carried out in Fiji.   This is a welcome boost for our economy.  This is not only 
<br/>to serve Fiji’s priorities but also our responsibility as the regional hub, a regional port of entry and 
<br/>trans-shipment centre for the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second MOU signed between honourable Pat Conroy and I, relates to 
<br/>Cyber Security Cooperation.  Fiji and Australia share a commitment to a rules-based cyberspace and 
<br/>strong cyber standards. These rules and standards provide stability for our countries to protect our 
<br/>sovereignty, whilst harnessing the economic benefits to be derived from the digital economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our increased connectedness and the introduction of critical technology present opportunities 
<br/>and  challenges  that  require  us  to  work  more  closely  together  than  ever.    Both  countries  have 
<br/>experienced a series of significant cyber incidents in recent times, which impact our Governments, 
<br/>our economies and our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The areas of cooperation identified in the MOU include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Support for Fiji’s computer emergency response team capability; 
<br/>Support for combatting cyber incidents; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Workforce upskilling; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening governance arrangements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  MOU  also  affirms  our  joint  commitment  to  promote  international  law  and  norms  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsible state behavior in cyberspace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  MOU  establishes  a  critical  framework  of  cooperation  on  existing 
<br/></span><span>cybersecurity and critical technologies. In addition, Sir, the MOU will facilitate the identification and 
<br/></span><span>protection of critical infrastructure and information infrastructure.  It is a critical steppingstone for 
<br/>protecting Fiji’s information systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  you,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  deliver  this  Ministerial  Statement  on  the  Elevated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vuvale Partnership and recent developments.  </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  acknowledge  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister for the Ministerial Statement this morning on the Elevated Vuvale Partnership.  We all know 
<br/>how important this agreement is, in as far as Fiji and Australia’s relations is concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  for  acknowledging  the  previous  Government, 
<br/>particularly  the  leadership  of  the  former  Prime  Minister,  Mr.  Voreqe  Bainimarama,  for  the  work 
<br/>undertaken previously that led to the signing in 2019, as you have correctly stated. The review is 
<br/>timely and, of course, we acknowledge the Government as well for the signing that took place in 
<br/>October 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>619 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted from the honourable Prime Minister’s statement that in terms 
<br/>of the pillars, probably it is just the wording in Pillar 5 of the previous document was on fostering 
<br/>closer institutional  linkages in  support of strong  and inclusive societies.   I have noted and  I look 
<br/>forward to the one that is available online, honourable Prime Minister, that Pillar 5 is now the joint 
<br/>commitment to sustainable human development, whether it is just the changing of the wordings, et 
<br/>cetera, but of course human development is so important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for the MOUs.  They are both critical and I will talk a bit on the assistance under 
<br/>the  Australian  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility  for  the  Pacific  (AIFFP)  which  was  part  of  the 
<br/>recommendation on a joint economic and trade studies that was also undertaken previously.  That 
<br/>was part of the recommendation in the economic partnership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wish to touch on a few issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister and given the limited time that I have in order to respond.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have listened to the statement by the honourable Prime Minister.  I hope 
<br/>that  security  co-operation  has  not  been  dropped,  particularly  the  provision  of  strategic  lift  by 
<br/>Australia to the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) when it goes to peace keeping missions.  
<br/>We all know the limitation when it comes to commercial airlines, honourable Prime Minister, and 
<br/>you are well aware of that in terms of the extra supplies that we can take.   But we are thankful that 
<br/>under this Vuvale Partnership, Australia has also committed to providing strategic lifts for us as we 
<br/>go to the peace keeping missions.  I hope that, that continues because that is very, very important for 
<br/>us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly, we are not new to three issues which is still important that I 
<br/>wish  to  raise  again  as  part  of  the  partnership,  and  we  need  to  continue  to  raise  this  with  the 
<br/>Australians, particularly when it comes to a few principles under the Vuvale Partnership, we will -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engage with each other with trust, respect and understanding; 
<br/>share responsibility; 
<br/>listen and speak carefully to understand our respective points of view when differences 
<br/>arise; 
<br/>share our prosperity to improve economic and wellbeing; 
<br/>help each other to grow; and 
<br/>work on a considered and sustainable manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The three issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I wish to, again, raise this morning to Government is, 
<br/></span><span>firstly, on the labour rights of our workers in Australia.  We appreciate the labour scheme, I have 
<br/>provided a copy of a document that I have undertaken by an institution in Australia, honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, Sir.  I have passed it to the honourable Minister responsible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are key issues highlighted in there, particularly in the agriculture sector, because it is 
<br/>not  even attractive domestically in  Australia and we hope that our workers will not be exploited, 
<br/>particularly on working conditions and equity.  They need to be treated with respect, particularly with 
<br/>the labour laws, including medicare. We hope that our workers do not lose out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  on  economic  partnership,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  under  Pillar  2,  the 
<br/>deepening economic relationship on fisheries and forestry, I, again, raise the issue of our fresh ginger, 
<br/>that  was  raised  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  in  one  of  his  first 
<br/>Ministerial Statements, and that is important for our farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, on climate change, it is very, very important.  We know that Australia is a very big 
<br/>contributor to fossil fuel exports.  That cannot be denied, but we are benefiting from the partnership 
<br/>with Australia, at the same time, as true friends, speaking not only on behalf of Fiji but for the Pacific.  
<br/>We need to tell them that they need to slow down on fossil fuel.  That is key to our survival, and that 
<br/>is very, very important not only for Fiji, but for every Pacific Islander and, of course, in terms of our 
<br/>collective action towards the implementation and achievement of the Paris Agreement.  Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  at  this  point  the 
<br/>presence  of    Wani  Cawaru  from  the  Hidden  Paradise  of  Savusavu  in  the  gallery,  a  colleague  of 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Naisa Tuinaceva.

<br/>ladies and gentlemen, those here at the gallery and those listening from their homes, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to provide a Ministerial Statement to this 
<br/>august Parliament today on the recent trip by the members of the iTaukei Institutions Forum to New

<br/>ceremony of traditional installation of the Tui Levuka yesterday] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I led a delegation from the iTaukei Institutions to New Zealand on 11</span><span>th</span><span> February 
<br/>to 18</span><span>th</span><span> February this year.  The delegation comprised of the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs, the CEO of the iTaukei Trust Fund, CEO for iTaukei Land Trust Board, Chairman 
<br/>of iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission, Director for Appropriate Technology and Development, 
<br/>DCEO for iTaukei Affairs Board and a VKB team from the iTaukei Land Commission (</span><span>Veitarogi 
<br/>Vanua)</span><span> was also part of the visit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the travel expenses for the delegation members were sponsored by their 
<br/>respective  institutions.    The  purpose  for  the  visit  was  to  explore  the  opportunities  that  would 
<br/>complement the work of the iTaukei  Executive  Forum as mandated by the GCC, particularly,  on 
<br/>economic empowerment of the </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>  The visit was also an opportunity for the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span>
<br/>to raise awareness on the Immigration (Amendment) Act 2023 which allowed those registered in the 
<br/>VKB to enter Fiji without a visa or permit.  The VKB Team also took the opportunity to register 
<br/>names of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> living in those areas visited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the delegation had a meeting with the Pacific Trade and Investment Board, 
<br/></span><span>Fiji’s Trade Commissioner and the New Zealand-Fiji Business Council.  The purpose of the meeting 
<br/>was  to  identify  market  opportunities  in  New  Zealand  for  the  iTaukei  entrepreneurs.    We  also 
<br/>conducted  </span><span>talanoa</span><span>  sessions  with  the  Fijian  communities  in  Auckland,  Hamilton,  Wellington  and 
<br/>Christchurch. A range of diverse topics were discussed, mostly about land and VKB issues.  The 
<br/>Heads of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Institutions provided clarification on issues under their respective mandates.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The delegation met with the Maori King and had a constructive discussion about partnership 
<br/>for  the  mutual  benefits  of  the  Maori  and</span><span>  iTaukei</span><span>.    The  Maori  King  shared  about  successful 
<br/>commercial  undertaking  by  Iwi  Trusts.    The  Iwi  Trusts  prioritised  investment  over  distributing 
<br/>monies  to  their  members.    The  members  only  received  benefits  such  as  education  scholarships, 
<br/>housing and health insurance.  This  model enabled their trust  to  grow.  Their Trusts operate as  a 
<br/>wealth fund with a major portion invested.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an outcome of the meeting was an agreement for the signing of an MOU 
<br/>between the GCC and King Tanga.  The delegation also visited the Waikato Tainui Tribal Parliament.  
<br/>The delegation learned about the framework, strategies and business plans implemented by the Tainui 
<br/>for their tribes.  The delegation then travelled to Rotorua and visited the Puke-Roa Oru-a-Wata Trust 
<br/>and was briefed on the history of the Trust and how they grew their commercial arm.  Later, the 
<br/>delegation  toured  the  properties  owned  by  the  Trust  in  Rotorua,  which  included  their  latest 
<br/>investment venture, the Wai-Ariki Spa.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Chair of the Trust has been invited to 
<br/>visit Fiji later this year for the iTaukei Resource Owners Forum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The delegation also visited the Te Wananga-o-Aotearoa Institute which is one of the most 
<br/>successful training institutions for the indigenous of Aotearoa the Maori.  The delegation visited the 
<br/>institution  to  learn  more  about  course  delivery  that  would  be  relevant  for  Nadave.    The  Institute 
<br/>operates a hybrid delivery model that could be useful for Nadave in the future.  We also visited the 
<br/>Toi-Oho-Mai Institute of Technology, the delegation visited the institution to learn about its forestry 
<br/>programme.  This was due to the increased interest of our resource owners in the forestry sector and 
<br/>their need for capacity building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei Land Trust Board, under is Wealth Fund Initiative will dedicate 
<br/>a certain percentage for scholarships for this purpose.  The delegation also visited the Maori Arts and 
<br/>Crafts Centre to explore how it could help the Ministry in further developing the Fiji National Art 
<br/>Gallery, especially on how to generate its own funding through tourism revenue.  Commitment to 
<br/>the numerous artists of Fiji, this year, for the first time, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs allocated a 
<br/>space, specifically for them within the newly opened National Art Gallery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  delegation  also  held  a  bilateral  meeting  with  the  Minister  for  Maori 
<br/>Development to discuss potential areas of collaboration, particularly in commerce.  I had raised with 
<br/>my NZ counterpart the issue of visa for forestry workers.  We had requested if their visa conditions 
<br/>could also include allowing them to further their education.  Honourable Potaka has agreed to raise 
<br/>the request with the NZ Immigration Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also held bilateral meetings with honourable Shane Jones, the Minister for Oceans and 
<br/>Fisheries.  After being shared the purpose of our visit, Minister Jones stated that he would encourage 
<br/>Turner and Growers to visit Fiji with a view to connecting with some farmers on export.  Minister 
<br/>Jones  agreed  with  our  request  for  collaboration  in  fish  farming,  particularly  to  help  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>fish 
<br/>farmers.  He stated that he would advise the Under-Secretary for Fisheries to visit Fiji for iTaukei 
<br/>Resource Owners Forum and visit some potential fish farming spots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had also met with Chief Judge Caren Fox and Judge Sarah Reeves of the Maori Land 
<br/></span><span>Court and members of the Waitangi Tribunal.  The delegation learned about the legislative structure 
<br/></span><span>that supported and complemented the Land Courts.  A Maori Framework for hearing has worked best 
<br/>for  the  Maori  Land  Courts  and  has  been  very  successful  and  we  will  explore  the  possibility  of 
<br/>adopting  lesson  learned  onto  Fiji’s  context.    The  formal  court  system  recognises  the  Maori  Land 
<br/>Courts.  We had also met with the Te Arawhiti-O-Aotearoa Office of the Maori Crown relations.  
<br/>The  delegation  learned  about  the  Department’s  crucial  role  as  mediator  between  the  Crown  and

<div><span>various Maori claimants. After the discussions, the Department is open to receiving officials from 
<br/>the Office of the Solicitor-General and the iTaukei Affairs institutions for attachments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  the  delegation  was  impressed  with  the  consistency  in 
<br/>understanding laws and resources available by all related stakeholders that we met.  These includes 
<br/>the  Iwis,  Iwi  Trusts,  accounting  firms,  government  and  subsidiaries.    Education  was  the  key 
<br/>component of the strategies implemented by the Iwi Trusts.  Those who benefitted from scholarships 
<br/>went  back  to  help  their  Iwis,  the  programme  of  work  by  most  Trusts  was  guided  by  their  own 
<br/>indigenous frameworks that incorporated their values and practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit was a success.  On my return, I have directed the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> institutions 
<br/>to follow-up on the undertaking in New Zealand and learnings from the visit.  The institutions have 
<br/>taken significant steps in the commercial space since our return from New Zealand.  Please allow me 
<br/>to  express  our  deep  appreciation  to  the  New  Zealand  High  Commission  in  Fiji,  the  Fiji  High 
<br/>Commissioner in New Zealand, the NZ Government and the Maori institutions for their support in 
<br/>making the trip a success.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the honourable 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei, </span><span>Turaga na i Talai</span><span>’s Ministerial Statement this morning. From the brief given 
<br/>to Parliament this morning, I think we have no issues because it was an educational trip and also a 
<br/>trip that was economic based where there were lessons learnt from the Maori institutions and how to 
<br/>implement it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is one thing that I would like to respond to is the priority that is needed to make our 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> institutions be self-sufficient through funding. I think if you study those Maori institutions 
<br/>right from the Treaty of Waitangi plus the Maori Land Court, and we still have issues in Fiji where 
<br/>members of landowning units still have some claims, I think these are all that needs to be facilitated 
<br/>and we look forward for those facilities to come through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that there are two things that have been announced through the Coalition Government 
<br/>probably  after that visit,  one is  the </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>Development  Facility which gives us  loan right up to 
<br/>$40,000 for any landowning unit or landowner.  Honourable Minister, through the implementation, 
<br/>people  in  Vanua  Levu  especially  in  Labasa  are  still  looking  for  those  forms  to  apply  for  those 
<br/>assistance that could mirror the things that you have learnt from the trip to New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  is  the  wealth  fund  that  you  have  talked  about  and  the  need  for  certain 
<br/>percentage to cater for things that are of interest to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>. I think the biggest achievement that 
<br/>needs to be achieved in your term is how the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs plus the Great Council of 
<br/>Chiefs to have self-funding. It could be achieved through a certain percentage of lease money to be 
<br/>agreed from the various landowning units to help in building that Trust Fund or that Fund that will 
<br/>enable the development of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> economically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing too that I would like to raise, Mr. Speaker, is in terms of Climate Change and 
<br/>the need, probably it also started in New Zealand where the Maori Land Commission too has moved 
<br/>into carbon trading and buying carbon credits.  We passed a Climate Change Act two years ago and 
<br/></span><span>we still have a registry that needs to be established that could also allow landowning units to own 
<br/></span><span>these carbon credits, for them to then do business with carbon traders that come overseas.  I think in 
<br/>the last sitting the honourable Speaker talked about </span><span>volitaki cagi</span><span> and this is where it comes in and the 
<br/>need for the iTaukei Affairs Ministry to facilitate this so that landowning units can own those carbon 
<br/>credits and have that particular value of the amount of carbon that is in their forests and also on the 
<br/>shoreline.  These are some of the things that we look forward to.

<div><span>From what we have seen, we all agree, </span><span>sa dede na noda dravudravua na i Taukei, Turaga na 
<br/>Minisita.  Sa da vinakati me da sa toso i liu, vakaukauwataki vakabisinisi kei na veivakatorocaketaki</span><span>. 
<br/></span><span>Au kila ni sa kena matanisiga eda sa tiko kina ‘qo, eda sa vakanuinui tiko ni na rawa.</span><span>  We all support 
<br/>from this side on how we empower </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> in business and development and how we are going to 
<br/>move this forward. Again, there are some recommendations that have come out from their report, 
<br/>there are many things that can be explored to, to empower </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people.  We, from this side of 
<br/>Parliament also support the empowerment of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people in business so that we elevate them from 
<br/>poverty and also for them to raise money and funding in order to support their </span><span>soli</span><span> </span><span>vakavanua, lotu</span><span>
<br/>and also the development in their villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other policy that you have announced, Sir, the village beautification.  There are still some 
<br/>villages around still looking for assistance through halls and churches that needs to take that on board 
<br/>too. Just before I take my seat, the Permanent Secretary for iTaukei Affairs is very helpful. He has 
<br/>been very helpful through the communities in setting up the current co-operatives in Vanua Levu. I 
<br/>hope his contract is renewed moving forward given that he has got the vision for </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and also 
<br/>developing Vanua Levu and the rest of the landowning members in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, just a correction, it is not </span><span>volitaki cagi</span><span>, it is </span><span>sau ni 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cagi</span><span>.  That is the translation that is down there in villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that final punch from honourable Bulitavu, I hope we will disregard 
<br/>that because it has nothing to do with our Parliamentary role, the renewing of contracts or something 
<br/>of a civil servant.  Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.07 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament  and  the  people  of  Fiji.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  make  a 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on the Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  years  we  have  spoken  about  diversifying  and  spreading  the  tourism 
<br/>dollar but in the past decade we have made very limited progress.  If we look at visitation by area, 
<br/>Nadi, Denarau, Yasawa and Mamanuca right up to the Coral Coast accounts for about 80 percent of 
<br/>all visitors, a trend that was there pre-COVID-19 and is here today.  That means, where the visitors 
<br/>go, the tourism dollar also goes and where the tourism dollar goes, the socio-economic benefits go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in June last year, the World Bank approved financing of US$200 million or 
<br/>FJ$447 million for a 10-Year multi-face pragmatic approach to tourism development in Vanua Levu.  
<br/>This is on a highly concessional terms through the International Development Association or known 
<br/>as IDA.  I am glad to share that this is the World Bank’s first multi-faced programmatic approach for 
<br/>the Pacific and the first ever for tourism.  So, here we have an opportunity to carefully design and 
<br/>deliver this for the people of Vanua Levu.  What is important to realise is that the US$200 million 
<br/>while earmarked for a tourism programme will greatly benefit other sectors.  That is the power of 
<br/>tourism.    The  crux  of  the  programme  is  to  mobilise  investments  and  resilient</span><span> </span><span>infrastructure  in 
<br/>essential  services,  create  a  more  enabling  business  environment  and  enhance  institutional 
<br/>coordination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, we are looking at a total funding of US$200 million spread over 10 
<br/>years,  this  broken  down  in  three  phases.    Very  briefly  on  the  three  phases.    Phase  1  is  valued  at 
<br/>US$61.5million and runs from year 1 to year 6 to set the foundation for sustainable tourism in Vanua 
<br/>Levu.  This is where we are starting, it will tackle major barriers to growth like insufficient transport 
<br/>infrastructure and essential services, uncoordinated plans and limited private sector and community 
<br/>engagement in the tourism sector. This phase involves activities such as tourism master planning, 
<br/>supporting MSMEs through a pilot programme, Waisali Reserve Upgrade, improving Savusavu and 
<br/>Labasa  airports,  upgrade  on  the  road  connect  to  Labasa  and  Savusavu,  a  landfill  for  Savusavu, 
<br/>cityscape  enhancement,  Locally  Managed  Marine  Protected  Area  (LMMA),  pilot  wastewater 
<br/>treatment plan and renewable energy investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  concerning  the  airports,  there  was  a  study  carried  out  last  year  that 
<br/>highlighted  that  an  international  airport  in  Vanua  Levu  is  not  feasible  in  the  immediate  future.  
<br/>However, what this project will support to ensure sustainable tourism growth are various investments 
<br/>in both Savusavu and Labasa airports to improve current facilities, enhance passenger experience 
<br/>and meet ICAO safety and security regulations.  At this juncture, let me just assure my colleagues 
<br/>from Taveuni that there is also a plan for them.  Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Taveuni should see 
<br/>the  ATR  landing  in  Matei,  that  is  important  for  the  growth  in  Taveuni  as  it  has  some  wonderful 
<br/>resorts and of course the beauty of …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  to  extend  the  runway  at  Matei.    The  concept  design  has  been  developed  for  the 
<br/>extension of Matei and land acquisition around the airport is required for this, and as I speak, dialogue 
<br/>is  happening  with  the  Fiji  Airports  Limited  and  the  landowners,  and  co-ordinated  by  Lands 
<br/>Department to make this happen, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, my colleagues from Taveuni, you are also

<div><span>625 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>part of the equation in a significant way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase 2 is valued at $70 million and will tentatively run from year 3 to year 8.  It will put 
<br/>physical and social infrastructure in place. The phase will build a lesson from phase 1 and it will 
<br/>continue  to  improve  essential  services  and  infrastructure  for  people  and  tourism  businesses  and 
<br/>further enhance the environmental, social and cultural sustainability of tourism assets.  As we speak, 
<br/>a lot of people in Vanua Levu are coming forth with what they need we should do.  That will be 
<br/>accommodated in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Phase 1 will put the stage in place, and what we do in Phase 
<br/>2 and Phase 3 is learn from Phase 1.  So, for those who are there, please do not despair, your views 
<br/>will be heard and will be factored in Phase 2 and Phase 3.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investments will capitalise on the findings from the feasibility studies conducted in Phase 1 
<br/>including  those  for  a  greenfield  airport,  wastewater  management  infrastructure  and  system  in 
<br/>Savusavu, renewable energy development options in Vanua Levu.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Phase 3, which 
<br/>is valued at $68.5 million, will tentatively run from year 6 to year 10.  Building on the previous two 
<br/>phases, the final phase will see long term outcomes such as improved infrastructure connectivity, 
<br/>increase tourism revenue and tourism-related jobs and increase community benefits from integrated 
<br/>tourism development in Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  measure  the  success  of  the  programme  not  by  how  many  more 
<br/>tourists Vanua Levu gets but how we the people benefit.  As such, the result indicators will include 
<br/>tourism related jobs created by gender, number of people with improved resilient essential services, 
<br/>number of people with access to improved resilient infrastructure connectivity to tourism destination 
<br/>in Vanua Levu, percentage of coastal areas with Locally Managed Marine Area and Other Effective 
<br/>Area--based Conservation Measures (OECM) established in Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, in terms of how we are managing the programme, the financial allocation 
<br/>would be overseen by the Ministry of Finance as the borrower. The Ministry of Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation  is  the  leading  implementing  agency  and  will  play  a  coordination  role  with  the  other 
<br/>implementing  agencies.    Under  our  Ministry,  a  Central  Project  Management  Unit  is  in  place  to 
<br/>manage the day to day project activities. This Unit includes a Project Manager and three personnel 
<br/>who have been appointed and are responsible for the daily operation of the project. Two specialised 
<br/>project implementing agencies who will be responsible for procurement and project implementation 
<br/>for  the  projects  are  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  and  Fiji  Airports  Limited  as  they  are  significantly 
<br/>infrastructure related organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  project  will  support,  continued  intra-governmental  coordination  through  a  Project 
<br/>Steering  Committee  that  has  been  established  and  consist  of  key  government  and  private  sector 
<br/>representatives oversee project management.  This is an extremely important programme and we are 
<br/>excited  to  see  it  unfold  over  the  next  few  years.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  again  for  this 
<br/>opportunity to deliver my Ministerial Statement on this subject. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  seems  like  nowadays,  whenever  there  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something to do with Vanua Levu, I had to be there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very good statement by the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/></span><span>Aviation but it is always good to reflect back and put a mirror on the face of some people.  You might 
<br/>recall, Sir, that during the honourable Member’s time as an Opposition Member, when we were doing 
<br/>the 30 kilometre tarsealing of the Buca Bay Road, the former Leader of the Opposition, Ro Teimumu 
<br/>Kepa, once suggested that we were going to build a road leading to nowhere and that was published 
<br/>quite a lot.  But it is good now that as Minister for Tourism, he actually understands why we need to 
<br/>do  that  and  build  infrastructure  in  such  areas  because  as  you  know,  if  we  are  talking  about

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cakaudrove, the road leading from Savusavu Airport all the way to Napuka has some great views 
<br/>where  new  tourist  destination,  hotels  even  seven  star  hotels  and  resorts  can  be  developed  –  very 
<br/>appropriate place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such irresponsible statements coming back then was not appropriate.  This is what we call, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, something that a visionary leader sees for the future.  So, we have actually done 30 
<br/>kilometres so, please, further develop that road right up to Napuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are still dealing with infrastructure, we know that Savusavu is the 
<br/>hidden  paradise,  but  Hibiscus  Highway  is  about  to  be  turned  from  tarsealed  road  to  gravel.    The 
<br/>number  of  potholes  is  huge.    I  ask  the  Government  that  before  doing  the  infrastructure,  please, 
<br/>maintain what was done by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- He is misleading Parliament because work is being done to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>address that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Your point is irrelevant then.  It is already in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been requesting the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Public Works, Metereological Services and Transport for the past one year to fix  the open trench 
<br/>at Kaunitoni Road.  It is one year and two months now, honourable Minister, that open trench still 
<br/>remains on the tarsealed road.  Please, get it fixed before you talk about Hibiscus Highway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether this money has been approved or not, it is another question.  How 
<br/>many boxes do we have to tick before we access this $200 million?  In today’s world, $200 million 
<br/>means nothing, and the way the honourable Minister is trying to explain that is as if we are getting 
<br/>$200 billion to fix the whole tourism sector in Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Vanua  Levu  economy  does  not  depend  on  tourism,  and  this  was  proved  during  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic.   The economy  at  Vanua  Levu was not  affected because we do not  rely  on 
<br/>tourism.  There are more important sectors, such as agriculture whereby we have Fiji Rice Limited 
<br/>sitting at Dreketi, we have Food Processors sitting at Batiri where the sweet oranges come from, we 
<br/>have the Saqani Kava which is a potential to be a billion dollar market, as explained by the honourable 
<br/>Minister sometimes back, we have the sugar  industry and we need to fix these industries if we want 
<br/>to build the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are talking about business, we have a very healthy 
<br/></span><span>business  community in Labasa.  But  the issue is the transportation cost  from Viti Levu to Vanua 
<br/></span><span>Levu.  Bringing materials  all the way from China and India to  Fiji  is  much cheaper compared to 
<br/>taking the same materials from Suva to Vanua Levu.  We need to work on subsidising the freight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about tourism, there is a development that is supposed to take 
<br/>place near the Labasa River – the Vualiku Hotel.  The Special Administrator, having a conflict of 
<br/>interest, is not allowing this project to go through.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been issues.  The landowners who have given their 60 percent 
<br/>consent  for  the  development  to  take  place  are  requesting  for  the  resignation  of  the  Special 
<br/>Administrator, who has a conflict of interest and is objecting to the development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note, if he cannot do a new international airport, what is this 
<br/>Government doing with regards to the air fares from Nausori to Labasa?  I have been saying this all 
<br/>the time.  It is cheaper to go to Auckland and come back to Suva, than to visit Taveuni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  only  local  airline  that  is  providing  competition  to  Fiji  Link  is  now  downgrading  its 
<br/>service.  According to the owner, he is not getting what was promised to him by this Government in 
<br/>terms of support.  We need to work on these fundamental issues before we can actually talk about 
<br/>the $200 million that is being provided to fix the tourism industry in Vanua Levu.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Asia Pacific Co-operative Ministers Conference 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  Na  Tui  Cakau</span><span>,  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament,  those  of  you  at  the  gallery  and  people  of  Fiji  who  maybe  listening  to  this  broadcast 
<br/>through </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  or livestreaming, or simply  listening  on the radio;    I rise  to  provide a Ministerial 
<br/>Statement on my recent trip on the 11</span><span>th</span><span> International Co-operative Alliance Asia Pacific Ministerial 
<br/>Conference.  But before I do, Sir, allow me to offer some remarks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Parliament  is  a  bit  poorer  today  in  the  passing  of  Mr.  Lemeki 
<br/>Senibale, who passed away while we were away and I take this opportunity, on behalf of Parliament, 
<br/>to  extend  our  condolences,  recognising  his  significant  contribution  to  the  smooth  running  of  this 
<br/>august body, and also share our condolences with his family, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  congratulate  the  Fijian  Drua  on  their  magnificent  win  against  the 
<br/>Queensland Reds and maintaining our top eighth position and, hopefully, Sir, put them on a sure 
<br/>footing to qualify for the Quarter Final. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Statement, I thought I would bring to our attention because it is in-
<br/>keeping with the desire of the People’s Coalition and this Government, to continue to rebuild the 
<br/>country and look at  avenues to really leverage or activate more economic activity in the country.  
<br/>Certainly, after being at this Conference, our focus on co-operatives is certainly an area that we need 
<br/>to focus on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a well-known fact, Sir, that we have prioritised the development of co-operatives as one 
<br/>of the key vehicles for economic development and rural transformation across the country. We have 
<br/>done this, Sir, for many reasons, such as it actually suits our way of life, our communal spirit and the 
<br/>way we conduct ourselves in Fiji and the Pacific. It is quite interesting, Sir, when I was listening to 
<br/>the international governments, they did share the same parallels in terms of community spirit and the 
<br/>way they conducted themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cooperatives, Sir, if governed properly from a policy level at an implementation angle, has 
<br/></span><span>the ability to unlock the productive use of idle resources, pool resources together and derive economic 
<br/>returns for the communities.  They are, of course, a source of employment and poverty alleviation 
<br/>and they contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suppose it is fair to say that our work in the co-operative development 
<br/>space has begun to get international recognition, leading to the Government receiving an invite to the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Conference.  I must also mention that this is the first time that the Minister responsible 
<br/>for Co-operatives has attended this Conference which happens every four years since the 1990s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministerial Conference was held in Jordan from 28</span><span>th</span><span> April to 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 
<br/>2024.    Actually,  there  were  two  Pacific  Island  Countries  that  were  invited,  ourselves  and  the 
<br/>government of Papua New Guinea.  My colleague could not make it, so I was the only representative 
<br/>from  the  South  Pacific  and  I  can  say  that  I  tried  my  best  to  do  justice  to  our  presence  at  that 
<br/>Conference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Conference, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the theme was “Partnerships Between Government and 
<br/>Co-operatives for Cooperative Resilience, Sustainable Development,  and Inclusive Growth in  the 
<br/>Asia Pacific, Middle East and North Africa”.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the objectives of the Ministerial Conference, Sir, which were, but not limited to - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>examine  the  current  state  of  cooperatives  in  the  Asia  Pacific  and  their  potential  for 
<br/>contributing to resilience, sustainable development and growth. 
<br/>analyse existing partnerships between governments and cooperatives in the region and 
<br/>identify successful models that have yielded positive outcomes. 
<br/>highlight  the  benefits  of  collaborative  initiatives  between  government  and  co-
<br/>operatives, including improved access to resources, enhanced regulatory frameworks 
<br/>and social inclusion. 
<br/>identify  challenges  and  obstacles  in  building  effective  partnerships  and  proposed 
<br/>strategies to overcome them. 
<br/>provide recommendations to policymakers and cooperative stakeholders, to strengthen 
<br/>and  expand  government  co-operative  partnerships  for  sustainable  and  inclusive 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Conference  provided  an  excellent  platform  to  share  experience, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understand the global developments and reiterate our position on co-operative development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Conference covered the following topics and sessions which included 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>study on Assessment of Partnerships Between the Government and Co-operatives; 
<br/>statement by Government representatives; and 
<br/>acceleration of a cooperative identity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly,  adopted  a  new  resolution  on  co-
<br/>operatives in social development on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> November, 2023, calling for the proclamation of 2025 as an 
<br/>International Year of Co-operatives (IYC).  The resolution encourages Member States of the United 
<br/>Nations  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  to  take  advantage  of  this  proclamation  to  promote  co-
<br/>operatives  and  raise  awareness  of  their  contribution  to  the  implementation  of  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals  (SDG)  and  their  overall  social  and  economic  potential.    This  is,  indeed,  a 
<br/>wonderful outcome, Sir, and we intend, as a Government, to optimise on this opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  also  a  discussion  around  adapting  to  the  changing  environment  and  building 
<br/>resiliency, particularly when it comes to climate change. And one of things that really struck me, Sir, 
<br/>or the governments that were in the meeting was the direct connection between the advancement of 
<br/>the Sustainable Development Goals and what happens in their co-operative environment.  SDGs such 
<br/>as SDG 1– No poverty; SDG 5 - Gender Equality; SDG 8 and SDG 13, have been linked quite closely 
<br/>to the co-operatives and it is something that we certainly as Government will endeavour to do and

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>629 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also the importance of the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in all these countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of our contribution at the Conference, Sir, the importance of co-operatives has been 
<br/>recognised  across  countries  and  in  some  countries,  Sir,  is  actually  reflected  in  their  National 
<br/>Constitution - strategy documents to enhance contribution to  GDP, the creation of new ministries 
<br/>that we have in Fiji, and the implementation of SDGs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to shed some light on Fiji’s contribution at the Conference.  During the discussions, I 
<br/>elaborated on the following issues.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had provided an overview of the co-operative 
<br/>movement in Fiji.  Some highlights provided included that there are 590 operating cooperatives that 
<br/>exist across 15 sectors. Collectively, they hold around $151 million worth of assets, earning around 
<br/>$26 million and generating $2.5 million in profits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also spoke about the collaboration across Government on how the Ministry of Agriculture, 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Rural Development 
<br/>and the Ministry of Women have adopted a “pro-cooperative” approach in their work.  In fact, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports has insisted for every youth club, that 
<br/>they seriously contemplate developing a co-operative.  This can only be a positive development in 
<br/>this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  proud  moment  also  was  when  I  reported  on  the  increased  interest  in  women-led  co-
<br/>operatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past few years.  From having 46 women led cooperatives in 
<br/>2022, we now have 58 in 2024.  This number continues to grow as well and, in fact, in terms of 
<br/>women  leadership,  this  has  increased  by  over  236  percent  over  the  same  period  as  well.    These 
<br/>statistics were used to demonstrate internationally that the co-operative movement is vibrant and is 
<br/>very much alive in Fiji and the South Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the sessions, I also took the opportunity to put forward our request 
<br/>to the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA).  It was actually a long list, but we prioritised three 
<br/>areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, we made a call that the ICA establish an office in  the South Pacific and seriously 
<br/>consider Fiji being the regional hub.  Although we fall under Asia Pacific as a grouping by region, 
<br/>all their offices are in Asia and have really advanced their co-operative movements in those areas 
<br/>and we feel that it is time to have a base in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also made a request with the ICA regarding the review of our Co-operatives Act.  This is 
<br/>quite important, Sir, because it not only encapsulates the Act, but also how we can really boost the 
<br/>co-operative movement and I will share an example.  In Jordan, they have a National Co-operative 
<br/>for each agricultural sector.  For instance, for dates, they have a National Co-operative that manages 
<br/>the date production and then each member co-operative hinges into that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is 
<br/>somewhere that I would like us to head, Sir.  Just imagine, having a National Co-operative for kava, 
<br/>it means better control on our kava, better pricing for our farmers and these are the kind of benefits 
<br/>that this forward thinking will bring. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also sought advice on the National Co-operative Federation which is a 
<br/></span><span>body that is already in the Act.   As with other countries, it is proven that where a strong functioning 
<br/>apex body for co-operatives exist, they do very well in their development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, we already have a National Co-operative Federation body that was established 
<br/>in 2018.  I think the former Chairman is sitting in this Parliament, honourable Agni Deo Singh, but 
<br/>for obvious reasons, their progress was curtailed and Honorable Minister, you will be pleased to note 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we intend to rejuvenate that body.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also happy to report that our requests were well received with the ICA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they have affirmed their commitment in working with us on the issues we have mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to place on record that the Ministerial Conference was, 
<br/>indeed,  a  very  invaluable  platform  for  Fiji  to  be  present  at  the  table,  otherwise,  we  miss  our 
<br/>opportunity to be heard at international levels.  Some countries, particularly countries in the Asia and 
<br/>Middle Eastern regions, have developed their Co-operative Strategic Plan. Fiji does not have one but 
<br/>is earmarked to be part of the MSME Strategic Plan which we are currently developing.  We may 
<br/>even have a dedicated Strategic Plan for co-operative development going forward.  The Australian 
<br/>Association for Co-operatives has expressed an interest in working in that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things that is of benefit to the country is the level of desired co-operation 
<br/>that is now forthcoming, apart from Australia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and even Jordan, in terms 
<br/>of trying to help our co-operative movement moving forward, which is probably missed about in 
<br/>some respect, Sir, over the last few years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to strengthen our education around co-operatives.  We did have that facility down 
<br/>in Draunibota, Lami.  In Malaysia, Sir, they have two universities for co-operatives.  So, these are 
<br/>the types of things that, as a country and as an august body, we should be looking at, to ensure that 
<br/>in going forward, we truly maximise the benefit that we can derive from pushing co-operatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a way forward, I assure this august Parliament that we will continue the 
<br/>discussions  with  respective  agencies,  such  as  the  ICA,  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat  and  the 
<br/>Australian High Commission, to implement these items and also look to the other partners such as 
<br/>India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Jordan,  in  terms  of  some  of  the  areas  that  we  can  collaborate  on.  
<br/>Incidentally, Sir, in Jordan, I was quite surprised that they are exporting banana from Jordan through 
<br/>a cooperative, Sir. This is the type of potential that exists in their beautiful country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I can say that our participation was worthwhile and a success, 
<br/>and where Fiji is reevaluating its position as regional leader to the ICA.  It also demonstrated that 
<br/>Fiji is committed to the development of co-operatives, and I look forward to continuing to work, to 
<br/>ensure that the co-operatives movement moves to bigger and greater heights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since I only have five minutes I will try to fill in as 
<br/>much as I can.  I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I also want to tell 
<br/>him how much we appreciate the engagement with the International Cooperative Alliance because 
<br/>this is one area in Fiji which has actually remained a very apolitical part of our landscape.  In Fiji, all 
<br/>previous  Governments  have  dealt  with  co-operatives  in  a  manner  that  it  should,  because  it  is 
<br/>something that provides us with an area where we can actually empower people, we can safeguard 
<br/>our future generations, and we still have a long way to go with respect to how much we can actually 
<br/>do for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  respect  to  Fiji  alone,  I  think  we  have  about  379  cooperatives  that 
<br/>operate throughout Fiji.  Just for everyone’s perspective, it actually holds about US$58 million worth 
<br/>of assets.  This is just our cooperatives in Fiji and we do business in co-operatives.  These are the 
<br/>figures that came out in 2020 - we do business with our cooperatives close to about FJ$22 million 
<br/>dollars on a yearly basis.  It actually comes from quite a few different sectors.  They operate within 
<br/>the consumer sector, the sugar sector, the thrift sector, the agriculture sector, the land sector, service 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>631 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector, the livestock sector, so you can see a vast array of activities that happen in these cooperative 
<br/>sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has done a great job with nurturing the cooperative part of our economy.  It 
<br/>forms a part of our SMEs also.  In terms of geography, Sir, they are spread well across Fiji.  We have 
<br/>about 76 cooperatives around the Northern Division, 152 cooperatives around the Western Division 
<br/>and in the Eastern Division, we have about 50 cooperatives, and there are many great examples of 
<br/>our cooperatives that have succeeded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  an  area  in  which  we  have  been  recognised.    From  about  2000,  I 
<br/>remember when the Fijian Trade Policy Framework was being done, that also made cooperatives and 
<br/>how  the  role  of  cooperatives  in  the  economic,  social  and  cultural  and  human  capacity  spheres 
<br/>recognised.  It promoted the education in terms of cooperatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that time, it also encouraged the formation of the National Cooperatives Federation (NCF).  
<br/>Our 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan which came out in 2017 promoted those policies 
<br/>to strengthen the cooperatives and install the institutional capacity of cooperatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had a Target 100 initiative also that came out in January 2018.  This was to assist and 
<br/>guide  100  odd  cooperatives  across  Fiji  to  be  fully  compliant  with  the  Act.    It  also  marked  the 
<br/>celebration of our cooperative movement in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a law which probably also needs to be looked at to bring it up to 
<br/>speed with today’s activities that are happening.  It is an area that we can seriously look at, especially 
<br/>in light of the fact that we want to diversify.  As the honourable Minister spelt out, there are many 
<br/>areas that you can look at and see how cooperatives can actually assist Fiji, whether it is sustainable 
<br/>aviation fuel, whether it is farming   things that we used to farm before, and he just mentioned about 
<br/>bananas, we do not even see that anymore, for commercial purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many avenues that have been created by the Ministry for things to go into countries 
<br/>which we still have not utilised.  Biosecurity has opened up many pathways which we still do not 
<br/>utilise.  So, the education part of it is so important that with so much land that is available, it is the 
<br/>education part of it that is probably lacking that needs to be done so that we can get more and more 
<br/>cooperatives, helping the Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the Act would need to be amended, et cetera, or brought up 
<br/>to speed.  We have some great stories with respect to the examples of cooperatives in Fiji that have 
<br/>been successful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a quick word about the SDGs that the honourable Minister spoke about, we also need to 
<br/>be careful because if you remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last session we had at the Intercontinental, 
<br/>we were reminded kindly by the UNDP that we have not even got close to try and achieve the agenda 
<br/>that we want to by 2030, and now it has been put forward by 2065.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I think the honourable Minister is correct.  We need to make sure that we are compliant 
<br/></span><span>with the SDGs, so that we are environmentally compliant with all the cooperatives that actually come 
<br/></span><span>in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also see there are very worthy cooperatives around, like the Nasinu Land 
<br/>Purchase Cooperative that have faced numerous problems.  So, it is a problem that the Ministry has 
<br/>been dealing with and I think it is a forward step by making sure that we actively participate in the 
<br/>International Cooperative Alliance.    I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the floor.

<div><span>Conditions and Status of Government School 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  good  morning.    The  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, fellow Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition  and  Members  of  Parliament;  my  Ministerial  Statement  today  in  this  Parliament 
<br/>focuses  on  the  update  of  current  conditions  and  status  of  Government  schools  facilities  and 
<br/>infrastructure in Viti Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  deliberate  on  the  issue  in  detail,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  acknowledge  the 
<br/>Government  Ministries,  organisations  and  individuals  who  contributed  to  the  Ratu  Latianara 
<br/>School’s Flood Rehabilitation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the extensive damage faced by the school, 
<br/>some of them have experienced it for the first time, they have been allowed an additional two weeks 
<br/>school holiday upon their request  and the assessment made by the Ministry of Education team to 
<br/>allow  them  to  clean  up  the  school  compound  including  their  staff  quarters.  This  flood  has 
<br/>unfortunately  impacted  30 kindergarten students,  428 primary school  students  and 293 secondary 
<br/>school students with a total of 751 students.  In addition, Sir, out of the 27 staff quarters, 13 secondary 
<br/>teachers and four primary teachers quarters were severely affected and most if not all, the household 
<br/>items were also damaged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the extent of the damage to the school, the Ministry is 
<br/>urgently working in organising the support from the local authorities, Government agencies, NGOs 
<br/>and  community  organisations  to  facilitate  the  recovery  process.  The  Ministry  of  Education  will 
<br/>supply textbooks, water tanks, library books and school stationeries to the school to be ready to open 
<br/>for  Term  2.  The  Ministry  will  also  be  providing  psychological  support  (counselling)  through  the 
<br/>Substance Abuse and Advisory Council to the students, teachers and the stakeholders of the school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we acknowledge the hard work of the Head of School and his team, school management 
<br/>committee  to  have  the  school  ready  by  3</span><span>rd</span><span>  June  to  resume  in  Term  2.  We  also  acknowledge  the 
<br/>involvement of the RFMF, Fiji Police Force and the National Fire Authority in joining the community 
<br/>with the cleanup and restoration activities to foster a sense of ownership and resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to continue highlight in Parliament the current status of facilities 
<br/>in Government-owned schools.  Sir, as you are aware, most of the Government schools’ facilities 
<br/>visited are in dire need of repairs, renovations and maintenance.  Some of them will be celebrating 
<br/>100 years of its existence this year (2024). The Government through its 2023/2024 Budget allocated 
<br/>$1.8 million for upgrade and maintenance of Government schools facilities and $1 million towards 
<br/>the upgrade and maintenance of Government schools quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Repairs and maintenance of Government schools were unfortunately carried out in a more </span><span>ad 
<br/>hoc</span><span> way as opposed to the periodic maintenance that used to be undertaken by the Public Works 
<br/>Department in the past.  During the PWD days, school infrastructures were well kept.  There was a 
<br/>standard  color  code  of  all  Government  school  infrastructure  because  there  was  a  standard 
<br/>maintenance plan in place.  This is something that the Coalition Government values and embarks on 
<br/>to bring back, so the standard of education facilities in all Government schools are restored.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and 
<br/></span><span>Meteorological Services has conducted an assessment of all Government school facilities.  The scope 
<br/>of work has been prepared for all Government school infrastructure and we intend to overhaul all the 
<br/>ailing facilities. We, as Government must provide an environment conducive to learning and living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education is also grateful to the assistance of the Ministry of Finance for 
<br/>granting  us  with  a  Waiver  of  Tender  so  the  works  be  given  to  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meteorological Services and Transport or to other capable contractors.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>approval came too late and we have missed the timeline given by the Ministry of Public Works.  In 
<br/>that case, I have instructed that we procure materials so that we can utilize the budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  team  have  been  requested  to  incur  expenditures  and  we  expect  to  start  with  the 
<br/>procurement and upgrading works soon.  The Ministry has arranged to have the school management 
<br/>maintenance teamwork with the Ministry of Public Works to carry out and monitor all the upgrading 
<br/>works.  In the meantime, some of the upgrade and maintenance works have been done as witnessed 
<br/>in some of our schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programmes offered in all the Government schools and it is critical that 
<br/>all Government schools must offer some standard form of academic and extra-curricular activities.  I 
<br/>have encouraged the Heads of Schools to provide the opportunity to expose their students to a variety 
<br/>of activities and not be restricted to the same traditional sports, like rugby, netball and athletics.  We 
<br/>also want to bring back those academic competitions that once were done during earlier times like 
<br/>Shakespearian dramas, quizzes and debates.  These joint platforms are opportunities to share best 
<br/>practices,  teaching  methodologies  in  STEM  subjects  and  networking  amongst  the  Heads  of 
<br/>Government schools, teachers and students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Government  schools lack  digital facilities and  equipment which has 
<br/>drastic  impacts  on  teaching  and  learning.    For  the  boarding  Government  schools,  the  students 
<br/>accessing internet for research to do English and technical projects in the upper secondary schools 
<br/>are always hindered.  Accessing the latest science and engineering journals for pleasure reading in 
<br/>the library and improving internet connectivity. RKS has limited connectivity and so unfortunately 
<br/>that QVS is at a blind spot.  The Board of Governors, Head of Schools and teachers are encouraged 
<br/>to work together and collectively improve digitisation and at least have smart boards installed like 
<br/>we find in certain communities and faith- based schools today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school chaplains in Government schools are being paid by 
<br/>the students through the </span><span>vakamisinari</span><span> or PTA funding support. Without counsellors in some of the 
<br/>Government  schools,  the  chaplains  provide  an  important  role  in  providing  pastoral  care  and  a 
<br/>listening  ear  with  spiritual  advice  much  needed  by  our  students  today  to  curb  the  escalating  in 
<br/>disciplinary cases and this is an area for which we still need Government funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  has  become  public  knowledge,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  agriculture  is  the  backbone  of  any 
<br/>developing economy and this was an avenue to discuss with the Heads of Schools to be thinking 
<br/>outside the box on the utilization of the land. The Heads of Schools were reminded that they were 
<br/>just  being  given  brand  new  farming  tractors  and  are  encouraged  to  toil  the  land,  not  only  for 
<br/>consumption for the boarders but  also to consider expansion for business ventures.  Through this 
<br/>expansion, all Government schools will earn money and the students will also learn financial literacy 
<br/>skills through this venture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will soon continue with due diligence visits to other Government schools 
<br/>outside Viti Levu including faith-based and local community-owned schools on Taveuni Island, Lau 
<br/>Group, Yasawa and the other remote rural schools in the interior of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu for 
<br/></span><span>the  sole  purpose  of  capacity  building  for  teachers,  heads  of  schools  and  the  school  management 
<br/></span><span>committees to improve facilities, share practices to empower students for their future and to have 
<br/>education facilities conducive to teaching and learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform Parliament that the Coalition Government has already reset 
<br/>the wheel for the upgrading and maintenance works of all our Government schools so they restore 
<br/>the status of our Government schools and the pride of our nation.  The schools that every child in this

<div><span>country  continue  to  compete  to  get  enrolled  in  will  churn  out  the  best  scholars  for  leadership 
<br/>positions, empower students for their future and to have education facilities conducive to learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  above  stated  information  on  the  current  status  of  our  Government 
<br/>schools should be improved as our schools are the haven for our students to learn, remain in schools 
<br/>and be marketable in all walks of life when they leave the school gates at the end of their secondary 
<br/>and primary school journey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During my visit, Sir, a constant concern raised by teachers was on the salary level and bands 
<br/>that many states were depressing and demoralizing given the hard work of teaching and managing 
<br/>students.   Factors that were raised included new  teachers joining  the profession sharing the same 
<br/>salary level as those who have served for more than 15 years at the very least.  Many have raised that 
<br/>the poor salary levels of teachers compared to the workload and stress they have to endure is leading 
<br/>many to resign and opt for lucrative job markets abroad especially those in New Zealand, Australia 
<br/>and Dubai where teachers are being scouted for job opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is urgently addressing these concerns raised and policies are being looked at as 
<br/>we speak to allow for proper right sizing and right fitting into salary scales and grades to support and 
<br/>reward a progressive career assertion plan.  The major teacher unions will also continue to be engaged 
<br/>to  ensure we capture the proper details  and structures that will ensure a sustainable retention  and 
<br/>management of teachers not only now but also into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, providing a conducive teacher work environment to manage and provide a 
<br/>safe  enjoyable  learning  experience  for  our  students  is  crucial  and  a  happy  and  well  looked  after 
<br/>teacher means a productive and highly dedicated teacher.  With the high level of stress and challenges 
<br/>teachers  today  face  in  a  growing  environment  of  aggressive,  misbehaving  and  sometimes  violent 
<br/>students, our teachers must have the proper incentives to remain teaching and thus, we accept the 
<br/>urgency of these issue that grapple us must be addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education for his Ministerial Statement.  A nation is judged by how it prepares its citizens, especially 
<br/>its  young  people  for  success.  Education  is  not  a  privilege  for  a  few  but  a  right  for  the  many. 
<br/>Government has an obligation to create opportunities to make sure that all young children benefit 
<br/>from early childhood to primary and to secondary education so that young adults can build their skills 
<br/>and chase their dreams through advance education in ECE, primary, secondary and university.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has always fought to bring education into each 
<br/>home and put opportunities at the fingertip of each child, to empower young people to realize their 
<br/>ambitions.  For effective teaching and learning, good teaching and learning resources and conducive 
<br/>learning environment is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government gave priority to education and introduced Free Education Grant in 
<br/>2014 and made sure that all schools in Fiji, regardless of the location of the school and regardless of 
<br/>the  controlling  authority  of  the  schools  benefited  from  the  Free  Education  Grant.    The  Grant  is 
<br/>allocated in six different areas:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Administration  
<br/>-  30 percent;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Building and Compound Maintenance  -   20 percent;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>IT and Computer  
<br/>-  15 percent; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Library and Textbook  
<br/>-  10 percent; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>PEMAC and Science  
<br/>-  10 percent; and 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Teaching and Learning Material  
<br/>-  15 percent.

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All schools, including Government Schools, can use this allocation of 15 percent to upgrade their 
<br/>computer laboratories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school management and the school heads were provided training on how 
<br/>to utilize the Free Education Grant and this training was also provided to the Government School 
<br/>Heads  and this  training is  provided every year to  ensure that  all school  managements  and school 
<br/>heads were up to date and well-versed with the school management handbook.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the current financial year, around $6 million was given to Government 
<br/>Schools for infrastructure against $344,000 given to Non-Government Schools.  For the information 
<br/>of Parliament, there are only 13 Government schools out of 900 primary and secondary schools that 
<br/>we  have  and  about  10,000  students  are  in  these  Government  schools  out  of  250,000  students 
<br/>altogether. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- After </span><span>TC Winston, </span><span>FijiFirst spent more than $300 million to construct 
<br/>schools. We do not discriminate between Government and Non-Government Schools. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the children who stay in Government hostel schools pay less than $100 per term.  Children from 
<br/>poor families and outer islands send their children to Non-Government Schools and these children 
<br/>pay  around  $400  per  term  as  hostel  fees.    Why  so  much  emphasis  on  Government  schools?    All 
<br/>schools  whether  Government  or  Non-Government  are  given  the  same  amount  of  Free  Education 
<br/>Grant.    If  Non-Government  Schools  can  build  or  maintain  schools,  then  why  not  Government 
<br/>schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, good governance in the education system promotes effective delivery of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>education  citizens.  If  Free  Education  Grant  is  well-managed  by  the  school  management  and  the 
<br/>school heads, I am sure all the schools in Fiji regardless of the controlling authority will have good 
<br/>facilities, teaching and learning resources and conducive teaching learning environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  schools  whether  Government  or  Non-Government  should  be  treated 
<br/>fairly when it comes to allocation of resources. Taxpayers can see how this Government is giving 
<br/>preference to Government schools over Non-Government Schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government fails to appreciate that religious bodies and communities 
<br/>have taken the burden away from the Government by providing schools. The least you can do is to 
<br/>treat all schools in the same manner when it comes to funding.
