<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the honourable Member’s question, 
<br/>I  would  like  to  respond  to  the  earlier  comment  made  by  honourable  Maharaj  in  regards  to  the 
<br/>resignation of the Special Administrator because he has a conflict of interest as he tried to object to 
<br/>the development of the  hotel.  All  I am saying,  Mr. Speaker, there is  definitely a huge disparity.  
<br/>There is no issue about the Special Administrator.  The issue is about the land which was illegally 
<br/>transferred to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Sir - Standing Order 74(1).  The practice of Parliament, 
<br/>Sir, if he be asked a question, he simply answer the question.  This is a completely different matter 
<br/>that he is talking about.  If he wants to, he can answer it at a later stage, Sir.  This is not the forum 
<br/>for him because he does not have the right to respond to it.  Please let him stick to the question, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Minister.  Would you mind sticking to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue that is being raised rather than that hotel which was raised by honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to honourable Rinesh Sharma’s 
<br/>question and I must thank him for his pertinent question.  I am aware that honourable Sharma, being 
<br/>a graduate from India, is well acquainted with the quality of training and education taught in India. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that the first-of-its-kind educational trip for our cane farmers to 
<br/>India was, indeed, a great success and a fruitful one for all the participants. </span><span>Firstly, I want to convey 
<br/>my  deepest  gratitude  to  the  Government  of  India  for  sponsoring  the  two-weeks  training  for  all  the  18 
<br/>participants,  including  14 cane  farmers  and  four  officials from  the  Sugar  Cane Growers  Council  (SCGC). 
<br/>These 14 farmers included four female and ten male farmers that are actively growing and supplying cane to 
<br/>the mills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  sincerest  appreciation  also  goes  to  the  National  Sugar  Institute  of  Kanpur  for  hosting  our 
<br/>participants and arranging all logistics for our delegates.  For the information of this august Parliament, the 
<br/>Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) has just recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National 
<br/>Sugar Institute, Kanpur, to acquire the benefit from their training for FSC mills and staff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The comprehensive two-week training, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was made possible by the SCGC with the 
<br/>exceptional support of the Indian High Commission in Fiji. The discussions began in 2023 with a submission 
<br/>of a proposal by the SCGC to the Indian High Commission which was well received and considered to be 
<br/>fully funded  by  the  Government  of  India  under  the  Indian Technical  and  Economic  Co-operation  (ITEC) 
<br/>programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon receiving the approval from the Government of India, the SCGC management 
<br/>identified participants based on selection criteria approved by the Council. The criteria included the need to a 
<br/>balanced gender, ethnic mix and the need for representation of farmers across the cane production areas. The 
<br/>14 farmers selected are progressive farmers, and influential in their farming communities as a lead farmer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the SCGC have been continuously provided with the various training by FSC and the 
<br/>Sugar  Research  Institute  of  Fiji  (SRIF)  through the  Farmer  Field  Schools  and  Demonstration 
<br/>Trials.  However, there is a need to provide exposure to these farmers to other cane producing countries, 
<br/>especially, India, as one of the largest producers of sugarcane. As we say, seeing is believing; therefore, such 
<br/>international exposure provided an opportunity for our farmers to attain modern cane farming practices and 
<br/>technologies available for improving yields.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two-week training, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was tailor-made to fulfil the needs and capacity requirements 
<br/>of  our  farmers.  The  participants  visited  various  sites  including  sugar  research  institutes,  sugar  factories, 
<br/>attended field-days, had interaction sessions with successful farmers and visited their farms in the State of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Uttar Pradesh.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  highlighted,  the  objective  of  the  programme  was  to  provide  an  international 
<br/>exposure to our farmers. Uttar Pradesh was a preferred choice as they have the same language as a medium of 
<br/>exchange that eased communication, similar farming practices, and is the largest sugar producing state in India. 
<br/>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the research and mill visits, the participants were able to learn about the adaptation of the new 
<br/>improved cane varieties, effective crop</span><span> </span><span>management practices, crop diversification opportunities, practice of 
<br/>crop rotation and intercropping, pest and weed management practices, soil health, plant nutrition and farm 
<br/>mechanization. In principle, the participants gained insights on methods to enhance cane productivity, model 
<br/>farm set-up, fertiliser applications, disease control, weed management and integrated approaches combining 
<br/>traditional knowledge with modern technologies for sustainable cane production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key attributes of learning were: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hands-on learning for farmers to experience both, sugar mill operations and farm practices that 
<br/>will provide deeper understanding of how farmers actions on farms affect the quality and quantity 
<br/>of cane subsequently sugar made at the mills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Holistic approach, the farmers learnt how integrating mills and farm visits encourage them to 
<br/>adopt a holistic approach to sugar cane cultivation and to optimise yield including learning about 
<br/>the  preparation  and  different  planting  methods.    The  importance  of  planting  quality  cane, 
<br/>adoption  of  good  crops,  husbandry  practices  and  the  importance  of  soil  analysis  and  plant 
<br/>nutrients.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Visitations to farms allowed farmers to identify and tailor solutions to address specific solutions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or opportunities unique on their farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Exposure to a range of practices encouraged farmers to innovate and adapt approach in response 
<br/>to changing market trends, technological advancements and environmental considerations. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is essential for long-term sustainability in strengthening growers’ commitment 
<br/>to remain competitive in the sugar industry. The learnings from models of crop diversification, 
<br/>intercropping  and  crop  rotation  have  certainly  broadened  our  farmers  understanding  on  the 
<br/>possibilities of improving revenue, profits and enhance farm sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Understanding the importance of selective harvesting of matured cane and green cane harvesting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to improve sugar recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Revenue Diversification by mills – visits to mills allowed farmers to understand the importance 
<br/>of  diversification  into  cogeneration,  ethanol  production,  refined  sugar  production  and  value 
<br/>addition into speciality sugar, something that I have planned for our sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  having  acquired  the  necessary  knowledge,  our  14  farmers  are  now  required  to 
<br/>practice and share their learnings with fellow farmers under a prudent monitoring structure set by SCGC.  The 
<br/>four officials of SCGC were part of the tour team to learn all the ways and practices whereby they learnt ways 
<br/>to improve service delivery and support to farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must note that sugarcane is a permanent crop and requires 14 months to 16 
<br/>months to mature, therefore, we must not expect miracles to happen by tomorrow on the farms of these 14 
<br/>farmers.  The new planting season begins this month and I expect these farmers to plant new cane and begin 
<br/></span><span>applying their knowledge on their farms which they learnt from India.  Therefore, we can expect positive 
<br/></span><span>results from the 2025 harvesting season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  mentioned,  the  SCGC  staff  will  work  very  closely  with  the  Sugar  Research 
<br/>Institute of Fiji and FSC to monitor the progress of these 14 farmers including those in the nearby communities 
<br/>to assess the efficiency in capacity building.  I am informed that these farmers have already outlined their 
<br/>plans and will showcase it to fellow farmers in their communities through field days with the support of the

<div><span>Sugar Research Institute of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, such an educational trip was the first of its kind but not the last one.  
<br/>We will continue to have dialogue with the Government of India to make this programme an ongoing event 
<br/>for our cane producers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Supplementary question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I expressed in the last Parliament session that I had a 
<br/>couple  of  youths  who  had  approached  me  and  asked  how  could    they  go  on  this  trip  as  well.    Can  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Sugar Industry elaborate on his selection criteria of the 14 farmers and how has his 
<br/>Ministry ensured that there was a balance of youth representation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I already outlined that selection was done by SCGC and I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not be able to elaborate as to what was the criteria like.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will skip the question that was supposed to have 
<br/>been raised by honourable Vocea, Question No. 47/2024, since the honourable Prime Minister has 
<br/>made a very thorough statement, and have taken care of the issues that he wanted to raise.

<div><span>Prevention of Future Problems - Fijiana Sevens Players  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 48/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Youth  and  Sports  inform  Parliament  as  to  what 
<br/>measures have been put in place to prevent the repetition of future incidents, like the Fijiana 
<br/>Sevens players sleeping on airport benches outside Sydney Airport? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I wish to congratulate the Fijian Drua for 
<br/>the win in the weekend and also to congratulate the Lautoka Maroons for successfully defending the 
<br/>Farebrother Sullivan Trophy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the question raised by the honourable Member.  Before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do that, Sir, please allow me to make the following remarks:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding a similar comment you have made, Sir, in the last sitting, I did receive a letter 
<br/>from the Office of the Prime Minister, seeking clarification on the issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A report from Rugby House was received and forwarded to the Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/>which confirmed that the allegation was false, and we had discussed the same during our 
<br/>Parliament Workshop at Natadola.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  categorically  state  in  this  august  Parliament  that  your  Coalition  Government, 
<br/></span><span>through the Ministry of Youth and Sports, is committed to the development of sports in 
<br/>Fiji.  The honourable Prime Minister shared the values of our Vuvale Partnership and sports 
<br/>diplomacy in his Ministerial Statement this morning.  Sports has provided pathways for our 
<br/>youth to live their dreams.  Sports have been the catalyst of change for our youth to move 
<br/>away from criminal activities.  Sports is the cornerstone of a healthy and vibrant nation. Sir, 
<br/>players welfare and safety has always been the core of our development.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>639 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to the Oral Question, Sir, your Coalition Government with the Ministry of Youth 
<br/>and Sports and Fiji Rugby is deeply concerned about the recent reports regarding the situation faced 
<br/>by our Fiji Airways Fijiana Sevens Team at Sydney Airport on December 2023, as they transited to 
<br/>Dubai.  The welfare and comfort of our athletes are of utmost importance to  us, and we sincerely 
<br/>apologise for any inconvenience on discomfort caused to the Team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to this incident, we want to assure our stakeholders, fans and, 
<br/>most  importantly,  our  players,  that  we  are  implementing  immediate  measures  to  prevent  such 
<br/>occurrences in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to highlight that a new Team Manager has been on board since January 
<br/>2024, following a transparent and merit-based recruitment process. This change aims to enhance the 
<br/>overall management and logistical support provided to our teams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  we  have  established  a  central  database  for  series  and  teams’  documentation 
<br/>which is meticulously maintained by the Team Manager.  This ensures that all necessary information 
<br/>and plans are easily accessible and organised, contributing to smoother operations during travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regular  management  meetings  are  now  held  with  both,  the  men’s  and 
<br/>women’s team managers prior to any trip, enabling thorough discussion of travel plans and ensuring 
<br/>that appropriate arrangements are in place, particularly during long transit periods.  This collaborative 
<br/>approach  fosters  efficiency  and  coordination  between  Team  Managers,  ultimately,  benefiting  the 
<br/>entire programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  schedules  are  shared  and  coordinated  between  both  teams.    The  Sevens 
<br/>Programme  Manager  overseas  travel  schedules  and  activities  to  avoid  any  overlaps  on  conflicts.  
<br/>After each series leg, comprehensive reports are prepared by the Coach and Manager, highlighting 
<br/>any areas that require attention or improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rugby remains committed to providing the highest level of support and 
<br/>care for our athletes and we will continue to review and enhance processes to uphold these standards.  
<br/>We appreciate the understanding and patience of our supporters, as we look towards ensuring the 
<br/>wellbeing and success of our Teams. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Just  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  honourable  Koya  for  his  supplementary 
<br/>question,  I  stand  to  be  corrected,  honourable  Minister,  on  your  opening  reply  that  my  report  to 
<br/>Cabinet was false regarding the men’s team before the issue on the question which has now been 
<br/>raised is regarding the women’s team.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, the allegations that were forwarded to you…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, it was not forwarded to me.  I forwarded it to the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, Sir, we received that report from the Fiji Rugby Union and they 
<br/></span><span>fully explained their position on that allegation, which we have forwarded to the Office of the Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister and it was confirmed that it was false.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- My report to the honourable Prime Minister was false? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- No, Sir, the person that had advised…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I was not advised. In fact, I was delegated in this duty by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister to go.  All we are talking about here is the welfare of our players.  As a former rugby 
<br/>player for our Lautoka Team, that is where we are now, as champions of the Farebrother Sullivan 
<br/>Trophy.  But, again, the person that complained was the Coach. I did not go there to go and listen to 
<br/>complaints, I went there to hand out the jerseys as asked of me by the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>because he was busy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When that issue came up, I raised it by way of a report simply on that basis. So, if we are 
<br/>going to continue with this pointing of fingers, that someone is lying, this is false, then heaven knows 
<br/>what else may come through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second team was the Fijiana Sevens Team.  They were shown pictures of them sleeping 
<br/>on the benches  and that  is  where the question is  coming from.   All  I am  raising is,  now that my 
<br/>complaint has been labelled as false by the Fiji Rugby Union because honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau 
<br/>was unhappy with the question now being posed in the Business Committee. I said, “No, let us hear 
<br/>it”.   The good thing about hearing it is because now, mine is being labelled as “false”.  I would like 
<br/>to implore upon you, honourable Minister, please, have your fingers on the pulse.  That is all I would 
<br/>like to say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, if I may, this has become a very sore topic and I may offer 
<br/>some advice, honourable Minister, this requires a thorough investigation, especially now in light of 
<br/>the fact that you are saying that the complaint put forward by Mr. Speaker, has turned out to be a lie.   
<br/>I think it requires a thorough investigation has to what is actually going on in FRU and someone 
<br/>responsible needs to go home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question was,  is  this is  the only  occasion  that  this  happened?   I think it has just been 
<br/>answered, there are other occasions that this has happened.  Have there been other occasions where 
<br/>our  rugby  team  -  our  pride  and  joy,  whether  it  be  the  female  or  the  male  team  or  any  sporting 
<br/>organisations, has this ever happened before, especially in light of the fact that the answer that was 
<br/>given, Mr. Speaker, was, “oh, it was FRU’s fault”, and they started a big finger-pointing exercise.   
<br/>Everyone knows in the whole wide world that Sydney Airport shuts at 12 o’clock.  Where and who 
<br/>was responsible for doing the logistics for our rugby team? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, unfortunately, this is not the first time that has 
<br/>happened.  It has happened in the past as well, from the report received from the Fiji Rugby Union. 
<br/>This is what we are trying to address now, particularly the administration and the logistical support 
<br/>for the teams before they leave our shores. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for that reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the fact that we have already won two Gold 
<br/>Medals in Sevens, we have won  a Bronze Medal for the women and we understand the psychological 
<br/>nature or the impact to the players can be very, very important for our possibility of winning a third 
<br/>Gold and a medal for the women.  Can the honourable Minister assure us that all measures have been 
<br/>put in place to make sure that the team members will be in full condition, the best possible conditions 
<br/></span><span>– mentally, psychologically and emotionally, to make sure that they bring those Gold Medals back 
<br/></span><span>to this country? We want to hear from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his comments.  
<br/>We  are  taking  that  on  board.    For  this  particular  incident,  I  never  elaborated  on  the  cause  of  the 
<br/>incident that happened.  It was a misunderstanding between World Rugby and Fiji Rugby Union.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World Rugby was supposed to provide the transportation part of it but they never realised 
<br/>that  Sydney  Airport  will  close  at  11  o’clock.  Based  on  that,  that  is  why  it  was  never  taken  into 
<br/>account.  The girls had to sleep outside and there was no prior arrangement from Fiji Rugby Union.  
<br/>Of course, we are taking that on board, I want to assure this august Parliament and members of the 
<br/>public listening and watching television that we are prepared for the Olympics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government seems to talk a lot but we have seen 
<br/>our sports women and men are affected and as the honourable Minister has said, this is not the first 
<br/>time, it is the second time.  The question to the honourable Minister is, was any action taken against 
<br/>the person or particular staff responsible behind this debacle?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have stated that it was World Rugby’s fault but at the end of the day, when Ministers 
<br/>and our sports people are travelling, there is someone managing these things.  Was any action taken 
<br/>against the staff? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think I will not allow that because the honourable Minister has fully 
<br/>explained.  There was some kind of communication problem between the World Rugby Union of 
<br/>which FRU is an affiliated member of.  So, they organised these things, that did not happen, so people 
<br/>slept on the benches.  We leave it at that, honourable Lal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we will adjourn Parliament for lunch now.  We will return at 2.30 p.m.

<div><span>Operational Partners Agreement for Global Environment Facility 
<br/>(Question No. 49/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Operational Partners 
<br/>Agreement for Global Environment Facility (GEF) for Community Based Integrated Natural 
<br/>Resource Management (CBINRM)?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 26</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024, Cabinet approved the 
<br/>Operational Partners Agreement for the Global Environment Facility Six-Cycle (GEF-6) Project with 
<br/>the  Food  and  Agricultural  Organization  (FAO),  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Strategic    Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Community Based Integrated Natural Resource Management (CBINRM) Project, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, centres on two Provinces - in Ra and in Tailevu.  The specific focus of the Project is to 
<br/>address  the  rate  of  deforestation  across  the  Nakauvadra  and  Tomaniivi-Wabu  Forest  Reserves 
<br/>towards the lowlands of Tailevu Province, including mangrove zones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Project is essentially to promote CBINRM) at landscape level to reduce 
<br/>land  degradation,  enhance  carbon  stocks  and  strengthen  local  livelihoods  in  Ra  and  Tailevu 
<br/>Provinces.  Through the Project implementation, it aims to address the negative development impacts 
<br/>of unsustainable forest management, while addressing the poverty and livelihood demands of local 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to benefit approximately 3,500 individuals from 
<br/>17 villages, or 21 landowning units in the district of Dawasamu and Namena in the Tailevu Province, 
<br/>and  Nakorotubu  in  the  Ra  Province,  through  the  implementation  of  the  three  components  of  the 
<br/>Project which involves strengthening local capacities, community based integrated natural resource 
<br/>management and monitoring and evaluating the lessons of dissemination to replicate it elsewhere.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Project will oversee the implementation of the following activities: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 47,719  hectares  of  land  under  Improved  Land  Use  Plan  Integrated  Natural  Resource 
<br/>Management  at  district  level,  through  the  development  of  appropriate  land  use  plans, 
<br/>community integrated development plans and implementation of appropriate restoration 
<br/>programmes.  
<br/> Appropriate  training  and  support  provided  towards  income  generating  activities,  the 
<br/>introduction and supply of resilient crops, as well as revitalisation of traditional knowledge 
<br/>and practices for food and nutrition security and build communities’ resilience. 
<br/>Empowerment  of  community  members,  especially  the  inclusion  and  engagement  of 
<br/>women and youth in sustainable development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Project  implementation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  requires  a  total  of  US$2,119,425  million, 
<br/>which is equivalent to  FJ$4.8 million, the amount approved by the GEF Secretariat.  Of the total 
<br/>allocation for the Ministry - $3.7 million, the remaining balance of FJ$1 million will remain with 
<br/>FAO to cover the cost relating to the Project’s monitoring and evaluation, including mid-term and 
<br/>final  project  review.    Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  also  subject  to  change  as  the  Project 
<br/>progresses.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Operational Partners Agreement for the Global Environment Facility 
<br/>Six-Cycle  Project  on  Community  Based  Integrated  Resource  Management  has  been  signed.    The 
<br/>Ministry of Finance is in the process of releasing the first funding and, therefore, the project is almost 
<br/>ready to go.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FAO  is  GEF’s  implementing  agency  in  this  particular  case  and  has  an  overall 
<br/>responsibility not only in Fiji, but for similar projects elsewhere.  The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs is 
<br/>the main Government counterpart and will have the overall executing and technical responsibility of 
<br/>the Project, with FAO providing technical oversight as the agency chosen by the GEF, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be a Project Steering Committee, as is the case with 
<br/>most  funded  grant  and  loan  funded  projects,  which  will  include  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and 
<br/>Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Climate Change and the Ministry of Finance and 
<br/>Officials from FAO.  Basically, the idea of the Project Steering Committee is to ensure that all the 
<br/>preparations and different aspects of implementing the Project on the ground is fully done and that 
<br/>the benefits eventually flow to the people whom the project is intended to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  some  cases,  and  sometimes  more  often  than  not,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  these  kinds  of 
<br/>projects, a lot of funding does not necessarily end up to helping the very people the project is intended 
<br/>(02:39:23)  to  do.    So,  the  Project  Steering  Committee,  obviously,  will  have  its  own  standards  to 
<br/>ensure that it is done.  For example, the six-monthly project progress, financial reports, looking at 
<br/>the annual workplan and making sure that the budget is implemented carefully.  So, that is update on 
<br/>the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There are no supplementary questions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will skip Question No. 50/2024 because that has been taken care 
<br/>of.  The Minister for Multiethnic Affairs has made his reply to the question that was raised earlier 
<br/>on.  We will go right to the sixth Oral Question for today.

<div><span>Re-Introduction of School Counselling Services 
<br/>(Question No. 51/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the re-introduction 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the School Counselling Services?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to provide some background into 
<br/>the  School  Counselling  Services  that  has  been  given  in  schools.  In  2001,  more  than  10  large 
<br/>secondary  school  counselling  positions  were  established  within  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  in 
<br/>2014, these positions were removed and the Counsellors that were appointed were given the teaching 
<br/>positions in the respective school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, since 2014, has strengthened the Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC). 
<br/>The  SAAC,  a  statutory  Unit  with  qualified  counsellors  provided  counselling  support  to  students 
<br/>referred from schools and the Unit is also mandated to provide basic counselling training to teachers. 
<br/>Therefore, 35 teacher counsellors were trained and certified with a Diploma in Counselling by APTC.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, Divisional Counsellor positions were established in the four Education Divisions. 
<br/>However, due to the previous Government’s reform of the Civil Service, the Divisional Counsellor 
<br/>positions at the Ministry of Education were neutralised and, even worse, Chaplains’ post was also 
<br/>removed in 2019.  All these mechanisms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support health, well-being, safety of 
<br/>teachers  and  students,  were  dismantled  and,  unfortunately,  could  have  led  to  the  increase  in 
<br/>disciplinary cases in our education system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education acknowledges that due to the increasing number of in-discipline 
<br/>cases  referred to  the SAAC over the years from  the schools is  quiet alarming, with  recent media 
<br/>report of 3,742, an urgent need to decentralise the School Counselling Services to the four Education 
<br/>Divisions, Districts and in large schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  all  the  changes  that  have  impacted  our  social  fabric,  the  Ministry  of  Education  in 
<br/>collaboration  with  the  Australian  Government  under  the  Vuvale  Partnership,  have  established 
<br/>counselling hubs in all the four Education Divisions and these hubs are in the selected Government 
<br/>schools.  However,  counselling  support  is  provided  to  all  students  in  their  respective  education 
<br/>divisions.  The counselling hubs were opened in 2023 at Natabua High School, Nasinu Secondary 
<br/>School, Labasa College and Levuka Public School in 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all disciplinary cases that are reported to the School Heads, for example, for 
<br/>drug  use,  drug  peddling,  sex  related  offences  which  require  counselling  services  intervention  are 
<br/>registered at the District and Divisional Education Offices. These cases are then referred to the SAAC 
<br/>Office, as they are classified as high risk, and SAAC contacts the various Heads of Schools in the 
<br/>Divisions to release the trained counsellors from respective schools - the 35 trained counsellors, to 
<br/>attend  to  the  students.  As  always,  parental  consent  is  obtained  by  the  Head  of  School  prior  to 
<br/>registration  of  the  cases  with  the  District  Offices  and  parents  are  present  during  all  counselling 
<br/>sessions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  SAAC,  in  collaboration  with  District  and  Divisional  Education  Offices,  monitor  and 
<br/>evaluate the work of the counselling services, reports and follow ups of the cases are submitted to 
<br/>SAAC, and depending on the seriousness of the cases, these are referred to the relevant authorities, 
<br/>such as the Department of Social Welfare, Medical Services Pacific, Ministry of Health and the Fiji 
<br/>Police Force for their necessary support and actions. Sir, SAAC is also expected to provide a monthly 
<br/>report to the Minister of Education’s Office on the work carried out by the organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education acknowledges that there are limitations in our effort to attend to 
<br/>all cases that are happening in schools as the counselling hubs are located in town areas and SAAC 
<br/>has limited powers also as their work with rural school cases greatly depend on the availability of 
<br/>support,  the  availability  of  transport  and  the  availability  of  finances  from  District  and  Divisional 
<br/>Education Offices. The counsellors are then expected to travel to rural schools, subject to availability 
<br/>of transportation and the release of the counsellor from the respective Head of School. Thank you 
<br/>very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Supply of Tuna in Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 52/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and  Forestry inform Parliament  whether 
<br/>Fiji  has sufficient  supply of tuna to  support the Government’s recent  announcement of its 
<br/>intention to sell more tuna internationally? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>645 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to answer the question of Fiji tuna supply, we first 
<br/>need to understand the different categories of fishing feeds that Fiji use to source its tuna.  These 
<br/>categories are differentiated under the following fleet: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Fish fleet; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Foreign fishing fleet based in Fiji; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Foreign fleet based in foreign ports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from these three  categories, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, to  understand Fiji’s  tuna supply, it is 
<br/>imperative that we learn the nature of tuna and that it is a highly migratory species.  In layman’s term, 
<br/>this means that tuna knows no bo8undaries and they move around a lot. Tuna that we catch in our 
<br/>waters today is likely to be in Tonga on high seas tomorrow.  Therefore, they will be targeted by 
<br/>fishing vessels in Tonga and those in high seas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This means Mr. Speaker, Sir, that fishing vessels and fishing nations such as Fiji compete for 
<br/>the same school of tuna that migrate and feed across our different EEZ.  That is why there is always 
<br/>a shortage in raw materials to support Fiji’s aspiration to increasing our market for export size. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in highlighting this, the Government’s recent announcement to underpin the 
<br/>need to ensure that we have enough raw materials feeding our processing facilities.  The processing 
<br/>facilities that handle and process fresh and frozen products line including canaries.  Currently, we 
<br/>have seen a steady increase in raw materials which relate to the increase in catch sourced from our 
<br/>Fiji fleet and foreign fleet calling into Fiji ports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that change do not  happen overnight and there needs to  be 
<br/>policies, legislation, partnership agreement and investment on infrastructure that need to be directed 
<br/>to the tuna sector, if we are to see drastic increases on our volume of export and market shares.  In 
<br/>light,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  great  emphasis  on  future  export  needs,  the  current  Government  is 
<br/>working towards policies and legislation that supports and increase the number of vessels calling into 
<br/>Fiji ports to lend its catch for our processing facilities.  While we are currently seeing a constant on 
<br/>steady supply of tuna, we are also mindful that due to the complexity of the tuna sector, some of 
<br/>these developments takes time.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are optimistic that this is the right approach, 
<br/>and the right people will increase our market and export shares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Tuna knows no boundaries.  I did not know they were that knowledgeable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about boundaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>his detailed explanation.  In 2019, PAFCO at Levuka was only generating about 18 tonnes per day, 
<br/>in 2020 it was producing 120 tonnes a day. What I wanted to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not 
<br/>the result of the fishing vessels that comes into Fiji.  Fong Chun Formosa Company (FCF) Taiwan 
<br/>bought Bumble Bee and when Bumble Bee was bought by FCF, they are the biggest supplier of tuna 
<br/>around the world.   Basically, they had  been feeding PAFCO to  ensure that the workers there are 
<br/>employed for the seven days.  My question to the honourable Minister, does he think that there is 
<br/>surplus  demand  now  for  the  Government  to  go  around  the  world  and  try  and  sell  tuna  to  other 
<br/></span><span>countries mainly in Europe and USA? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as he alluded to earlier regarding FCF being the major 
<br/>supplier to PAFCO but as  mentioned that PAFCO is producing only 13 tonnes on a daily basis.  We 
<br/>cannot supply and sell tuna around the world unless we have the capacity in our industry to supply, 
<br/>so we are signing an Agreement with PAFCO and FCF to give us 250 tonnes of tuna per month of 
<br/>tuna so we can access into other countries in the supply of tuna and canneries.

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister from a trade perspective, I know 
<br/>the honourable Minister has been out looking for people to invest in the industry, is the focus on the 
<br/>supply  of  tuna  to  only  PAFCO  or  is  the  focus  on  developing  the  industry  so  that  we  have  more 
<br/>suppliers of the product that is actually going out from Fiji in terms of trade? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are trying to do both at the same time.  First, we 
<br/>try to get the stock and we try to move in this tuna hub into the Pacific to attract fishers and fishing 
<br/>companies to come to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a supplementary question. I wish to 
<br/>thank the honourable Minister for his answer. Can the honourable Minister advice Parliament on the 
<br/>recent  innovative  technology  and  e-platform  development  currently  underway  to  improve  service 
<br/>delivery and operation of the tuna sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  use  of  advance  innovation  technology  and  e-
<br/>platform  is  critical  and  imperative  in  this  day  and  age.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  work  to  advance 
<br/>innovation and e-platform was initiated by me last year during my study visit  to Forum Fisheries 
<br/>Agency (FFA) in Solomon Islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this visit, I was able to secure the support of the FFA to help us realise the aspiration 
<br/>in technology and e-systems.  Throughout last year, we have worked closely with FFA to conduct 
<br/>the  needed  scope  of  work  and  secure  external  funding  to  finance  this  work.    This  led  to  a  trial 
<br/>conducted on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.  Fiji electronic post grade massive platform; 
<br/>2.  Fiji electronic catch document scheme; and 
<br/>3.  Fiji boarding and inspection electronic platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also honoured to confirm that the trial phase has been completed with 
<br/>the launch date scheduled for next month.  The milestone achievement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will indeed 
<br/>strengthen our ability to address a daily operation and needs to provide a more streamlined platform 
<br/>to assist our tuna stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He was really prepared for that supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answers from the honourable Minister is sort 
<br/>of confusing me. He is talking about migratory species and then we know that this is an extractive 
<br/>industry, the tuna stocks are depleting.  My question is on the licenses that we issue because there 
<br/>has been efforts in the past to reduce the number of licences, yet the honourable Minister is talking 
<br/>about  getting  more  tuna  stocks.    This  is  why  I  am  confused,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  and  I  want  the 
<br/>honourable Minister to  state the direction that the Ministry is  taking in order to address  all these 
<br/>issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Have  you  got  that,  honourable  Minister?    You  want  to  reply?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned earlier, we have limited licence here in Fiji for our EEZ but 
<br/>what we are trying to do now is to get this tuna hub in the Pacific to get those foreign fishing boats 
<br/>to come and lend their fish in Fiji.  That is the reason why we are limiting our licences and try to get

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the foreign fishing boats to lend and supply our fish.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The tuna hub comes from where?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- From other Pacific Island countries and the other neighbouring countries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like Japan and Taiwan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Supplementary question is in relation to what the honourable Minister 
<br/>has just said about the focus of the Ministry to bring in tuna from other countries into Fiji.  We have 
<br/>had a shipping fleet in this country for a number of years and a lot of those ships are berthed in the 
<br/>Suva Harbour, they cannot fish, the fisherman are not fishing.  There are families that depend upon 
<br/>them, they cannot go to sea because of the high costs, et cetera.  The Ministry is focused on bringing 
<br/>fish, what is it doing about our local fishing fleet that is sitting out in the harbours that are not sailing 
<br/>at all? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, we would not want you to elaborate on that hub you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are trying to bring here, maybe sleeping there now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will look into that issue. I think that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a new question coming up and we will try to sort that in the Ministry, our institution.
