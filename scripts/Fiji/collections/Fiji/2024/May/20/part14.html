<div><span>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Corrections  Service  (Amendment)  Bill  2024  (Bill  No.  02/2024)  be  considered  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other committee of Parliament; 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated, voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024, but that 
<br/>one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Corrections Service Act 2006 provides for the 
<br/>establishment  of  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  (FCS),  the  administration  of  prisons  in  Fiji,  the 
<br/>treatment of the prisoners including the remission of their sentences, early release schemes and the 
<br/>discharge of prisoners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act was enacted in 2006 and commenced on 27</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2008.  The Corrections Service 
<br/>has  since  identified  areas  in  the  Act  which  necessitates  the  need  for  the  amendment  to  the  Act.  
<br/>Therefore, the Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 seeks to amend the Act to – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extend the list of international standards and instruments that the Corrections Service 
<br/>may be guided by regarding the treatment of prisoners; 
<br/>allow the Commissioner of the Corrections Service to appoint medical officers to the 
<br/>Corrections Service for the care of prisoners; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>provide for the mandatory medical examination of prisoners upon their admission and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discharge; 
<br/>introduce the provisions to establish a Central Allocation Classification Board within 
<br/>the Corrections Service; and 
<br/>correct inconsistency terminology throughout the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is urgent for the Government as it incorporates changes to align 
<br/>with the current practice of the Corrections Service, which will improve the administration of the 
<br/></span><span>Corrections Service.  There has been wider consultation with the Office of the Solicitor-General and 
<br/></span><span>with the Fiji Corrections Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There may be questions asked by the Opposition as to why the need for Standing Order 51.  
<br/>The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just to put some clarity into some of the gaps from the Act in 2004.  
<br/>Later on, there will be a holistic review of the Act, so this is necessary.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>649 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  1  of  the  Bill  which  provides  for  the  short  title  and  commencement.    If  passed  by 
<br/>Parliament, the amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister that is 
<br/>set.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act to provide for the definitions of terms used 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 3 to  extend the list  of international  standards that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corrections Service must be guided by. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 5 of the Act to allow the Commissioner, for the purpose 
<br/>of an investigation, to direct any officer of the Corrections Service to answer questions under oath or 
<br/>affirmation and produce a record or item in the officer’s possession. The amendment also limits the 
<br/>delegation of the Commissioner’s powers to a senior officer only, so it is basically to address the 
<br/>abuse of power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 8 of the Act by deleting any reference to certain terms for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarification purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 10 of the Act to provide that any officer of the Corrections 
<br/>Service who is absent without leave for more than seven days will be deemed to have resigned from 
<br/>the Corrections Service.  This is one of the problems that is faced by the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>where people go over seven days and in some case 10 or even 21 and there is no definite solution as 
<br/>to in terms of the HR how we deal with these problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  7  of  the  Bill  amends  section  15  of  the  Act  to  allow  the  Commissioner  to  appoint 
<br/>medical officers to the Corrections Service.  Under the Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of 
<br/>medical  officers  are  done  by  the  Permanent  Secretary,  now  the  power  is  vested  with  the 
<br/>Commissioner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 18 of the Act to include a Judge as the visiting justice.  
<br/>Under the Act, the visiting justice refers to a senior magistrate.  Now we enlarge the provision to also 
<br/>include judges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 9 of the Bill  amends section 26 of the Act  by mandating that upon admission and 
<br/>immediately before discharge, a prisoner must be medically examined.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the 
<br/>issues raised constantly over time and time again is the issue of violence against prisoners or the 
<br/>allegations  so  it  is  apparent  that  there  must  be  a  medical  report  upon  admission  and  also  before 
<br/>discharge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  11  of  the  Bill  amends  section  33(3)  of  the  Act  so  that  Assistant  Commissioner  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Operations and the Commissioner are informed about the medical condition of any prisoner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 12 of the Bill  amends the Act  by inserting a new section 36A which establish the 
<br/>Central Allocation and Classification Board.  These boards are basically to tabulate the records of 
<br/></span><span>those who come in as inmates as to the date of their release of other rehabilitation services which 
<br/></span><span>should be afforded to them during their period catered for by Fiji Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 41(1) of the Act so that arms may only be issued to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Correction Officers upon the order of the Commissioner.  I think this is straightforward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 14 of the Bill amends section 43(3) of the Act by deleting reference to “fair wages” 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and substituting “income” for consistency purposes.  This is the income from activities performed by 
<br/>inmates so upon release, they will be paid that income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 15 of the Bill amends section 46(2) of the Act by inserting an additional eligibility 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>requirement that would allow prisoners to be released under the Early Release Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 16 of the Bill amends section 51(3) of the Act by substituting “firearm” with “arms” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for consistency purposes. Arms and ammunitions are defined as “arms”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that Parliament considers the Bill without delay to give clarity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in terms of administration enforcement that will be debated on Thursday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to start off by saying at the outset that 
<br/>this Government has never brought a Bill to Parliament that is not using Standing Order 51.  The 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  needs  to  know  that  because  the  gentleman  sitting  on  his  right, 
<br/>gentleman  sitting  on  his  left  and  those  two  who  are  sitting  behind  him,  and  a  few  others  in  this 
<br/>Parliament  have  always  been  against  Standing  Order  51.    So,  I  will  say  it  again,  when  you  say 
<br/>something and you do that exact opposite, you are a hypocrite; that is what it is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill needs to be taken to Committees.  I give you one example of very poor drafting that 
<br/>I, a non-lawyer, have already seen.  Clause 2.9 states and I quote: “Clause 10 of the Bill amends 
<br/>section 26 of the Act by mandating upon admission and immediately before discharge, a person must 
<br/>be medically examined.”  What does that mean?  It means nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The other one that I am talking about is clause 2.14 is the removal of 
<br/>words “fair wages” to talk about income.  What does that mean?  That we want to treat prisoners 
<br/>differently from other people that are employed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think with some of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these types of Bills must be taken to 
<br/>Committees  so  it  can  be  scrutinised  in  detail  so  that  we,  the  Members  of  Parliament,  the 
<br/>representatives of the voters of this country, have an opportunity to look at it in detail. On that ground, 
<br/>I do not support the motion that it be taken through Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  agree  with  my  fellow  Opposition  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament’s  comments,  but  I  just  have  a  question  with  respect  to  the  Board  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister spoke about and this is contained in Clause 12 of the Bill.  This is section 36A which actually 
<br/>establishes  the  Central  Allocation  and  Classification  Board.    My  question  is  with  respect  to  this 
<br/>classification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure of the explanation that was given by the honourable Attorney-General, but the 
<br/></span><span>purpose  of  this  Board  is  to  make  recommendations  to  the  Commissioner  in  relation  to  the 
<br/></span><span>classification and allocation of prisoners to suitable Corrections Centres. When doing this, we are 
<br/>talking about Corrections Centres all around Fiji, Sir, and prisoners request for early release or short-
<br/>term release.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see the composition of the Board as being the Deputy Commissioner of Corrections Service 
<br/>as the Chairperson, the Assistant Commissioner Operations, the Director Rehabilitation, Supervisor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>651 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Central/Eastern Division (fair enough), Supervisor of Southern Division (fair enough) and a Senior 
<br/>Operations  Officer.    What  about  the  other  Corrections  Centres?    Where  is  the  Supervisor  for  the 
<br/>Western  Division?    Because  there  are  prisoners  who  are  all  around  Fiji,  should  it  not  be  that  we 
<br/>include the Western Division also - Supervisor for the Western Division?  Why are we Suva-centric 
<br/>or why are we Central/Eastern Division-centric and leaving out probably a very important category 
<br/>that ought to be in there?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That would be something that the honourable Attorney-General might want to look at. Is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there a particular purpose?  I am not sure, I do not know the reasoning behind it but most certainly, 
<br/>Sir, I think that would help in terms of getting the classification done for prisoners.  If there are 
<br/>reoffenders, et cetera, you would have had someone in the Western Division who is known to the 
<br/>Supervisor in the Western Division, et cetera.  My suggestion is that the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General amend it to include Western Division supervisory officers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to give the data back to honourable Usamate, 
<br/>there were 318 Bills and out of those, 290 Bills came under Standing Order 51. That is your record, 
<br/>93.7 percent.  It is only the first Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that the Bill is necessary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so that this implementation can be caried forward.  There will be a holistic review later on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. J. Usamate interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The honourable Member mentioned 2.9, that is the Explanatory Note, 
<br/>which is not part of the Bill.  In any case for any drafting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is a spelling error, 
<br/>that can be corrected later on.  I endorse the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being opposition, Parliament will now vote on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the first time, so Members made a mistake 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between minus and x, so instead of putting in minus, we placed x as exchange.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- For the sake of transparency, we will do that.  Please, let us reopen the vote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>once more.  The problem is this, you want to vote, and you also want to do the talking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes Cast 
<br/></span><span>Ayes   - 28 
<br/></span><span>- 23 
<br/>Noes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
