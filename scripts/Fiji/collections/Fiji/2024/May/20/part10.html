<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery, 
<br/>as  well  as  those  watching  the  proceedings  on  television  and  the  internet.  Thank  you  for  your 
<br/>continued interest in the workings of your Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  please,  join  me  in  also  welcoming  the  Ambassador  of  Japan,  His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency Mr. Rokuichiro Michii.  Thank you for joining us today, Your Excellency. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Communications from the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members to make use of this service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Women in Leadership 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  information  of  all  honourable  Members,  Parliament  will  host  a  Women’s  Mock 
<br/>Parliament,  focussing  on  the  theme,  “Women  in  Leadership”.    The  necessary  preparations  are 
<br/>underway, and we hope to have this event at the end of July this year.  The Secretariat is working 
<br/>closing with UNDP - Fiji Parliament Support Project, to ensure the successful implementation of this 
<br/>initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Formal Attire – Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the House Committee has duly met to discuss issues pertaining to the 
<br/>welfare of honourable Members and, at this juncture, please, allow me to convey the decision of the 
<br/>House Committee, which has also been endorsed Business Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you may remove your coat only after the Prayers each day, that is, 
<br/>your jacket.  Safari wear is deemed a formal attire, and this can be worn during Parliamentary Sittings, 
<br/>as well as Committee meetings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of Lunch During Parliamentary Sitting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the provision of lunch during Parliament sitting week will resume from 
<br/>this  week.    Quite  a  lot  of  requests  have  been  coming  from  both  sides  and  you  must  understand, 
<br/>honourable  Members,  that  I  have  also  requested  Medical  Teams  to  be  brought  in  for  medical 
<br/>checkups to be conducted here.  It is not that I want to scare you, but as has happened in the past, 
<br/>some honourable Members become unconscious during sittings, probably due to heavy food intake 
<br/>during parliamentary sittings.  But, again, lunch has been provided, honourable Ketan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee Review Report – Time Allocation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the Business Committee has agreed to uphold the practice in the April 
<br/>Sitting with respect to the speaking times in the debate in the Committee Review Reports, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>the mover will move the motion for up to five minutes; and  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>up to minutes for the right of reply.  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>There will only be two speakers from each side of Parliament and each of the two speakers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will have up to 10 minutes to speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key issue here is the Committee Reports. Please, do not confuse this when we will be 
<br/>having Treaties being brought before us and you might think this applies too, no, we will rely on the 
<br/>Whips to provide the list of speakers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information  of honourable Members,  I have also  received the  response to  Written 
<br/>Question  No.  09/2024  from  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  this  will  be  conveyed  to  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Premila Kumar and a copy will be uploaded on the Parliament website. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SODELPA Whip  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I have also received confirmation from the SODELPA Party Leader, 
<br/>honourable Aseri Radrodro, that honourable Ifereimi Vasu is now the SODELPA Whip.  I wish the 
<br/>honourable Minister the best in his tenure as Whip.

<div><span>Tabling of Report - Emoluments Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  have  been  informed  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  Emoluments 
<br/>Committee that the Committee Report will be tabled at a later sitting date, as it has not completed its 
<br/>deliberations.
