<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable

<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>665 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, during its review, had also cross-checked with the previous 
<br/>Public  Accounts  Committee  Reports  to  gauge  the  Municipal  Councils  and  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government’s response on the audit issues that were raised over the years. Sir, it is sad to say that 
<br/>the Public Accounts Committee’s recommendations that were tabled in Parliament in the past were 
<br/>not seriously taken by these Municipalities under the past Administrators and Management, as well 
<br/>as the Ministry of Local Government under its Director, Permanent Secretary and past Ministers. 
<br/>With this new Committee, under this new Government, we are not going to accept that, Sir, we are 
<br/>going to improve the situation for the betterment of the Municipalities and for the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  section  57(1)  and  (3)  of  the  Local  Government  Act  1972  establishes  the  financial 
<br/>accountability and legislative timeframe for Municipal Councils to produce and publish its audited 
<br/>financial statements. It is sad to say that most of them failed to meet their legislative requirements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  highlight  some  of  the  common  findings  that  were 
<br/>prevalent in those Municipalities.  The delays and backlog, there was lack of compliance with the 
<br/>Financial Reporting Framework, lack of compliance with the International Accounting Standards, 
<br/>lack of compliance with the Local Government Act and the limitation of scope or quality of the audit 
<br/>due to insufficient supporting documents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this lack of compliance is reflected in the audit opinion issued by the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General in the report who issued Modified (Qualified) audit opinions on six financial 
<br/>statements that were audited while seven financial statements were issued with modified, which is 
<br/>with a Disclaimer of Opinion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Committee identified a number of common issues across municipalities and necessary 
<br/>action is required to address the following and I am happy that the Minister and the current Permanent 
<br/>Secretary are working hand in hand to try and address those issues.  I wish to advise that currently 
<br/>there is a good level of management cohorts as well as Administrators in most of the Councils as 
<br/>well as the current Permanent Secretary and Minister and would like to acknowledge the hard work 
<br/>they are doing to clean their books and put in place internal control processes and update the account 
<br/>for timelines and quality. Minister, PS, Management and Administrators of Rakiraki, Tavua, Nadi, 
<br/>Levuka, Nausori, Labasa, Savusavu, Lami, Nasinu and Sigatoka, please continue the hard work to 
<br/>meet our 2025 target. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we are targeting with the assistance of the Office of the Auditor-General to 
<br/>update  all  accounts  in  the  2025  Financial  Year.  Some  are  outsourcing,  some  are  putting  in  place 
<br/>systems apart from recruiting the right personnel. I will not go into all the recommendations, Sir, but 
<br/>I will just highlight one which we discussed with all the municipalities.  We have given them July 
<br/>2024 to submit an Action Plan to the Committee as well as to Parliament an update of the financial 
<br/>accounts and clearance of all unsubstantiated balances and identifying and resolving all audit issues 
<br/>raised from 2013-2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Action Plan should include recommendations and implementations of verifications and 
<br/>finally any write-offs.  We have given them another six months (January 2025), all those actions to 
<br/>be implemented with the assistance of the Ministry of Finance for possible write-off.  Sir, given the 
<br/></span><span>issues  identified,  the  Committee  strongly  recommends  that  immediate  action  is  required  by  the 
<br/></span><span>respective municipalities and working closely with the Ministry of Local Government to improve 
<br/>financial accountability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Committee will continue to highlight issues in this august  Parliament 
<br/>until these municipalities improve their audit status and strengthen their systems and processes for 
<br/>public funds accountability purposes. With those few words, Mr. Speaker Sir, I as the Member  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moving the motion thank you for this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I concur with the Committee’s recommendations.  The 
<br/>Report is very comprehensive with very good recommendations. The Committee has also come up 
<br/>with many good findings.  I will be deliberating on the findings, recommendations of the Committee 
<br/>and the current issues faced by the ratepayers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noted from the Report that audits of some Councils’ accounts are on hold and this is 
<br/>due to some vacancies of senior staff in the Finance Department of the Councils.  I hope this will be 
<br/>addressed by the authorities at the earliest and these positions will be filled, following due process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, on the monitoring functions of the Councils, I am from Lautoka and I always drive 
<br/>past Nadi Airport and noticed overgrown bougainvillea.  This issue was also brought to my attention 
<br/>by  ratepayers.    On  one  side,  we  have  a  beautiful  International  Airport,  thanks  to  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, which is rated highly, and just a few metres away from the Airport, the people including 
<br/>tourists  are met  by overgrown bougainvillea.  Sometimes  I wonder if this  is  the latest  decorative 
<br/>design  or  failure  of  the  custodians.  The  idea  of  planting  bougainvillea  is  very  good,  but  regular 
<br/>maintenance and trimming is important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another recommendation by the Committee was on planning and action plan. One of the key 
<br/>functions of the Council is to provide quality service to the ratepayers.  Recently, some residents of 
<br/>Nasinu have raised concerns about poor service provided by the Nasinu Town Council, as many have 
<br/>faced drainage and issues of solid waste collection and nothing has been done.  It has been a health 
<br/>issue to many and a breeding site for mosquitoes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  issue  raised  was  on  uncollected  garbage  across  Nasinu  that  has 
<br/>become an eye sore and has caused blocked drains for the residents of Tovata, Nepani, Makoi, Narere, 
<br/>Nadera, Valelevu, Caubati, Kinoya and Nadawa.  This reflects poor planning.  The lack of services 
<br/>from the Council can lead to the spread of serious diseases, such as dengue and leptospirosis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During our visit to Labasa, it was mentioned that more investments need to be done in Labasa 
<br/>for a resilient economy.  While on one side a lot of talks are done in Parliament about development 
<br/>in the North, there are certain people interfering with the Council, even if it does not fall under their 
<br/>portfolio to stop investment.  I had been informed by a concerned ratepayer that one such investment 
<br/>is Hotel Development, whereby, the land was transferred to the iTLTB in 2003, and then iTLTB gave 
<br/>proper lease to the developer in 2011, after 60 percent consent was obtained from the landowning 
<br/>unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been informed by the ratepayer that the landowning unit are partners 
<br/>in this $10 million development.  In Parliament, we speak about empowering the landowners and 
<br/>here  we  are,  just  because  some  people  have  vested  interest,  objecting  the  empowerment  on  the 
<br/>ground.  That is a sad reality at the moment in this case.  My question is, why is Labasa Town Council 
<br/>not approving the development?  The second question, is there someone who has vested interest and 
<br/>trying to block the $10 million development?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Attorney-General to intervene.  The 
<br/></span><span>Government should honour the ruling of the courts and let the $10 million development to flourish. 
<br/>The Government has been preaching about development in the North before and after the election.  
<br/>Now, it is time for action, time to support development in the North, not to block development.  I 
<br/>support the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the motion before 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>667 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, firstly, I would like to express my very best wishes to the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> </span><span>o Nabukebuke</span><span>, Levuka 
<br/>on behalf of the </span><span>Vanua o</span><span> </span><span>Nabukebuke</span><span>, Namosi, on the installation of the Tui Levuka tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, before I share some insights into some 
<br/>of the recommendations and findings by the Committee, I would like to respond to some of the issues 
<br/>that were highlighted by honourable Chand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was waiting for him to, at least, share some of those issues with me before discussing it 
<br/>openly  in  Parliament  but  I  thank  him  for  that.  First  is  on  the  overgrown  bougainvillea  hedge  at  
<br/>Namaka Road near Nadi Town. I think he failed to understand that there is a working process in place 
<br/>where  the  Councils,  as  well  as  Fiji  Roads  Authority  (FRA)  do  their  work  according  to  the  work 
<br/>schedule.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to understand that there is a lot of rain in the West. It has also caused overgrown 
<br/>vegetation, as well as some of the overgrown areas in some of the spots. He only mentioned that spot 
<br/>but there are some spots and places that have been looked after by the Nadi Town Council. We must 
<br/>also appreciate the work done by the Nadi Town Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  solid  waste  around  Nasinu,  we  should  be  thankful  to  the  newly  appointed  Special 
<br/>Administrator for Nasinu Town Council for coming forward with some new strategies and policies 
<br/>to  manage some of the illegal  dumping of rubbish around the Nasinu  area.  Nasinu  is  one of the 
<br/>biggest  municipalities  in  Fiji  in  terms  of  population.  The  challenge  right  now  is  to  how  best  the 
<br/>Council  can  address  the  issue  of  illegal  dumping  of  rubbish.    I  was  sharing  this  with  honourable 
<br/>Pillay, he was also complaining about the same thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue right now in most Municipalities is that the garbage truck come and collect rubbish 
<br/>and as soon as they turn away from those sectors, the very next second, people come and dump their 
<br/>rubbish  on  the  road.  These  are  some  of  the  areas  that  I  have  also  instructed  the  new  Special 
<br/>Administrators to focus on. These are some of the basic services that we are trying to improve right 
<br/>now. So, in most of the Municipalities, these are some of the challenges that we are trying to address.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Labasa Town development, I want to reassure him that none of these newly appointed 
<br/>Special Administrators were appointed to hinder any type of progress in any of the municipalities. 
<br/>They are there to support the projects but if there are any issues regarding the projects, they have the 
<br/>right to investigate and find out the issues relating to some of these projects. That is the issue with 
<br/>the Labasa project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now try and respond to the motion before Parliament.  First, I thank 
<br/>the  Standing  Committee  and  its  Chairperson  for  doing  a  great  job  in  conducting  a  detailed  and 
<br/>thorough review, as well as coming up with very constructive recommendations.  I think there are 
<br/>about 15 of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going forward, it is a good lesson that the Ministry of Local Government has taken. We have 
<br/></span><span>been working with them to try and improve on some of these areas which are recurring issues. There 
<br/></span><span>is a need for us to take this on board and come up with new ways and strategies  on how we can 
<br/>improve on some of the recurring issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Local  Government  Act  1972  has  provisions  for  the  manning  of  the 
<br/>Councils  and  how  they  must  conduct  themselves.  However,  in  2009,  an  intervention  by  the  then 
<br/>Government led to disarray in the manner in which the Councils was supposed to conduct themselves.

<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  above  situations  led  to  complacency,  lack  of  accountability  and 
<br/>transparency. Most of the issues that have been highlighted by the Committee are legacy issues and 
<br/>common in all the Municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  Minister  responsible  for  the  Council  or  the  13  Municipalities  in  Fiji,  I  have,  since 
<br/>taking office, ensured that there will be clear guidance, advice and monitoring of the Councils.  Our 
<br/>focus  is  on  proactive  solutions  and  positive  transformation  for  the  Municipalities,  residents  and 
<br/>ratepayers’ benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the team at the Ministry, specifically the Department of Local Government, 
<br/>have  been  working  on  various  strategies,  policies  and  plans  to  ensure  that  before  the  Local 
<br/>Government Elections, the Municipal Councils are able to get rid of the current recurring audit issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform this august Parliament that the Ministry has been actively 
<br/>undertaking the following to ensure that Municipal Council’s teams - from Special Administrators to 
<br/>the Chief Executive Officers and 
<br/> all the Finance Teams are fully aware of their roles and responsibilities. These are the things that we 
<br/>have undertaken: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revision of the Finance Manual in 2023; and 
<br/>Budget  training  -  the  Special  Administrators,  Chief  Executive  Officers  and  Finance 
<br/>Manager of the Councils have been undergoing training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  though  the  Ministry  does  not  have  resources  to  train  each  and  every  member  of  the 
<br/>Finance Team of each Council, SMART strategies have been implemented and put in place to train 
<br/>the  team  leaders  who  are  required  to  train  their  teams.  These  additional  training  include;  Human 
<br/>Resource Training, Customer Service Training, Finance Training for CEOs, Finance Team in all the 
<br/>Municipalities, OMRS Training, as well as Project Management Training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those who have also been working in consultation and collaboration with the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General, we have partnered with them and recently in March 2024, they have conducted 
<br/>training on the following - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>audit processes; 
<br/>financial reporting processes; 
<br/>internal control; 
<br/>reconciliations; 
<br/>accounting records and asset management; and  
<br/>effective policies and procedures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the team at the Office of the Auditor-General for the 
<br/>intensive yet very focused training.  One of the vital issues highlighted in the Report is the need to 
<br/>standardize the accounting system that are to be used by all the Municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  speak,  different  Municipalities  have  different  accounting  systems.  Lautoka  City 
<br/></span><span>Council and Suva City Council have their own systems. Levuka Town Council are still doing things 
<br/></span><span>manually. So, these are some of the things the Ministry is trying to do, to ensure that we have a new 
<br/>system in place and the Council is now the driving force behind this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also trying to put in place a process to strengthen the compliance and monitoring of 
<br/></span><span>all Municipal Councils.  I wish to also acknowledge that out of all the 13 Municipalities, only one 
<br/></span><span>Municipality, Rakiraki Town Council, has completed its audits and is up to date. I must thank the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>669 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>CEO and the Special Administrator for organising the financials of the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also very important, Mr. Speaker, is the issue of some of the monitoring within the Ministry. 
<br/>We will also be recruiting two officers that will be part of the audit team in the next financial year. 
<br/>We are also requesting the Ministry of Finance for us to hire more auditors so that we can have one 
<br/>audit  pool  within  the  Ministry,  who  will  be  able  to  go  around  and  conduct  auditing  of  all  the 
<br/>Municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, when we do that, we are going to ensure that all the Municipalities are up to-date 
<br/>with their Financial Statements so that it can be audited by the Office of the Auditor-General before 
<br/>they present to Parliament for discussion.  We are working very hard on that. There will be some 
<br/>additional  issues  in  terms  of  improvements  that  have  been  done  and  implemented  in  all  the  13 
<br/>Municipalities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity and I fully support the motion 
<br/>before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute to the debate on the Audit Report on 
<br/>Municipal  Councils.    The  Committee  reviewed  10  Municipal  Audits  from  2021  to  2022  and  the 
<br/>Committee has carefully examined all the available evidence, considered various perspectives and 
<br/>arrived at a set of recommendations that are practical and feasible.  These recommendations are aimed 
<br/>at addressing the root causes of the problem and not just its symptoms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my appreciation to the Committee for their diligent 
<br/>work  in  conducting  the  review  and  for  making  these  important  recommendations.    The 
<br/>recommendations made are crucial for the effective functioning of our municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of recommendations has been made and I would like to speak on 
<br/>some of them.  Sir, in one of the recommendations, the Committee is calling on the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government to place priority in getting all the Municipalities’ accounts audited up to date. This will 
<br/>provide accurate and up to date financial information that is necessary for effective decision-making.  
<br/>It  is  important  that  the  Ministry  takes  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  this  recommendation  is 
<br/>implemented without delay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In another recommendation, Sir, the Committee is calling for the inclusion of special criteria 
<br/>in the Special Administrators and Chief Executive Officers terms of engagement contracts, such as 
<br/>bringing  the audited accounts up to date during their tenure.   According to the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government  policy,  this  is  a  commendable  recommendation  that  will  ensure  that  there  is 
<br/>accountability for the financial management of the Municipalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another recommendation is calling for all Municipalities to explore with the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government on the use of a standard accounting software for uniformity purposes. 
<br/>This  is  a  very  important  recommendation  that  will  help  to  ensure  that  there  is  consistency  in  the 
<br/>accounting practices of all Municipalities.  It will also make it easier for the Ministry to monitor the 
<br/>financial performance of the Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  another  recommendation,  Sir,  it  concurs  with  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General’s 
<br/></span><span>recommendation and further recommends that Municipal Councils should utilise Government grants 
<br/></span><span>only for the intended purpose.  This is an important recommendation that will ensure that the funds 
<br/>allocated for specific purposes are used for those purposes only. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another recommendation is calling for the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/>to  conduct  regular  monitoring  of  qualification  issues  for  all  Municipalities  so  that  discrepancies 
<br/>identified are addressed in a timely manner. This is a commendable recommendation that will help

<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ensure that Municipalities are staffed by qualified personnel, who are people who can effectively 
<br/>manage the financial resources of the Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do recognise that some of the recommendations may require significant resources, time 
<br/>and effort to implement, however, we believe that they are necessary if we want to create a society 
<br/>just an equivocal for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the recommendations made by the Committee and call upon 
<br/>the Ministry of Local  Government  to  take the necessary steps to  implement them.  The  effective 
<br/>implementation of these recommendations will help to improve the financial management capacity 
<br/>of our Municipalities and ensure that they are able to provide quality services to their ratepayers.  I 
<br/>urge all honourable Members of this Parliament to carefully consider the recommendations presented 
<br/>in the Report and to support its recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my colleague has raised some very important issues in regard to the garbage 
<br/>collection in Nasinu.  Sir, Nasinu being the largest Municipality, garbage collection is an issue there. 
<br/>We have noted that the kitchen garbage which is supposed to be collected in the morning is collected 
<br/>late in the afternoon and the stray dogs scatter the rubbish all around.  In the afternoon when you 
<br/>reach home, it is an eyesore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the monthly green garbage, Sir, is supposed to be collected in my area in Valelevu every 
<br/>first Tuesday of the month.  As alluded to by the honourable Minister, I have discussed this with him 
<br/>a number of times and even this morning, we spoke about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our purpose here is not to criticise, but we would like to improve the services 
<br/>of all the Municipalities and the whole of Nasinu, as alluded to by my colleague.  Yesterday, I went 
<br/>to pick my cousin from Ibo Place in Nadawa and right in front of his house is a huge pile of rubbish.  
<br/>Upon inquiry, he told me that the Council promised to collect the rubbish and everyone has dumped 
<br/>there but the Council did not turn up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rubbish there is an obstruction to the vehicle, I had to wait for another 
<br/>car to go across.  It is the whole of Nasinu which is suffering.  I do not know, I just do not understand 
<br/>why this is happening because when FijiFirst was in Government, everything was done on time, and 
<br/>I have raised this with the honourable Minister.  Everything was done on time. There were no rubbish 
<br/>issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand because during FijiFirst time, there was some 
<br/>agreement with the Suva City Council and Nasinu Town Council in terms of exchanging or using the 
<br/>rubbish collection trucks.  This agreement was there but I do not know what has changed or I do not 
<br/>know if the policies have changed that this has happened.  I have raised this with the honourable 
<br/>Minister that this is only happening since your Government has come into place.  The reason why I 
<br/>am  raising all these, Sir,  is  we want  all these services to  be provided at  Nasinu  being  the largest 
<br/>municipality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has just raised the issue of the town council elections.  Sir, I know 
<br/>it has been said in this Parliament that the town council elections will take place but to date, we have 
<br/>not seen any legislation or policy to regulate the municipal council elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, time is running and as we know, May has already gone.  In June and July. 
<br/>we will be talking about the Budget and we are left with August.  The honourable Minister has given

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>671 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a timeframe saying that towards the end of this year, so end of this year could mean November or 
<br/>December but remember, Sir, there are certain processes which cannot be fast-tracked, so we need 
<br/>to follow the processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am urging the honourable Minister in consultation with the Elections Office, plus with the 
<br/>Office of the Attorney-General to bring in these legislations because we need to have the registrations 
<br/>done and there is also the objection period.  We also would like to know if the political parties would 
<br/>be allowed to fill candidates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, if that is  to  be done  and we all know that  a lot  of preparation needs to be done in  an 
<br/>election or any election for that matter, so in that case, we need time, and political parties need to 
<br/>prepare for all those things.  For that reason, we have heard this, and we do not want things to be 
<br/>rushed so  proper preparations could  be done.  For that reason also,  we would like to see that the 
<br/>legislation comes up in time and we are all prepared towards it so that we have a successful election.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  words,  I  once  again  thank  the  Committee  and  I  support  the  motion  before  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  speak  on  the  Report,  let  me 
<br/>congratulate the new Auditor-General, Ms. Finau Nagera.  She is very highly accomplished and a 
<br/>qualified professional, and a first woman ever to occupy the position of the Auditor-General of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  quite  interesting  to  hear  people  like  honourable  Hem  Chand  and 
<br/>honourable Virendra Lal.  I consider them to be Johnny-come-lately to FijiFirst Party and politics.  
<br/>Perhaps, they do not understand and they have no idea what this Government and this Minister has 
<br/>been landed with in terms of dealing with Municipal Councils and Cities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the report of the Committee, the Auditor-General’s Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very clearly 
<br/>lays down the fundamental problem with respect to the management and delivery of services in towns 
<br/>and city councils in this country.  And the blame for what is there today, squarely rest on the previous 
<br/>Government  and  some  of  them  are  sitting  there  and  pontificating  about  governance,  of  how  city 
<br/>councils should be managed and honourable Virendra Lal went all over the place about elections, 
<br/>without even acknowledging that for 15 years or so, they had suppressed democracy of the ratepayers 
<br/>in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at least, they should have a little bit of decency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Practice what you preach! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is coming, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has announced 
<br/>that the election will be held.  There is work already being done, there are reviews, the process is in 
<br/>place and they will know in good time when the election will be, because I know they want to go and 
<br/>lie very quickly about what is going on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Hem Chand, again, a Johnny-come-lately I would say, he talked about overgrown 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bougainvillea in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order on 74(1) reads and let me read it to you 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the 151</span><span>st</span><span> time: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any member may only raise a point of order if –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>There is an alleged breach of the Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The breach, Sir, is this gentleman should, by now, after so many years, learned the language 
<br/>of Parliament.  Do not be offensive!  He is a Member of Parliament and whether it is six months or 
<br/>six years, Sir, be a little respectful.  What is this Johnny-come-lately garbage, Sir.  I think he ought 
<br/>to be sanctioned, he needs to stop insulting the young Members of Parliament who have just joined 
<br/>us.    They  have  their  opinion;  you  have  your  opinion  but  there  is  no  reason  for  him  to  denigrate 
<br/>themselves.  He should be experienced enough to know that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, continue, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  All I was referring to in the 
<br/>context is that he is new in FijiFirst, new in Parliament and he has not looked at what had happened 
<br/>in the last 10 or 15 years in the city and town councils.  He talked about the overgrown bougainvillea.  
<br/>Let me tell him – overpaid, long grown bougainvillea and the responsibility of that falls directly on 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those bougainvillea and the way it was put in place, should have 
<br/>been investigated by FICAC long ago, the contract that they owe after the cost of doing that.  That is 
<br/>the context I said that they do not know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me talk about the rubbish collection that they talked about.  I was in Nasinu the other day, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Nasinu Town Council Administrators at the launch of the new Nasinu 
<br/>Chamber of Commerce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They do not like that because they talk about rubbish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, they said to me was that the Nasinu Town Council had their own trucks.  Someone decided 
<br/>that those trucks would be transferred to Suva, a new contract would be given to people here and this 
<br/>is  the  problem  why  it  is  not  working.    The  new  Administrators  have  decided  that  as  soon  as  the 
<br/>contract ends in the next month or this month, Nasinu Town Council will have its own trucks, its 
<br/>own processes and will have its own system of collecting rubbish and that will be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/>from  the  Opposition  come  into  this  Parliament  and  pontificate  about  what  is  going  wrong,  they 
<br/>actually forget what has happened.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>673 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me also add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that now we are grappling with the collection of rates.  
<br/>Town and City Councils are struggling to even put fans in the market.  I went to Nausori Market one 
<br/>day  and  all  the  vendors  were  complaining  about  the  heat  and  there  were  no  fans.    The  vendors 
<br/>themselves were saying, “We do not mind paying stall fees, but we need fans”, because they built 
<br/>the market, they tried to be populist, they did not want to collect rates, they did not want to charge 
<br/>anyone and they left everything, including the services, undelivered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suva City Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 11,400 ratepayers, is being owed $33 million in 
<br/>arrears.  Nasinu Town Council - $14 million.   Sir, what we are now saying is that we want to make 
<br/>sure  that  ratepayers  pay  that  and  Town  and  City  Council  Administrators  appointed  by  this 
<br/>Government are now working on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can talk about the legality and illegality my friend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  let  me  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  be  considering  not  only  legislative  changes  for 
<br/>effective rate collecting mechanisms, we want to use other tools that is there, whether it is Garnishee 
<br/>Order on bank accounts, whether it is legal penalties and interest, whether it is revamping revenue 
<br/>collection systems, setting up convenient collection centres, public awareness campaigns or proper 
<br/>debt  collection  strategies.    These  are  all  the  activities  and  strategies  that  need  to  be  put  in  place, 
<br/>because if you do not collect rates, if town and city councils are not empowered to have this, Nasinu 
<br/>Town Council Administrators were left high and dry when they got in there, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They know, they understand the problem and the ratepayers also understand, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  When you talk to them, they tell you quite directly what the problem is.  But that is the point 
<br/>that the Opposition  and  those who raised those issues do not  understand.  They would do better.  
<br/>Honourable  Virendra  Lal  would  do  better  if  he  goes  and  tells  the  ratepayers.    If  he  joins  the 
<br/>Administrators  and  help  them  to  collect  rates,  then  the  town  and  city  councils  can  deliver  their 
<br/>services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the statement by the Chairperson, honourable Assistant Minister and Chairman 
<br/>of the Public Accounts Committee, he is absolutely right when he points out that there is a legacy, 
<br/>there is a system collapse of the past that we are now trying to revive and put in place so that there is 
<br/>a system that works on a regular basis, a system that allows the ratepayers to be part of it.  When they 
<br/>abolished the elected councils, that was the end of it, Mr. Speaker, because in the previous systems, 
<br/>you had elected councilors, so if the rubbish was not collected in a ward, if there was a problem with 
<br/>the  drain  or  overgrown  grass,  the  councilors  knew  that.    They  knew  that  the  council  would  do 
<br/>something, but when they took over, decisions were centralized, administrators were appointed, they 
<br/>had no interest in going to the ratepayers and making sure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government as soon as it came, we made that decision, the Cabinet has approved that, 
<br/>the processes are in place, then once you have that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these things will be in place 
<br/></span><span>and the ratepayers of this country can expect better services throughout the municipal boundaries of 
<br/></span><span>this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  all  honourable  Members  who  have 
<br/>contributed  to  the  debate.    I  look  forward  to  this  Municipal  Council  to  improve  their  overall 
<br/>performance  and,  most  importantly,  the  implementation  of  the  audit  and  the  Committee’s 
<br/>recommendations.
