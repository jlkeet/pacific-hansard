<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; as the Member moving this motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Review 
<br/>Report of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Annual Report 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2017 to 
<br/>31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in February 2023, and I wish to proceed 
<br/>directly into reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in this Report.   To 
<br/>begin with, Sir, there are few pertinent issues identified which the Committee had noted, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rationale of filing </span><span>nolle prosequi</span><span> on the matter of certain disposed cases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Health officials involved in corruption related offences. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>selection of communities by FICAC to conduct training sessions on corruption prevention. 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>effectiveness  of  awareness  training  programme  undertaken  by  FICAC  on  selected 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>education level of the National Anti-Corruption curriculum taught in schools.  
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>monitoring  and  reporting  mechanisms  of  FICAC  in  achieving  the  targets  set  out  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>unclear terms derived on certain expenditures by the Commission as listed under the financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement of the FICAC Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by FICAC and any information 
<br/>on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report.  In doing so, Sir, I will dive straight into the 
<br/>recommendation as put forth by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  Commission  provides  timely 
<br/>submission of its Annual Reports to Parliament, and this has always been an issue with a lot of entities 
<br/>that are late with their Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  also  recommends  that  the  Commission  ensures  that  there  is  formal  SDG 
<br/>compliant component in all future reports.  Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommended 
<br/>that the Annual Peer Review Report be also in the schedule of all future reports that are compiled by 
<br/>the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  further  recommends  that  communities  such  as  Rotuma,  Rabi,  Kioa  and 
<br/></span><span>Melanesian communities be also visited annually to conduct such trainings.  These communities are 
<br/>confined recipients of project development funds from the Office of the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  also  recommends  that  training  information  be  translated  into  vernacular 
<br/>languages  in  Fiji  and  not  limited  to  any.    Lastly,  Sir,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  anti- 
<br/>corruption education be emphasised at all education levels for primary to tertiary and be part of the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I urge honourable 
<br/>Members of this august Parliament to take note of the content of the Committee’s Report and show 
<br/>support for the motion before Parliament.
