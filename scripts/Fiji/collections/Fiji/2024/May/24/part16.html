<h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 6, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That so much of Standing Order 34 be suspended so as to allow the Chairperson of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special Committee on Emoluments to move her motion today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. AV.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as indicated in Standing Order 6(1), and I 
<br/>quote: “A Standing Order may be suspended in whole or in part only by leave of Parliament.  That l 
<br/>results in  Standing Order 6(2), and I quote:  “…which will result in the suspending of  a  Standing 
<br/>Order in whole or in part, must not be moved except with the Speaker’s permission…” We have done 
<br/>that.

<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then Standing Order 6(3) and (4) states, I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (3) “No amendment to a suspension motion may be moved and no debate is allowed on it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (4)      If  Parliament  grants  leave  on  a  suspension  motion,  the  Standing  Order  concerned  is 
<br/>suspended.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what we are putting into effect in order to suspend Standing Order 34, which specifically 
<br/>guides us on Parliament business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you look at Standing Order 34 in terms of the motions, they are either moved under 
<br/>Clause(1)(n) where it states:  “motions moved by members of the Business Committee that relate to 
<br/>sittings and Parliament business”, or under Clause 1(o):   “motions for which notice has been given”, 
<br/>or under Clause2(a):  “the Business Committee determines otherwise”, and that was the case in terms 
<br/>of the motion I am moving today.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments to add. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
