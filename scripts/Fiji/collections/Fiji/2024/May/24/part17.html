<div><span>REVIEW OF SALARIES AND ALLOWANCE –  
<br/>MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND EXECUTIVE OFFICE 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on 
<br/>Wednesday, 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024, and sections 3, 12 and 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations 
<br/>Act 2014, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates and approves the recommendations in the Report of the Special 
<br/>Committee on Emoluments which was tabled on Wednesday, 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024, and that this 
<br/>determination to take effect from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024 and expire on 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to elaborate on the Committee’s Report and the recommendations contained in the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  reiterate  in  this  Parliament  that  the  Special  Committee  on 
<br/>Emoluments was formed, firstly, by a resolution of Parliament on Wednesday, 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 and 
<br/>that was resolved unanimously.  As I had alluded to during the tabling of the Emolument’s Committee 
<br/></span><span>Report on Wednesday, 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024, due to the non-inclusion of other Offices such as the Office 
<br/></span><span>of the President and Office of the Speaker, as well as the review of the Parliamentary Retirement 
<br/>Allowances  Act  1989,  an  amendment  motion  was  later  moved  to  rectify the  anomalies  that  were 
<br/>previously not included and, again, this was unanimously passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  had  mentioned,  a  second  motion  for  the  review  of  all  the  Offices 
<br/>mentioned above was moved by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, seconded, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>953 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  debated  and  passed  as  a  resolution  of  Parliament  on  Monday,  11</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2023.    As  all 
<br/>honourable Members are aware, during the tabling of the Emoluments Committee Report, the motion 
<br/>was seconded by the Committee Member from the Opposition because this was a bipartisan Report 
<br/>and all Members of the Committee had discussed this together and came up with a final decision, 
<br/>following the discussions and the recommendation from the independent consultant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The independent consultant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an experienced former Parliamentarian from 
<br/>abroad  and  was  hired  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  through  the 
<br/>Parliament Support Project, to assist the Emoluments Committee to do an independent analysis and 
<br/>comparisons between the Fijian Parliament and other jurisdictions. The Emoluments Committee met 
<br/>on several occasions and looked at the relevant laws, as well as the report from the consultant, before 
<br/>coming to its final decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  also  listened  to  the  submissions  provided  by  different  political  parties 
<br/>represented in Parliament and called for briefing as well from the Pensions Office for the Members 
<br/>of Parliament (MPs) who are based at the honourable Prime Minister’s Office.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>will now go into the Report, and I will explain, discuss and address some of the decisions taken by 
<br/>the Committee which is as follows.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the discussions or the recommendations on the salaries:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of the President  
<br/>The  current  salary  is  $130,000  and  the  Committee  endorsed  from  the  Consultant’s 
<br/>recommendation that it be $185,000 non-taxable.  The Head of State, we believe, deserves a 
<br/>salary  that  reflects  the  post,  which  is  both,  ceremonial  and  has  legal  decision-making 
<br/>authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of the Prime Minister  
<br/>The current salary at $328,750, is now being reduced to $320,000. I apologise, honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister. The reduction from the previous salary by 2.5 percent is in comparison to 
<br/>the salary of the Chief Justice.  Both posts are Heads of Branches of Government – both 
<br/>Judiciary and Executive and have the full authority and responsibility to manage and deliver 
<br/>programming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of Ministers  
<br/>Currently, we have four Ministers that sit on a different band of salary.  The Minister  of 
<br/>Finance or the Minister for Economy as stated in the Act, earns $235,000.  The Ministers for 
<br/>Education,  Health  and  Infrastructure  earn  $200,000.    The  remaining  Ministers  earn 
<br/>$185,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Consultant recommended that all Ministers earn a salary of $200,000 and these posts 
<br/>have  the  capacity  to  make  legally  binding  decisions  and  are  fully  autonomous  in  their 
<br/>decision-making.  It is important to note that this was considered by the Committee, that even 
<br/>some of our Permanent Secretaries are earning more than the Ministers in our Ministries.  
<br/>My Permanent Secretary earns $190,000 and I have been on a reduced salary for the past 
<br/></span><span>three years to $148,000.  Other Permanent Secretaries range from $190,000 to $250,000 -  a 
<br/></span><span>quarter of a million dollars that the Permanent Secretaries earn more than their Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of Assistant Ministers  
<br/>The Assistant Ministers currently earn $90,000 and it has been recommended and endorsed 
<br/>that they earn $120,000, an increase of $30,000.  The Assistant Ministers engaged with the 
<br/>highest and second highest civil servants in their respective Ministries, therefore, they should 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>receive a salary commensurate.  Of course, as you compare it to Permanent Secretaries, it is 
<br/>still quite low.  This is what was recommended, and we have endorsed it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of Speaker  
<br/>Currently sits on $150,000.  It has been recommended and endorsed to earn $220,000.  The 
<br/>Speaker  is  the  Head  of  the  Legislative  Branch  of  Government  and,  therefore,  the  role  is 
<br/>important, and the salary should reflect the gravitas of the post.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of the Leader of the Opposition  
<br/>Currently earns $120,000.  We have endorsed that he earns $200,000.  This is a constitutional 
<br/>office, and he also acts as the Shadow Prime Minister while representing Fiji in international 
<br/>platforms, along with the Speaker and the Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary of Members of Parliament  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently they earn $50,000.  We have recommended and endorsed that 
<br/>they earn $95,000. Of course, this is almost a double in salary.  It is important to note that the 
<br/>last review of Members of Parliament salary was in 2014, which is now 10 years later.  This 
<br/>has not been done for 10 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each of these posts involve a significant level of autonomy in decision-making and each has 
<br/>the  requirement  for  legal  and  policy  analysis,  and  general  management  skills.    Fiji  is  an  open 
<br/>constituency,  therefore,  all  the  members  who  were  sworn  in  as  MPs  have  added  responsibilities 
<br/>which is allowed to them to be other office holders, for example, in their own political parties. So, it 
<br/>comes with responsibilities as well to their constituents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  to  the  allowances,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  allowances  that  is  currently  in  the  Act  for  the 
<br/>President  so  all  of  those  positions,  I  will  be  referring  to  the  United  Nations  Daily  Subsistence 
<br/>Allowance (UNDSA). UNDSA x 50 percent + $300 for the Office of the President.  Again, we have 
<br/>seen  because  of  the  position  that  the  President  holds  and  the  international  engagements  that  he 
<br/>engages  in  with  other  Heads  of  State  around  the  world,  we  have  increased  it  to  150  percent  and 
<br/>remained the $300 incidental. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister (my apologies again, Sir) currently he is on the UNDSA x 
<br/>250  percent  +  $600  daily  allowance  and  this  has  been  massively  reduced.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to 
<br/>UNDSA x 200 percent and no daily incidentals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers have all been reduced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the Act says UNDSA x 200 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent + $500, it has now been slashed to UNDSA x 150 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Assistant  Ministers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  also  been  reduced.    They  are  currently  on 
<br/>UNDSA  x  100  percent  +  $300,  which  is  now  being  reduced  to  more  than  half  -  UNDSA  x  125 
<br/>percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Speaker is currently on UNDSA x 100 percent + $300 and, again, for being 
<br/>the  Head  of  Legislature,  honourable  Speaker,  with  your  engagements  globally,  this  has  been 
<br/></span><span>increased to UNDSA x 200 percent + $300 incidental.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition is the same as the Ministers; UNDSA x 150 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were at UNDSA x 100 percent + $200 incidental 
<br/>daily.  This has now been recommended and endorsed at UNDSA x 125 percent only, so no daily 
<br/>incidentals.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>955 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some additional benefits that are being proposed here.  For the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  provision  of  a  tax  and  duty  free  purchase  of  a  vehicle.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this benefit was in place prior to 2007 and should be reinstated, given the amount of 
<br/>travel incurred in our role, as well as the eligibility would be one vehicle per term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation about Government Quarters in Suva, the Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers is recommended to have access to Government Quarters in Suva as a form of 
<br/>accommodation at the same rate as civil  servants because  according to  the Ministry of  Finance’s 
<br/>Offices Accommodation Unit, officers in the Civil Service stationed temporarily in Suva can access 
<br/>Government  Quarters  at  10  percent  of  the  market  rate.    The  same  benefit  should  be  available  to 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers if they wish to utilise this form of temporary accommodation in 
<br/>Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Speaker of Parliament, as  well as the Leader of the Opposition, it is 
<br/>recommended and endorsed that official residency be available for both officers.  Prior to 2007, there 
<br/>was  an  official  residence  for  the  Speaker  of  Parliament,  and  this  should  be  reinstated.  In  many 
<br/>jurisdictions in the Commonwealth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it provides an official residence for the Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition and this benefit should be extended to the Leader of the Opposition here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the MPs’ travel and Committee sitting allowance, the </span><span>status quo</span><span>
<br/>remains, there is no change to that. However, the only change is to the accommodation allowance 
<br/>because of the impracticality of the 30 kilometre radius,  where it is a 30 kilometres radius in a straight 
<br/>line. We have recommended and it has been endorsed that this 30 kilometres apply by the most direct 
<br/>route by road, but if you are being accommodated outside of your normal place of residence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  constituency  allowance  of  $15,000  allocated  to  each  MP  where 
<br/>currently, it is $10,000 a year, it is recommended and endorsed that the full amount be given to MPs 
<br/>in order to carry out their constituency work.  The initial idea and thought was that the political parties 
<br/>needed funding in order to also operate but as we all know, this allocation is being covered in the 
<br/>yearly budget of $325,000 per Party and, therefore, this allocation is to go to MPs to be able to have 
<br/>the freedom and the autonomy to decide how they go about their constituency work, so to give the 
<br/>full $15,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, medical and life insurance does not exist, but this should be a 
<br/>benefit not only offered to the Civil Service, but should be extended to all MPs as well, given the 
<br/>duties required for your post and the high risk related to extended travel.  If an MP wishes to continue 
<br/>to make premium payments on any life insurance policy after you leave office, then that option is 
<br/>available.  But this coverage is a maximum of $100,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maternity leave, Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently does not exist, but Parliament should establish a 
<br/>system for maternity leave.  This is to entice more women to seek elected office, and this should be 
<br/>given in line with the national system for such benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, gadgets that are given to MPs at the beginning of their term to enable them 
<br/>to do their work, it is endorsed that Members are entitled to keep the provided gadgets after the end 
<br/></span><span>of the Parliament term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  allowances  now  recommended  for  office  holders  within 
<br/>Parliament.  It is recommended and endorsed that the Deputy Speaker of Parliament receive an annual 
<br/>allowance  of  $15,000,  because  it  is  a  significant  role  in  the  parliamentary  office,  for  the  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker presides in the absence of the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>956 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  proposed  that  the  Leader  of  the  Government  in  Parliament  receive  an  annual 
<br/>allowance of $7,000.   The Leader of the Government in Parliament is a key player in organising and 
<br/>coordinating the business of Government for any parliamentary sitting and in other parliamentary 
<br/>events.  The Leader of the Government in Parliament also has the procedural role during sitting days, 
<br/>and also in important parliamentary days, such as the Opening of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is endorsed that the Party Whips be given $5,000 allowance annually.  
<br/>This particular position is significant in the daily functioning and during Parliament sitting, and also 
<br/>for organising the Members for any parliamentary duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Deputy Whip, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been endorsed to receive a $3,000 yearly allowance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Deputy Whip assists the Whips in fulfilling their roles and duties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now go on to the review of the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 
<br/>1989.  Since July 2018, there have not been any substantial changes to this Act.  The Committee, 
<br/>through its deliberations, recommended that there should be amendments made to the Act, as to align 
<br/>with the evolving economic status and social practice of the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has collectively made the following recommendations, and we support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations by the Consultant in this report:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eligibility for the Maximum Years of Service 
<br/>Currently, it sits at 15 years.  This has now been changed or reduced to 12 years.  This is 
<br/>because the terms of Parliament now stand at four years.  So, instead of the five years in the previous 
<br/>Governments, so that was three terms, it is now four years, so 12 years is consistent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Double Dipping Issue   
<br/>In the Act, it is not clear as to whether or not an MP who retires or leaves Parliament, receives 
<br/>an allowance and then subsequently, when they get re-elected can collect the allowance while also 
<br/>holding that post.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  revised  the  Act  to  prevent  an  MP  who,  returns  to  Service  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, from receiving that allowance while currently serving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Severe Disability 
<br/></span><span>There is no provision, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for anyone holding that has a severe disability, who 
<br/></span><span>becomes  severely  disabled  before  reaching  the  age  of  55  years,  to  apply  for  and  receive  the  full 
<br/>allowance. And we are recommending that the new Act should allow that former MPs with severe 
<br/>disability to receive full allowance prior to 55 years of age.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ineligibility for Conviction 
<br/>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act is unclear as to whether or not a former MP who is eligible 
<br/>for this allowance would be entitled if they were to serve a sentence for bribery, corruption, or such 
<br/>a conviction, will make the former member ineligible permanently. A secondary question is whether 
<br/>or not a conviction for bribery or corruption should be linked to the member’s work as an elected 
<br/>official, or if any conviction, no matter the relevance to the elected post, is enough to make a former 
<br/>member ineligible for allowance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been recommended that if the former MP is convicted of bribery or 
<br/>corruption related to their time as an MP, then they will lose the retirement allowance permanently. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>957 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Otherwise, they lose the allowance while they serve their sentence. So, this needs to be clarified and 
<br/>something to be discussed further.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Spousal Eligibility  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act is clear, only a person who was a spouse to a member while they 
<br/>were elected is eligible for the reduced rate of allowance after the member’s death. However, if the 
<br/>member remarries after retiring and the first spouse pre-deceases the member, should the second, or 
<br/>third, or fourth, or fifth spouse have a right to a portion of the allowance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  no  change  to  the  current  rules.  Allowing  second  or  post-MP’s 
<br/>spouses to receive an allowance will create an unnecessary level of anxiety and complexity to the 
<br/>allocation of allowances. Spouses who were married to an MP when the MP was serving in office 
<br/>are entitled to a constructive trust and, therefore, some of the allowance earned by the MP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administrator for Retirement Allowances 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act defines the Administrator as the Secretary to Cabinet, or some other 
<br/>person appointed by the  Prime Minister. However, as the allowance is  for  MPs  and most elected 
<br/>officials, should the Administrator be a staff person of Parliament?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we revise the Act to designate the Secretary-General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament as the Administrator of Retirement Allowance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Qualifying Salary  
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  current  Act,  the  salary  that  is  the  basis  for  calculating  the 
<br/>retirement allowance is the salary the MP was receiving in their final year of elected office. This can 
<br/>result in an MP who has had a larger income, for example, for being a Minister or Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, and then reverts back to a singular role as an MP, their allowance is calculated, if they 
<br/>exit Parliament, based on the salary of an MP, as this was the last salary.  As I had mentioned, it is 
<br/>not based on the highest salary received by the MP, which has an impact on the final calculation of 
<br/>the retirement allowance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are proposing that the new Act should calculate the annual salary for 
<br/>allowance purposes based on an average of the three best  years of the higher salary in  which the 
<br/>former Member earned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Retroactivity  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the Act has two application dates - the original from 1989 which 
<br/>states that the allowance is only eligible to a member who has been an MP since 1970 and has attained 
<br/>four years of service. The Act was amended in 2016 to reflect the new 2013 Constitution in which 
<br/>MPs elected under that Constitution may only serve three years and six months for the completion 
<br/>of one term in office. If the formula or other aspects of retirement allowance are amended, should 
<br/>the Act apply to those who are already receiving an allowance, or only to those who will receive their 
<br/>retirement allowance in the future under a new scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our recommendation that any retroactive application of legislation is 
<br/></span><span>considered bad form. In this case, all new provisions should apply to those who are currently sitting 
<br/></span><span>MPs, and any subsequent elected MPs, moving forward from the date of the promulgation of the new 
<br/>Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Re-drafting  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned, this is quite an old Act. Since that time, the format and 
<br/>quality of legal drafting have evolved, and the question we ask was, does the Act need to be fully re-
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>written  to  reflect  these  new  drafting  standards  and  to  make  the  Act  more  easily  interpreted  and 
<br/>understood by beneficiaries?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is our recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we draft a completely new Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allowance as a Source of Income 
<br/>Currently, the Act is silent as to whether or not the retirement allowance assigned to a former 
<br/>MP  or  person  who  held  a  qualifying  post  is  considered  ‘income’  for  purposes  of  using  such  an 
<br/>allowance to secure debt or a loan by the former MP.  Now, </span><span>de facto</span><span>, the allowance is not considered 
<br/>income  and,  therefore,  is  not  assignable,  except  for  specific  exceptions,  and  cannot  be  used  as 
<br/>collateral or security for a loan or other debt instrument.  It should also be noted that the allowance 
<br/>is tax free, according to the Act and, thus, is not considered income for tax purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This needs to be clarified in the Act, Mr. Speaker, it needs to be specified that the retirement 
<br/>allowance is not income and cannot be assigned or a lien placed upon it, except as related to debts 
<br/>owed to the State, or for settling a divorce, or to provide child support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eligibility for Qualifying Posts 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the remuneration scheme for MPs is amended to separate salaries for MPs 
<br/>from additional salaries for Ministers, Assistant Ministers and other leadership posts in Parliament, 
<br/>should the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act apply to only MPs and the salary attained as 
<br/>an MP?  If so, what  additional allowance, if any, should be allocated for those  who assume such 
<br/>leadership posts in Government and Parliament, in addition to their MP duties? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, assuming that the remuneration scheme is amended to have all MPs receive an 
<br/>MP salary, and those who take on leadership posts to receive a separate allowance for that work, it 
<br/>is recommended that the new Act only apply to MPs, Leader of the Opposition and Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eligibility for Minimum Time Served 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, the Act allows for two separate minimum levels of service for those who hold 
<br/>a qualifying post.  For those who serve from 1970 to December 2006, the minimum year of service 
<br/>is four years, equivalent to one term.  For   those elected after 2014, the minimum time served to be 
<br/>eligible for an allowance is three years and six months, equivalent to one term.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>should a former MP be eligible for an allowance who may have served for a period shorter than that 
<br/>term – they have come in for a month, for a day, for a year, what should apply? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are recommending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the new Act should state that any MP who has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>served in Parliament for any amount of time should be eligible to the retirement allowance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eligibility – Maximum Time Served 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already mentioned that it is 12 years, instead of 15 years, and I had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stated why.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eligibility Age at Retirement 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, this was quite a sore point and I know this was for younger MPs who are under 
<br/></span><span>40 when they came into Parliament.  The Act allows for a full allowance when you have attained 55 
<br/></span><span>and for those from 40 to 55, you have a pro-rated basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee is recommending that it should reflect a broader scope of who is 
<br/>eligible for retirement allowance. So, an MP over 55 years receives the full amount. Any MP between 
<br/>40 years and 55 years has a pro-rated allowance, and any MP under the age of 40 years receives 3.33 
<br/>percent less than the age category of 40 years to 55 years. So, they are receiving something, it is not

<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>959 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a full amount because we acknowledge the workable years left when you are younger.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent Review Process 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  we  also  recommend  that  there  be  an  independent  review  process,  moving 
<br/>forward. We recommend that an Independent Remuneration and Allowances Tribunal be established 
<br/>to make the determinations with regards to MP benefits and salary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allowance Formula 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  the  current  formula  is  quite  complicated.  I  finally  grasped  it,  so  we  need  to 
<br/>simply it.  But we are recommending that the formula to be calculated for the allowance for an MP, 
<br/>as follows – 1/12 years x average annual salary based on the best three years, the highest salaries you 
<br/>received, by the number of years of services as an MP. So, simplifying the formula to be calculated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee agreed that these issues be raised because these are pertinent for 
<br/>honourable Members. I want to also state here that the 20 percent pay cut on all honourable Members 
<br/>that was imposed during COVID-19 is still not restored.  So, all these salaries that I have mentioned 
<br/>that are currently under the Act, they are all reduced by 20 percent, and we have been receiving that 
<br/>for the last three years.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recommend that that be restored also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members of the Committee, I want to thank our Members. 
<br/>I  now  request  all  honourable  Members  to  support  the  motion  and  adopt  and  approve  the 
<br/>recommendations  in  the  Report  of  the  Special  Committee  on  Emoluments  which  was  tabled  on 
<br/>Wednesday, 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not prepared anything to say and only to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>raise my complaints.  I know, everyone was going up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had some exchanges in the media, as well as the social media, and 
<br/>some members of my Party have been pretty vocal and urging me, and I assured them as Minister 
<br/>responsible for Parliament that I would be guided by my oath which I swore on Christmas Eve 2022.  
<br/>I remind those who are pointing fingers at me and saying that it is not the right time and why am I 
<br/>doing it when I am in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My oath, Mr. Speaker, Sir is very simple.  I, Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, being appointed 
<br/>as Prime Minister, swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Republic of Fiji.  And 
<br/>that I will obey, observe, uphold and maintain the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and all other 
<br/>laws of Fiji, and I solemnly and sincerely promise to uphold my office with  honour, dignity and 
<br/>integrity;  to  be  a  true  and  faithful  counsellor;  not  to  divulge  any  secret  matter;  and  I  will  devote 
<br/>myself the wellbeing of the Republic of Fiji and all Fijians;  to protect and promote their rights and 
<br/>well and truly serve the Republic of Fiji and the Office of Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, those who are in my Party who have been pointing fingers at me and urging me not to do 
<br/>anything, it is not for the Party, I am speaking on behalf of the people of Fiji and all of us are people 
<br/></span><span>of Fiji.  I am glad that my salary is reduced because I can vote with a free conscience on this one, 
<br/></span><span>that I am not looking after my own interest, and I urge all honourable Members to do likewise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute to the motion before us.  We 
<br/>know how important and, of course, how sensitive it is as well.  But before I go into the motion itself, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to remember the late Pastor Vuli Waqa, I think he had his funeral today, he was well known 
<br/>in athletics, and we do convey our deep condolence and sympathy to the family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In contributing, I also declare my interest.  I have two, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because this affects 
<br/>me and, perhaps, I will speak on behalf of all the Parliamentarians on this side because it affects them 
<br/>as well.  I do declare my interest before I proceed further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said in the social media, comments by political parties who 
<br/>are not in this Parliament and, of course, other stakeholders who have an interest in this issue.  That 
<br/>is why I stand here, on behalf of the Parliamentarians of the FijiFirst Party, to also share our thoughts 
<br/>on this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated from the very beginning, Sir, this is not an easy matter to discuss because it 
<br/>affects us.  But at the same time, let us be fair and let us be honest on ourselves as well and I would 
<br/>like to speak on behalf of my Members, particularly, given what we have experienced while we were 
<br/>in Government and, of course, now, in the Opposition.  Perhaps, I do not only speak here now, being 
<br/>in the Opposition, but I speak on behalf of Parliamentarians who will come after us, either on that 
<br/>side  of  Parliament  or  this  side  of  Parliament  because  elections  will  determine  which  side  of 
<br/>Parliament we will sit on and the benefits that do come with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We live in a benefit-oriented society, that is a fact.  Of course, it is critical that we look at it 
<br/>not only for now, but also for the future.  Not only Parliament, but Government as we have always 
<br/>discussed, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, has to  be seen as  an equal  employment opportunity  provider and, of 
<br/>course, an employer of choice for all Fijians. I hope that the conditions and the environment that is 
<br/>created  here  will,  somehow,  set  the  standard  in  order  for  us  to  entice  well-qualified  professional 
<br/>people  out  there  in  our  communities,  in  the  private  sector  and  in  the  public  sector,  who  have 
<br/>aspirations to be an honourable Member in the future, and this is something that we need to look into 
<br/>as we are deliberating on this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know for a fact that some have to make sacrifices, on both sides of Parliament, coming 
<br/>from a better job, better conditions, better pay, but being patriotic and passionate about serving for 
<br/>the country, most of us do join this august Parliament as Members of Parliament, but the fact also 
<br/>remains that we are all human beings.  We are all part of our community.  We have needs, we have 
<br/>wants, some have mortgages, we have relatives, we have our commitments to our churches, and these 
<br/>are all facts of life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  remember  very  well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  advice  that  you  gave  me  when  I  first  joined 
<br/>Parliament in 2014 when every now and then, so many people are queuing up here.  You gave me a 
<br/>very good advice that I will not forget because people do come expecting a lot from you when you 
<br/>come with that beautiful suit, entering this Parliament, and they know that you have a deep pocket.  
<br/>That is a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, when we are making our contribution, we are considering those 
<br/>issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Very briefly, we are just fulfilling the process of Parliament, that is what we have done.  It 
<br/>was moved in July 2023.  It was again discussed with another motion from the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span><span>the Government in Parliament in September last year.  We are completing that process, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance specifically stated then  
<br/>and I will not read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> that I have here before me, based on the system that was used 
<br/>previously, I do not want to bring that up, let us put it to a Committee, bring independent consultants 
<br/>and in the end, as he specifically stated, it will come back into Parliament and we will vote for it, and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>961 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is exactly what we are doing today.  It was initiated by Government for whatever reasons, for 
<br/>whatever motives behind it, it was an initiative of Government.  So where do we stand now?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to raise that question to Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We are just simply completing 
<br/>the process and the continuation of that process will depend on the decisions that we will make today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  and  also 
<br/>Chairperson  of  the  Committee  for  the  submission.    I  have  been  briefed  by  our  Members  of  the 
<br/>Committee  as  well.    It  is  unfortunate  that  perhaps,  not  all  the  discussions  involved  during  the 
<br/>deliberations  is  in  the  Report  and  that  is  where  perhaps,  listening  to  her  concluding  remarks,  if 
<br/>continuing  discussions  and  negotiations  on  some  of  the  pertinent  issues  that  still  have  not  been 
<br/>resolved will continue, that is something that we will forward to.  But there were some issues as well 
<br/>that we raised, we understand the democratic process, but it was put to vote, et cetera.  We lost out 
<br/>on the vote since, but it is for fairness sake and transparency, it would have been good, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, if all the deliberations, the discussions and the decisions are reflected in the Report because we 
<br/>are concerned, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before this debate takes place today, information is already out in the social 
<br/>media. We are concerned, that is not fair, Sir. It was a decision of Government, all the Parties on the 
<br/>other side are part of Government, we in here are also part of the institution in here, but only FijiFirst 
<br/>Party’s contribution in the Committee was out there in the public media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise here my disappointment and I also wish to raise my concern. 
<br/>It is unfair, Sir. It has been pulled out, again, perhaps by the National Federation Party.  As I have 
<br/>stated this is your initiative, this is the process that we are completing. It is unfair when our proposals 
<br/>were only put up as if all the decisions in terms of salary, allowances, et cetera, all came from FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise that issue. I am disappointed and I am concerned because 
<br/>that should not happen.  Where is the confidentiality of the processes that we have.  It is out in the 
<br/>public, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that to me is very concerning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is part of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will talk on our submission because it was out 
<br/>there in the media.  This is why I chose to speak.  I was not comfortable because, as I have stated, I 
<br/>have declared my interest, but I have to speak on behalf of our Parliamentarians.  We did  a very 
<br/>thorough  research  before  we  took  our  presentation  to  the  Committee.  Whether  the  independent 
<br/>consultant considered that or benchmarked from it, that was entirely up to the Committee and the 
<br/>consultant, and I thank our Members who were involved in our research.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had some discussions about the Office of the Opposition and the 
<br/></span><span>things that need to be addressed in that, but I will go back to the issue.  We prepared well before we 
<br/></span><span>went to the Committee, as required by the process.  We were all to make submissions. The NFP had 
<br/>their submission, People’s Alliance had their submission, SODELPA had their submission and so 
<br/>did we.  We made our submission, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not talk about that in detail, we looked at all the other jurisdictions, 
<br/>but the most important thing out of the submission is the base salary for an MP.  We discussed that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>962 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Australia, Sir, because in other jurisdictions, you start from the base salary of an MP.  Then the 
<br/>other responsibilities are added on to you as an MP, and then the terms and conditions and the benefits 
<br/>come with it.  So that is where we should all start off and that is where we also came in, in terms of 
<br/>our recommendations - the base salary for an MP.  As I have stated, I am not only speaking now as 
<br/>being here in the Opposition, because come 2026, you will be here on this side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  fairness,  that  is  where  we  should  all  start  from,  and  then  we  looked  at  other 
<br/>jurisdictions.  From there, Assistant Ministers and then Ministers, and then the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister.    In  some  jurisdictions,  they  have  special  salary  packages  as  well  for  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers, but in our case, that is where we started from - the base salary for our MPs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  not  repeat  what  the  honourable  Chairperson  and  the  Leader  of  the  Committee  has 
<br/>already highlighted about the salaries, allowances and other benefits, like tax, and quarters access, 
<br/>but let me say here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, when it was done, we looked at the salary and the 
<br/>other benefits.  But now, a lot has been added into this because in terms of housing, you are given a 
<br/>reasonable salary, so then you can look after your housing, your medical, other bills and, of course, 
<br/>communications  where  we  are  given  all  these  gadgets.    But  that  was  how  it  was  worked  out 
<br/>previously.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is why it would only be fair if the other comments 
<br/>from the other side can also be heard in here and that is why I was insisting that their contributions 
<br/>in the Committee be also included in the Report because that is how we will gauge and be able to 
<br/>judge how the Committee and the independent consultant came up with their final decisions and, of 
<br/>course, the recommendations that are here before us, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the independent consultant, I am told that he was the same one 
<br/>used by UNDP when the Parliament Remunerations Act was drafted way back in 2014.  So, in terms 
<br/>of the Report of the Committee, I would say that it is credible because it has gone through the process 
<br/>that was agreed to in the September sitting last year and, of course, that has come back now into 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question that we have now is, are we going to accept this Report that 
<br/>was initiated by Government?  The question of timing has been raised.  However, the other question 
<br/>that  I  would  also  raise  with  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  is,  how  is  the  Ministry  going  to 
<br/>implement,  subject  to  the  decision  of  this  Parliament  today,  the  recommendations  that  are  in  the 
<br/>Report?  Are we going to continue to discuss further on some of the recommendations that are here?  
<br/>So, do we have the funds for this, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have always stated, the bottom line is growing the economy. We are still waiting, and I 
<br/>am still waiting, but I am told that the recommendations of the Economic Review Report has come 
<br/>out today, as we are gearing up towards the sitting of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, let me just go back to the submission that we made, particularly on 
<br/>the base salary for MPs.  That is, perhaps, what I call a decision that will be strategic as we move 
<br/>forward from here.  I know that the honourable Minister for Education experienced this in his three 
<br/></span><span>months as an ordinary MP - from a Cabinet post to an ordinary MP, that is what I am talking about 
<br/></span><span>because we, on this side are the only MPs who are not Ministers.  All on the other side are Ministers 
<br/>and Assistant Ministers, the basics and the strategic decision that we must take today is, the base 
<br/>salary for all MPs.  Of course, Sir, we look forward to the decision and the guidance of Government 
<br/>on this motion that is before Parliament.

<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>963 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be brief but before I actually 
<br/>speak about the motion itself and the position that the National Federation Party (NFP) took in terms 
<br/>of our submission, I just want to remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition that he is, sort of, 
<br/>wishy-washy in saying that it is a Government’s initiative.  I think the initiative came from Parliament 
<br/>and  the  Opposition  Members  also  agreed  that  the  best  way  to  move  forward  is  to  look  at  an 
<br/>independent Emoluments Committee to address this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  issue  of  FijiFirst  or  NFP’s  submission  getting  covered  by  the  media,  in  fact,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, for the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s information, the submissions of all the 
<br/>Parties  were  part  of  the  Report  and  the  moment  any  report  is  tabled  in  Parliament,  it  is  a  public 
<br/>document. The media covered NFP’s position, FijiFirst’s position, it was part of the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was part of the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  now,  when  the  report  is  out  there,  any  report  that  goes  on  that  table,  is 
<br/>immediately a public document which included all Party submissions.  Therefore, the media picked 
<br/>up all the submissions in the social media, including NFP as well. What is wrong with putting your 
<br/>submission and our submission? We put our submission, we put their submission, they want to hide 
<br/>their submission from the public? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what they are saying.  It was about transparency and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not get round this and ask, “Who put it there?  Why?”  Everyone’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>submission is there, it is part of the report, it is a public document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  It  is  not  a  crime  for  NFP  people  to  pick  up  FijiFirst’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>submission and put it out there, or NFP’s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribution about conscience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  I  want  to  say  is,  on  behalf  of  the  five  Members  of  the  National 
<br/>Federation Party who are in  this Chambers, we made the Party’s submission,  and the submission 
<br/>went through the Party’s Management Board and the Working Committee, and that submission was 
<br/>a directive by the Party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the report was presented to Parliament 48 hours ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we said very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>964 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clearly that the content of the Report is noted, and the debate on the Report will be at a future sitting 
<br/>of Parliament.  We looked at the content of the Report, Sir, and we were going to take that Report 
<br/>back to our Management Board and our Working Committee to be able to take a position as far as 
<br/>the Report is concerned and the recommendations in the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Committee was formed in Parliament, I said that I want to quit, 
<br/>but that does not mean that the Parliamentary Emolument’s Committee itself will make an assessment 
<br/>because the principle is that we cannot determine our own salaries and allowances.  The idea, as the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  said,  was  to  get  an  independent  consultant  and,  in  fact,  an 
<br/>independent  consultant  committee,  perhaps,  should  have  made  the  recommendations  to  the 
<br/>Emoluments Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  far  as  our  Party’s  constitution  is  concerned,  we  cannot  meet  the 
<br/>requirements  of  the  Party’s  constitution  section  63(1)  and  subsection  (h)  and  (i)  of  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution because if the Party provides a directive - the Party Management Board and the Working 
<br/>Committee, we cannot go against that until we go back and get their direction. What we are saying 
<br/>is that, of course, we can argue about the increases, the relativity, and I am happy that my salary is 
<br/>going  down,  but  that is another issue.    Therefore, we cannot  support the recommendations in  the 
<br/>Report as it is because we have to go back to our Party, to our Management Board and to our Working 
<br/>Committee, to make the decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our position on this matter is in accordance with the directive of the Party 
<br/>and, as I have outlined, this should not, in any way, be construed or misinterpreted in terms of our 
<br/>position and as support to the honourable Prime Minister and to the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, and let me repeat this, the honourable Leader of the Opposition cannot shy 
<br/>away from the fact that what he was trying to imply was that this was the Government’s initiative, 
<br/>this was the Parliament’s initiative, this was the Opposition’s initiative… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes, of course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …and Parties made their submission.  And when the report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was presented to this Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was a good process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Once  the  report  is  made  public  in  Parliament,  you  expect 
<br/>debate to be on that, and that is our position, Sir.  We can argue about the merits and demerits, and I 
<br/>heard what the honourable Leader of the Opposition said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we were sitting in the Opposition for eight years, the salaries and the decisions that 
<br/>were made in 2014 before the first sitting of Parliament was made by a decree.  That was the last 
<br/>decree,  which  set  the  salaries  of  the  Ministers,  the  Prime  Minister,  the  allowances  and  for  the 
<br/>Opposition.  When we had another committee of that Parliament looking at the allowances, et cetera, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would recall, that we took a different position and we actually voted against 
<br/></span><span>the increase in allowances in 2016.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  position  and  we,  at  this  point  in  time,  cannot  support  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations of the Report or the Report itself. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to give a short contribution.  I thank 
<br/>you for allowing me to speak on this motion and as one of the Committee Members, the only thing

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>965 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that I would like to raise here and which I was not in consensus with when it came to the Committee 
<br/>as well (unfortunately, that was not reflected in the Report) is the pension issue.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>have been representing the youth because I entered Parliament at the age of 30 years.  I am into my 
<br/>third  term  now  and  I  am  40  years  old.    I  think  it  is  discrimination  against  the  youth  who  are 
<br/>categorised  and  would  not  be  getting  the  full  pension  just  because  they  entered  Parliament  at  a 
<br/>younger age. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do understand that they have a good number of years to go if they retire from Parliament, 
<br/>but that does not mean that we do not give them the full benefit of what someone can attain after 
<br/>coming into Parliament after the age of 55 years. So, as a youth representative for the past 10 years 
<br/>in  Parliament  and  as  a  youth  MP  in  this  august  Parliament,  I  think  it  is  an  injustice,  and  that  is 
<br/>something that needs to be reconsidered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request honourable Members in this Parliament and because most of them 
<br/>sitting here are above the age of 55 years, please, let us not discriminate our youth but entice them to 
<br/>come to Parliament.  On pro-rata basis, it is not worthwhile because the amount of time and devotion, 
<br/>the amount of work they do for the four years they are in Parliament is the same as any other Member 
<br/>of any age category sitting in this Chamber.  I have that reservation and I will go along with that 
<br/>reservation. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I will just leave the message delivered by the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, and he said and I quote, “this reflects the Opposition” because the report is there, the 
<br/>report is out too.  It is, perhaps, better if I just give the floor to the Madam Chairperson for her right 
<br/>of reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Members,  including  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition for their contributions.  At 
<br/>this point, I just want to highlight as I had stated in my presentation, that there are certain aspects of 
<br/>the Retirement Allowances Act that we have endorsed that does need further discussion, if we were 
<br/>to make changes to the Act.  So, that is something that can be considered that has been stated by 
<br/>honourable Maharaj.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  reiterate,  your  concept  about  having  a  prorated  amount,  it  is  just  like  in  any  other 
<br/>workplace, in fact, if you leave other workplace for civil service and other places, you do not get 
<br/>anything, you will wait until you are 55 years.  So, if we are trying to apply the principles of equal 
<br/>opportunity employment in Parliament, then we should adhere to the principles of retirement and the 
<br/>need to have a secure future for those that are over 55 years, and you cannot make that comparison 
<br/>really if you are younger because of the workable years.  That is how retirement is calculated, that is 
<br/>where the independent consultant came from when he did the independent assessment, and that is 
<br/>how the Committee agreed to it that, that should be the case.  But other than that, like I said, there 
<br/>are features that I have mentioned in the Retirement Allowances Act that requires further discussion 
<br/>but they would require the changes to the Act. So, we can discuss that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an entire 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to take this time, again, to thank the Parliament 
<br/></span><span>staff  for  their  hard  work,  as  always,  supporting  the  work  of  the  Committee.    I  think  it  is  often 
<br/></span><span>understated, but at this point, I do want to say, </span><span>“vinaka vakalevu”</span><span>.  Thank you very much for your 
<br/>support to the work that was done by the Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- When we finish with the process that is now before us, then I will seek your 
<br/>indulgence, honourable Members, some of my experiences in the past review of allowances, we differ 
<br/>a lot, I even wrote to the former Speaker on that as the President of the Party. But having this Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here before us now, Parliament will now vote on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes cast 
<br/>-  40 
<br/>Ayes 
<br/>Noes 
<br/>-  7 
<br/>Abstained  -  5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  as  indicated  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics,  he wants to take 
<br/>this back to their Management Board, as probably directed in their Party constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the increase of the allowance when FijiFirst was still ruling then, the Committee chaired 
<br/>by one businessman and former MP from Nadi, Mr. Sanjeet Patel, delivered their report in this august 
<br/>Parliament.  I was not in Parliament then because I was suspended, but we were sitting in our office 
<br/>–  the  SODELPA  Headquarters  -  myself,  even  the  present  Prime  Minister,  and  a  few  other  Party 
<br/>stalwarts, when we were told that that was the result of what transpired in this august Parliament.  
<br/>They voted in favour of the increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The very same thing is coming out of the papers now, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/>The timing is not right and everything, we are still suffering, we have just come out of the woods, 
<br/>and we are not fully out of the woods yet, and the debt level was increasing, we raised all those in 
<br/>our protest letter to my predecessor and leading the SODELPA then, as the Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>was Ro Teimumu Kepa and the Whip was Mr. Tikotikoca.  It came, but no reply was given to our 
<br/>protest letter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it was time for me to rejoin Parliament.  I came in, joined Parliament and the allowances 
<br/>then  were  so  high.      Then  there  was  shortage  of  Members  in  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/>Accounts,  so  I  was  asked.    They  all  looked  at  me  and  said,  “You  are  not  part  of  any  Standing 
<br/>Committee, might as well take this up”, so I took it up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In attending the Standing Committee on Public Accounts meeting for the first time,  I was 
<br/>given my cheque. When I looked at it, I was so astonished.  It this real?  Honourable Bulitavu told 
<br/>me, “Yes, that is real, Sir.”  Our going into and be part of this Committee and accepting the new 
<br/>allowances, which we were against, this saw to the demise of our Party.  Not really demise of the 
<br/>Party, it is still alive, but some of us had to leave because the injury was there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You people were  against this, now you are  reaping  the benefit of what  we had  agreed to.  
<br/>Those were the words floated around here.  It was $2,000 plus in a week, that is huge, but that is it.  
<br/>As the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, this is the process that we have here.  No matter 
<br/>how you want to style it, how you want to do it, this is how we do it.  When I protested and said, “I 
<br/>am the President of the Party and I  do  not  like it”, they did  not  want  to take heed  of what  I was 
<br/></span><span>complaining about because the Leader of the Opposition then and the Members of the Caucus decided 
<br/></span><span>on things that happened in this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  after  reading  the  papers  this  morning,  I  was  quite  shocked  as  well  because  of  the 
<br/>innuendo that was going in and out from this side, the National Federation Party was making some 
<br/>comments with a picture of the Deputy Speaker on it, but that was picked up from the Report because 
<br/>the Report has gone out. No matter how you want to do it as well, the Report has gone out. You will 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>967 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say that there is quite a lot of leakages here but no, leakages happen all the time. Even the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister is sometimes shocked because the leakage comes from Cabinet Office to us outside 
<br/>of the Cabinet Office.  So, this is an old problem that exists within us because we are just human 
<br/>beings. We can be sitting here and agreeing to something, yet we disagree when we go out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I told the honourable Leader of the Opposition, “Whilst you are still a Member of Government 
<br/>and an MP, do a lot of savings whilst you are still there because the day you finish from Parliament, 
<br/>you walk the streets tomorrow, no one will give a damn about you.” This is in all honesty, and that 
<br/>is why the honourable Leader of the Opposition was saying for you to do your savings and keep it 
<br/>aside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Education came up with some ideas on his own, he forgot about 
<br/>us, but we learnt that he is doing this - he did some extra deductions to his FNPF, and we all followed 
<br/>suit. That is our only savings. Your FNPF as an MP, that is your savings.  Unless you want to take 
<br/>it, that is your choice,  but  to  rely  on whatever income you get  in  the bank in  trying  to visit your 
<br/>constituency where you will be subjected to all kinds of </span><span>kerekere</span><span>, you just have to fork it out from 
<br/>your own pocket. By the time you finish, you do not have anything with you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We even went further. This is from the former Minister for Education when he told me one 
<br/>day, “I will be your campaign manager”.  I said, “No, I do not want to go into politics because my 
<br/>father and grandmother were both politicians here”. We have learnt a big lesson. We just look at the 
<br/>material things. There was none. The car is a very old car.  There was no house in the urban area, 
<br/>only in the village, but they serve their community well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that is all we are here for. We are here to serve, but when opportunities 
<br/>like this arises, for me, in listening intently to the honourable Chairperson, I was taken aback when 
<br/>she apologised twice to the honourable Prime Minister when they reduced his pay and allowances.  
<br/>Maybe, that was his decision or his plan, I do not know, but it has come to light now. We can only 
<br/>hear and talk about that when we are provided with that kind of information.  It is finished now. The 
<br/>complaints will keep on coming until the cows come home, but they are not here to serve. When we 
<br/>go out, you are expected to do a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection just mentioned 
<br/>that  the  Girmit  Festival  that  they  undertook  recently,  quite  a  lot  of  donations  mostly  came  from 
<br/>donors who are willing to give.  Otherwise, my poor honourable colleague would have suffered a lot 
<br/>if she had to dig from her own pocket.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the rest of the questions that were raised by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition have been answered briefly by the Chairperson.  It can be an ongoing exercise and 
<br/>that is for you to decide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance has decided that it is a Party’s 
<br/>decision.  So, there is 44, and we will just have to go along with that.  That is the decision you have 
<br/>made, honourable Members, whether it is strategic or whatever, that is the decision you have made.  
<br/>Now, the issue raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, again, do we have the ability to 
<br/></span><span>pay and when will this kick in?  That is for the Government to decide.  We are not going to be making 
<br/></span><span>decisions here, no, only in the Budget, it will be brought before us here.  This one here is a separate 
<br/>one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been hearing lately about the Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 that was 
<br/>presented by the honourable Attorney-General.  He talked about the very thing that we are addressing 
<br/>here - an increase in their pay, increase in their uniform, there are so many things that were addressed.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Water people went on strike in Nadi and they received some 26 percent or something.  
<br/>The honourable Minister for Labour knows that very well.  This is an ongoing thing; it will never 
<br/>end.  That is all that I want to share with you, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sorry and I must apologise, on behalf of the Secretariat, there is no tea being prepared, 
<br/>no dinner being prepared, and we work so hard to try and keep abreast with the changing decisions 
<br/>being we made from the Government’s side - do this, wait for this, and that is why we had to send 
<br/>the flying Minute across at midday today, to ensure that we comply with the time requirement, et 
<br/>cetera. Once again, thank you very much.
