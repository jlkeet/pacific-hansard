<h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with 
<br/>a 10 minute response by the Minister responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech.  No 
<br/>seconder is required and there will be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call upon honourable Koya to deliver his End of the Week Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transparency, Accountability and Judicial Independence 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  allowing  me  the 
<br/>opportunity  to  give  my  End  of  Week  Statement  on  Transparency,  Accountability  and  Judicial 
<br/>Independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  interpretation  of  the  law  is  a  must  and  must  be  met  with  sound 
<br/>understanding of the law and, especially, in an unbiased manner to basically ensure that the integrity 
<br/>of  the  judiciary  is  upheld,  Sir.    Why  I  say  this,  Sir,  is  that  we  need  to  understand  this  particular 
<br/>concept so that we can ensure if anything is untoward and it is rectified quickly, and from what we 
<br/>have heard in  this past  week, it would seem  to  me that the honourable  Attorney-General and the 
<br/>Government is working to further building the integrity of Government and the Judiciary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to quickly talk about transparency, accountability and judicial 
<br/>independence, as I have said, as I feel this is something that needs to be said so that the people of Fiji 
<br/>can understand the importance of how it affects their daily lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow  me  first  to  explain  one  of  the  pillars,  Sir,  and  I  will  be  succinct.    In  terms  of 
<br/>transparency, this talks about the accessibility and openness of Government.  This allows everyone 
<br/></span><span>the ability to see what the Government does and is doing and that the law and their rights are being 
<br/></span><span>upheld, and this is very important as it will build trust between the people and Government, and it 
<br/>also prevents corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of accountability, the Government has to be held accountable for their actions at all times.  
<br/>Both, elected and non-elected people of Government, have a responsibility to explain their decisions 
<br/>and actions to the people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This powerful tool is used to keep public officials 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in check, and also used to prevent the abuse of power.  It is also important to build the people’s trust 
<br/>in Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of Judicial independence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very important because it is there 
<br/>to maintain the independence from the two arms of Government.  Judicial independence is vital for 
<br/>the  upholding  of  justice  and  the  rule  of  law,  to  ensure  that  cases  are  decided  fairly  and  the 
<br/>constitutionally protected rights of the people of Fiji are intact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may quote the honourable Attorney-General this past Thursday where 
<br/>he  said,  “the  integrity  and  effectiveness  of  a  judicial  system  is  paramount  to  the  health  of  our 
<br/>democracy and the wellbeing of our society”.  Let me build on this, Sir.  The essence of democracy 
<br/>lies in its transparency and accountability and those in power with respect to the people that they 
<br/>serve.  Transparency and accountability is actually demanded by law, and our democracy needs to 
<br/>ensure that the three arms of Government remain completely independent.  We cannot allow for the 
<br/>blaring  of  the  lines  for  any  reason,  even  especially  if  it  is  politically  motivated,  or  for  any  other 
<br/>reason.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 12 months or more, maybe about 17 months, crime in Fiji has 
<br/>skyrocketed.  No one is putting a blame on anyone, but it has skyrocketed.  So, it is actually good to 
<br/>hear  that  the  honourable  Minister  for  Justice,  along  with  the  Judiciary  has  worked  to  expand  the 
<br/>Courts - the Nadi Court, the new Lautoka Complex and established new court complexes around Fiji, 
<br/>to empower the Judiciary to expedite the backlog of cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the rise of the use of methamphetamine in Fiji, we can only expect that there will be a 
<br/>plethora of cases that will clog the Judiciary in months to come.  As we all know, the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Home Affairs is actually working very hard to ensure that the Police are empowered to 
<br/>ensure that all those are those people who break the law are brought to justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to remind the honourable Minister to, please, remember 
<br/>that some of the planned refurbishments and constructions that were put on hold, were put on hold 
<br/>because we went through a pandemic, and that was COVID.  It was not through any other reason, it 
<br/>was not through laxity, and I am not sure how much of that is falling on deaf ears.  Projects were put 
<br/>on hold because our nation came to a standstill, and we needed to divert funds.  When you look at 
<br/>these things, you have to put it into perspective.  There was a lot that could not be done.  We had the 
<br/>country to look after, and all of those such projects were put on hold. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  any  democracy,  especially  like  ours,  for  it  to  stand  tall,  we  need  to 
<br/>understand the concept of legal precedence, and this needs to be maintained at the highest level.  It 
<br/>is precedent that ensures that cases are decided in a similar way that will lead to a stronger and more 
<br/>predictable legal system.  It is this that sets the tone for our Judiciary, and it will help the people of 
<br/>Fiji better understand the potential legal consequences of their actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir, one must be very wary that precedent is something that you do 
<br/>not play with, as it will have a major role to play when it comes to the doctrine of </span><span>stare decisis</span><span> and 
<br/>the erosion of this particular doctrine in Fiji is a bit of a worrying trend, Sir.  It undermines the core 
<br/></span><span>principle of law and the predictability of legal interpretation in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To have a strong and fair Judiciary, we need to ensure that consistency is adhered to and will 
<br/>promote  consistency  in  the  application  of  the  law.    Where  would  it  be  abiding  precedent  or  a 
<br/>persuasive precedent, we must understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that precedent plays a vital role in legal 
<br/>systems and other things as we do in this Parliament.  We have followed a lot of precedents that you, 
<br/>being a very senior member, have told us about it, and we have followed, Sir.  It promotes 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>937 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>predictability, confidence, consistency and efficiency in the entire legal system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to transparency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not just in the Judiciary but in Government 
<br/>itself as a whole, people need to understand that Government is a representative of the people and for 
<br/>the people.  What we do in this august Parliament, Sir, what transpires in a Ministry and what happens 
<br/>in the Judiciary, is the right of that person or people to know.  Most of these, sometimes, is taken 
<br/>care of by a lot of gazettes.  It is a bit worrying that sometimes we do not get to see the gazettes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do have a lot to get through.  The media also plays a key role to holding 
<br/>governments  accountable  and  to  ensure  transparency.    Only  yesterday,  we  saw  that  some  media 
<br/>outlets were bringing something up that was tabled, and it was only half sent out.  That is not fair, 
<br/>that is not very unbiased. These particular outlets are bringing up something that was tabled and it is 
<br/>causing much debate in the nation.  We will debate it today, Sir, and I am sure it will lead to robust 
<br/>debate,  but  we  must  understand  that  unbiased  reporting  is  a  must,  where  true  accountability  and 
<br/>transparency can flourish.  Do not put something out just as a piece and half read it, and say, blame 
<br/>someone about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  In  fact  that  particular  report  that  I  am  talking  about,  Sir,  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is alarming that when people are unhappy, they use the media to push 
<br/>their narrative, and even have stories sidelined because it exposes the half-truth about their narrative 
<br/>that they are pushing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing I do hope, Mr. Speaker, is that editors and publishers will push their reporters to 
<br/>start doing this and follow-up on stories.  If it is an ongoing story, to build on the story, not just report 
<br/>on just one part or part of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you look at it from a global perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, different countries are  at 
<br/>different stages in terms of transparency, accountability and judicial independence. Some countries, 
<br/>like  Finland  and  New  Zealand,  are  often  cited  as  examples  of  countries  with  high  levels  of 
<br/>transparency and accountability. On the other hand, there are countries where those principles are 
<br/>constantly under threat due to various aspects.  It is important for us to learn from the successes and 
<br/>failures of other countries and adapt those lessons to us in Fiji, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  closing,  maintaining  transparency,  accountability  and  judicial 
<br/>independence is not without challenges. This can range, as I have said earlier, from corruption to lack 
<br/>of resources, political interference and lack of public awareness about people’s rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To overcome these challenges, it is important to strengthen the institutions that uphold these 
<br/>principles.  We need to promote education and awareness about the importance of these principles to 
<br/>the public. It is important that everyone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is held accountable, and it is paramount 
<br/>that people understand that accountability is the key to a strong and fair judiciary, and a government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  as  a  citizen  of  this  country,  it  is  our  right  to  have  access  to  information 
<br/>because we are free and in an independent country, and that is the quote from Thomas Jefferson and 
<br/>should reverberate in everyone’s mind.  This is so true; it is our right to have access to information 
<br/>and it is important that Government ensures that they are transparent in all that they do, but at the 
<br/>same time, as the great Nelson Mandela said, “the time has come to accept in our hearts and minds 
<br/>that with freedom comes with responsibilities”.  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a  very  important  topic  and  I  share  the 
<br/>sentiments of honourable Koya that, indeed, transparency and accountability are noble principles for 
<br/>any democratic nation to uphold and promote.  However, you are measured by what you do, not by 
<br/>what you preach but what you actually do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  two  weeks  ago,  I  was  invited  by  the  Fiji  Media  Association  on  the 
<br/>International Press Freedom Day.  I was a bit surprised or probably shocked when it was revealed to 
<br/>me that I was the first Cabinet Minister to be invited to their function after 16 years.  That means 
<br/>there  was  no  media  freedom  in  Fiji  in  the  last  16  years.    This  Government  brought  light.    This 
<br/>morning, we are talking about an issue that is concerning us.  Why?  Because people have the freedom 
<br/>to say it.  Gone are the days where people were suppressed with fear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you do not have to look far but look at this august Parliament.   I look at my 
<br/>colleague, the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, the former Director for Legal 
<br/>Aid Commission.  Apparently, on a working day, he took a walk from his office across the street, a 
<br/>court case was going on, and he stood there with other members of the public.  As he stood by, he 
<br/>did not realise that he was standing opposite the Suvavou House where the Office of the Attorney-
<br/>General is, he spoke to a few people and later on, because of what was going on, he heard a </span><span>yaqona</span><span>
<br/>session at Level 5, his contract was not renewed soon thereafter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were many others, Sir, I am one of them who is a living testimony. On 19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2020, 
<br/>I made a decision in Nadi and on the same night, the decision was asked to be brought to Suva to be 
<br/>heard in the appeal at 2.00 p.m. and at 10.00 a.m. my predecessor criticised me.  I did not complain, 
<br/>I moved on.  At that time, I did not realise that I will end up here.  “Let justice roll on like a river, 
<br/>righteousness like a never-failing stream.” People can now see that organisations operate on their 
<br/>own - independently, and that is important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have another story, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of a former DPP who is a Sri Lankan National, as she 
<br/>was celebrating her birthday on a Friday, there was a knock on the door, “Lata, you are to leave the 
<br/>country the very next day.”  That also happened to the former Chief Registrar, also a Sri Lankan 
<br/>national, so both ladies.  Imagine if you are foreigner and a woman, and you face such circumstances.  
<br/>She was removed. Guess, who replaced her?  Mohammed Saneem.  The question I ask is this, why 
<br/>was Saneem appointed when there were more matured senior lawyers than him?   Why?  Does he 
<br/>have any connection with the Attorney-General?   Was he destined to go and be the PS for Justice, 
<br/>and later become the Supervisor of Elections?  They can come here and say things, but there are 
<br/>examples.  History speaks for themselves, the people of this country and the whole world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was enlightened when I read Mr. Mick Beddoes comment last week in the 
<br/>papers,  “Finally,  we  can  see  justice.    You  are  never  given  an  opportunity  to  explain  when  your 
<br/>contract is not renewed.  We have now extended the contract of the Judicial Officers to five years 
<br/>from three years, so that we give them the security of tenure, so that they are not afraid when they 
<br/>are giving judgments.  Did we intervene when we are not happy with the Court’s decision?  No!  I 
<br/>have to constantly remind myself, and I remember what I had said in the first Cabinet meeting, “our 
<br/>legacy will be to follow the due process”.  That is the legacy.  It is going slowly but we will end up 
<br/>there. Yes, I agree, there is a lot of work to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  just  before  I  sit  down,  I  note  that  the  other  side  was  talking  about 
<br/>accountability.    Section  121  of  the  Constitution  talks  about  the  Accountability  and  Transparency 
<br/>Commission.  Where  is  the  Commission?  We  are  now  in  2024.  All  you  have  to  do  is  set  up  a 
<br/>legislation, and we are in the process of doing so, Sir.

<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  In Chapter 8 - Accountability.  Where is the Code of Conduct that 
<br/>you drafted and submitted here in Parliament? Because it scrutinises the work of Parliamentarians?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can come here and complain, but you are measured by what you do.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not appear in the Fiji Law Society and lecture every lawyer, no, I do not. I respect them. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Lomaiviti.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of work to be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We must acknowledge that our country 
<br/>had gone through dark ages. As a lawyer, as a parent, for those in prison, for those graduates from 
<br/>Police  and  Correction  Commissioners,  we  know  that  the  system  was  toxic  and  it  needed  to  be 
<br/>changed and that change came about on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are grateful. As I have said, we are thankful to the God Almighty.  </span><span>Turaga na Kalou,

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our collective responsibility - all of us, wherever you go, to practice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and promote transparency and to speak against drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Much has been said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I would like to thank Parliament.  As shared by 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and by the honourable Prime Minister, there is some change. Yes, the wind of 
<br/>change  is  coming.  We  are  thankful  that  we  can  actually  take  the  time  to  ponder  and  discuss  the 
<br/>national issues in a more pragmatic and practical way and create a new Fiji.

<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Tuiwailevu for briefing 
<br/>Parliament about the resource owners and MSME investment bank now being implemented by Fijian 
<br/>Holdings Limited through Merchant  Finance.  The objective of the establishment  of the resource 
<br/>owners and SME investment bank in Fiji is to significantly increase the wealth and participation of 
<br/>iTaukei and resource owners in economic activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Invexa Business Solutions was engaged in September 2023 and the final 
<br/>version of the report was endorsed by the FHL Board at the end of March this year.  It has since been 
<br/>presented to me, and as had alluded to by honourable Tuiwailevu, I will submit the report to Cabinet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conclusion of the Feasibility Studies is that there is a strong case for the 
<br/>resource owners and MSME investment bank and that Merchant Finance Limited is the right vehicle 
<br/>to  set  up  a  new  resource  owners  and  MSME  dedicated  division  to  achieve  the  objectives  of 
<br/>significantly increasing  the wealth and participation of iTaukei  and  resource owners in economic 
<br/>activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  aligned  to  the  feasibility  studies,  Merchant  Finance  has  started  the 
<br/>implementation of the dedicated resource owners’ division with the creation of a new team called 
<br/>Vanua</span><span> </span><span>Finance.  The sole purpose of this team is making finance accessible to more iTaukei and 
<br/>resource  owners’  businesses.    Merchant  Finance  have  also  started  their  focus  on  the  MSME  by 
<br/>creating a new gender-based financing team called the Marama</span><span> </span><span>Finance.  The sole purpose of this 
<br/>team is to make financing more accessible to women-owned businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vanua</span><span> </span><span>Finance team will be fully operational in June 2024 and will start 
<br/>off by using existing Merchant Finance products to serve resource owners.  New products, especially 
<br/>for resource owners, will be rolled out to the market over the next three  months to six months to 
<br/>manage the resource owners’ current demand for financing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Merchant  Finance  have  already  started  focusing  on  resource  owners,  especially  those 
<br/>planning to do land subdivision and have built a strong portfolio.  The list is expected to grow as the 
<br/>Vanua Finance team spends more time with the resource owners.  Merchant Finance has approved 
<br/>funding for three subdivision projects in the last month and more to be approved in the coming month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Marama  Finance  team  will  be  fully  operational  in  June  2024.    More  gender  specific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>products will be rolled out to the market over the next three to six months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  holistic  approach  is  required  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  success  for 
<br/></span><span>MSMEs and resource owners’ business.  Capacity building is one aspect, and we also need to address 
<br/>monitoring and reporting functions.  The Provincial Council Office, through the Roko Tui, the Mata 
<br/>ni Tikina and the Turaga Ni Koro will be tasked with additional responsibilities of monitoring and 
<br/>reporting of iTaukei and resource owners’ businesses in their own districts.

<br/>also for the Provincial Office and their delegates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the iTaukei Administration which has commenced will ensure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the appropriate infrastructure is put in place for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude  and  as  alluded  by  honourable  Tuiwailevu,  our  Solesolevaki 
<br/>Framework ensures that the public and the private sector collaborate, and we will continue to embed 
<br/>this in our work because we need to improve the economic contributions of the iTaukei to our national 
<br/>economy.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rising Cases of Suicide in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, life is a journey of self-discovery, a journey where 
<br/>we seek to find a purpose, a purpose where we were destined for. There will be good days and there 
<br/>will be bad days.  There will be days where we will win, and then there will be days where we will 
<br/>not win.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it all comes down to how we take our failures.  Many learn from them, 
<br/>and many are suppressed by their own failures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, failures and resentment take a toll on our mental health.  Mental health is a 
<br/>state  of  successful  performance  of  mental  function,  resulting  in  productive  activities,  fulfilling 
<br/>relationships with other people and the ability to adapt to change to cope with adversity.  You never 
<br/>know who might be the people who are affected, who are suffering, because they are emotionally 
<br/>unstable, who are hallucinating and hearing voices in their own heads, who are having dark thoughts 
<br/>and those who have anxiety and panic attacks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People who experience depression and mental illness are more likely to suicide and this is 
<br/>why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there should be more talk and more dialogue to normalise that these issues 
<br/>exist in our societies, especially for younger generations who have been victims to suicides. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it can be stated that globalisation is creating a significant toll on mental 
<br/>health worldwide.   I would  like to  share some of the case studies  that have been sent  by various 
<br/>people in Fiji to me or some of the ways they have felt neglected, disappointed at a disadvantage, 
<br/>depressed, and even been the victims of domestic violence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  first  case  is  where  this  person  says,  “I  grew  up  feeling  that  I  was 
<br/>neglected by my parents. I felt like I was not their favourite child.  Now, that I am a parent myself, I 
<br/>am not repeating the same mistakes my parents made.”  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a two-way street 
<br/>over here.  Cases of children facing neglect from an early age, there can be various reasons but on 
<br/>the other hand, parenting is not an easy task and no parent graduates with a degree to become a parent.  
<br/>Some things are done well, and some are not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  case,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  where  a  65-year-old  lady  shares  with  me,  “We  did 
<br/>everything for our children, coming from an average family.  But now, at this old age, they do not 
<br/>even call us or visit us”.    Sir, parents and children share a very beautiful relationship, and we need 
<br/></span><span>to realise that both the sides need to communicate with each other and communicate to understand 
<br/></span><span>and clear misunderstandings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other case is where a child gets bullied in school and gets into fights and 
<br/>does other wrong things in peer pressure.  There are people who can relate where they have been 
<br/>bullied in schools, universities and in their workplaces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>943 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another case here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is where a youth shares with me, “My parents had high 
<br/>academic expectations from me.  I got scolded at and beaten if I did not score the highest in my class.   
<br/>I wanted to do marine biology, but I was forced to become an engineer. I hate my job.  I wake up 
<br/>every day and I have to go and do what I am not passionate about.  I feel like I am dying from inside.”  
<br/>Sir,  one  thing  to  note,  is  that  an  increasing  factor  in  youth  suicide  in  Fiji  seems  to  be  parental 
<br/>expectations for academic achievement and students feeling that they have failed their parents if they 
<br/>do not succeed, as this was stated by the Ministry of Health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other case is the ability to endure toxic relationships and be victims of 
<br/>domestic violence.  A lady shares with me and says, “I have endured domestic violence up to the 
<br/>fifth year of my love marriage. I have two kids.  Sometimes I want to kill myself, but then, I cannot 
<br/>leave my children with this drunkard.  I have tried leaving, but he would not let me.  I have frustration 
<br/>boiling in within me and, honestly, it feels like a disease.  It feels like I am being eaten from inside”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other case here is where a youth shares with me that she started dating 
<br/>in her first year of university.  After seven months, her partner changed.  She said, “He became really 
<br/>possessive and aggressive.  I could not talk to anyone, not even to my own friends, or my brothers 
<br/>and sisters.  When I left him, he would blackmail me for our personal and private photos, and I could 
<br/>not sleep for days.  I felt helpless, ashamed and fearful. I could not even study.  He would stop me in 
<br/>public or come and scream my name outside my hostel”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  last  case,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  where  someone  has  shared  with  me  and  said,  “I  was 
<br/>internally  broken.    I  thought  getting  into  a  relationship  would  fix  me,  and  at  the  end  of  the  new 
<br/>relationship, I broke him, and I made a hero into a villain.”  So, if in doubt, is it important to check 
<br/>it out and the best approach is to communicate.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 700,000 cases recorded globally.  It is the youth between 15 
<br/>years to 29 years, who have been the victims of cases the most.  Fiji has a worryingly high case of 
<br/>suicide cases and in Fiji, the youngest person who committed suicide was a seven-year-old child.  So, 
<br/>it is a worrying factor for the younger generations of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the helplines available today are – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Empower Pacific 24/7 Counselling Helpline 5626;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>National Crisis Toll Free line;

<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Child Helpline Fiji 1325;  
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Fiji National Domestic Violence Helpline 156; and  
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lifeline Fiji 1543.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell these people, “All of you even have the numbers of us 
<br/>Members  of  Parliament,  reach  out,  call  us,  because  your  problem  is  our  problem,  and  through 
<br/>collective action, we will be able to combat this.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though mental health is a significant part of our life, it is considered taboo to openly 
<br/></span><span>talk about.  I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to be strong advocates for mental wellbeing 
<br/></span><span>and endorse prevention mechanisms. We have to lead by example, and it is only through collective 
<br/>action, we can achieve this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I shared my views with the honourable Minister for Health earlier this week on this matter, 
<br/>and I am hopeful that there is a multi-sectoral approach from Government and a change of mindset 
<br/>in our society, which is key to make mental wellbeing and suicide prevention a high priority on Fiji’s

<div><span>health agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell the younger generation and the people who are suffering 
<br/>from  high  stress,  depression,  mental  health  issues  and  suicidal  tendencies,  that  it  is  a  matter  of 
<br/>perception. When faced with a problem, challenge and stress,  I would like to share in this august 
<br/>Parliament what a teacher once told me in high school, who said, “Rinesh, be so prepared that the 
<br/>problem is afraid to be addressed by you”, and that has stuck with me, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One must remember that carbon, under high pressure, turns into diamond. There is always a 
<br/>way and impossible is nothing, but giving up on yourself and your life is not one. Be ambitious, but 
<br/>not be overly ambitious.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Burnouts  will  wear  you  out  and  slow  you  down.  Small  consistent  steps  are  necessary  for 
<br/>success, but I would say, if one finds being successful is easy, remaining successful is the ability to 
<br/>deal with stress, pressure and how one adapts to situations and challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  it  comes  to  relationships,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  virtue  of  patience  is  important  and 
<br/>communicating  to  understand.  At  times,  when  someone  is  not  understanding  something,  usually 
<br/>when I try to explain something to my Mum, I have to explain it to her in a way that she understands. 
<br/>So, one can try and communicate in a way that other members absorb or take in that information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the younger generations, do not be carried away by the likes, comments and shares you 
<br/>get on social media. Social appreciation does not really mean those people are really for you.  If you 
<br/>want to know who stands by you, see that on a bad or rainy day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The greatest wealth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is having a healthy body, peaceful mind and the right 
<br/>people in your life.  Rest, reset, restart, refocus as many times as you need, but ending your life is not 
<br/>a solution and our young people are being victims to this societal issue, Sir. So, indulge yourself with 
<br/>nature,  start  backyard  farming  and  gardening,  have  pets,  communicate  with  your  loved  ones  and 
<br/>develop good habits of working out and getting seven to eight hours of sleep everyday, as these are 
<br/>some of the best long-term solutions for a healthier mind and life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  that  being  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  looking  forward  to  hearing  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister’s response and initiatives. </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the End of 
<br/>the  Week  Statement  by  honourable  Sharma  on  the  topic  of  Rising  Cases  of  Suicide  in  Fiji.  It  is, 
<br/>indeed, a good topic to discuss, especially within the walls of Parliamentary Chambers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ‘Creating  Hope  Through  Action’  was  the  triennial  theme  for  the  World 
<br/>Suicide Prevention Day for the last three years, and it is commemorated on 10</span><span>th</span><span> September every 
<br/>year. The theme is a reminder that suicide is preventable, not inevitable, and it inspire the belief that 
<br/>our actions, no matter how big or small, can provide hope and positive directions to those who are 
<br/>struggling with suicidal thoughts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According  to  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)’s  ‘</span><span>LIVE  LIFE:  An  Implementation 
<br/></span><span>Guide  for  Suicide  Prevention  in  Countries</span><span>’,  any  death  by  suicide  is  a  deeply  sad  occasion.  It  is 
<br/>extremely painful for the close family members and friends left behind who cannot understand why 
<br/>it happened.  Inevitably, their sadness is multiplied as they ask themselves, “What could they have 
<br/>done to prevent the untimely death”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, WHO estimates that 700,000 persons die by suicide each year globally, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>945 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>alluded to by honourable Sharma, and 77 percent all suicide occur in low middle income countries.  
<br/>Suicide is the fourth leading course of death amongst 15 year old to 29 year old worldwide and each 
<br/>one is a strategy with a far reaching impact of families, friends and communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the global front, reducing the global suicide mortality rate by one-third by 2030 is both, 
<br/>an indicator and a target - the only one for the mental health under the United Nations Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals  and,  indeed,  WHO’s  Comprehensive  Mental  Health  Action  Plan  2013-2030.  
<br/>Current assessment suggests that the world is not on track to reach the 2030 suicide reduction target.  
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  WHO  is  encouraging  countries  to  take  action  to  prevent  suicide  through  a 
<br/>comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  Fiji,  the  suicide  and  attempted  suicide  statistics  gathered  by  the  Fiji 
<br/>Police Force in the last six years from 2016 to 2021, revealed a total of 1,476 suicide and attempted 
<br/>cases and deaths, an average of 2013 cases per year, with about half the number leading to deaths. 
<br/>The highest number of suicide and attempted suicide cases were recorded in 2019 with 244 cases, 
<br/>and the Western Division recorded the most cases every year for the last six years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot and must not ignore suicide.  The Ministry of Health and Medical Services has 
<br/>placed  suicide  prevention  high  on  its  agenda  and  it  is  committed  to  transforming  its  efforts  to 
<br/>implement effective actions to prevent suicide. These efforts are aligned to the SDG targets and the 
<br/>WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for reducing the global suicide mortality rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  has  implemented  several  measures  to  address  and  prevent  suicide, 
<br/>reflecting a comprehensive and community-based approach to mental health and suicide prevention. 
<br/>One  is  on  policy  and  strategies.  Existing  high  level  policy,  such  as  Mental  Health  Act  2010,  the 
<br/>Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Policy 2015 and hospital-based counselling standards, guide 
<br/>the national efforts in addressing mental health issues and suicide prevention in Fiji. These policies 
<br/>aim to create its supportive environment where mental health is openly discussed and addressed. The 
<br/>Ministry will be reviewing and updating these policies to address the ever-changing mental health 
<br/>landscapes in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On governance and collaboration, the National Committee on the Prevention of Suicide which 
<br/>is chaired by the Minister for Health and Medical Services provides the platform for high level multi-
<br/>stakeholder’s  collaboration  with  community  stakeholders,  interest  groups  and  Government.  This 
<br/>collaboration helps to address stigma related to mental health and promotes transparency to an open 
<br/>discussion about suicide and its prevention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  National  Mental  Health  Team,  under  the  Wellness  and  NCD  Division  within  the 
<br/>Ministry,  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  promoting  mental  health  wellness  and  training  healthcare 
<br/>professionals. They have trained nearly 1,000 nurses and doctors, and more than 500 Civil Servants 
<br/>and members of the civil society organisations across the country on suicide prevention strategies 
<br/>and  mental  health,  focussing  on  promoting  positive  coping  mechanisms  and  health  seeking 
<br/>behaviours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Crisis  Helplines,  as  alluded  also  by  honourable  Sharma,  there  are  several  toll  free 
<br/></span><span>helplines that have been developed and are now available for those in need of psychological support, 
<br/></span><span>including  the  Lifeline  Fiji  1543,  Child  Help  Line  Fiji  1325,  Empower  Pacific  24/7  Counselling 
<br/>Helpline 5626.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we could not have done this without the continuous support of our CSOs 
<br/>and Community Programmes. A number of CSO, such as Empower Pacific, Lifeline Fiji, Mending 
<br/>Minds Foundation, Building Innate Resilience Through Hearts (BIRTH) Fiji, Psychiatric Survivors

<div><span>Association, Medical Services Pacific, Fiji Cancer Society and Diabetes Fiji work closely with the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services in focusing and supporting the identification of individuals 
<br/>at  risk,  increasing  help-seeking  behaviour  and  ensuring  access  to  effective  mental  healthcare  and 
<br/>other supportive services.  They also emphasise post-intervention support, reducing access to means 
<br/>of suicide, enhancing life skills, resilience and promoting social connectedness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  awareness  and  education,  annual  events,  like  the  World  Suicide  Prevention  Day,  the 
<br/>Mental  Health  Day  and  the  Mental  Health  Month  help  raise  awareness  about  suicide  and  mental 
<br/>health issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Health Promoting Schools (HPS), one of the pillars of HPS Policy is the Mental Health

<div><span>Pillar and this allows the focus on good mental health practices in schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Substance Abuse and Advisory Council (SAAC) under the Ministry of Education and 
<br/>established under the Substance Abuse Advisory Council Act 1998, it provides the framework for 
<br/>targeting interventions with regards to substances in learning environments and promoting substance 
<br/>free learning environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On capacity building  and accreditation, the Ministry has worked  closely  with  our training 
<br/>institutions, in particular, the Fiji National University (FNU), in the training of our health workers in 
<br/>the field of psychiatry and mental health.  The University has delivered many mental health courses 
<br/>that help to build the capacity of our healthcare workers and recently started to offer the Postgraduate 
<br/>Master of Medicine in Psychiatry Degree, which is a significant achievement by the University. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, one cannot forget to mention St. Giles - our national referral hospital for mental health 
<br/>disorders. The St. Giles Hospital works in coordination with three Stress Management Wards in Suva, 
<br/>Lautoka  and  Labasa,  and  other  hospitals  at  primary  healthcare  centres  for  early  detection  and 
<br/>appropriate intervention for patients visiting any health facilities. Sir, this coordinated action also 
<br/>helps patients who are recovering after a suicidal attempt, in terms of finding possible causes of the 
<br/>attempt and addressing it appropriately so as to prevent any future attempts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  measures  reflect  Fiji’s  commitment  in  tackling  suicide  through  a 
<br/>multi-faceted approach, simply means that more people should know about it, talk about it and do 
<br/>something about it.  The new theme for the World Suicide Prevention Day for the next three years 
<br/>from 2024 to 2026 is ‘Change the Narrative is a call to action to “Start the Conversation”’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With targeted mental health strategies, good health promotions, well-trained health workforce 
<br/>and a thorough effective community engagement, we can improve suicide awareness, breakdown the 
<br/>stigma and begin to reduce the rate of suicide in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would like to highlight my experience as a young 
<br/>doctor, straight after graduating and into internship.  So, internship period is a period where you are 
<br/>tested to witness and experience attempted suicide patients who are calling for help after they have 
<br/>deliberately burned themselves or ingested some harmful chemicals. Sir, it is a sight no one wants to 
<br/>see.  Therefore, I urge all honourable Members of this august Parliament and those who are listening 
<br/></span><span>that suicide prevention is a responsibility for all of us here in Fiji. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  </span><span>Vinaka  vakalevu</span><span>,  honourable  Minister  for  Health.    I  must  apologise  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announcing honourable Tabuya’s name because that appeared on my speaking notes.

<div><span>Girmit Commemoration 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and all those who are watching today’s proceedings; 
<br/></span><span>sab ko mera Pranam, ni sa bula vinaka saka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to commemorate the arrival of 60,553 indentured labourers between 1879 
<br/>and  1916,  the  Coalition  Government  has  declared  Girmit  Day  as  national  holiday.  This  year,  we 
<br/>organised a Girmit Mela in Lautoka from 11</span><span>th</span><span> May-13th May at Fiji Girmit Centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The theme of this year’s Girmit commemoration was the ‘Journey of Girmit Descendants in 
<br/>Building a New Fiji’, acknowledging the journey of descendants in different fields of work and the 
<br/>influence on the fabric of our society.  The programme was organised by Ministry of Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs and Sugar Industry under the leadership of the honourable Minister and Permanent Secretary, 
<br/>Mr. Yogesh Karan, and his staff.  I was asked to Chair the Programme’s Committee to support their 
<br/>staff and Working Committee based in the West.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taking the national programme to the Western Division was significant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as 
<br/>many descendants of Girmityas settled in the West, to restart their lives after the end of the Girmit 
<br/>era.  After completing their indenture, many could not go back to India for many, many different 
<br/>reasons.    Those  who  chose  to  stay  could  access  land  from  the  Colonial  Sugar  Refinery  (CSR) 
<br/>company but they were restricted on what they could plant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as a result, many of the settlers negotiated with chiefs to gain or access land for 
<br/>farming.  We learned through a Girmitya elder who resided in Vuda that </span><span>Na Momo na Tui Vuda</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>
<br/>allowed many settlers to access land in early 1900s.  In the writings, we also found that Girmityas 
<br/>who made Fiji their home had learnt the language and protocols well and had developed strong ties 
<br/>with the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  important  to  acknowledge  the  custodians  of  the  land  before  we  begin  the  Girmit 
<br/>programme.  On Friday evening of 10</span><span>th</span><span> May, we organised our </span><span>vakavinavinaka </span><span>ceremony to honour 
<br/>and thank the chiefs, and </span><span>Bose ni Momo </span><span>was represented by the </span><span>Tui Nawaka, </span><span>Ratu Joeli Bulu; the 
<br/></span><span>Taukei Navo, </span><span>Ratu Meli Saukuru; </span><span>Taukei Vidilo, </span><span>Ratu Viliame Bouwalu; and the </span><span>Matanivanua nodra 
<br/>na Turaga na Tui Naviti, </span><span>Sikeli Molase.  It was a beautiful event where, after the formal ceremony, 
<br/>a </span><span>talanoa</span><span> allowed  for interaction.   We ended the evening  with  a meal  and entertainment,  a </span><span>meke 
<br/></span><span>brought by </span><span>Tui Nawaka, </span><span>South Indian dance and National Youth Band was present, that provided 
<br/>entertainment in all three languages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those who understand our culture and tradition will know that we treat our 
<br/>guests with deep respect, and we seek forgiveness at the end of any such event in case we have erred 
<br/>in any way, that may have offended them or made them uncomfortable. When we hold prayers in our 
<br/>culture, our priests tells us to seek forgiveness of our parents and community at large in case we have 
<br/>hurt them, either intentionally or unintentionally.  That is our tradition, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  And our 
<br/></span><span>matanivanua, </span><span>Mr. Sundressan Chetty from Tavua, also offered his apology during the closure of the 
<br/></span><span>ceremony.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proceedings  have  been  aired  on  various  national  TV  channels,  including  the  Fiji 
<br/>Government  </span><span>Facebook  </span><span>page.    This  event  has  been  misinterpreted,  deliberately  or  otherwise,  as  a 
<br/>national apology, on behalf of descendants of Girmityas.  I have seen a rambling </span><span>Facebook </span><span>post by 
<br/>honourable Koya and similar comments by some of his colleagues, that I had led a national apology 
<br/>on behalf of indentured labourers seeking forgiveness from the chiefs in a </span><span>matanigasau </span><span>ceremony.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is false for the reasons I have just stated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why do some politicians become fearful and insecure when there is any interaction between 
<br/>the two ethnic groups, where we try to look at and do things differently, and begin a deeper process 
<br/>of communication?  At times, we are ridiculed and told we are naive and unrealistic, even that we 
<br/>are selling out our ethnic community.  Why is that, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And it is also so interesting that these attacks have all been heaped on a woman leader.  I was 
<br/>no more or less responsible for these events than others, including the honourable Minister for Multi-
<br/>Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry.  But it appears that it is easier just to attack a woman MP, perhaps 
<br/>so  she  can  be  blamed  for  showing  weakness.    I  am  disgusted  that  honourable  Members  of  this 
<br/>Parliament instigated mass cyber-bullying with their deliberate lies.  It is little wonder that women 
<br/>do not want to stand for politics in our country Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had a government that for 16 years, said nothing about ethnic relations.  
<br/>Its policy was to ignore ethnic differences and simply say, “we are all Fijians”.  We were not allowed 
<br/>even to know the ethnic background of our population, Sir.  This was a shortsighted and ignorant 
<br/>policy.  In every country in the world, there are people of different ethnic groups.  Many of these 
<br/>countries  do  multiculturalism  well.    They  understand  the  importance  of  celebrating  diversity  and 
<br/>communicating  with  each  other  about  our  different  languages,  customs  and  cultures,  to  improve 
<br/>understanding.    Commemorating  national  days  like,  </span><span>Girmit  </span><span>and  Ratu  Sukuna,  allows  us  this 
<br/>opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  important  for  those  of  us  in  the  minority  to  recognise  and 
<br/>acknowledge all that have been done for us by the majority community. Something many descendants 
<br/>of </span><span>Girmityas</span><span> may not think about is that the </span><span>vanua </span><span>and Chiefs have a generous heart.  They call us 
<br/>‘</span><span>vasu</span><span>’ in their own context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A </span><span>vasu</span><span> is someone from maternal links and have no restrictions in observing protocols.  Yes, 
<br/>there have been times of tension, deep racism and distress we cannot deny this, nor should we forget 
<br/>the painful lessons such experiences have taught us.  Our history is marred by political upheavals of 
<br/>the last 37 years.  But it is also important that we remember that for more than a century, our ancestors 
<br/>have lived here through the support of the people of the land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One has to read ‘</span><span>Fiji - A Love Story</span><span>’ by the late former Ambassador Ajay Singh, who wrote 
<br/>how his grandmother was helped by a Fijian Chief of Ra when she was in distress. Listen to the story 
<br/>of businessman, Ben Naidu, when his grandfather was nursed by women from Sawaieke in Gau and 
<br/>nurtured for 10 years by an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> family before being returned to his own.  Read the narratives of 
<br/>the rescue of Syria wreck and you will discover the political history of the last 40 years, does not 
<br/>define our relationships, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is important that as we honour our </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>we also 
<br/>honour the relationships and support they received in settling in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  time  we  look  forward  with  excitement  and  anticipation  about  what  our  new  political 
<br/>environment can offer us in exploration of each other’s ethnic identities, our language, our culture 
<br/>and customs.  Only in this way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can we truly become one nation.  I am proud of the 
<br/></span><span>initiatives of our Government in this space.  It is a real shame that there are honourable Members in 
<br/></span><span>this Parliament who use misinformation and bigotry to try and derail these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  been  asked  by  all  and  sundry,  who  am  I  to 
<br/>represent Indo-Fijian people in what I say and do.  During the mayhem of 2000, I was one of the few 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>949 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who went to most of the areas impacted, and I also took the time to understand the different ethnic 
<br/>tensions over the last 20 years.  So, I say to those whose ill-informed criticisms try to drive a wedge 
<br/>between our communities, learn your history. To air your insecurities and hate, find other avenues 
<br/>rather than ethnic relations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  three-day  Girmit  event  at  Lautoka’s  Girmit  Centre  was  a  very  well 
<br/>attended and a great success.  Many young and older artists from different part of the West showcase 
<br/>their drama, folk songs, poetry and participated in sports that was organised.  A carnival atmosphere 
<br/>was  created  by  many  local  artists  and  musicians  from  India  through  the  courtesy  of  the  Indian 
<br/>Government.  I wish to thank honourable Minister for Youth and Sports and his Band that coloured 
<br/>the events with their Hindi numbers they learnt within a few days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express gratitude to His Excellency the President of Fiji, 
<br/>Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, for gracing the occasion.  It was an emotional moment for many 
<br/>recipients of Girmit descendants’ awards, including Mata Gangmma Ji from Solovi in Nadi, who is 
<br/>108 years old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank the Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers who were present most of the 
<br/>days of the event. I wish to acknowledge the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management, for officiating in Labasa events, and honourable Minister 
<br/>for Housing and Local Government, for officiating at Savusavu events, the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs,  the  sugar  secor,    all  artist,  exhibitors,  sponsors,  media  organisations  and  all  those  who 
<br/>participated in the event, including various Government Departments, Archives and the Fiji Museum, 
<br/>who all worked hard to make the event a great success. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have much to do to make multiculturism in Fiji not just the norm, but a 
<br/>force for good and a way to capitalise our natural development, and I urge every MP and every citizen 
<br/>of our  country to  be generous in  spirit and to  support us as we  embark  on  a  new path  for  ethnic 
<br/>relations in Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You listen to me.  I am going to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  thank you very much for giving  me the chance to

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Wait!  I have not given you the floor.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the problem of them continuing with their running commentary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have not given you the floor yet.  I was about to address you, but anyway, since you have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stood up, I will give you the floor now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am the last speaker, I suppose.  Honourable Bulitavu 
<br/>is saying, “just be short and sweet’.  But I love to say one thing, despite my extending invitation to 
<br/>the Opposition to come to the all the celebrations, no one turned up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You gave the wrong invitation!

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  alphabetical  error  does  not  mean  your  name 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>changes.  Anyway, look, if they keep on interjecting, I will take long, I will take 20 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the End of the Week Statement by honourable Kiran on the 
<br/>update and the significance of the recently celebrated National Girmit Day that was held for the three 
<br/>days from 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 to 13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024.  The three-day event was held at the Lautoka Girmit 
<br/>Centre, while the two half-day events was organised at Subrail Park in Labasa and Savusavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to confirm that the National Girmit Day event 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this year was very successful, and this was attested by honourable Kiran earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Keep quiet!  When a senior person speaks, keep quite! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  for  the  successful  event  are  numerous. 
<br/>Firstly, the event was led by a very capable person, the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection, who was the Chairperson of this event.  With the vast experience she 
<br/>has  in  managing  the  projects  and  events,  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  provided  majestic 
<br/>leadership, guidance and a direct involvement in the planning, organising and executing of the three-
<br/>day event in Lautoka.  Despite her busy schedule, she took her valuable time to prioritise this event.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Ministry, I wish to thank her wholeheartedly for leading the success 
<br/>of this event,  given that the Ministry of Mult-Ethnic is a relatively new ministry with limited staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second reason of the success was the role of the hardworking committee 
<br/>members,  who  were  set  up  prior  to  the  event  in  Lautoka,  Labasa  and  Savusavu.    The  Lautoka 
<br/>committee was led by Mr. Selva Nadan, the Savusavu committee was led by Mr. Shankar Singh and 
<br/>the Labasa committee was led by Mr. Vinesh Prasad.  These gentlemen worked tirelessly with the 
<br/>committee members to ensure that everything was ready before the event proper.  All the committee 
<br/>members  dedicated  their  time  on  a  volunteer  basis,  and  I  was  amazed  by  their  dedication  and 
<br/>commitment.  On the same note, I wish to thank the volunteers who helped us in making this event 
<br/>successful in the three locations of Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  reason  of  success,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  the  service  provided  by  the  National 
<br/>Archives, which allowed the Girmit descendants in the Western Division to identify their ancestry in 
<br/>India.    There  is  a  very  popular  site  and  I  wish  to  thank  the  National  Archives  for  providing  this 
<br/>service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the event, the younger generation of the Girmit descendants were 
<br/></span><span>able to see the artifacts and jewellery that were brought from  India.  The Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/></span><span>displayed  spices,  cooking  utensils,  crops  and  farming  tools  that  were  introduced  by  the  Girmit 
<br/>descendants.  The Ministry of Forestry showcased some of the plants that were introduced by the 
<br/></span><span>Girmityas</span><span>, and this was another reason for the success of the Girmit event, and I am grateful for both 
<br/>Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the patrons witnessed a great performance by around 60 artists related to
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>951 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Girmit both, local artists and artists from India.  I wish to thank the Indian Government for bringing 
<br/>them over to Fiji, especially for the Girmit event.  In both, Labasa and Savusavu, there were 20 items 
<br/>from the different local groups that performed various items on Girmit, and I wish to pay my gratitude 
<br/>to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The patrons also witnessed some great performance by the National Youth Band where we 
<br/>witnessed iTaukei youngsters singing beautiful Hindi songs. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this attracted 
<br/>a good crowd. I wish to thank the Ministry of Youth for this stage performance, and I would like to 
<br/>see them perform more in my Ministry’s social cohesion events in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The highlight of the Girmit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the awards that were bestowed to the Girmit 
<br/>descendants  of  80  years  and  above  by  our  President,  His  Excellency  Ratu  Viliame  Maivalili 
<br/>Katonivere, who was the Chief Guest on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024.  That was an emotional moment 
<br/>for the recipients and family members.  I am sure  the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection will agree with this.  I wish to thank His Excellency for his time to be 
<br/>the Chief Guest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to state that the funds for this year’s Girmit Day event in 
<br/>Lautoka, Suva, Labasa and Savusavu has been well accounted for by my Ministry.  I wish to clearly 
<br/>inform this Parliament that no funds were disbursed to any individual  or organisation prior to the 
<br/>event,  and  all  financial  and  procurement  rules  of  the  Government  were  followed,  including  the 
<br/>requirements for three quotations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is the way to go, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- On that note, I wish to thank everyone for making this year’s Girmit Day 
<br/>event successful and I support the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social 
<br/>Protection  for  her  End  of  the  Week  Statement  on  the  update  and  significance  of  the  recently 
<br/>celebrated National Girmit Holiday. </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- For the information of honourable Members, I received notification from 
<br/>the  Chairperson  of  the  Special  Committee  on  Emoluments  to  move  a  motion  pertaining  to  the 
<br/>Committee’s Report which was tabled on Wednesday, 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Business Committee has agreed to allow the Chairperson to move her motion today, and 
<br/>in that respect, honourable Members, a procedural suspension motion must be moved.  I now call 
<br/>upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move his motion.
