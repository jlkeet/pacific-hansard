<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on how the supply of cane in the Rakiraki area will be increased?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer honourable Maharaj, I would like to 
<br/>make some comments on what the honourable Leader of the Opposition said last night in regards to 
<br/>Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  (FSC)  and  the  staff  attitude,  what  has  been  happening  and  why  there  is  a 
<br/>decrease in the sugar industry’s cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are right, the attitude of staff and FSC over the last 10 years or so, have resulted in the 
<br/>farmers having to run to the workers rather than the workers going to the farmers and advising them.  
<br/>That is the only observation that I have seen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have warned the FSC workers and said, “If you are slack on your work, just go home.  Give 
<br/>the job to someone else”.  I will give you an example of a Sector Clerk in Wailevu, who never visited 
<br/>the farmers.  He was sitting in the office all the time.  One day, the farmer re-planted his cane, he 
<br/>requested the Sector Officer to go and survey his farm so that there could be a claim, but the Clerk 
<br/>never turned up.  So, the farmer made a video of his farm and complained against the Sector Clerk, 
<br/>and he forwarded it to me.  I immediately forwarded that to the FSC CEO and said, “This is what the 
<br/>Sector Clerk is doing.”  I told him, “You either fire him or I will fire you.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So that Sector Clerk got out of the office.  That is the type of attitude I am taking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  So,  I  wholeheartedly  take  your  advice,  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, I am  a‘no nonsense’ Minister.  I got hands-on job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Premila  Kumar  complimented  the  sugar  industry,  supported  the  motion  but, 
<br/>unfortunately, when I was replying, she was not in the Chamber. I do not know why, but if she wants 
<br/>to support me, she should be here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen to me!  I am coming to that, I have got plenty time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What are your saying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am just simply saying that you were not here when I was replying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yesterday, when I was talking about the sugar price, honourable Bala 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was complaining.  Why were you complaining?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>907 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who was complaining? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You were complaining last night. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  My  answer  is  coming.    Now,  listen,  to  what  I  am  going  to  say.  
<br/>Honourable Maharaj, you question me about Ra.  The honourable Member sitting next to you is from 
<br/>Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes, I am coming to that.  Honourable Ratu Niudamu is a high Chief of 
<br/>Ra.    He  actually  asked  me;  “Honourable  Minister,  how  can  we  get  together  and  increase  the 
<br/>production in Ra?”  A Chief like him from that side, he is offering to assist the Government on how 
<br/>we can increase production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes, I am coming to that! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question asked by honourable Maharaj regarding the 
<br/>measures taken to increase the supply of cane in  the Rakiraki area. We,  as  Coalition  Government, 
<br/>recognise the crucial role that the sugar industry has in our economy, particularly in supporting the 
<br/>livelihoods of many families in Rakiraki and beyond.  To address the challenge of sugarcane supply 
<br/>in this area, we are implementing a multifaceted strategy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  based  on  our  current  data,  the  total  area  registered  for  cane cultivation 
<br/>across the four sectors in the Penang Mill area is approximately 8,142 hectares. However, only 34 
<br/>percent (2,729.3 hectares) of this land is currently under cultivation, resulting in a production of 
<br/>only 141,520 tonnes of cane last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker Sir, there is significant potential to boost production in the Rakiraki 
<br/>cane belt as it was in the good days until after 2016. If we can increase the cultivation area to, at 
<br/>least, 60 percent of the total available area, we could produce approximately 250,000 tonnes of cane, 
<br/>and  this  was  achieved  in  the  past  years. To  boost  production,  our  initial  focus  will  be  on 
<br/>both, Ellington 1 and Ellington2 Sectors, where less than 20 percent of registered land is currently 
<br/>under active cultivation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Re-engaging inactive producers, Mr. Speaker Sir, is a primary strategy. Many farmers who 
<br/>have ceased sugarcane cultivation need encouragement and support to return to farming, which is 
<br/>essential for increasing the overall productivity of the Mill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  introduced  various  incentives  and  programmes  aimed  at  encouraging  existing 
<br/></span><span>farmers  to  expand  their  cane  cultivation  and attracting  new  farmers  to  the  industry. These 
<br/>incentives include grants for planting sugarcane</span><span>, </span><span>subsidies for fertilizers, a $5 tonne incentive for 
<br/>improving  production,  manual  labour  harvesting  support,  provision  of  farming  equipment  and 
<br/>improved cane varieties that promise higher yields.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising that adequate infrastructure is vital for efficient farming, we are investing in 
<br/>improving access roads to cane farms and upgrading drainage systems to mitigate the impacts of 
<br/>adverse weather conditions. This infrastructure support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will enable farmers to 
<br/>cultivate and harvest cane more effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are enhancing our Agriculture Extension Services to provide farmers 
<br/>with an up-to-date knowledge and best practices in farming.  These include training on the modern 
<br/>agricultural techniques, pest and disease management, soil fertility management, et cetera.  These 
<br/>services by the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) and FSC are designed to increase productivity 
<br/>and sustainability in cane farming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Engaging the youth in farming through the formation of small cooperatives is another strategy 
<br/>to  increase  cane  production.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SRIF  will  train  young  farmers,  particularly,  the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in best management practices, ensuring they will be well equipped to manage and cultivate 
<br/>sugarcane effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is working with financial institutions, especially the Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/>Fund (SCGF) to facilitate easy access to credit for the cane farmers.  By providing low interest loans 
<br/>and  financial  products  tailored  to  the  needs  of  the  cane  farmers,  we  aim  to  remove  the  financial 
<br/>barriers that prevent farmers from investing in their farms and expanding production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our collaboration with SRIF will focus on developing new cane varieties 
<br/>that  are  more  resilient  to  climate  change  and  disease  while  offering  higher  yields.    The  ongoing 
<br/>research and development efforts ensure that our farmers have access to the best possible resources 
<br/>to increase cane supply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to highlight a significant issue, the farmers have faced immense challenges 
<br/>since the removal of the Penang Mill in Rakiraki in 2016.  It is disheartening to note that reinstating 
<br/>this Mill will require just over $5 million at the time.  However, due to the irresponsible decision-
<br/>making by the then Government, this Mill was sold as scrap.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- We are now bearing the cost of the decision by providing the farmers 
<br/>with a cartage cost of $5 million plus a year.  Over the last seven years, we have already bled $30 
<br/>million for their ignorance, and we will continue to burden them.  This is a glaring example of the 
<br/>wastefulness of the previous Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nonetheless, we are moving strategically to eliminate this recurring cost and convert it to an 
<br/>investment  that  will  benefit  the  taxpayers  in  the  long  run,  instead  of  catering  to  the  incapable 
<br/>decisions of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investment of the building of a new mill in Penang will, no doubt, reward our investment, 
<br/>attract  new  and  young  farmers,  particularly  our  resource  owners,  and  enhance  other  economic 
<br/>activities in Rakiraki and Tavua again.  We expect this investment to operate efficiently enough that 
<br/></span><span>the debt incurred to build a new mill will be self-sustaining in the long run.  In fact, we anticipate 
<br/></span><span>that this will be a game changer for our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Coalition Government has been ardently advocating for the establishment of a new mill 
<br/>in  Rakiraki  to  replace  the  one  dismantled  by  the  previous  Administration,  which  deeply  hurt  our 
<br/>farmers and shattered their confidence in no time.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>909 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen!  If you have questions, then listen to my answers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Sir.  Standing Order 60 on the relevance.  I would 
<br/>just like to get a clarification.  Two days ago, the honourable Minister gave some figures that it is $7 
<br/>million to cart sugarcane from Rakiraki to Ba.  He actually stated that the cost on that particular day 
<br/>was not $5 million.  Within two days, the honourable Minister is giving two different figures.  Can 
<br/>the honourable Minister, please, clarify because it seems that his figures are coming out of thin air 
<br/>and not from the staff of the Ministry?  How come it was $7 million two days ago and today, it has 
<br/>come down to $5 million?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Well, let me rule on that point of order. Rakiraki is quite some distance 
<br/>away and as the crow flies, that is a different mileage altogether but if you follow the road, probably 
<br/>it is much longer.  That is why his figures are different.  What is going on, because if you follow the 
<br/>road ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, thank you, honourable Maharaj.  Honourable Minister, you may resume your seat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you have completed your time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, thank you for your response.  Specifically with 
<br/>respect to Rakiraki and this new mill that you have been talking about for months on end, you have 
<br/>heard the honourable Deputy Prime Minister talking about Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and the 
<br/>production of ethanol.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, can you tell us, will Rakiraki be also a centre and are you incorporating 
<br/>the plan to produce ethanol out of that new Mill?  In terms of that, how are you going to achieve that 
<br/>increase that you have spoken about with respect to sugarcane production, going on to include the 
<br/>production of ethanol with respect to sustainable aviation fuels? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Our plan is this, honourable Koya, the ethanol plant will be constructed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Will you address me, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I apologise, Sir. The ethanol plant will be done in Ba because when the 
<br/>Rakiraki Mill is done, we will have to bring in molasses and sugar out of Rakiraki Mill and Lautoka 
<br/>Mill into Ba Mill.  So that will be the center of the ethanol plant, but the Rakiraki Mill which will be 
<br/>established will have a refinery together with it. So, we will have a refinery in Rakiraki because as 
<br/>you know, honourable Koya, we are exporting all our raw sugar overseas and then we are importing 
<br/>white sugar back to Fiji. So Rakiraki Mill will have a full scale …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.-  Who is questioning me?  Question me properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not know about sugar, they will not ask about sugar. All I am saying 
<br/>is, I will answer you.  Our plans are very intact, it is going to happen, it is not a match box project. It 
<br/>is a big project, and we are currently negotiating with both, India and China, to build a mill and we 
<br/>will see which is the best option and, thereafter, we will take it to Cabinet.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, another supplementary question; due to </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and 
<br/>the  closure  of  Penang  Sugar  Mill,  a  lot  of  cane  farmers  stopped  doing  cane  farming  and  they 
<br/>diversified to other crops. My question to the honourable Minister is, what incentives are there to 
<br/>bring these farmers back to sugarcane farming?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, well, as I have said, in the last Budget, we had  13 
<br/>different programmes and in the next Budget, we will have another seven new programmes which 
<br/>will focus on Rakiraki itself and the farmers in that area.  So, just wait for a while and we will rebuild. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Thank you honourable Minister for Sugar for your nice answer.  My 
<br/>supplementary  question  is,  as  you  have  already  promised  the  Rakiraki  farmers,  when  will  the 
<br/>construction of the Rakiraki Sugar Mill start? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have just said, it is not a matchbox project, but  a 
<br/>project that has to be well-designed.  Currently, we are talking to the suppliers.  They will give us a 
<br/>proper price, then we will come back to the FijiFirst Party to take a bipartisan approval, and then we 
<br/>will start. It will not start now but will definitely finish before the end of our term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K.  BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, much has  been said  about  the  Rakiraki  Sugar Mill. 
<br/>What is the total tonnage of cane that we get from Rakiraki Mill? Sir, I have a follow-up question on 
<br/>the basis of his answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Can you repeat the question, please, because honestly, I cannot see you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I cannot hear you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can we have some provision for breathalyser here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, is someone driving? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  A Point of Order. That question implies when he is asking 
<br/>the question, do you need a breathalyser or referring to the word ‘breathalyser’, which is imputing 
<br/>improper motives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have corrected him on that one, honourable Leader of the Government in 
<br/>Parliament  because no  one is  driving here. So, honourable Minister, do you want  to  reply  to that 
<br/>supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What was the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament what is 
<br/>the total tonnage of cane that we get from the Rakiraki Mill? Then, I also have a follow up question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, we are getting about 140,000 tonnes out of 
<br/>Rakiraki but we are expecting that with the new mill to be there,  we should be having about 3,000 
<br/>tonnes of cane per day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Do you mean, having it after five years? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>911 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Well, look, I was not here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Hold on, hold on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- So, what I am saying is, the answer is 140,000 tonnes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is enough, Sir.  What is your follow-up question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, is that enough tonnage to build the Rakiraki Mill? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    that  is  what  I  am  saying,  we  have  to  increase  the 
<br/>tonnage, and the Mill will take two years to be built.  So, from now onwards, we have to encourage 
<br/>the  farmers,  including  the  children  and  fellow  members  of  the  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>,  to  start  growing  more 
<br/>sugarcane so that we can have sufficient sugarcane for the Rakiraki Mill in two years’ time.

<div><span>Aviation Industry - Growth in Tourism Sector 
<br/>(Question No. 89/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on the key activities that the Aviation Industry is undertaking to

<br/>Rotuma, Savusavu, Lakeba and Matei.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  contract,  awarded  in  April  2024,  after  a  rigorous  tender  process,  is  part  of 
<br/>ongoing maintenance efforts funded by Fiji Airports.  Additionally, construction for 
<br/>the Labasa Terminal will begin  in mid-2024  at its  current location,  with plans to 
<br/>acquire adjacent land for a larger terminal in the future.

<div><span>I have briefed Parliament on the World Bank Project, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span><span>Fiji Airports is supporting the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation in upgrading 
<br/>Savusavu  and  Labasa  Airports  as  part  of  the  World  Bank-funded  Fiji  Tourism 
<br/>Development Programme in Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase I, spanning six years, involves building a new terminal at the current site to 
<br/>serve passengers for the next five years.  A larger terminal, with expanded capacity 
<br/>and parking, will be constructed on a new site near the Airport, pending World Bank 
<br/>assistance. Concurrently, a feasibility study for a new domestic airport in Savusavu 
<br/>will be conducted.

<br/>Airports.    A  concept  design  for  extending  the  Matei  Airport  runway  has  been 
<br/>developed,  requiring  land  acquisition  around  the  airport.    As  I  have  stated,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we want to land the ATR in Matei.

<div><span>There  is  proposed  development  of  luxury  resorts  around  the  Yasawa-i-rara,  Blue 
<br/>Lagoon  area  and  Nacula  area.  At  the  latest  count,  there  are  about  10,  and  the 
<br/>Government is committed to this endeavour and is currently examining all feasible 
<br/>alternatives to  foster the  construction of  an airport and  corresponding  facilities  to 
<br/>support  these  investments.    This  initiative  aligns  with  Government’s  strategic 
<br/>objectives to distribute the advantages of tourism across the archipelago.

<div><span>Fleet Modernisation 
<br/>Our national airline has a very young fleet and doing a wonderful job internationally, but 
<br/>we need to upgrade/replace the local equipment being used domestically.  The reason, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, is that our national airline has reported some impressive results, and this augurs 
<br/>well for aviation and the future of our tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regulatory Reforms 
<br/>We are modernising our aviation safety and security legislation, to ensure it is in line with 
<br/>ICAO’s requirements and fit for purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Safety Enhancement Initiatives  
<br/>Also, with ICAO, and I had highlighted this week about the liberalization of our aviation 
<br/>policy as stated.  This is part of what you face today if you want to go into markets, like the 
<br/>USA.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I want to emphasise that when we talk about Open Skies Policy, it will be considered 
<br/>on a case-by-case basis bilaterally.  So, there should be no fear of our national airline being 
<br/>threatened by some of the big boys internationally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  initiatives,  coupled  with  our  strong  national  oversight  system 
<br/>compliant  with  ICAO  standards,  are  aimed  at  ensuring  that  our  aviation  industry  remains  safe, 
<br/>reliable and efficient, thereby, supporting the growth of our tourism sector.  We remain committed 
<br/>to overcoming the challenges we face and leveraging the opportunities that lie ahead to bolster growth 
<br/>in the tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  terminal  in  Labasa  is  important,  no 
<br/></span><span>doubt, there is a long-term goal and should be achieved for the betterment of the people of Labasa 
<br/></span><span>and Vanua Levu as a whole.  The immediate remedy that is required is to reduce air fares from Suva 
<br/>to Labasa and from Nadi to Labasa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is the honourable Minister doing in order to bring the air fares down?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I will give an example, I was trying to book my mother’s flight over the weekend.  It was costing me 
<br/>around $700 return, compared to previously when it was offered at $65 one way.  What is the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister doing to reduce the air fares between Suva-Labasa and Labasa-Nadi? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, operating an airline is a business and the laws of 
<br/>supply and demand apply.  Airlines have a yield system in place, so a yield system is whereby you 
<br/>book at a certain time, you pay a certain fare.  When you book last, you can be paying the highest 
<br/>rate in the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is the reality of the game today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but looking 
<br/>at the bigger picture, he scoffed at the World Bank Development Programme for Vanua Levu.  When 
<br/>you uplift Vanua Levu and you uplift tourism in Vanua Levu, there will be volume traffic, there will 
<br/>be frequencies and the air fare will come down.  So, do not scoff like you did, honourable Maharaj, 
<br/>about this initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister; in terms of the Fiji Link services to Vanua Levu and to Nadi, can Fiji Link and Fiji Airways 
<br/>ensure that there are planes available?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are mechanical problems and if you move forward, this could frustrate many tourists, 
<br/>given that flights are cancelled in the last minute  due to mechanical problems.  That has been an 
<br/>ongoing issue in the last six months.  How can we ensure that we have a proper aircraft servicing the 
<br/>people, so they are not affected if they have a connecting flight from Nadi to overseas and they are 
<br/>told at the very last minute that the plane from Nausori is not coming to Labasa? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the problem with our people on the other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>side is their selective hearing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I did highlight in my delivery that we are replacing the old equipment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>used locally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We are going to replace them.  As I have said, Fiji airways has a 
<br/>very  young  fleet  internationally  but  locally,  they  will  be  replacing  the  old  equipment.  It  will  not 
<br/>become an issue once we replace the old equipment, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  do  have  quite  a  remarkable  record  now  on    on-time  departure  and 
<br/>arrival.  For Labasa, the day will come very soon when you check in your bag in  Labasa and you 
<br/>can pick it up in London if you are going to London.  That is happening, Sir, it will be international 
<br/>check-in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the way forward for aviation in Vanua Levu.  
<br/>You  can  check-in  your  bag  in  Vanua  Levu  and  you  pick  it  up  where  you  are  going  -  London  or 
<br/>whatever. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<div><span>30 Million Tree Planting Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 90/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament on the total 
<br/>number of trees planted to-date under the 30 million Tree Planting Programme which targets 
<br/>reforestation and climate change mitigation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister for Fisheries, I notice you have been planting a lot of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trees in Lomaiviti.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Koroilavesau.  Thank you, honourable Member, for your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in January 2019, the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years Programme was officially 
<br/>inaugurated. This tree planting initiative is part of Fiji's green economy recovery from the ongoing 
<br/>impacts of climate change and the impacts of COVID 19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Fiji's tree planting initiative is contributing towards meeting our international 
<br/>commitments under the REDD+ initiative that was initiated in 2009 and the World Bank's Emission 
<br/>Reduction Programme signed in 2021 to remove and reduce emission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years initiative is part of Fiji's Nationally Determined 
<br/>Contributions  (NDCs)  where countries  set  targets  for  mitigating  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions that 
<br/>cause climate change and for adapting to climate impacts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reforestation of degraded forest through this tree planting is an attempt to utilise degraded 
<br/>forests  to  address  broad  thematic areas  of  need,  including  carbon  stock  enhancement, 
<br/>connecting forest  corridors,  coastal  restoration,  food  security,  flood mitigation  stabilisation  of 
<br/>riparian systems,  catchment restoration, enrichment  planting,  community woodlots and industrial 
<br/>planting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Sir, honourable Koroilavesau asked the number of trees you have planted so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>far, Sir.  We have been informed about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will elaborate more on this to let them understand the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reality. I will come to that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Can you explain a bit more? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V. RAVU.- I have to elaborate on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  the  start  of  the  Programme  in  January  2019,  more  than  19.1  million  trees  have  been 
<br/>planted, including almost a million mangroves, on more than 17,200 hectares of land across Fiji.  This 
<br/></span><span>means that we have planted approximately 64 percent of our target with 36 percent yet to be achieved, 
<br/></span><span>which is 10.9 million trees.   A further breakdown of trees across the various Provinces can be provided, 
<br/>if required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The approximate number of trees planted by Province included Ba Province planting the most 
<br/>with almost 5.8 million, followed by Nadroga with almost 4.2 million, Bua with 3.9 million, Ra with 
<br/>almost 2 million, Macuata with 1.2 million, Tailevu at 0.6 million, Rewa at 0.5 million and Cakaudrove

<div><span>at 0.49 million.  Others include - Naitasiri with 267,000; Serua with 127,000, Namosi with 73,000, 
<br/>Lomaiviti with 22,000; Lau with 37,000; Kadavu with 4,000 and Rotuma with 40 trees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  the  19.1  million  trees  planted,  pine  makes  up  about  14.9  million, 
<br/>mahogany at 776,000; mangroves at approximately 931,000; sandalwood about 17,000 and others, 
<br/>which include native trees, fruit trees and teak which is about 2.5 million.  The numbers achieved are 
<br/>a positive testament of the diligent work being carried out by my Ministry with the support of our 
<br/>communities and our partners - Fiji Pine Limited, Fiji Pine Trust and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Ltd, 
<br/>as well as the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we also acknowledge that there are challenges that we continue to face, associated 
<br/>with  activities  aimed  at  reforesting  degraded  landscapes,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  relatively 
<br/>lower survival rate of certain species in specific sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many  factors  affect  the  growth  of  seedlings  including,  drought,  fires, 
<br/>animals and flooding, as well as the suitability of certain species to different sites.  The Ministry has 
<br/>also assisted vulnerable areas in relation to the above factors with the erection of fences, construction 
<br/>of fire breaks and proper land preparation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past, research work carried out by the Department of Forestry had focused mainly on 
<br/>improving the growth of our two major plantation species - pine and mahogany, contributing to their 
<br/>current success.  But it is not only these species that are vital to the achievement of our goals, it is 
<br/>also the implementation of the tree planting programme, such as the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years 
<br/>initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Research Division of the Ministry has been undertaking site specific research studies, 
<br/>focusing  on  species  with  higher  mortality,  to  ensure  improvement  in  the  survival  rates,  moving 
<br/>forward.  That is why our Research Division has established permanent sample plots to monitor the 
<br/>growth of each species and their survival, to help determine which species to plant at different sites 
<br/>in the future, and the actions required to improve the survival of the planted trees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also revised our Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Guidelines 
<br/>to provide our monitoring team the ability to trace back the survival and mortality rates to activities, 
<br/>such  as  seed  collection  and  associated  treatments.    Moreover,  our  team  on  the  ground  is  also 
<br/>increasing their focus on the beating up of seedlings and planting new seedlings in the areas that did 
<br/>not survive under the initial round of tree planting.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  we  need  to  ensure  that  communities  are  able  to  take  ownership  of  the 
<br/>developments, especially the tree planting initiative.  If communities take ownership and look after 
<br/>the trees planted on their particular land, then survival rate could be greatly increased.  Ultimately, 
<br/>these initiatives will help us improve our future survival rates, therefore, the achievement of our goal 
<br/>in restoring degraded landscape.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on the improvements planned, I am confident that we will meet or even exceed the 
<br/>target of 3 million trees in 15 years, helping to restore forestry ecosystem, supporting socio-economic 
<br/></span><span>development, and positively contributing to the achievements of Fiji’s international commitments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank the people of Fiji for their continued support in assisting my Ministry towards 
<br/>the tree planting efforts.  I also have a table of the Provinces that have been planted. If they want, I 
<br/>can also hand it over to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we all realise how important the RED+

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>917 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme is to us and the fact that we have already planted 19.1 million trees, I think, according to 
<br/>the honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question to the honourable Minister, of that 19.1 million trees that are being planted, is 
<br/>there a particular portion that has already been designated for carbon trading or has the work going 
<br/>on with respect to that particular part of what we have been discussing earlier on regarding carbon 
<br/>trading? Has any portion of that 19 million been designated for or being looked at in terms of being 
<br/>designated for carbon trading?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It depends on how old the trees are, honourable Minister. The figures you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are quoting, maybe they are just one year old or something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I think carbon trading is coming after that initiative and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are working on it right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Not even that young. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Sa dina</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- They are still young, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  According  to  the  honourable  Minister,  it  is  still  young  so  they  really 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cannot… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- .. approve the carbon trading.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  that  is  why  I  said  ‘designated  for’.  Is  he  looking  at  a 
<br/>particular area where we know we can utilise in terms of designating it for carbon trading so that the 
<br/>landowners or whoever is responsible for that is aware that they actually have an asset so they can 
<br/>use?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Qo me sa vakagalalataki tu me baleta na ka ni</span><span> carbon trading.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, later on, we are looking into that when they grow into that size.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What size? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- We cannot do it now because it is a bit too small. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What size you are talking about, big size? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  this  programme,  it  was  aimed  at 
<br/>helping resource landowners. Basically, the landowners used to establish their own nurseries and sell 
<br/></span><span>it back to Government for the replanting programme. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if 
<br/></span><span>that programme is still continuing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Sir, it still continues until today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Still on and still continues, that is the wholesome answer.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  quick  question  to  the  honourable  Minister, 
<br/>there  is  an  over  reliance  now  on  plantations  -  pine  and  mahogany.  We  have  lost  most  of  our 
<br/>indigenous species. So, in that replanting programme, can you please clarify the level of efforts on 
<br/>bringing back our indigenous species and of course, the future plan as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  through  this  initiative,  we  are  also  including  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indigenous species all around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Seruiratu,  are  you  satisfied  with  that  reply?  Planting  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indigenous species all over the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The follow on question from here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because when 
<br/>you talked about it, one is for timber purposes and for our food security as well.  Breadfruit and all 
<br/>those, come under this classification.  So, if the honourable Minister can be more specific.  That is 
<br/>why  I  asked,  where  is  the  focus  and  what  are  the  future  plans  because  forestry  is  important  for 
<br/>biodiversity as well?  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  I will respond to that question later, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Why?  You tell me why you want to refer to it later?  You do not have the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answers with you, that is all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Sir, I do not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>answers that he has given to the questions.  I noticed that the major reason for the 30 million trees 
<br/>over 15 years was for biodiversity, maintaining our forest cover.  One of the things that I have noticed 
<br/>recently during our site visit is that a stock of raw material going into sawmills, our timber industry, 
<br/>is declining and there is a look now to replace that.  We have traditionally relied on to species that 
<br/>grow faster that can be harvested faster as well, and there are some works going on in Vanualevu on 
<br/>Eucalyptus and Acacia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we are doing this replanting, the Ministry of Forestry also looked into planting species 
<br/>that might be available faster for harvest for those sawmillers who are now facing severe shortage of 
<br/>raw materials into the sawmills.  It is happening now, and it is going to worsen in a few years’ time.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the failure before is, we put the wrong plant in 
<br/>the wrong soil texture and now we are doing it the right way.  We are putting the right trees in the 
<br/>right place where they can grow much faster and to be utilised in other species.  Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I think the bipartisan is really working in this Parliament because the last 
<br/>time,  the  honourable  Minister  provided  us  with  some  supplementary  questions  to  this  side  of

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  just  heard  from  the  honourable  Minister  that  the  previous 
<br/>programme  is  being  continued.  Is  there  any  specific  region  that  have  seen  significant  progress?  
<br/>Thank you.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Vocea, you will confuse him a lot.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do you want to respond to that question, Honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, can he repeat the question, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have just heard what the honourable Minister said, 
<br/>that the previous programme has been continued by your Ministry. So, is there any specific region 
<br/>that has seen significant progress?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in Nayarabale in Vanualevu, there is a place 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there and also Saqani. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  You are talking about Cakaudrove? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Yes, in the village of Naiyarabale. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Are they planting in the village? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  The area consists of 500 acres of land.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Border Security Actions 
<br/>(Question No. 91/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform  Parliament 
<br/>what actions have been taken or are planned to be taken to ensure border security, given the 
<br/>recent influx in criminal activities and illegal border entries?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  her 
<br/>question.  In response to that question regarding the actions that have been taken, or plan to ensure 
<br/>border  security  amidst  the  reported  criminal  activities  and  illegal  border  entries,  I  am  providing 
<br/>Parliament with the following update: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>National Border Security Upgrade Framework   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  has  developed  a  comprehensive  framework  to  enhance  border  security, 
<br/>incorporating a coordinated approach among all key stakeholders.  This will facilitate 
<br/>seamless information sharing and risk intelligence exchange.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Automation of Passenger Arrival Cards (PAC)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  introducing  a  digital  PAC  system,  allowing  travellers  to  submit  information 
<br/>electronically before arrival.  This will improve efficiency, reduce clearance times and 
<br/>enhance surveillance capability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Advance Passenger Information  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is in collaboration with the United Nations Office of Counter Terrorism.  We are 
<br/>implementing systems to collect real-time passenger data, and this will help prevent the 
<br/>entry of inadmissible individuals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Maritime Security Strategy   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are in the process of developing a robust maritime security strategy to protect our 
<br/>maritime domain.  This involves co-operation among maritime agencies and to detect 
<br/>and disrupt illegal activities effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Issue of addressing fake recruitment companies in Fiji 
<br/></span><span>We  are  also  aware  of  the  recent  surge  in  fake  recruitment  companies  exploiting  the 
<br/>current labour shortage in Fiji to bring people into the country illegally.  To combat this, 
<br/>we have intensified our efforts to identify and shut down this problem of operations.   
<br/>We are working closely with international partners and local agencies to track and prosecute 
<br/>those who are responsible.  Additionally, we have launched public awareness campaigns to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>921 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>educate potential job seekers about the risk of fake recruitment schemes and to encourage 
<br/>them to verify the legitimacy of these recruitment agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, these initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once approved by Cabinet, will significantly bolster 
<br/>our  border  security,  ensuring  Fiji  is  well  prepared  to  address  both,  traditional  and  non-traditional 
<br/>security threats. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his answer to the 
<br/>question in which the scourge of drugs, et cetera, criminal activities and illegal border entries that we 
<br/>are actually speaking about currently, all have an impact on our major earning industry.  I have seen, 
<br/>as of this morning, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has ensured that a statement was given 
<br/>with respect to a New Zealand TV investigative series which has gone way off the radar with respect 
<br/>to making comments about Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, in the interest of all of us because this is something of concern to all of 
<br/>us, will you be issuing a statement? I understand they did interview you, actually condemning that 
<br/>particular report that has come out of New Zealand from a very mischievous reporter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for the supplementary question.   
<br/>I think there has been much talk about the Dreaver report, as well as the </span><span>60 Minutes</span><span> that came before 
<br/>them.    Let  me  say  that  I  appreciate  Ms.  Dreaver’s  reporting  that  brings  to  light  our  Fijian  drug 
<br/>situation, and this is not something that I am shying away from because this is speaking about the 
<br/>real issues that affect us.  However, I think that maybe in many places, some of the information that 
<br/>she has shared through that programme, are being particularly exaggerated.  On the same token, I 
<br/>think she may have also been misled by a lot of people in that particular report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to say though, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Fiji is a safe destination.  Our Government 
<br/>is secure, we have institutions that are in place that look after the security of not only Fijians, but also 
<br/>those who are visitors to our shores.  We have independent institutions that are in place that protect 
<br/>their rights, if they are here as our guests, as well as for our locals.  We also have systems that are in 
<br/>place that ensure that justice is served where it is needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  whilst  to  a  certain  extent,  I  am  very  concerned  about  some  of  the 
<br/>inaccuracies  in  the  statements  that  Barbara  Dreaver  had  stated,  I  appreciate  the  fact  that  she  has 
<br/>continued to raise this issue, something that we are working at, as a country, but let me assure Fiji 
<br/>and our people, as well as for those who would like to visit our shores, that it is safe to come here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- I thank the honourable Minister for that response. Drugs is the 
<br/>topic of the hour right now in Fiji, and they are saying about the zombie state and all the mess that is 
<br/>created by drugs.  My question is, do we have drug cartels or criminal organisations here in Fiji that 
<br/>control the promotion and distribution of narcotic drugs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for his supplementary question.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drug situation in Fiji, as we understand it, is controlled, not only by people who 
<br/>come from abroad and bring drugs here for the ones that come from abroad, there are also those who 
<br/></span><span>are involved in these operations in Fiji and this has been going on for a while, as I have earlier stated. 
<br/></span><span>We, as a government and as a whole nation, are doing our best at this stage with the resources that 
<br/>we have to curtail this, and bring these people to justice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  always  acknowledged  that  drug  is  a  social  problem.  The  responsibility  of  the 
<br/>curtailment of drugs is the responsibility of everyone.  When children take drugs, in the first instance,

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is their parents. We cannot blame anyone else for that.  Then there is the rest of the society, then 
<br/>the Government, the </span><span>lotu</span><span> the </span><span>vanua</span><span> - we are all responsible for this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is part of our responsibility that if you know people who deal with drugs in Fiji, then you 
<br/>must report them.  We cannot condone these actions if we do not report them.  We must report them, 
<br/>and the police must act on this.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, Cabinet will approve this week, the new 
<br/>Narcotic Drug Strategy, as well as the Narcotic Bureau, which gives special powers to Government 
<br/>to deal with this.  We must not have any mercy for these people - those who do this business, to kill 
<br/>our people and our children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I ask the public out there to, please, help every other member of this beautiful place and nation 
<br/>to help cure us of this problem that we have.  We must not condone anyone who deals with illicit 
<br/>drug activities.  That is not good for anyone in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Maybe, I did not hear you properly, honourable Minister, on the thrust of 
<br/>the question that was provided by honourable Naisa.  Are there cartels?  Was that the question you 
<br/>are raising?  Are they here in Fiji?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we know that people are dealing 
<br/>in drugs in groups, whether we call them cartels or not, it is another issue.  There are intelligence 
<br/>reports that suggest that there are groups of people who deal in this matter across the Fijian society 
<br/>and that is the proper word to use for them.  But I would like to assure you that these are the people 
<br/>who we need to bring to justice, and they are the ones who are controlling these operations here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is on the two areas that are being asked 
<br/>- the criminal activities and illegal border entries.  On criminal activities, honourable Minister, this 
<br/>is just the lack of presence of police in our towns and cities. One of the biggest deterrent is when 
<br/>people see police out there, and I ask if you can get the police to go out there and be present.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one on illegal entries which include both, personnel and contraband.  I think you 
<br/>talked about the illegal entry of personnel.  But for contraband, we know that ships are the high-risk 
<br/>carriers for contraband, compared to aircrafts because aircrafts cannot stop in mid-air and change 
<br/>cargo, but ships can.  Aircrafts are tracked from point A to point B, but ships are not.  Have you, for 
<br/>the time being, increased your port boarding and search operations where all the ships are coming in, 
<br/>local that you go in, board and search for illegal contraband?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, the question about police, I agree 
<br/>with you.  Police must step up its activities, and I think this is the point that we continually remind 
<br/>the police that their presence is essential to providing confidence to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will continue to resource the police to be able to do that.  I am looking forward 
<br/>to the appointment of the new Commissioner of Police, who, I hope, is going to make sure that they 
<br/>reset the directions for the police, including looking at the issue of their increased presence within 
<br/>our community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of ship boarding, Mr. Speaker, some weeks back, I opened the Ship Boarding School 
<br/></span><span>that is run by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Togalevu.  This is one of 
<br/>the areas where we will build our capacity on to be able to go out there and board the ships that we 
<br/>suspect.  Also, with the arrival of the new vessels, I am glad that the Republic of Fiji Navy Ship, 
<br/></span><span>RFNS Puamau</span><span>, added to the fleet, will be able to have a better maritime surveillance, better control 
<br/>and a better outlook out there in the sea, in our maritime zone, and also do boarding operations for

<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, with the high level of engagement that we have 
<br/>with our development partners, have we been able to secure more and more equipment, et cetera, at 
<br/>our border agencies, to ensure that they are not as porous as some may seem, and at the forefront, is 
<br/>obviously our airports?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  in  terms  of  immigration  and  the  systems  at  the 
<br/>border, I have spoken a little bit about some of the initiatives that we do.  But in terms of enhancing 
<br/>the  capabilities  that  we  have  at  the  border,  we  are  working,  in  particular,  with  the  Australian 
<br/>Immigration Department through the Ministry of Home Affairs, particularly in the different areas of 
<br/>capability  that  we  need  to  have  as  a  modern  airport  or  as  an  area,  or  capabilities  that  are  used 
<br/>throughout other airports in the world in terms of cameras, et cetera.  I could name the whole thing 
<br/>for you, but suffice to say right now, we are working with our partners, particularly the Australians, 
<br/>in the areas of Home Affairs to help us build security around the frontlines, especially at the airport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Thank you, honourable Minister for your answers. Knowing that a lot of 
<br/>illegal activities happen in the Bligh Water and at sea and we know that Maritime Safety Authority 
<br/>of  Fiji  (MSAF)  has  very  advanced  tools,  how  are  you  utilising  the  tools,  like  the  Automatic 
<br/>Identification System (AIS), to get the global positioning of the ships or yachts that enter our waters?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-    I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his  question.  That 
<br/>responsibility in terms of tracking yachts out there in the sea, is presently done by the Navy.  They 
<br/>actually have a great system out there which is the AIS, and I would encourage every Member to go 
<br/>down there.  You will see that they keep track, almost on real time, of the ships that are out there in 
<br/>the sea. This information is then shared with the rest of Government that deal in maritime security, 
<br/>including FRCS, FIMSA and Ministry of Fisheries. I would encourage every MP to go down there 
<br/>and take a look, at your own free time. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I have a follow up question. I thank  the International 
<br/>Maritime Organization, the former Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, that 
<br/>we were able to secure those machines that MSAF has.  It is an advanced system.  I remember that 
<br/>there was a dialogue between Police, Navy and MSAF, to collaborate and use the joint equipment so 
<br/>that they can identify the position of these yachts. Is it still in talks, honourable Minister, the AIS 
<br/>system that I am talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I think down at the Navy, they actually have this capability which 
<br/>literally looks at everything out there in the water. Then they use to coordinate the national effort to 
<br/>then go and look at it, also integrating air assets to go out and have a look. I am not quite familiar 
<br/>with that asset that is with MSAF, but I can tell you for sure that with the operations room down at 
<br/>the Navy, you can see every boat out there in the water. That is if they do not turn off their beacon, I 
<br/>think.  Of course, it is illegal, if you turn off your beacon. That was how we tracked the drugs that 
<br/>were caught in Lautoka. We started monitoring this ship when it left Mexico in South America.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- It is not only drugs but human trafficking too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  do  address  the  Chair.  You  are  making  a  running 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commentary with the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, we all know that these drugs have probably gone 
<br/>to another level now.  If we start talking about chemsex and bluetooth, how bad is that in the country

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right now, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I am always, not very emotional, but becomes very 
<br/>sentimental when it comes to drugs in this Parliament because there was a lot of discussions in the 
<br/>past revolving around this issue but I do not want to remain in the past. I am absolutely sure, Sir. I 
<br/>think the honourable Minister for Health has spoken very well about the issue of chemsex and also 
<br/>bluetooth. I am not an expert in that. I hear of stories when people gather and do these things - the 
<br/>young people who indulge in drugs and then go on and do these things at night.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As far as I am concerned, I think the previous explanations by the expert is adequate enough. 
<br/>I think the more important thing is that we must realise that our children are doing this and that we 
<br/>must try to do everything to stop it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister. We are talking about all the new systems that are foreign to us, that come with glitches and 
<br/>other issues. We have a system in our nation - </span><span>vanua, lotu</span><span> and the Government. Will the honourable 
<br/>Minister consider the role of faith-based organisations in creating social awareness and willing to 
<br/>support them in this cause? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the excellent 
<br/>question.  The </span><span>vanua</span><span> and the </span><span>lotu</span><span> are at the centre of the fight against drugs. We are talking to them 
<br/>we are dialoguing with them and one of the last major ones that we had was held in the Fiji National 
<br/>University last week.  I think I have even suggested to Government that Government must subsidise 
<br/>or it must fund the Church and the </span><span>Vanua’s</span><span> efforts to deal with drugs where it is appropriate because 
<br/>this is a problem, I have admitted in the past, cannot be dealt by Government alone.  So, we need the 
<br/>help of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> and we need the support of faith-based organisations and civil society organisations 
<br/>in the whole of our nation to deal with this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the question is concerned definitely, faith-based organisations,  </span><span>na 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua, na Lotu, ena vukea na cakacaka ‘qo.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in the same interview, there is this gentleman 
<br/>that is talking about the Pacific being used as a buffer zone between the target markets, Australia and 
<br/>New  Zealand,  which  is  basically  saying  that  these  people  have  intelligence  -  when  the  drugs  is 
<br/>coming and then allows it to come into the Pacific, we deal with it here, before it goes into those 
<br/>markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I know that the Forum is coming up. I agree with you that drugs cannot only be dealt with 
<br/>by Government, the </span><span>Vanua, Lotu</span><span>, but it has to be dealt with regionally also because it is trans-border. 
<br/>Perhaps, in the next Forum, the honourable Prime Minister is going to attend, where we can bring up 
<br/>this issue and tell these bigger countries, “Look, do not use us as a buffer zone.  Try and get the drug 
<br/>before it hits the Pacific.”  I think it is begging the honourable Prime Minister to take it up and we be 
<br/>a regional voice.  I see he is laughing, and I know he will take it up.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/></span><span>statement, and that is acknowledged.  I want to assure Parliament that our international partners are 
<br/></span><span>helping us in many ways to do this.  But for the problem that we have, I think we should take every 
<br/>possible opportunity to indulge and stick with our partners about how they can help us more for the 
<br/>problem that we currently face.  I thank you for that statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- All I want to add to the exchanges that have been going around is that, we 
<br/>even have this problem in my village in Taveuni - that far.  I have been hearing this global positioning

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thing that you attach with the yachts and the boats, but a big load of drugs ended up in Nadi.  It has 
<br/>come through that far to reach Nadi and imagine the ones that they sell in other places, like my village 
<br/>in Somosomo, Taveuni, they have all these are there.  How it got there, that baffles me.  We play our 
<br/>part in the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.  But what more could we do if we cannot even take the laws into our own hands?  
<br/>But we rely on the people that take care of the laws, but they keep pointing fingers.  The putting of 
<br/>food on the table has affected this, poverty, and then unemployment and then the whole works and 
<br/>you remember these are villagers.  That is all I want to add to this and, please, let us all join forces 
<br/>together in this one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to see that we work hand in hand on this and try and address this big problem that 
<br/>we are having now.  The statistics and the data that was provided in Parliament on schools by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education, that was quite surprising that this has reached our school children.  
<br/>They become, what has been termed by the honourable Minister for Women, mules or something.  
<br/>They are being pushed around and moving these drugs but I hope good sense will prevail here and 
<br/>we will join hands in this.  The country, as a whole, needs to tackle this big problem.

<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform  Parliament on the activities and 
<br/>findings of the External Review Committee appointed by the Higher Education Commission 
<br/>in November 2023 to assess Fiji’s Universities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question by the honourable 
<br/>Member,  the  preparatory  groundwork  has  been  completed  in  terms  of  the  work  of  the  External 
<br/>Review Committee and they are ready to start the consultation with universities, as mandated in the 
<br/>Higher Education Act 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister for Education 
<br/>is  in  regards  to  the  appointment  of  the  Review  Committee.    The  appointment  was  done  on  3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>November, 2023.  Does that appointment still stands or has it been revoked?  I have been reliably 
<br/>informed that the appointment has been revoked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- You have already answered your question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, he 
<br/>is already aware of the answer that will be coming from this end.  </span><span>Qo vaka e taro kila tale tiko mai.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According, to the statement that you have made in this Parliament on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023, 
<br/>the Higher Education Commission  took the initiative on and re-did the advertisement,  calling  for 
<br/>expression of interest, and they have made the appointment of the new External Review Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the honourable Minister for Education that 
<br/>I suggested to the honourable Minister to re-look at the composition of the Review Committee.  My 
<br/>question is, although the appointment lasted for a very short period of time, it must have come at a 
<br/></span><span>cost. What is the total cost incurred from that mistake? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a former HR Director of the Ministry of 
<br/>Education  who  is  asking  the  question.    He  is  aware  of  the  appointment  process  that  has  been 
<br/>undertaken.  The appointment that was done initially, there was no cost involved or incurred in terms 
<br/>of the External Review Committee that was appointed.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, now that 
<br/>you have got a new team or new set of Committee established, by when do you expect the report to 
<br/>be out?  We have already lost quite a bit of time in appointing committees rather than getting the 
<br/>committees to do their work.  By when do you expect the report to be out? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the Committee, as mandated in 
<br/>the Act, usually takes a cycle of five years to seven years.  The University of the South Pacific is the 
<br/>only University that was reviewed in 2019, so University of Fiji and Fiji National University have 
<br/>not  been  put  through  this  process  of  review.    The  concerns  that  have  been  raised  from  students, 
<br/>parents and guardians whom their students have attended these  Universities are many in terms of 
<br/>relevancy of the courses, duration of the courses, accessibility of the courses and the cost of attending 
<br/>the Universities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the fifth year that guarantees and is mandated to have this University 
<br/>come under review because the last one was in 2019.  They will be completing this review towards 
<br/>30</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024.  Because of the changes due to the concerns that were raised by the honourable 
<br/>Member, the initial deadline that was mentioned in this Parliament has been reviewed.  Now, it is 
<br/>30</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the replies to his 
<br/>questions.    If  I am  approached,  I may decide to do  the EOI because it is  more transparent.   My 
<br/>question is, what sort of advice was given to him earlier on that led to the appointment of the initial 
<br/>set of committee members without going through the transparent processes of the EOI?  What sort 
<br/>of advice was offered to him that led to the decision which was apparently a mistake?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I think that is a pretty difficult question to raise because you are asking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about what sort of advice was given, but I leave it to the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Sir,  as  I  have  earlier  advised,  the  appointment  was  done 
<br/>according  to  the  Higher  Education  Commission  as  per  the  decisions  of  the  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commissioners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Waste Management Operations 
<br/>(Question No. 93/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the Nasinu Town Council, taking ownership of their waste management operations from 
<br/>Suva Municipal Council?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Member for asking 
<br/>the question.  That is a very important question because I think this week, there were some issues, 
<br/>there were some comments made about garbage collection around Nasinu Town.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a brief background on the garbage collection services at Nasinu Town 
<br/></span><span>boundaries, in the past, there were a lot of issues regarding solid waste collection by the residents of 
<br/>Nasinu, as well as the ratepayers.  There was an initiative that started in 2020 where the Suva City 
<br/>Council came on board, there was an agreement signed between Suva City Council and Nasinu Town 
<br/>Council  for  the  Suva  City  Council  to  take  over  garbage  collection  services  around  Nasinu  Town 
<br/>areas.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, there were five garbage trucks, three open trucks and a backhoe which is still owned 
<br/>by  Nasinu  Town  Council  but  used  by  Suva  City  Council.   When  Suva City  Council  did  garbage 
<br/>collection and they engaged a total of 25 staff to assist them in their collection of solid waste around 
<br/>Nasinu Town areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, the Council to Council have come to an agreement that there is a need 
<br/>to  separate their services because the  initial  agreement is  now going  to  expire in  July  2024.  For 
<br/>August, 2024, it is expected that Nasinu Town Council will take over the collection of rubbish within 
<br/>its own Municipality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to  also  understand that Nasinu  is  a big  area.  Currently,  there is a total  of about 
<br/>11,252 rateable properties, as well as about 17 informal settlements, with 1,317 households.  So, in 
<br/>total, Nasinu Town Council has to service an area which has 12,569 properties and a population of 
<br/>around  65,000.    Within  the  Nasinu  Town  boundary,  there  are  seven  wards  and  iit  is  now  the 
<br/>responsibility of the Special Administrators.  I have faith in the Special Administrators who are going 
<br/>to take this on board and also come up with new strategies on improving the solid waste management 
<br/>services around Nasinu Town areas.  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wanted  to  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  a  supplementary  question;  you  are  talking  about  waste  collection,  can  you  clarify  waste 
<br/>collection in the different delegated boundaries, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, each Municipal Council within Fiji is 
<br/>responsible for collection and disposal of solid waste within their municipal boundaries, including 
<br/>peri-urban  as  well as  rural  areas.  The collection of waste in  delegated  areas is  subsidised by the 
<br/>Fijian Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this started in 2018, whereby all the 13 Municipal Councils were given the 
<br/>responsibility to collect kitchen waste from the extended boundaries, usually managed by the Rural 
<br/>Local  Authority.    For  the  current  financial  year,  $2.25  million  has  been  granted  to  support  those 
<br/>Municipal Councils that were not in a financial position to fully cover hard and green waste collection 
<br/>costs.  What is happening right now is Municipal Councils have extended their services to those areas 
<br/>like Nausori is now looking after Korovou, Lami is also now looking after Navua, Savusavu Town 
<br/>Council  is  now  looking  after  Nabouwalu  areas,  and  the  Government  is  going  to  continue  with 
<br/>subsiding  these  costs  to  ensure  that  we  collect  rubbish  from  all  these  areas  by  the  respective 
<br/>municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Who is looking after Lami, honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.-  Lami Town Council has now extended its services to Navua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is clearer now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  needs  to  be  clarified.    I  recall  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister making a statement and asking; whose idea was this to transfer the trucks to 
<br/></span><span>Suva City Council?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, shared services is very much legal within the law, and this was the first time 
<br/>we were trying to look at waste management as essential as water and electricity.  The idea was to 
<br/>form a waste management company, owned by these three Municipalities so that they can combine 
<br/>their resources together and provide a thorough and a better efficient services.  But, of course, the 
<br/>process started, unfortunately, we had COVID-19, and you know what all happened after that.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, that in the last Budget, there was 
<br/>a reduction of $1.5 million for the services to be provided to the rural areas.  How has that reduction 
<br/>affected the service collection? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reduction in the grant actually does not affect 
<br/>the services provided by Municipal Councils because if you look at bigger Councils like Suva and 
<br/>Lautoka, they have sufficient funds to support delegated areas.  It is the smaller Councils where the 
<br/>Government comes in and assist the provision of services, especially the garbage collection services, 
<br/>which is an essential service.  The medium and smaller Councils do not have the means or the income 
<br/>to support these services.  Currently, with the cut in budget, that reduction is only to cater for those 
<br/>medium to smaller Councils that do not have the financial means to manage these services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I just make this quicker announcement, honourable Members.  As a matter 
<br/>of housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders, with respect to sitting 
<br/>times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move the suspension motion.
