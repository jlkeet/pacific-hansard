<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Minister,  SDG  11  is  about 
<br/>sustainable  cities  and  communities  and  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  gave  us  a  long 
<br/>statement the other day about how Government is approaching the implementation of SDGs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additional to the SDGs, the Environmental Management Act also specifically has clauses on 
<br/>solid  waste  and  liquid  waste.  While  you  are  providing  details  about  how  solid  waste  are  being 
<br/>handled, there is a big problem that we face in our communities and, particularly, in our towns and 
<br/>cities on liquid waste.  My question is, how are you addressing this issue and, of course, how are you 
<br/>also, in collaboration with other stakeholders, looking at ways to address the concerns?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question raised by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition is a very valid one and it is something that the Ministry is currently considering. Waste 
<br/>disposal is really a big issue right now in Fiji, not only within the Municipalities, I think all over our 
<br/>country.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>929 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is currently reviewing the system that we have to ensure that we address all 
<br/>these areas.  We are even having consultations with the Department of Environment, as well as other 
<br/>stakeholders,  even  with  the  civil  society  organisations,  on  how  we  can  better  manage  this  issue 
<br/>because if you look at it, there is no central body or authority that manages the issue of the waste 
<br/>management in Fiji.  That is something that we are seriously considering and with Cabinet approval, 
<br/>it is something that we are also going to consider, to ensure that we take into consideration all the 
<br/>different types of waste - green waste, also waste from factories, including liquid waste, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  A  follow  up  question,  to  the  honourable  Minister,  Sir.    He  just 
<br/>mentioned that there are Municipalities and Councils that have money and, therefore, that money is 
<br/>used to provide that service in the rural areas.  My question to you is, why are you using ratepayers’ 
<br/>money to provide services in an area where households are not paying any rates to the Council?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Member for her 
<br/>question.    In  fact,  the  issue  of  these  bigger  Municipalities  subsiding  or  offering  services  to  the 
<br/>extended boundary is something that took place during the previous Government’s time. Even those 
<br/>are the questions that were  asked by ratepayers; why do we have to subsidise  or pay services for 
<br/>those who are not within our Municipalities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It was subsidised by the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- So that is something that we are also looking at now and we are 
<br/>also going to consider that, may be reviewing so that we transfer this back to Government to look 
<br/>after the provision of services or financing of services to areas that are outside the boundaries of these 
<br/>Municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreshore Development Lease Processes 
<br/>(Question No. 94/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources inform Parliament on 
<br/>the requirements and procedures used by the Ministry to issue 5-Year Foreshore Development 
<br/>leases? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I echo the sentiments of Parliament in 
<br/>congratulating Suva Grammar School for their 60 plus four years anniversary that they are going to 
<br/>be celebrating tomorrow.  Many years ago, I think, over two decades ago, I hunted down a lioness, 
<br/>so I am now part of the pride there, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  ladies  from  </span><span>Ruku  ni  veidakua</span><span>  are  also  in  yellow  today  and  they  acknowledge  the 
<br/>contribution of Suva Grammar to national life, but you will see that the RKS boys are also wearing 
<br/>their distinct tie.  You can see the yellow is part of it, they are also honouring Suva Grammar School’s 
<br/></span><span>60 plus four years of anniversary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to begin with, I would like to just probably highlight some of the developments 
<br/>that happen in our foreshores which necessitates the leases and licences that are issued to it. They 
<br/>include  tourism  businesses,  foreshore  development  lease,  jetties  when  it  becomes  necessary  to 
<br/>construct,  wet  leases  in  our  mangroves  and  marine  conservations,  for  example,  the  one  that  we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>930 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presently have in Naitauba Island and, of course, where there is a need to have filming consent, such 
<br/>as the shooting of the “Survivor” Series and “The Love Island”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  six  main  steps  in  the  process  of  applying  for  foreshore  lease  or  licence,  with  a 
<br/>meagre application fee of $30.  I think it is time to review that because of the extent of economic 
<br/>capital that is usually driven into these sorts of projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Step 1, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, of course, the acceptance and the vetting of the application and 
<br/>the  checklist.  I  am  sure  the  honourable  Kirpal  would  know  and  would  have  already  seen.    This 
<br/>information is readily available on the public portal of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Step 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, involves the consultation and consent of customary fishing rights 
<br/>owners.  This is a responsibility of the applicant to ensure that they go out and obtain the necessary 
<br/>waiver from those who enjoy the fishing rights over the foreshore that they have applied for.  The 
<br/>consent waiver of fishing rights is then checked against the records that is held by the iTaukei Land 
<br/>and Fisheries Commission, commonly known as the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua,</span><span> and once 60 percent of that is 
<br/>confirmed, then that particular step is satisfied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Step 3, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the applicant for this foreshore development is required to 
<br/>submit  a  determination  screening  of  Environment  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  for  the  development 
<br/>from the Department of Environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Step 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  the determination of compensation sum  for  loss of customary 
<br/>fishing rights.  This is the process where the Director of Lands requests the Director of Fisheries to 
<br/>provide a quotation on the total logistics and cost necessary for the team to conduct a fisheries survey 
<br/>and to compile a report, determining the quantum that might be due to the iTaukei Land and Fisheries 
<br/>Commission that has registered the customary fishing rights to the custodians.  That payment is made 
<br/>into a trust account once that step is completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Step 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon completion of all the Steps 1, 2,3, and 4, a submission is then 
<br/>made to the Minister for Lands, requesting approval for publication in the Gazette to publish a public 
<br/>notice as mandated under section 21(2) of the State Lands Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second publication in the government Gazette is followed by 30 days objection period 
<br/>where members of the public, and this provides the check and balance within the system, they are 
<br/>invited to submit objections to the Office of the Minister for Lands should they wish to do so.  At the 
<br/>end of the objection period, all objections are collated and submitted to my office, and that would 
<br/>also include the final brief from the Director of Lands and his team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Step 6, of course, is the decision-making step where the Minister, if he or she says that the 
<br/>development  would  infringe  more  on  public  rights  to  the  access  of  the  foreshore,  they  have  an 
<br/>opportunity to appeal against that decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the developers are unable to complete their 
<br/>development within that five year term because once they get a lease, then they seek finance from 
<br/></span><span>financial institutions.   My question to  the honourable Minister is, whether the  Lands  Department 
<br/></span><span>screen or check the financial status of a developer because most of the time we have seen that when 
<br/>the developer gets a lease, he then seeks loan from financial institutions?  The second question will 
<br/>be whether the foreshore development lease can be sold? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much.  He is already in breach 
<br/>of the Standing Orders.  He is asking two questions in one question.  He should know very well that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>931 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he is entitled only to one question. So, I will answer only the first one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We have just gone through Standing Orders review, that is why he is so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>informative now, and as a lawyer, he is telling you that you have breached Standing Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at times, these sorts of ambitious foreshore 
<br/>development does surpass the five years.  I have not had that experience and I am sure honourable 
<br/>Kirpal can ask the experience of the previous two Ministers of Lands, they have had experiences 
<br/>such as that, but I am sure that it does happen because there are some developments that do, of course, 
<br/>run past the five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, what I think is central to determining whether you should renew the development 
<br/>lease is to see how far the work has progressed.  If no work has progressed and if you look at the 
<br/>financial viability of the company or the developer and you are not satisfied that they can push the 
<br/>development  further,  then  of  course  the  Minister  has  every  right  not  to  renew  it.    But  if  there  is 
<br/>substantial  work  that  has  been  done  on  the  ground,  there  is  promises  in  the  completion  of  the 
<br/>development.  There is funds available, there are construction material that is also able to complete 
<br/>the work, then of course, it brings a huge economic benefit to the country and also to the locality.  
<br/>Those,  I  think,  are  the  ones  that  the  Minister  would  approve  to  have  an  extension  of  their 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in terms of foreshore leases, a lot of the times when 
<br/>Fisheries Impact Assessments are being done with respect to the compensation to the landowners or 
<br/>the owners of the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>at that particular time, the experience from before tells us that not always 
<br/>does the landowning unit accept the valuations, et cetera and the work that has been done by the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries, and they object to it.  My question is, do you have an alternative channel of 
<br/>people who do Fisheries Impact Assessments that can assist the Ministry of Lands, or is it strictly 
<br/>only the Ministry of Fisheries that does Fisheries Impact  Assessments?  Remember Sir, there are 
<br/>landowners that object to the Ministry of Fisheries doing it for reasons best known to themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only speak of my experience in the past 
<br/>17 months. It is only been with the Director of Fisheries and I have not had any experience where 
<br/></span><span>Qoliqoli </span><span>owners have not been satisfied with the quantum that have been levied by the Director of 
<br/>Fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I want to adjourn Parliament now and before doing so, I would like to thank 
<br/>the former students of Suva Grammar School for coming in numbers to today’s Sitting.  A big </span><span>vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu</span><span> to you.  I just can recall when the primary school was up here somewhere and the boarding 
<br/>school for boys was still operating from where we were told yesterday by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for iTaukei Affairs. That building is now going to be known as the Fiji Arts Gallery, is it honourable 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei Affairs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Sir, it is the Fiji Arts Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It was the old boarding school for boys, that was Grammar.  It is a history 
<br/></span><span>of the development of even Suva.  They are moving down to Veiuto, you still exist as a very well-
<br/></span><span>planned development, the roads, et cetera, and for you to come in and grace our Parliament, we are 
<br/>so blessed and so happy.  Once again, we wish you well in your celebration. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament is now adjourned for lunch, and we will resume when the bell is sounded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.42 p.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.35 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initiatives to Promote Economic Diversification 
<br/>(Question No. 95/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on what initiatives 
<br/>the Ministry is undertaking to promote economic diversification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the very good question 
<br/>raised  by  honourable  Tunabuna,  and  before  I  do  response,  I  was  in  a  deep  thought  when  I  was 
<br/>listening to the words of the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, on the discussion that happened 
<br/>with regards to a challenge that is in front of us.  The word I thought about was ‘boldness’.’   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With what is happening in our country, it requires is to be bold - bold in the effort to address 
<br/>the challenge of drugs, as well as in our endeavour to rebuild the architecture of the Fijian economy.  
<br/>Thus, hopefully,  my  answer today will shed some light  on where your Government  is  headed, in 
<br/>terms of its desire to diversify the economy in Fiji.  There are so many things to talk about, I will just 
<br/>pick on a few, hopefully, to give an idea to the honourable Members of this august Parliament and to 
<br/>the people of Fiji of where we are headed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  far  too  long,  talks  of  economic  diversification  have  existed,  without 
<br/>much action taken.  The Ministry which I lead has taken it upon itself to undertake concrete initiatives 
<br/>to  expand  and  diversify  our  Fijian  economy.    We  have  established  a  Commercial  Agriculture 
<br/>Taskforce to support the diversification and expansion, specifically, focusing on attractive investors 
<br/>into the agricultural sector and, hopefully, aquaculture as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, I led a delegation to the inaugural Fiji-North America Business Mission, which was 
<br/>held in Canada and the USA.  The delegation consisted of Government agencies, the private sector 
<br/>and some of our very own exporters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  that  Business  Mission,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Water  formerly  announced  that  they  are 
<br/>exploring commercial agricultural opportunities to Fiji.  They also have made an announcement in 
<br/>the papers over the last few days, and this had been made possible by the close collaboration between 
<br/>Fiji  Water,  the  Wonderful  Company,  the  Commercial  Agriculture  Taskforce  and  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, as they explore the revitalisation of agricultural commodities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>have  to  say  that  this  announcement  can  potentially  be  a  game  changer  for  Fiji  in  commercial 
<br/>agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the back of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can also advise that there is another investor seriously 
<br/>looking at commercial agriculture and they are currently based in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and are 
<br/>already in discussions with Fijian Holdings Limited and Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another thing that I thought I would share when talking about commercial agriculture, for 
<br/></span><span>those of you who may have noticed, just recently, FNPF and the Bank of the South Pacific (BSP) 
<br/>joined forces and are now joint shareholders in a company called Future Farms Pte Limited. That, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a signal to the rest of Fiji that two of our largest institutional investors are serious 
<br/>about commercial agriculture in Fiji. And for those of us who can remember, when FNPF decided to 
<br/>start investing in tourism, the results are also shown for us to see in what happened many moons ago. 
<br/>I think the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation will 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>933 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remember when that actually happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on, we are also genuinely working on building our kava industry 
<br/>through  the  established  Kava  Taskforce,  which  is  being  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
<br/>Waterways. It should come as no secret that the kava industry is anticipated to be a billion-dollar 
<br/>industry in the future. This was also confirmed by various actors in the kava sector in the United 
<br/>States,  whom  I  had  met  along  the  margins  of  the  recent  Fiji-North  American  Business  Mission.  
<br/>During the mission in California, we heard firsthand from kava importers, distributors and members 
<br/>of the different kava groups who promote and sell kava, the potential that exists in kava.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  kava  evolving  from  being  a  commercial  ceremonial  drink  to  the  development  of 
<br/>different  ways  to  drink  kava  and  have  niche  kava  products,  we  need  to  develop  and  strengthen 
<br/>standards, the legislative framework to protect our kava industry and strengthen the quality of kava 
<br/>exported from Fiji. We need to ensure the right legislative framework is in place, and which is why, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are pursuing the Kava Bill and hope this will move things forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from kava, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a bit of focus going on in noni, ginger, turmeric, 
<br/>mahogany, and fisheries potential, as part of our desire to diversify and, Sir, it will probably surprise 
<br/>you that the noni industry, globally, is about US$2 billion, and there is some more potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning  to  the  Nutraceutical  and  Traditional  Medicine  Industry,  with  the  rapid  growth  of 
<br/>globalisation, we need to be innovative with our approaches to generate new opportunities for our 
<br/>economy. To this end, we are also trying to further develop our nutraceutical and traditional medicine 
<br/>industry,  including  medicinal  cannabis.  We  are  leading  a  Cabinet-mandated  taskforce  which  is 
<br/>exploring  the  establishment  of  medicinal  cannabis  in  Fiji,  and  with  the  support  of  the  Australian 
<br/>Government, a feasibility study has been undertaken and I will be reporting back to Cabinet soon on 
<br/>the results and,  therefrom,  hopefully,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we can  start developing the legislation to 
<br/>actually start this industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms  of Information  and Communications Technology  (ICT), Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I have 
<br/>said quite a bit in the last few days of ICT, suffice to say that with the entry of </span><span>Google</span><span> and </span><span>Starlink</span><span>, 
<br/>we have a major potential  in  the  ICT  industry in  our country. At lunch, the honourable  Attorney 
<br/>General introduced me to a couple who are currently doing good work in Levuka and they are IT 
<br/>experts.  They have only but reaffirmed my expectation that there is massive potential for our country 
<br/>and for the Pacific for that matter, in the ICT.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just for some additional information, </span><span>Google</span><span> is going to invest about $200 million in Fiji to 
<br/>create its own data centre. This will create that pathway that we all expect, that will happen in the 
<br/>ICT sector.  Of course, as I have mentioned, education is key. The Government has already partnered 
<br/>with USP in trying to look at developing the ICT sector, and I hope to expand more on that in the 
<br/>near future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Industry is another of those industries that is 
<br/>starting  to  gain  momentum.  It  was  3,000  people  before  COVID,  it  is  now  at  around  about  8,000 
<br/>people, and these are some of the things that we are focussing on, Mr. Speaker, in trying to deliver a 
<br/></span><span>diversified Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, we are also focusing on trade agreements.  We have talked about and ratified the 
<br/>Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Agreement. We are in discussions on Pacific Agreement 
<br/>on  Closer  Economic  Relations  (PACER)  Plus  with  the  Australian  Government  and  also  closely 
<br/>looking at the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)  as 
<br/>well, Sir, in terms of what that can do for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Sir, there is a big commitment in the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) 
<br/>sector and cooperatives.  I feel that if we actually develop some of these sectors well, we will put the 
<br/>country in a very good footing in terms of economic diversification.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I also welcome the comments made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. He was 
<br/>keen to, sort of, see how he could get involved in terms of agriculture and also sugar, and I think, 
<br/>hopefully, with the brief time that I have had, I have shared with Parliament and honourable Members 
<br/>of this Chamber, some of the serious efforts that are going in, to ensure that our economy is genuinely 
<br/>diversified which will create jobs and get more taxes to be able to battle some of the challenges that 
<br/>we have, as mentioned by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Very quickly, honourable Minister, I think you have heard all of these 
<br/>before  but  your  neighbour  and  brother,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  will  support  this,  in  terms  of 
<br/>diversification, and I spoke about this morning.  One of the areas that Fiji could really benefit out of 
<br/>is sustainable aviation fuel.  I think it helps the sugar industry to get a better price for our sugar by 
<br/>producing  more  ethanol.  Is  this  an  area,  honourable  Minister,  that  you  will  be  concentrating  on 
<br/>heavily to ensure that we actually get into that particular space? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is interesting that you mentioned that, honourable Koya.  
<br/>Again, I have been reaching out to various consultants just to get some contacts on various industries.  
<br/>I met two gentlemen from well-known authorities in terms of sugar and what they said to me was, 
<br/>“A  sugar  industry  based  on  global  prices  alone  is  not  sustainable”.    So,  to  your  point  around 
<br/>developing  value-add  products,  such  as  ethanol,  to  be  able  to  assist  with  aviation  fuel  and  other 
<br/>products, or other value-added potential, is worthwhile pursued, we certainly support it and we will 
<br/>actually try and do our best to work with the honourable Minister for Sugar to see what can be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The consultants also did tell me that in some parts of the world, sugar is looked at as an energy 
<br/>source, not as a sweetener of food. When you think about it that way, you do understand that there is 
<br/>a lot of other potentials in the sugar industry, and we are certainly going to ensure that, that is pursued 
<br/>as well, as part of the economic diversification strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A quick follow-up, Mr. Speaker, if I may, in view of what you have just 
<br/>said and in view of what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation and I witnessed, the European Union (EU) has entirely backed Africa with respect to this, 
<br/>and they forgot about the rest of the Pacific. So, will we be engaging with our development partners 
<br/>to seek assistance that can put us in this space quicker and sooner than we anticipated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I did mention it in  terms of the Trade Agreements, that we 
<br/>are seriously looking at signing up to the interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU and 
<br/>I think once that is signed, it will make some of the conversations around sustainable aviation fuel a 
<br/>lot more easier from our development partners’ side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope to bring to Cabinet very soon the justification around why we should join  ASEAN 
<br/>Inter-Parliamentary  Assembly  (AIPA)  and  as  you  know,  Sir,  even  in  terms  of  PAFCO,  it  is 
<br/>uneconomical for them to export to the EU because of the 35 percent tariff that is currently imposed 
<br/></span><span>because we are not a signatory to AIPA. Once we unlock AIPA, I feel that some of the things that 
<br/></span><span>you have mentioned will be very doable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- There being no further supplementary questions.  That takes care of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Oral Questions and now we go into Written Questions.
