<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and those watching proceedings on the 
<br/>television  and  the  internet.  As  usual,  thank  you  for  your  continued  interest  in  the  proceedings  of 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hibiscus Festival Contestants 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in extending a warm welcome to the 2024 Hibiscus 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Festival Contestants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What a beautiful group of Contestants we have here, excluding honourable Ketal Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  really  for  a  change,  this  needs  to  kind  of  spruce  up  this  august 
<br/></span><span>Parliament by the presence of the Contestants here. This is just an effort, hopefully, you will agree, 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Members,  on  our  part  as  Parliamentarians  to  be  part  of  this  beautiful  occasion  in  the 
<br/>capital of Fiji in honouring the Contestants, since they have also raised a few social issues among 
<br/>themselves in their interviews.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, they can come and mingle amongst you, honourable Members, and see how best 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you can raise your question on a one-to-one basis with the honourable Members of Parliament.  I

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>must say, on behalf of the honourable Members of Parliament, that we are also pleased to be part of 
<br/>this occasion since it has been quite a while after almost five years, then we have had this revival in 
<br/>the festivity again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ladies, I hope that your experience here today will not only educate you, young ladies, but 
<br/>also raise your awareness on the Parliament institution, to aspire to, as well as to encourage more 
<br/>women representation and participation in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am delighted to learn that in the course of your engagement with the media, business houses 
<br/>and the general public, you are amplifying the very issues that are pertinent in today’s society.  For 
<br/>that, I congratulate you all and, at the same time, encourage you to continue to engage in opportunities 
<br/>involving  participation  at  the  decision-making  level  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  becoming  change 
<br/>makers of your communities.  I also welcome Mr. Ravai, who is sitting amongst you, and who has 
<br/>been in the lead role right throughout this Festival.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the final stretch only one will be crowned as Miss Hibiscus after this week’s 
<br/>sitting, dear ladies.  And to the rest, remember this is not the end, you just need to keep pressing 
<br/>forward, because there are other roles that you will have to play to be part of the rebuilding of our 
<br/>society, especially in our communities all the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, I warmly welcome you all to Parliament and I wish you our very best 
<br/>for the remainder of this week’s programme and for that you will be engaged in right towards the 
<br/>end of the hectic week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to Office Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of the honourable Members, the Back to Office Report for the study visit 
<br/>that was undertaken at the Parliament of Victoria by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee and the Standing  Committee on Economic Affairs is  now available in  the Library for 
<br/>your perusal and reference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, it is just the timing of the reports coming in.  It is so quick to take the 
<br/>tour, but Reports need to be submitted on time as well, to ensure that the rest of the Members of 
<br/>Parliament are kept well abreast of what transpired during the tour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will proceed to the next item, honourable Members, and there will be four Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports tabled today. 
<br/></span></div>
