<div><span>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  purpose  of  Section  145(1)  of  the 
<br/>Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament approves: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  increase  in  Government  guarantee  limit  for  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  Limited 
<br/>(FSC) borrowings of $95 million for the period 1st August, 2022 to 31st May, 2028 
<br/>(Guarantee Period), by $105 million to $200 million; and  
<br/>that the FSC be exempted from paying the guarantee fee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not need to go into the background of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FSC. It is a sugar milling company… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Tell us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.-  …by  an  Act  of  Parliament  in  1972  and  the  rest  is  history.  
<br/>Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, had been guaranteeing FSC’s domestic and offshore borrowings in 
<br/>the past.  The most recent domestic guarantee cover was approved by Parliament on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024, 
<br/>whereby Parliament approved an additional Government  guarantee to  FSC of $95 million  for the 
<br/>guarantee period 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2028.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of to-date, FSC has fully exhausted the approved Government guarantee limit.  On the 
<br/>other hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government also guaranteed FSC’s offshore borrowings which was 
<br/>approved on 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2017 whereby Parliament approved the extension of the Government 
<br/>guarantee period for the Exim Bank and Bank of India loan of US$50.4 million from 19</span><span>th</span><span> September, 
<br/>2019 to  31</span><span>st</span><span>  December,  2028.  Both  the Parliamentary  approvals  exempted FSC from paying  the 
<br/>guarantee fee.  For this guaranteed financing, the FSC has started with its repayment from August 
<br/>2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC as we all know has been operating at less than 50 percent of the 3.5 
<br/>million  tonnes of crop that the Ministry of Sugar has directed  for inclusion in  the Strategic Plan.  
<br/></span><span>Despite a concerted effort, the honourable Minister for Sugar has a number of times in this Parliament 
<br/></span><span>explained  some  of  the  difficulties  within  the  FSC,  the  company’s  operation  and  how  it  has  been 
<br/>affected, factors attributed to structural and operational issues ranging from spate of natural disasters, 
<br/>volatility in the world sugar price, milling inefficiencies, resulting also from the failed mill upgrade 
<br/>in  the  past,  deteriorating  cane  quality,  et  cetera  that  has  affected  not  only  production,  but  the 
<br/>performance of the FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cane production for the last 14 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the trend from 2010 to 
<br/>2023, it has not picked up.  It has fluctuated within a particular range of 1.6, 1.7 to 1.3.  As of May 
<br/></span><span>2023, FSC’s total operating cost is $60.6 million of which approximately 44 percent ($26.7 million) 
<br/></span><span>is disbursed as salaries and wages.  There was an increase of about 8 percent when compared to $56 
<br/>million  as  total  expanding  cost  in  the  2022  Financial  Year,  an  increase  mainly  attributed  to  an 
<br/>increase  in  minimum  wage  rate,  rise  in  the  fuel  price,  post  COVID-19  recovery  and  impact  of 
<br/>significant loss of skilled employees. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1853 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FSC anticipates right-sizing the business and creating an environment for a skilled and 
<br/>competent workforce that will take the business forward.  Sir, FSC also has continuously incurred 
<br/>net losses for the past 10 years.  If you look at figures from 2014 from $6.9 million loss to $31.7 
<br/>million in 2015, $53 million in 2016, $45 million in 2017, $80 million in 2019, $44 million in 2022 
<br/>and $23 million in 2023.  As of 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, FSC incurred a net loss of $23 million compared to $44.3 
<br/>million net loss for the 2022 Financial Year. The total liabilities for FSC has also been increasing. Its 
<br/>liabilities  has  exceeded  its  total  asset  base  for  the  last  10  years,  technically  meaning  it  has  been 
<br/>insolvent during this period and again, the figures are there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2024 Financial Year which is 2023 cane season, FSC anticipates better results with 
<br/>cane production of 1.56 million tonnes and sugar make up of about 139,628 tonnes.  Hence $238.8 
<br/>million in total revenue is expected from sugar proceeds in molasses for the financial year; the highest 
<br/>in  the  last  14  years.    The  earnings  before  interest  tax  depreciation  and  amortisation  for  the  2024 
<br/>Financial Year is likely to be positive $25 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  world  sugar  price  as  we  all  know  has  moved  into  FSC’s  favour,  currently  hovering 
<br/>around US$0.20 cents per pound compared to below US$0.40 cents per pound some two years back 
<br/>at the time of pricing; an increase of 43 percent.  The price had increased to over US$0.25 cents per 
<br/>pound last year and is projected to stay close to US$0.20 cents per pound.  The trend at the world 
<br/>market, looking at sugar production and the alternatives, they are being produced by many countries 
<br/>could  see  the  price  go  further  except  for  natural  disaster,  it  is  expected  at  the  key  performance 
<br/>parameters for the next five years as indicated will be achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  outstanding  liabilities  for  outstanding  borrowings  guaranteed  by 
<br/>Government stood at $293 million, of which, $216.7 million is covered by domestic Government 
<br/>guarantee and $76.3 million, which amounts US$32.7 million is covered by offshore Government 
<br/>guarantee.  I do not want to get into the details of the respective outstanding balances that I have.  
<br/>The total Government guaranteed debt stood at $1 billion or 7.7 percent of GDP at the end of July 
<br/>2024.  With FSC accessing this additional guaranteed borrowing will increase the total Government 
<br/>guarantee exposure to $1.1 billion or 7.9 percent of GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given FSC’s financial status, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is already exposed to $293 
<br/>million of guaranteed debts both domestic and offshore, which brings FSC’s debt stock as at 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>July, 2024 to $293 million.  In the event of a default, which is normal for Government guarantee, the 
<br/>Government will be liable for the guaranteed borrowings of the FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  working  with  FSC,  and  I  am  sure  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister will talk about the FAO study that is being done, the honourable Assistant Minister in the 
<br/>Office of the Prime Minister is leading that.  We want to ensure that we work with FSC and manage 
<br/>any fiscal risks, and if there are, that they are communicated to Government in a timely manner so 
<br/>that  we  are  able  to  put  in  plans  to  mitigate  any  of  those  fiscal  risks  that  may  arise  from  the 
<br/>Government guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for that, I have a list with me.  The batting order is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S.T. Koroilavesau; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Sugar Industry and Multi-Ethnic; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay;

<div><span>Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  Cooperatives, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable K. Lal; and  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to make a short 
<br/>contribution to the guarantee that has been mooted by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance in support of FSC. The FSC and the provision of guarantee to its loans is not a 
<br/>new thing.  It has been ongoing for some time since the withdrawal of the preferential prices during 
<br/>the friendship that we had with the European Union, and that has continued.  There are issues that 
<br/>need to be dealt with.  The honourable Minister for Finance has indicated about trying to relook at 
<br/>how we deal with FSC and try and assist.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  has  to  be 
<br/>congratulated in the direction that he had taken in asking FAO to come and assist. I think overall, 
<br/>that will give a different perspective from an outside organisation looking into. We have been dealing 
<br/>with these outstanding issues for a very long time.  There are issues that have been there since we 
<br/>took over from Colonial Sugar Refinery (CRS). I think without identifying those issues and dealing 
<br/>with them, it will be an exercise in futility. I just wanted to highlight some issues that I think we need 
<br/>to  consider,  and  I  think  Parliament  can  look  at  and  see  how  we  improve  going  forward.    It  is 
<br/>apparently not a good advice for us to try and support the guarantee without discussing the issues 
<br/>that surround FSC and the production of sugar in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Finance, FSC is basically insolvent and without the Government guarantees, the Corporation will be 
<br/>unable to continue to operate; cane production is slow, inconsistency of cane supply and decline of 
<br/>cane quality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues that has been raised when I was a member of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs was the non-existence of KPIs in all the agencies that support FSC. That needs to 
<br/>be looked at. There should be guidance of their performance and what they need to be able to achieve 
<br/>at the end of a financial year. That gives them a challenge to try and produce that at the end of the 
<br/>year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that there is  a lot of territorial  hold  by the sugar stakeholders.  There is  a lot of 
<br/>differences and a lot of agencies are working in silos, they are not working together.  I think that is 
<br/></span><span>the challenge for the honourable Minister for Sugar to try and coordinate, make sure that they work 
<br/></span><span>together. Most of these are agencies within the sugar industry.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had a suggestion that I think the honourable Speaker, Sir, is very well aware that we had 
<br/>suggested a Special Committee be appointed after FAO had done its review on the sugar industry as 
<br/>a whole. Again, I am pleading with you that we work with the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/>Affairs to select a special committee to look at all these intricacies that can improve sugar production 
<br/>and the sugar industry as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FSC needs to work closely, I certainly believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need just to grab the 
<br/></span><span>bull by the horns and actually direct it. The issues that I have suggested, there are a lot of landowners 
<br/>in Fiji that can be involved in the production of cane. They have the land. I urge the Government to 
<br/>put a system that can allow these landowners, especially in the Western and Northern Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had visited these areas, these land masses are available.  It just needs Government assistance 
<br/>for the landowners and in actual fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the small farmers can become work they have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1855 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>labourers and work this big cane estate because they have the experience, the landowners have the 
<br/>land and all they need to do is work together to lift the volume of cane that can be produced. Without 
<br/>talking about ethanol, which is a secondary product of sugar, there is an urgent need just to lift the 
<br/>amount of cane that is produced and supplied to the mills.  Without that, it is very difficult to go 
<br/>through the system and make sure that FSC is commercially viable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before the House is basically asking us to provide the guarantee 
<br/>and increase it to $200 million.  The Government is arguing that the funds are necessary to keep FSC 
<br/>afloat.  There is no doubt, if we do not support the motion before the House, then it is difficult for 
<br/>FSC to continue.  It is a catch- 22 scenario here - we do not do it, we are dead; we need to go ahead 
<br/>and do it, to keep FSC going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  situation  is  further  compounded  by  the  steady  decline  in  the  number  of  sugarcane 
<br/>farmers.  Farmers have consistently dropped with the production year after year.  Even if FSC were 
<br/>to make some operational improvements now, the question remains, where will the sugarcane come 
<br/>from to sustain its operations?  We need to increase cane production.  Additionally, the high cost 
<br/>associated with farming, milling, the timely renewal of land leases and persistent labour shortages in 
<br/>cane carting only adds to the challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We seriously need to look at bringing in labour from other countries like Bangladesh to keep 
<br/>this  industry  afloat.    Without  a  comprehensive  strategy,  that  include  performance  benchmark, 
<br/>modernisation efforts, the proposed increase in borrowing guarantees could very well lead to further 
<br/>financial disaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the survival of the sugar industry is crucial for our economy, simply 
<br/>throwing more money at FSC is not a solution. The government must demand accountability from 
<br/>FSC’s management, implant a clear plan operational improvements and address the broader issues 
<br/>affecting the sugar industry.  Whilst these measures the increased borrowing guarantee risk becoming 
<br/>yet another failed attempt to rescue the company and is increasingly seen as beyond sale, we must 
<br/>act  with  prudence  and  responsibility,  ensuring  that  our  decisions  today  do  not  lead  to  greater 
<br/>problems for our nation tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament with reservations as I need the issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that has been highlighted in the House to be addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning  the honourable Prime Minister asked me 
<br/></span><span>with my other colleagues, “are we milking the wrong cow?  Does the cow have sufficient milk?”  I 
<br/></span><span>said, “the cow can produce milk but we have the wrong people milking it.”  In the What happened, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you look at the decline of the sugar industry from 2006 when your party was there, 
<br/>what I am saying, the blame should not be put on us.  What I am saying Mr. Speaker, Sir, the blame 
<br/>should not be put on us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- We are here trying to take up and improve, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You do nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CJ. SINGH.- Now, there is another story to this. A farmer had a very scheming cow 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grazing next to the roadside and what happened… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- ….this cow was grazing by the very dry grass. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>1856 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Irrelevant! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- So, what the farmer did, was the cow did not eat the grass as it was so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dry. The farmer put green sunglasses on the because then the cow started seeing green grass. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- That is what I am saying. You guys are putting on the wrong sunglasses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at the wrong time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- So, what I am saying, the key area is to bring the sugar industry back, to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bring FSC back on track. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Therefore, I rise to support this crucial motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>foundation of this motion lies in our steadfast belief that the sugar…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Huh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Come on, go outside! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the foundation of this motion lies in our steadfast belief 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the sugar industry is moving steadily towards a stable and sustainable future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO.F.Q TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- This belief is grounded in a tangible progress we have seen within the 
<br/>industry in the recent months. Firstly, the Government has continued to bolster its support for the 
<br/>sugar industry. We have not only continued the programme initiated in 2023-2024 fiscal year, but 
<br/>we are also actively identifying areas where further funding is essential to ensure the industries long 
<br/>term viability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Wasting money! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- This productive approach, reflects our commitment to securing the future 
<br/>of the sugar industry. Secondly, we have made significant strides in resolving the loans and issues 
<br/>surrounding land leases. By maintaining and spending the subsidies on premium payments, we are 
<br/>ensuring  that  the  land  remains  accessible  for  cane  farming.  This  initiative  has  been  crucial  in 
<br/>introducing  the  financial  burdens  on  our  farmers  and  securing  their  long  term  commitments  to 
<br/>sugarcane cultivation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  our  focus  on  attracting  young  farmers  into  the  sugar  industry  and  promoting 
<br/>minimisation  continues  to  bear  fruit.  The  integration  of  water  agriculture  technologies  and 
<br/>engagement of our next generation of farmers are vital to building a resilient and future proof sugar 
<br/>industry. This  efforts are not  only  ensuring continuity, but  also  driving innovation and efficiency 
<br/>within the sector.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1857 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, we have reached a historical milestone with the 2023 crop, being the highest in 
<br/>payment recorded $101.08 per tonne. To the fifth payment, still from next month. This achievement 
<br/>is  a  that  our  dedication  to  ensuring  the  farmers  receive  a  full  compensation  for  their  hard  work, 
<br/>whereby securing their financial well-being and loyalty to the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress we have made is undeniable and the path to recovery is clear. 
<br/>However,  to  ensure  that  this  positive  momentum  is  sustained,  the  approval  of  this  motion  is 
<br/>imperative in increasing the Government guarantees for FSC borrowing and exempting FSC from 
<br/>guarantee fees and our measures that will provide financial stability, confidence with that to support 
<br/>the Corporation as commitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Furthermore, this motion is not only a response to immediate financial 
<br/>needs of FSC but it is a strategic investment for the long term viability of the sugar industry. By 
<br/>providing FSC with the necessary backing, we are ensuring the cooperation can continue to support 
<br/>our farmers modernising operations and contributing to the broader economic recovery of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q TUISAWAU.- Modernisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- In conclusion, I urge all Members of this esteemed Parliament to support 
<br/>this motion and reward a financial instrument. It is a corner stone of a broader strategy to rejuvenate 
<br/>and sustain the sugar industry which remains a vital part of our economy and the livelihood of Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Now listen! Next week, I have been tasked to negotiate with Wilmar, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you know what is Wilmar? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Google it!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Wilmar is the biggest sugar producer in Australia. Yes! Google it! They 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wanted to come into strategic partnership with FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- And then? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- And then? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What happened? You have been made a laughingstock, because we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trying to do something better that you could not do! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You did nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen, you are a small kid.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, so we are trying our best and here, people sitting on 
<br/>the other side have done nothing for the last 17 years are trying to attack us. With these words, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q TUISAWAU.- Stop wearing green sunglasses! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of 30</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024, FSC’s outstanding borrowings guaranteed by Government stood at 
<br/>$276.2  million  of  which  $200.2  million  is  covered  by  domestic  Government  guarantee  and  $76 
<br/>million is covered by offshore Government guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  all  understand  that  in  the  event  of  a  default,  the  Government  will  be  liable  for  the 
<br/>guarantee borrowings of FSC.  Earlier on, it was indicated that gradually the Coalition Government 
<br/>will reduce the guarantee amount as FSC improves its services, however, this is nowhere to be seen 
<br/>as it has increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development  and  Statistics,  had  stated  that  the  Government  will  work  with  FSC  to  monitor  the 
<br/>restructuring efforts of the Board and Management of FSC to ensure any fiscal risks are properly 
<br/>communicated and mitigated to the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do support this Government guarantee, as this will assist the farmers and 
<br/>FSC,  so  that  production  is  increased  and  the  sugar  industry  remains  afloat.  Having  said  that,  the 
<br/>expectation  is  that  all  stakeholders  must  work  in  tandem,  so  that  the  overall  objectives  of  the 
<br/>organisation in this case, FSC is achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  this  remains  to  be  seen.  For  instance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  currently  we  are 
<br/>experiencing a prolonged period of drought in the West which we have discussed earlier on, which 
<br/>translates into low tonnage of cane and overall production of the farmers have dropped close to 40 
<br/>percent. So, they have lost about to 50 to 60 percent of their production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am being informed, and since I am a farmer also, no assessment has been 
<br/>carried out by the FSC or the Sugar Ministry. As I said earlier on, so far, on this drought and how it 
<br/>intends to assist or compensate the farmers who have lost considerable income as a direct result of 
<br/>this drought.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- So far there has not been any word by the honourable Minister for Sugar, 
<br/>on how he intends to mitigate this.  Many farmers have contacted me, and I have personally visited 
<br/>the farmers  and they have all echoed the same sentiments that there is  a huge loss of production 
<br/>which means very less income for the families. Less income means that for the next season, farmers 
<br/>will find it harder to produce and harvest their cane as production cost will definitely increase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Farmers will be forced to borrow or invest more to ease this. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, another stakeholder in cane production and milling, are the hard working FSC workers who toil 
<br/>day in and day out to keep the mills running and also ensuring that harvested cane reach the mill on 
<br/>time. Recently, during the last Parliament session, the honourable Minister for Sugar belittled the 
<br/>FSC staff saying that instead of supporting farmers, FSC staff are consuming kava and chicken curry

<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- He said and I quote, Mr. Speaker, Sir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“They would go around in their vans, have grog, have chicken curry and then will be back, 
<br/>unlike in the previous years, the farm advisors and the field officers used to go out to farmers 
<br/>to teach and support them” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, this is very sickening. Especially if this is coming from the Minister for Sugar, </span><span>
<br/></span><span>who is supposed to lead them and guide them. FSC staff are hardworking especially field officers, 
<br/>farm  advisors,  sector  clerks,  research  personnel  and  so  on.  They  have  continued  to  support  the 
<br/>farmers over the  years and have even  gone extra miles to  assist  the  farmers, and here  we have  a 
<br/>Minister who is very good at putting the blame on these FSC staff for the misery and the failure of 
<br/>FSC or maybe to divert attention from his own failures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a common practice in the sugar cane farming community, that after 
<br/>successful harvesting season, farmers and FSC staff have a small gathering to celebrate the success 
<br/>of the harvesting season, which I find it very encouraging as this builds a better relationship between 
<br/>the farmers and FSC staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is the use of guaranteeing this loan if the persistent issue of the mill 
<br/>breakdown  is  not  addressed.  Year  in  and  year  out,  we  have  the  same  recurring  problem  of  mill 
<br/>breakdown, which delays harvesting. This, in turn creates frustration and loss of income amongst 
<br/>farmers, lorry drivers and cane cutters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- All year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Also, farmers’ families suffer in silence as harvesting gangs will need 
<br/>additional  food  and  supplies.  So  far,  the  Ministry  has  not  been  able  to  mitigate  the  frequent  mill 
<br/>breakdowns and if this persists during rainy days, which is about to approach, will be an extra burden 
<br/></span><span>to the farmers as trucks will be bogged down in the field, and they will have no choice but to pay 
<br/></span><span>extra costs to hire tractors and heavy machines to pull the bogged truck load of cane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the downward trend in cane production and poor performance of the 
<br/>current mills and change of mind from the honourable Minister for Sugar to install a second hand 
<br/>mill, instead of a brand new mill as promised earlier.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  I  bet  my  last  dollar  that  the  same  problem  will  occur,  which  is  mill 
<br/></span><span>frequent  breakdowns.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  we  support  this  motion  before  Parliament  on 
<br/>Government  guarantee.  I  strongly  urge  the  Parliament  to  appoint  a  joint  Parliamentary  Select 
<br/>Committee, to thoroughly look into the state of affairs of the Sugar Industry, its poor performance 
<br/>and how we can find ways and means to mitigate the challenges once and for all, so that there is 
<br/>improved  mill  performance  and  farmers  are  assisted  and  rewarded.    This  will  bring  back  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confidence in farmers and those that have withdrawn from sugar cane farming can see a glimmer of 
<br/>hope and return to farming. With these words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak very 
<br/>briefly on this very important motion.  I thought I would just start by saying when the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Sugar, the started talking about the bulls or cows. I was wondering whether he was going 
<br/>to end up talking about the two tonne bulls that the honourable Minister for Agriculture tends to talk 
<br/>about now and again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But Mr. Speaker, this motion is very significant and I think it is good that it has come to the 
<br/>floor again this time around, because it talks to one of the issues that has been least talked about 
<br/>probably,  but  it is one of the things that  this country and this  Government  will solve, and it will 
<br/>address one of the elephants in the room that has been talked about for some time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the other side of Parliament now admits that there is a problem 
<br/>in sugar. I used to look at the reports that the Committees that were looking into Sugar. I used to look 
<br/>at their reports when I was outside Parliament, and there was never ever and admittance that there 
<br/>was a serious problem with sugar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Now, never ever! I challenge them to show me one of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reports that says that there is a serious problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The second thing that I would like to say, you did nothing! 
<br/>Let us repeat it, you did nothing! The other thing I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I will 
<br/>leave some expressions in Tailevu, </span><span>su raice ga su kila</span><span>.  When you see it, you know! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sustained losses insolvency, production 
<br/>is down, yields are down, equipment is antiquated, obsolete, labour issues, no R&amp;B, not really any 
<br/></span><span>value-add in the sugar industry. These are the fundamental problems that that side of the house did 
<br/></span><span>nothing about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-But I am so thankful, that this is now a desire to fix the issues. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would just like to assure that side of Parliament and the people 
<br/>of Fiji listening in at this late hour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- How about those two? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Ultimately!  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  comes  down  to  political 
<br/>will. Which Government has the political will to face up to the challenge and do something about it.

<div><span>And to all of Fiji listening today. The People’s coalition has the will and we will fix this once and for 
<br/>all.  Not for us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but for the future generation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- And they failed to do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, on behalf 
<br/>of this side of Parliament,  we wholeheartedly  support the bill.  We are putting  in  place, measures 
<br/>initiated by the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister. There is also a 
<br/>study into the FSC, that will actually ensure that we do come to this Parliament, the Government, the 
<br/>people of Fiji wants solutions, and there is only one Government that we can say in the last 20 years, 
<br/>is  going  to  offer  solutions  to  the  people  of  Fiji.  On  that  brief  note,  I  support  this  motion, 
<br/>wholeheartedly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to speak on an issue that is close to the heart 
<br/>of many Fijians. The state of our sugar industry. The honourable Minister for Sugar has recently 
<br/>provided reasons for the disappointing performance of this industry. He has pointed to the ongoing 
<br/>dry spell as a reason for the downgrade in our sugar production estimate from 1.8 million tonnes to 
<br/>now somewhere between 1.6 to 1.7 million tonnes. But, Mr. Speaker Sir, the FSC itself has forecasted 
<br/>even lower figures between 1.2 and 1.4 million tonnes. This raises a crucial question, why is there 
<br/>such a difference between what the Minister is saying and what the FSC is forecasting? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  while  I  understand  that  weather  conditions  like  drought  are  beyond  our 
<br/>control, the fact remains the Minister cannot use this as an excuse to explain away all the problems. 
<br/>The sugar industry has faced many challenges over the years. Challenges that go beyond just the 
<br/>weather, what we need from the industry, or the Minister is a clear plan, to deal with these challenges 
<br/>and not just excuses when things go wrong. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for farmers every year is a fight for 
<br/>survival. It is deeply concerning that instead of solutions, the Minister is resulted to blaming our hard 
<br/>working men and women in the sugar industry, referring them as muck-a-round workers… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- …this is not only disrespectful but also damaging to the morale of every 
<br/>person who are the backbone of this industry, and also recently has been criticising the field officers, 
<br/>blaming them of drinking kava and having chicken curry at the farmers house. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if 
<br/>the Minister is  serious about  improving the industry, he should be lifting up the workers and not 
<br/>tearing them down. The success of the sugar industry depends not just on structure, but on the morale 
<br/></span><span>and motivation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Listen, please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He explained that the honourable Minister is  undermining the workers.   In fact,  he is  just 
<br/>pointing out some of the practices within FSC, which contributes to inefficiency, but he has turned 
<br/>that out that he is campaigning against the workers.  So, stop imputing improper motives in terms of 
<br/>what he has raised.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue, honourable Ketan Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when workers feel valued and supported, they are more 
<br/>likely to be productive and committed and serve FSC with their whole heart.  Now, let us talk about 
<br/>the broader issue affecting the industry.  The lack of effective fiscal policies which is putting more 
<br/>pressure  on  farmers  who  are  already  struggling  with  low  yield  and  high  cost.    The  Government 
<br/>promised to deliver a more efficient and less dependent sugar industry, but so far, we have seen very 
<br/>little action.  Where are the measures to improve yearly outputs?  What is being done to address the 
<br/>issues of the unsecured land leases?  What about the decline in tonnage in production and labour 
<br/>issues faced by our farmers?  These are the real challenges that need to be addressed not just the 
<br/>weather.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the elections, grand promises were made to fix the sugar industry.  
<br/>They  talked  about  bringing  new  technologies  (and  still  they  are  bringing  in  new  technologies), 
<br/>improved milling system and supporting our farmers, but here we are with production estimates going 
<br/>down and down and down and no real solutions in sight.  May I ask, who is accountable for this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- You. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FSC has said that over 200,000 Fijians are associated 
<br/>and dependent on the sugar industry.  The lack of fiscal planning is evident, and the fact that it was 
<br/>only four months ago in May, this House approved the guarantee for FSC, that is why we are calling 
<br/>for an investigation into the operations of FSC.  This raises serious question abouts all the big talk in 
<br/>the industry on bringing about  changes, and big  plans in  reviving the Penang Mill  with  no fiscal 
<br/>planning aside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not  that  easy  to  run  the  sugar  industry,  because  when  we  were  in 
<br/>government, we had to go through COVID-19 and we were hit by major cyclones, but despite that, 
<br/>we were able to achieve 1.8 million-plus tonnes of sugarcane.  However, all this while, travelling 
<br/>from one country to another at taxpayers’ expenses, and this includes the expenses of the poor cane 
<br/>farmers, what is the investment on return on every trip the honourable Minister is making?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just an economic issue, it is a matter of survival for many of our 
<br/></span><span>people.  While I support the Government’s loan guarantee from the FSC until 2028, we need to see 
<br/>real fiscal discipline and action from this Government.  We cannot keep on bailing out FSC without 
<br/>seeing any improvement.  The morale of our farmers and workers is just as important as running our 
<br/>mills.  The two go hand in hand.  We must remember that the sugar industry is not just about numbers 
<br/>and forecast, it is about our Fijian people.  It is about the farmers waking up early in the morning to 
<br/>tend to their crops; the workers who labour in the mills and their families who depend on this industry 
<br/>for their livelihoods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to see real progress.  We need to build an industry where these 
<br/></span><span>people feel respected, valued and motivated to give their best.  The sugar industry is too important to 
<br/>be left in this state of uncertainty.  The livelihoods of thousands of Fijians depend on it, and it is time 
<br/>that the honourable Minister stops blaming the weather and start taking responsibility.  It has been 
<br/>almost two years now, and the fact the honourable Minister still has no plans, is shocking.  Let us see 
<br/>real action and not just empty promises, honourable Minister.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time to stop pointing fingers and start delivering results that will benefit 
<br/>our farmers, our workers and our country as a whole.  Having said that, I support the motion on the 
<br/>floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion moved by the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance on the increase in Government guarantee to  Fiji 
<br/>Sugar Corporation from $105 million to $200 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  begin,  I  wish  to  mention  that  Ratu  Kadavulevu  School  will  be 
<br/>celebrating its 100 years anniversary for one week from next Monday.  The school was established 
<br/>in 1924 by a high chief of Bau, Ratu Penaia Kadavulevu to educate and nurture young Fijian boys to 
<br/>be well rounded students. It  focusses on developing  excellence in  character, academia  and sports 
<br/>activities.    We  have  eight  former  students  in  this  House  led  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and seven other Members.  On behalf of the former students of the school and Members 
<br/>of this august House, we wish to congratulate Ratu Kadavulevu School for its excellent achievement 
<br/>in the first 100 years of establishment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think quite a lot has been said about this subject of 
<br/>sugar but I just wish to raise an issue with regards to who are the people who  are directly benefitting 
<br/>from the industry. There has been a lot of numbers that has been raised; honourable Ketan Lal raised 
<br/>$200,000.  However, this $200,000 was based on the 20,000 farmers in the 1990s when it was at its 
<br/>a peak where we were producing over 4 million tonnes. If you calculate 20,000 multiply the average 
<br/>farm members of five, you might get that number.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of farmers to-date has drastically reduced to 
<br/>around 11,000 who are  quite active. On average  families, we might  have around 55,000 who are 
<br/>directly  affected  and  include  other  FSC  workers  with  around  another  1,000,  the  numbers  have 
<br/>drastically reduced. I think it is not fair for us to be saying that we are supporting the 200,000. I think 
<br/>it has been exaggerated to some extent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to raise that the previous government has continued in its attempt 
<br/>to revive the industry, with an average allocation of the budget of perhaps around $50 million to $60 
<br/>million annually.  As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, production has continued to decline and most 
<br/>of these are just the subsidies that has been going on but has not addressed the fundamental problems 
<br/></span><span>now facing the industry.  If you look at the industry, of the 11,000 farmers, only 80 percent of the 
<br/></span><span>farmers are producing 20 percent of the throughput going to the mill, with only 20 percent producing 
<br/>80 percent of the throughput.  So, these are some issues that we need to address and look at how we 
<br/>are going to facilitate 80 percent of the farmers. They had to move out if they were not efficient. So, 
<br/>the government programmes had to be targeted at ensuring that there were alternative livelihoods to 
<br/>support these farmers when moving out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that I wish to mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are depriving other agricultural 
<br/>industries  of  the  assistance  that  they  are  supposed  to  be  receiving  when  supporting  one  industry, 
<br/></span><span>which  is  not  economical  and  unsustainable.  As  you  go  around  there  are  so  much  lucrative 
<br/></span><span>opportunities  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  farmers  are  being  deprived  the  support  that  they  are 
<br/>supposed to be receiving.  You name it, coconut which is out there in the outer islands, tropical fruits, 
<br/>livestock there are so much opportunities for the Government to support but instead we have been 
<br/>supporting only one industry.  When you see the contribution of agriculture to GDP, it has continued 
<br/>to decline. In the last 30 years it was 25 percent and now we are just reaching 80 percent.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as was mentioned by honourable Koroilavesau when we undertook the visits 
<br/>in Fiji through the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, we noticed the drastic reduction in the 
<br/>area that was previously cultivated for cane.  There are some estimates from the 50,000 hectares that 
<br/>has been allocated to cane, only 24,000 has been effectively utilised.  Honourable Koroilavesau and 
<br/>I witnessed this, when we went to Lomawai, a big flat land not being utilised.  I totally support what 
<br/>honourable  Koroilavesau  has  just  mooted;  the  empowering  of  the  landowners  to  be  done  again 
<br/>through  a  more  coherent  targeted  initiative  to  ensure  the  landowners,  with  the  assistance  of 
<br/>government to be strengthened and empowered so that we can try to train them in cane production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, during the CSR days there has to be a training facility in Drasa; training people 
<br/>to go back into cane farming. I think that is what I wish to raise this afternoon.  There are a lot of 
<br/>issues already mentioned, and of course, we are looking forward to the FAO study which will be 
<br/>produced in October that will map out the way forward for the industry.  I totally agree with the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives that if your study comes 
<br/>up  with  some  recommendations  that  you  are  not  comfortable  with,  we  have  no  choice  but  to 
<br/>undertake drastic actions to ensure that we have an industry, without being continuously subsidised 
<br/>will benefit all the people of this country instead of a chosen few.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support the 
<br/>motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Deputy Prime and honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finance to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I thank all the honourable Members for their contribution and  
<br/>support for the motion, though I was not sure whether honourable Lal was supporting  or opposing 
<br/>with some reservations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He supported.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Koroilavesau touched a very important point.  He 
<br/>talked about the preferential prices and how those prices came to an end.  As part of the strategy of 
<br/>the European Unit (EU) to support that phase-out or transition from guaranteed price under those 
<br/>conventions  to  more  world  market  price,  the  EU  provided  substantial  funding  to  all  the  sugar 
<br/>producing ex-colonies including Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2006, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Qarase Government, $350 million was provided by the 
<br/></span><span>European Union for three aspects of the sugar industry.  There were three components in that $350 
<br/>million:      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>upgrade of the mills (milling part);s  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>farm level part to support more efficient and productive farms; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>alternative livelihood because the restructuring would have allowed smaller inefficient 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farms to be transitioned out into more alternative crops, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, we lost that $350 million because of the events in 2006 and subsequently, if you 
<br/></span><span>look at the statistics and I do not want to go back as to what happened, but I was just listening to 
<br/>honourable  Lal  and  honourable  Viam  Pillay,  perhaps,  they  need  to  reflect  on  the  history  of  what 
<br/>happened in last 13 or 14 years and since 2006.  We were producing about 3.2 million tonnes of cane.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, as you would know, since then the decline was continuous, partly because we remained 
<br/>inefficient, we did not benefit from that very substantial amount of money that was lost by Fiji and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FSC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1865 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we could never put  that  amount of money back into  the industry that was provided by European 
<br/>Union.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue with respect to, I know honourable Lal raised this issue about workers.  It is under 
<br/>this  Government,  2,000  workers  of  FSC  received  a  5.3  percent  pay  rise.  So,  this  question  of 
<br/>Government not looking after the workers’ interest, I think what honourable Singh was implying was 
<br/>that some of the inefficiencies at the mill level and the attitude of those in the industry. We used to 
<br/>have a great partnership right in Parliament under the Prime Ministers before 2006; under the late 
<br/>Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara’s time, under Prime Minister Rabuka’s time and Prime Minister Qarase’s 
<br/>time. We used to have a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Sugar and there was a lot of bi-partisan 
<br/>approach in terms of taking the industry forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I was the Chair.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Sir,  you  were  one  time  Chair  of  the  Joint  Parliamentary 
<br/>Committee and a lot of good things happened as a result of that. So, the suggestion by honourable 
<br/>Viam Pillay, he forgot to say that it was the FijiFirst Government which refused, and I remember 
<br/>moving a motion in Opposition calling for an establishment of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to 
<br/>address the problems in the sugar industry.  I know that the honourable Prime Ministry likes that idea 
<br/>and that is something that the Government will consider.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives said,  I 
<br/>think  for  the  first  time,  we  as  a  Government  are  determined  to  look  at  the  industry.  I  think  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Sugar, having inherited such a difficult proposition, and I do not envy his 
<br/>job trying to get to the workers, trying to get to the farmers, trying to address the concerns of what is 
<br/>happening  in  the  mills  with  aging  infrastructure,  aging  machines  and  spare  parts.  These  are  real 
<br/>problems within the milling sector then of course, we have the same issue at the farm level; issues of 
<br/>labour, farm practices.  These things have not changed and that is why I kept referring to that period 
<br/>that we lost a very critical moment in Fiji’s sugar industry history which was not taken on.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think as the honourable Assistant Minister said quite rightly, once we get the FAO Report, 
<br/>we are talking  to  the  consultant, I think he has  consulted a  number of people, a number of us in 
<br/>Government,  once  that  report  comes  out,  I  think,  as  a  Government,  we  need  to  as  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau said “take the bull by the horns”. I think we are already moving towards a direction 
<br/>and looking at the sugar industry in a very critical manner. So, once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want 
<br/>to thank the honourable Members for their support and thank you for the opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
