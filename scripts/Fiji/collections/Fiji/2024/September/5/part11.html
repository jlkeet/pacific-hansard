<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby 
<br/>submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on Investment Fiji 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 
<br/>Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji was established in 1980 under the Economic Development Board Act 2017.  
<br/>It  serves  as  Fiji’s  Trade  &amp;  Investment  Promotion  Agency,  with  the  primary  goal  of  promoting, 
<br/>stimulating, and facilitating economic development in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment  Fiji  operates  independently  as  the  marketing  arm  of  the  Fiji  Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>providing services to promote investment, develop industries and enterprises, and increase exports 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1787 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of goods and services. The agency plays a crucial role in creating employment opportunities, raising 
<br/>economic  activities  and  bringing  in  foreign  exchange,  thereby,  contributing  to  Fiji’s  economic 
<br/>growth and prosperity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Agency’s vision is to be a leading economic development agency by ensuring increased 
<br/>sustainable levels of investment and exports. Its mission is to create a positive economic impact in 
<br/>the lives of Fijians through premium investments, export, and employment opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee acknowledges positive developments in the Reports and identified areas that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>require improvements:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  Committee  commends  Investment  Fiji  for  successfully  developing  a  three-year 
<br/>Strategic Plan that aligns with its new role, as outlined in the new Investment Fiji Act 2022 
<br/>(Act No. 25 of 2022), passed on 7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  Committee  expressed  its  concern  that  the  Annual  Reports  did  not  contain  any 
<br/>performance  matrix  aligned  with  the  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPIs),  making  it 
<br/>difficult  to  thoroughly  assess  the  performance  of  Investment  Fiji.    However,  when  the 
<br/>Committee raised this issue, Investment Fiji did provide the performance Matrix, which 
<br/>should have been included in the Reports from the outset.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)   The Committee also noted that Investment Fiji did not report on relevant Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals (SDGs), which is a mandatory requirement for all Annual Reports 
<br/>presented to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>While the Committee recognises the progress made in specific activities such as number of 
<br/>trade missions and investments promotions conducted, however, the Report lacks detailed 
<br/>information  on  the  level  of  interest  these  activities  generated  and  how  the  interest  is 
<br/>translated into actual investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee observed that the Annual Reports stated the number of businesses without 
<br/>specifying names, making it difficult to assess how promotional activities are translated into 
<br/>actual investments or exports over the years. Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed 
<br/>that this information was withheld due to commercial sensitivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)   The Committee noted the paucity of tangible data and reliable statistics related to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operations of Investment Fiji, which hinders comprehensive evaluation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)   The Committee expresses concern about their failure to report on the expected targets 
<br/>versus  actual  achievements,  which  is  necessary  to  justify  the  budgetary  allocations 
<br/>provided to Investment Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)   The Committee observed that recommendation 6 of the previous Committee Report on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>full disclosure of data and key information were not fully implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Investment Fiji, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Kamal Chetty, and his staff for their timely assistance in this inquiry on answering various questions 
<br/>raised by the Committee through face-to-face public hearing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I also would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who were part of the team that produced this Report:

<br/>(5)  Honourable P. Ravunawa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank the Secretariat for their invaluable support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend this Review Report

<div><span>to Parliament and request all Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members  before  I  continue  to  the  second  Report  to  be 
<br/>submitted, I must apologise for not highlighting the fact to you, our beautiful Contestants. We also 
<br/>have two or three former Queens here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Yes,  they  are  both  sitting  on  this  side  of  Parliament,  the  honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs  and Deputy Speaker, I hope you all know her, otherwise, I 
<br/>will ask her to stand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Fiji knows her. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Fiji knows her?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Oh,  thank  you,  and  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social Protection, as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before coming to this Sitting, I was a bit confused whether my Secretary-General was also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Queen, or was it her sister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, her sister.

<div><span>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Beauty with brains, Sir!

<div><span>Review Report - OAG’s Special Investigation Conducted for Procurement of Goods and Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I am pleased to present the Committee’s Review 
<br/>Report on the Special Investigation conducted by the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) for the 
<br/>Procurement of Goods and Services during the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  was  charged  with  leading  Fiji’s  planning  and  hosting 
<br/>responsibilities for the 52nd Asian Development Bank (ADB) Annual Meeting (the Event) which 
<br/>was held in Nadi from 1st May, 2019 to 5th May 2019. The Event gathered 3,582 attendees from 76 
<br/>countries. Over 30 seminars, debates and other events brought together stakeholders to discuss key 
<br/>development issues in Asia and the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the host country, the Fijian Government allocated $10 million to meet the costs for the 
<br/>Event. Upon completion of the meeting, the actual cost incurred was $10.9 million. The additional 
<br/>$0.9 million, which was the VAT component, was sourced from the Government’s Head 50 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The (OAG) carried out a special investigation at the Ministry of Civil Service, focused on the 
<br/>hosting of the Event in May 2019. It came about subsequent to a preliminary audit carried out by the 
<br/>OAG that found that there could be a material misstatement of the financial statements of the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Civil Service for the 2019 financial year at the back of two Investigation Reports detailed below 
<br/></span><span>relating to the ADB event: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Special Audit: Voiding of Payments by the Internal Audit of MoF; and 
<br/>(2)   Investigation  Report  by  the  Investigation  Panel  appointed  by  the  Ministry  of  Civil 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG found that the occurrence of misstatement is high, hence the decision to proceed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the investigation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  the  seriousness  of  the  issues  found  in  the  investigation,  and  after 
<br/>consultations  with  relevant  stakeholders  agreed  for  further  investigation  by  the  relevant  law 
<br/>enforcement agencies on the findings that includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>elements of fraud during payments; 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>breach of relevant legislations, rules and regulations and policies in the procurement of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>goods and services; and 
<br/>limitations in the FMIS over the processing of payments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, through its own investigation, found that with those findings: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>There were delays by the Ministry of Civil Service and its then Minister to finalise this 
<br/>Report  which  was  finally  done  on  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  December,  2020,  and,  apart  from  delays  due  to 
<br/>COVID-19,  there  were  intentional  delays  to  bring  the  Report  to  Parliament  which  was 
<br/>finally done on 27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023, when the new Government came in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>There  were  delays  as  well  by  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  to  direct  the  Report  to  the 
<br/>appropriate authorities, including FICAC, for further investigations, which was finally done 
<br/>by  the  current  Permanent  Secretary  and  his  Team  after  consultation  around  November 
<br/>2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the findings identified above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the time that had lapsed and the move 
<br/>by those implicated, the Committee further recommends that the current Executive Management of 
<br/>the Ministry of Civil Service with the assistance of the Ministry of Finance tofollow up further with 
<br/>FICAC on the progress of those cases referred to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While some or most of the recommendations have been implemented by the Ministry of Civil 
<br/>Service, the Ministry of Finance Internal Audit team or Office of the Auditor-General should carry 
<br/>out  a  follow  up  audit,  especially  on  the  breach  of  relevant  legislations,  rules  and  regulations  and 
<br/>policies in  the procurement of goods and services, as well as the limitation in  the FMIS over the 
<br/>processing of payments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, both  Ministries should ensure that the Standard Operating Procedure for 
<br/>hosting of events such as this magnitude that is being developed and put in place to be used in the 
<br/>future to include the recommendations by the Office of the Auditor-General and should cover every 
<br/>aspect of the event. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, I wish to thank the current Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Civil Service and 
<br/>his Team, as well as Ms. Susan Kiran, the former Permanent Secretary, for responding and providing 
<br/>clarifications on those audit issues that were highlighted. Also, I wish to thank the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>FMIS Team and the Internal Audit Team for responding positively to the Report as well to the queries 
<br/></span><span>raised by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable 
<br/>Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,  who  were  part  of  the  successful 
<br/>compilation of this bipartisan Report namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural,  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj; 
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable H. Chand; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank the Alternate Members of the Standing Committee who took part in the 
<br/>consultations, namely, honourable Taito  R.  Matasawalevu who stood in  as an Alternate Member, 
<br/>pursuant to Standing Order 115(5).

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Tavua Town Council 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Consolidated Review 
<br/>Report on the Tavua Town Council 2016-2018 Annual Report.  As mandated under Standing Order 
<br/>109(2)  (b),  the  Committee  looks  into  issues  related  to  health,  education,  social  services,  labour, 
<br/>aviation, culture and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee,  through  its  mandatory  role  as  stipulated  under  Standing  Order  110, 
<br/>undertook a site visit to the Government grant projects administered by the Council, which was the 
<br/>Tavualevu Village Public Convenience Project and the Muti-Purpose Sports Court Change Room.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council raised concerns faced by the Council which has been ongoing from the previous 
<br/>years.  The  Committee  noted  the  various  issues  raised  by  the  Council  and  provided  possible 
<br/>recommendations as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the importance of small Municipalities, like Tavua, in engaging with 
<br/>stakeholders to expedite various projects that are being planned to be undertaken by the Council for 
<br/>better service to the people.  The Committee commends the Council for having a good rate collection, 
<br/>as compared to other Councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I extend my gratitude and appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer and Management of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua Town Council for their timely contribution in this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  former  Chairperson  of  the  Committee,  the

<div><span>Review Report – Office of the Auditor-General Special Investigation on Housing Authority  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker Sir, this Public Accounts Committee Report is on 
<br/>Special Investigation on Housing Authority (HA) which was carried out by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General in July 2020. The investigation centered on matters related to the illegal allocation of lots 
<br/>and abuse of the tender process which resulted in the controversial and inappropriate owning of lots 
<br/>by both individuals and employees of the Housing Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The case came to light after members of the public raised concerns in an uproar manner with 
<br/>the  then  Minister  of  Housing  namely,  the  honourable  Premila  Kumar,  who  initiated  a  special 
<br/>investigation through the Board of Housing Authority with the Office of the Auditor-General who is 
<br/>empowered to do such audit under Section 6 (1)(d) of the Audit Act 1969.  Honourable Kumar and 
<br/>Board  Chairperson,  Lorraine  Seeto,  must  be  commended  for  their  effort  in  trying  to  improve  the 
<br/>operations at Housing Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As expected  from  the Committee under the provisions of Standing Order 109, a thorough 
<br/>review on the Office of the Auditor-General’s investigation result document was carried out by the 
<br/>team and noted the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Corporate governance, transparency and accountability was extremely weak, bordering 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on being pathetic at Housing Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Absence of Conflict-of-Interest Policy, lack of proper verification, poor record-keeping, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>abuse of power and corruption.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Not all tender documents were provided for the development of lots from 2010 to the 
<br/></span><span>date of this Report (2020). Critical records such as tender documents which were not 
<br/></span><span>provided during the investigation is a serious issue, especially when the Tender Policy 
<br/>was  approved in  2005  which was used to  process the tenders. The  Authority should 
<br/>make every effort to locate these records for independent examination and verifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Cases of suspected fraud and collusion where staff and their relatives benefitted from 
<br/>the breakdown in the Authority’s processes should be referred to relevant authorities, 
<br/>since the audit of the Office of the Auditor-General did not focus on non-compliance 
<br/>with the law. These law enforcement agencies will also be able to access information 
<br/></span><span>on financial transactions which are held by other institutions and with that, I wish to 
<br/></span><span>advise that over 60 cases were referred to FICAC by the Housing Authority after the 
<br/>investigations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Office of the Auditor-General was unable to interview a former key staff member 
<br/>of the Authority and was also unable to receive responses for the interview questions 
<br/>provided to another key staff member, who were both accountable for overseeing the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1793 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>selection of applicants and for lot allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Documentation  relating  to  submissions  for  Ministerial  approval  regarding  customers 
<br/>earning  over  $50,000  could  not  be  provided  by  the  Housing  Authority.  In  addition, 
<br/>documentation and ministerial approval for lot allocation for customers earning over 
<br/>$50,000 could not also be made available by the Ministry of Housing and Community 
<br/>Development, for submissions made in  2015  and 2016. This  restricted the Office of 
<br/>Auditor-General from determining if the appropriate processes were in place and were 
<br/>followed for approval of customers earning over $50,000 per annum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  issue  was  the  missing  files.  There  were  12  customer  files,  including  six  files  for 
<br/>Tacirua  Subdivision  and  four  files  for  Matavolivoli  Subdivision  which  were  not  provided  to  the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor -General for review. Mr. Speaker Sir, the missing files meant that the officers 
<br/>or the Housing Authority staff were trying to hide from being investigated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee acknowledges the remarkable effort and co-operation by the current Board 
<br/>and the current Executive Management of Housing Authority in providing clarifications on issues 
<br/>relating to the case raised with them.  As, I have said before, they had resolved or implemented over 
<br/>75 percent of the recommendations and are targeting to complete all the recommendations by the end 
<br/>of this year, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee’s ultimate objective is to see that the key outcome of the investigation is a 
<br/>system  overhaul  at  Housing  Authority  that  ensures  full  proof  administrational  and  operational 
<br/>processes and practical  governance policies are put in place to eliminate gaps that might bring to 
<br/>existence any violation that stimulates corrupt practices at Housing Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker Sir, the Committee agrees that those implicated in the investigation 
<br/>should be taken to task as an act of employing strong deterrence and sending correct disciplinary 
<br/>signals  to  members  of  the  public  and  employees  of  Housing  Authority.  As  I  have  said  before, 
<br/>currently there are over 60 cases with FICAC, with one being taken to court, and we would like to 
<br/>see that FICAC facilitates the remaining cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker Sir, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for their contribution and participation by putting this 
<br/>bipartisan Report together.  The task was an  enormous one.  Apart  from  reviewing  the Auditor’s 
<br/>Report,  the  Committee  conducted  separate  interviews,  studied  relevant  documents  and  general 
<br/>discussions, seeking to understand the case better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My sincere appreciation goes to the then Minister for Housing, honourable Premila Kumar, 
<br/>and  the  Housing  Authority  Board  Chairperson,  Miss.  Lorraine  Seeto,  as  well  as  the  current 
<br/>Executives of Housing Authority, for being brave enough to be consulted by the Committee to share 
<br/>the experiences that they faced in relation to the production and finalisation of the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate that we could not get honourable Parveen Bala to be interviewed, who was 
<br/>one of the Ministers responsible for housing during the review period, in which he advised that he 
<br/>was not aware of the request, despite…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Just  a  matter  of  clarification,  I  was  never  asked  to  appear  before  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee, and let the Assistant Minister stop making a sweeping statement here. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Restraining order!

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I have not finished with what I was about to say, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but he advised that he was not aware of the request, despite the e-mail that was sent to him by our 
<br/>Secretariat and also, being advised through phone call by one of our Committee members….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. K. BALA.- He is lying! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Appreciation is also extended to our Committee Members, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (1)    Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister; 
<br/> (2)    Honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural,  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (3)    Honourable A.A. Maharaj; and 
<br/> (4)    Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  acknowledge  our  Alternative  Members,  namely  honourable  Hem  Chand  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Taito R. Matasawalevu for standing in when required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few words, I now commend this Public Accounts Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y.  IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant  to  Standing Order 121(5),  I hereby 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we continue to the next item on the agenda for today, honourable 
<br/>Members, I would like to invite your views, especially when we have three Reports that we have just 
<br/>heard that are very serious in nature - files are missing and even Officials have moved on without 
<br/>being  interviewed.  Given  the  seriousness  of  the  cases,  we  now  have  before  us  the  oversight  and 
<br/>scrutiny role that Parliament plays.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I am requesting, honourable Prime Minister, is, could we make use of that oversight and 
<br/>scrutiny role that Members of Parliament (MPs) now have, or will we continue with this?  It is now 
<br/>in the Standing Orders.  It takes a period of time before three years to four years, may be in the next 
<br/></span><span>general  election, then it will come to some kind of finality.  To avoid all that, I am seeking your 
<br/></span><span>views, as certainly I would be moving this in the next Business Committee meeting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will be inviting your views, but I am just throwing this across since we now can jump straight 
<br/>into Standing Orders, get the oversight role or scrutiny, and then we continue with that. It is you, 
<br/></span><span>Parliamentarians, who are running this sitting. Instead of being referred to a Standing Committee and 
<br/></span><span>surely, the outcome we have just heard, it would certainly be the result that we would not like to
