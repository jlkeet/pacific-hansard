<div><span>Regularisation of Private Vehicles for Public Service Activities 
<br/>(Question No. 195/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on how the Ministry plans to regularise private vehicles that 
<br/>are engaged in illegal public service activities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question regarding regularisation of private vehicles. The Ministry with Land Transport Authority 
<br/>(LTA) has recognised the growing concern of private vehicles unlawfully operating as Public Service 
<br/>Vehicles (PSV).  The proliferation of these operators who provide transport services without receipts, 
<br/>permits  or  adherence  to  regulatory  standards  presents  a  significant  challenge.  While  these 
<br/>unauthorised services may temporarily meet certain transportation demands, they function outside 
<br/>the  legal  framework,  resulting  in  compromised  safety,  unfair  competition  and  with  legitimate 
<br/>operators, a loss of revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we should recognise that the demand is there, and some are genuinely serving, for 
<br/>example, after hours and for emergency situation. The LTA together with the Department of Transport 
<br/>is looking at regularisation pathways of these vehicle owners in order to transition into the legal PSV 
<br/>framework which may involve creating specific criteria and incentives that will allow them to meet 
<br/>the regulatory requirements. Therefore, fostering a more inclusive and compliant transport sector. So 
<br/>it is something which is still under discussion, we are considering it and given the growing number 
<br/>of illegal  operators, I emphasise that there are various public service permits which are open, for 
<br/>example, the lifting of the freeze has enabled the applications for rental (LR) and mini-buses (LM) 
<br/>and carriers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these categories, for example,  LH, authorises the use of a motor vehicle 
<br/>licensed as hire vehicle with a driver provided, subject to the Act and licence and permit conditions, 
<br/></span><span>on a route and for a fare negotiated between the permit holder or his or her driver and the passenger 
<br/></span><span>carried but shall not authorise the vehicle to ply or stand for hire for the carriage of passengers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the LR (Rental) use of a rental vehicle and there are minibuses and carriers. These 
<br/>are options available for them to regularise and the LTA is working closely with stakeholders in order 
<br/>to move them away from their current situation of unregularised operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, the issuance of LR and LH has also meant that 
<br/>those LR and LH plates are being used as taxis. Will you be looking at strengthening the laws and 
<br/></span><span>the  punishments  that  currently  exists  with  respective  PSV  drivers  and  those  that  try  and  be  PSV 
<br/></span><span>drivers within this particular boundary? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not sure if I heard you correctly, whether LR used as 
<br/>taxis, but in terms of the question of the laws, that is what we are currently reviewing - the various 
<br/>aspects of the law that needed to be reviewed. For example, the sale of sale permits, and looking at 
<br/>the review of the current regulations regarding taxis, open taxi rank, et cetera.   I think there is another

<div><span>5</span><span>th </span><span>September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the review of the current regulations regarding taxis, open taxi rank, et cetera.   I think there is another 
<br/>question coming up on the availability of bases in the Municipal boundaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are various challenges we face but generally, we are encouraging more participation 
<br/>in the transport sector, but also to spread it out, not only in the urban areas where they are currently 
<br/>based, but also to the rural bases.  For example, in villages, they are working with the Ministry of 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs and iTLTB to create bases there or where they could operate from. I noticed, even in 
<br/>my area, there is quite a number of cars parked there and they are looking forward in terms of the 
<br/>development towards the issuance of taxi permits which we are currently working on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farm to Fork Initiative - Ministry of Tourism 
<br/>(Question No. 196/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  Farm-to-Fork  initiative  that  is  currently  being 
<br/>spearheaded by the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the 
<br/>question.  The Farm-to-Fork initiative is an important collaborative programme led by the Ministry 
<br/>of Tourism and Civil Aviation. It is unique because we have multiple partners across Government, 
<br/>private sector and development partners. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture and 
<br/>Waterways, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, the Ministry of Trade and Co-operatives, Micro, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, with the support of the United Nations Food 
<br/>and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Farm-to-Fork  initiative  was  launched  with  a  primary  objective  of  fostering  stronger 
<br/>relationships  between  our  tourism  and  resource-based  sectors  -  agriculture  and  fisheries.  The 
<br/>initiative aims to  integrate local  agricultural  and  fisheries products  into the tourism supply chain, 
<br/>thereby, promoting local produce and reducing dependency on imports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, since entering the partnership with the UN FAO in 2023, we have conducted 
<br/>two workshops - one in Sigatoka and one in Savusavu. These workshops brought together a diverse 
<br/>group  of  stakeholders,  including  Government  Officials,  farmers,  cooperatives  and  clusters, 
<br/>middlemen and caterers and makers from the hospitality industry such as chefs, food and beverage 
<br/></span><span>managers and hotel purchasing officers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative is overseen by a Steering Committee which has representation 
<br/>of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and 
<br/>Forestry, Ministry of Trade, Fiji Hotel Association, Fiji Chefs Association, Culinary Federation of 
<br/>Fiji, Tourism Fiji and UNFAO.  Collectively, we have had over 100 participants in these workshops.  
<br/>We  are  covering  key  areas  such  as  supply  chain  management,  fish  handling,  hotel  purchasing 
<br/>requirements, market access, funding opportunities and health and safety standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the workshop, participants also had the opportunity to visit an on-site farm at the 
<br/></span><span>Outrigger Resort, Sigatoka, and Namale Resort, Savusavu, to see the variety of crops and vegetables 
<br/>grown, the sustainable farming practices, and how the farm contribute to the resort’s commitment, 
<br/>of offering fresh locally sourced meals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to share that there was a good representation of women 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with close to 50 percent participation. We had one who attended the Sigatoka workshop with her 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>two-year old child.  This really attests to the commitment and the hard work of women.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key issues that we have seen from these workshops include a 
<br/>significant  lack  of  communication  and  coordination  between  farmers  and  key  Government 
<br/>stakeholders, including our Ministry. There is also a need for more training, technical support and 
<br/>better access to farming infrastructure, equipment and water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farmers are often unaware of tender bids from hotels and struggle with understanding the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>procurement process. Other challenges include:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>labour shortages;  
<br/>their perception of farming as a non-lucrative and labour-intensive business;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>difficulties related to market access;  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>high input costs; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the unavailability of seeds and materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The workshops also noted problems with inconsistent supply and quality of produce, delayed 
<br/>payments  from  hotels  and  the  need  for  better  information  on  seasonality,  suppliers  and  quality 
<br/>control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of coordination is a critical missing link, that if established, could significantly drive 
<br/>demand and supply for both industries. Strengthening this connection is vital for ensuring a consistent 
<br/>and high quality supply of local produce to the tourism sector, while also creating a reliable market 
<br/>for  farmers.  Establishing  strong  synergies  through  policies,  taskforces  and  better  communication 
<br/>channels will enable these sectors to work together more effectively, boosting the local economy and 
<br/>enhancing the sustainability of both agriculture and tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, a third workshop will be held in Suva later in the year, where 
<br/>we hope to present solutions on the types of arrangements needed to build stronger, healthier and 
<br/>more sustainable links between the food and agriculture sector and the tourism sector. We are also 
<br/>looking to extend our partnership with the UNFAO, so that this initiative becomes a core part of our 
<br/>Ministry’s outputs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Farm-to-Fork Initiative is a testament of our commitment 
<br/>in promoting sustainable tourism and supporting local communities. By strengthening the linkages 
<br/>between tourism and resource-based sectors, we are not only enhancing the visitors’ experience, but 
<br/></span><span>also contributing to the economic development of our rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, does the Farm-to-Fork Initiative actually have an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>organic portion to it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, it does. Organic producers, as we know, are high on the list of 
<br/>most people, especially our visitors.  So, it is very much dominant the way we are developing this. 
<br/>The beauty about it is that these are local farmers who are adjacent to where the resorts are situated. 
<br/>As I have highlighted, it is the way for them to grow on demand, to know what the hotels want and 
<br/></span><span>to  grow  accordingly.  It  is  working  quite  properly,  and  it  is  very  promising  for  both  our  tourism 
<br/></span><span>industry and the local community of farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister, I think I have  mentioned this during the Fiji  Institute of Chartered Accountants  (FICA) 
<br/>Conference. There are two obstacles in this Farm-to-Fork Initiative, one is the procurement officers, 
<br/>and two, are the middlemen.  These are the ones who come in between the initiative and the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, with this training and discussions that are ongoing, how is this being handled by the Ministry? It 
<br/>is a good initiative, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the programme includes the middlemen, they are 
<br/>also  part  of  this  initiative  because  we  need  to  secure  the  supply  chain.  In  cases  where  you  have 
<br/>businesses between the farms and the buyer, you do need the ability of the middlemen to consolidate 
<br/>producers for purchase by the hotels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is something that is always there, but the way to go around that is to secure a price between 
<br/>the  farmer  and  the  hotel  and  then  involve  the  middlemen.  I  think  it  is  here  when  the  middleman 
<br/>decides  on  what  the  prices  should  be.  So,  it  is  a  matter  of  close  coordination  and  building  a 
<br/>relationship that is forward looking and one that can live on for a long period of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem with middlemen is that they come in, take what they buy and come back another 
<br/>time and are not able to sustain the relationship between the farmer and the hotel. The Ministry is 
<br/>trying to find a way to sustain this relationship between the farmer and the hotel. The hotel should 
<br/>know what is available in their vicinity.  That will be key to all these.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On procurement, I know as a hotelier, my purchasing manager, it was easier for him to pick 
<br/>up the phone and call New Zealand, as opposed to going around the market to go and find out what 
<br/>is available. So, that is what we are going to do, for the hotels to take interest in what is available 
<br/>locally. Do what we call, a market survey. Hoteliers normally do this to find out what is available. 
<br/>So, procurement is key, and our farmers need to know how the purchasing manager works. They 
<br/>need to be related to the chef, what the chef wants to have on the menu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  the  food  and  beverage  manager,  the  chef  and  purchasing  manager  is  also  part  of  this 
<br/>dialogue. And in that, the middleman will also be there, but if these people can work closely together, 
<br/>the fee of the middleman, manipulating prices can be addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>honourable Minister for Tourism is how is the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) assisting in 
<br/>this initiative? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are also part of the dialogue. It is all hands on 
<br/>board, but the Farm-to-Fork Initiative is more the local community and the hotel. They must develop 
<br/>their relationship, and with that relationship, it is more a direct one between the farmer and the hotels. 
<br/></span><span>AMA would be more on distributing to far flung areas, areas that are away from the community. So 
<br/></span><span>really,  there  is  so  much  good  land  available  in  the  hotel  areas  and  this  is  what  we  are  trying  to 
<br/>encourage, that the land to be put to good use based on what the hotel needs. You know, we should 
<br/>farm on demand, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Non-Provision of Town Base Permits for LMs and LCs 
<br/>(Question No. 197/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.D. BULITAVU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament 
<br/>on the reasons why the Municipal Councils are not providing town base permits to vehicle 
<br/>owners applications which have been accepted by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) 
<br/>for the processing of their Public Service Vehicles (PSV) permits in particular for LMs 
<br/>and LCs.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1835 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/>It is a very important question because of public interest and a lot of people have also been coming 
<br/>to my office asking for assistance in relation to the town or city base permit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  rise today before you to address  a pressing issue that has  come to the 
<br/>attention of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government concerning the challenges faced by PSV 
<br/>owners  in  obtaining  town  based  permits  from  our  municipal  councils  particularly  for  Licensed 
<br/>Minibuses (LM) as well as Licensed Carriers (LC), despite having their applications accepted by the 
<br/>Land Transport Authority as Public Service Vehicle (PSV) permits. The situation has caused concern 
<br/>among our constituents, particularly those whose livelihoods depend on operating these vehicles. It 
<br/>is, therefore, our duty as the Government to ensure that as regulatory processes are efficient, fair and 
<br/>supportive  of  economic  growth  while  maintaining  necessary  standards  of  safety  and  order  in  our 
<br/>urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  identified  a  gap  in  coordination  between  the  LTA,  FRA  and 
<br/>municipal  councils.  This  is  the  absence  of  a  streamlined  integrated  process  for  handling  Public 
<br/>Service  Vehicles  or  PSVs  and  town-based  permit  applications  has  resulted  in  conflicting 
<br/>requirements, duplicated efforts and confusion for applicants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difficulty in obtaining permits has led to an increase in informal and 
<br/>sometimes  illegal  transportation  services.    This  not  only  poses  safety  risk  but  also  results  in  loss 
<br/>revenue for both local and our national governments.  The Ministry of Transport, together with LTA, 
<br/>is closely working with my Ministry to obtain baseline data from the councils on the bases and what 
<br/>areas can be aligned as bases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  past  months,  we  have  observed  a  growing  number  of  complaints  from  vehicle 
<br/>owners who have successfully navigated the LTA’s rigorous process for obtain PSV permits.  These 
<br/>individuals  and  businesses  have  invested  time,  effort  and  resources  to  meet  the  LTA’s  standards 
<br/>demonstrating their commitment to providing safe and reliable transport services to our communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to understand the internal role of our municipal councils in this 
<br/>process.  Municipal  councils  are  tasked  with  managing  the  urban  environment,  ensuring  ordinary 
<br/>development and maintain a quality of life for residents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  context  of  public  transportation,  they  play  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  and  allocating 
<br/>appropriate  spaces  for  PSV  base  and  stands,  ensuring  the  number  and  type  of  vehicles  operating 
<br/></span><span>within the municipalities are aligned with the areas infrastructure and needs and collecting local fees 
<br/></span><span>and charges that contribute to the maintenance and improvement of urban facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after extensive consultation with municipal councils, vehicle owners and 
<br/>other stakeholders have identified several key factors contributing to the current bottleneck that create 
<br/>challenges  for  permit  issuance.  It  is  important  to  note  that  municipal  councils  have  expressed 
<br/>concerns about the increasing traffic congestions in their jurisdictions with limited provisions to bases 
<br/>to accommodate these requests. They view the limitation as of new town-based permits as a means 
<br/>to  control  the number of vehicle operating in  urban centres.   While this concern is  valid, it often 
<br/></span><span>results in a blanket approach that fails to distinguish between different types of public service vehicles 
<br/></span><span>and specific impacts on the traffic flow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal  councils  face  general  challenges  related  to  the  existing  infrastructure,  limited 
<br/>parking spaces, narrow roads and inadequate public transport facilities contributed to hesitation in 
<br/>issuing  new  permits.  The  council  is  of  the  view  that  allowing  more  vehicle  to  operate  without 
<br/>corresponding improvements in infrastructure would lead to chaos and deterioration of services. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In collaboration with the Ministry of Public Works, we will work with the municipal councils 
<br/>to  develop  comprehensive  plans  for  upgrading  urban  infrastructure  to  support  an  efficient  public 
<br/>transportation  system.  This  will  include  dedicated  lanes  for  public  service  vehicles,  improving 
<br/>parking facilities and enhanced traffic management systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise the need to support our municipal councils in building their capacity to handle 
<br/>the complexities of modern urban transportation. The challenges faced in  harmonising our public 
<br/>service permit processes are significant.  By working together across different levels of government, 
<br/>between agencies and in partnership with the private sector and our communities.  Municipal councils 
<br/>are prompted to work closely with FRA and LTA in implementing these reforms.  I urge patience 
<br/>and cooperation from our vehicle owners and operators as we work to streamline these processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for what 
<br/>he has mentioned about the town base permit for LM and LC. If someone on day one lodges their 
<br/>application, how long will it take – weeks or months?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I thank the honourable Member for asking a very good question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is like a challenge not really a new….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is using the case in Navua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- One river, one bus! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- It is like a legacy issue that we are reviewing at the  moment. I 
<br/>remember  first  time  in  Office  I  was  asked  by  some  carrier  operators  on  how  long  it  will  take  to 
<br/>approve  an  application  for  a  base  for  a  municipality  here  in  our  country.    They  said  that  their 
<br/>application has been sitting there for more than two weeks. That is something that we are trying to 
<br/>review now. Realistically, it should not take more than a week because information are there by all 
<br/>the Councils unless fees updates, then it should be processed within a week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Less than a week, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- The Minister will agree that there is a disconnection between the 
<br/>municipal councils and LTA. Before I mention my question, there are many areas that are no longer 
<br/>serviced by buses, either no longer serviced or reduce fleet in a given day.  These are people who are 
<br/>living around who want to help their own people by buying trucks or minibuses to help them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My supplementary question to the Minister, how will the Ministry address the concordance 
<br/>of  streamlining  the  process  to  improve  the  compliance,  also  a  timeline  for  opening  up  of,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Works mentioned about the open ranking system, something similar to that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, that is a very important question because I also been 
<br/>receiving this same issue from the public on some of the areas that even have been serviced by the 
<br/>bus providers, but due to some issues, maybe road conditions, the service are affected. They have 
<br/>been applying for LM applications, I think I have said earlier that we are also having consultation 
<br/></span><span>with the Ministry of Public Works, FRA as well as LTA on the way forward for this, because it is 
<br/></span><span>affecting our people, especially those who are living in the rural areas.  They also need our assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that I also want to share, I was looking at some of the information that had been 
<br/>given to me regarding some of the applications, the base permits that had been given by Municipal  
<br/>Councils, it is very interesting to note that in some cases, some Councils have issued more bases, but 
<br/>these bases do not end up with the process which is formalising of the permits, this is in relation to

<div><span>LM with LTA. These are some of the issues, I think there needs to be a holistic review process so 
<br/>that  the  general  public  understands  the  process  and  also  agencies  are  involved  in  processing 
<br/>applications for LM, LC as well as LH.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic

<div><span>The virement and redeployment processes have always been a feature of our budget system, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not just in this budget and provides the operation flexibility…

<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is the not the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …I am coming to that for budget execution but within a proper 
<br/>legal  framework  to  ensure  proper  management  including  Cabinet  approval  for  redeployment  of  
<br/>funds.  The  reason  why  I  am  saying  this  at  the  beginning,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  what  the 
<br/>honourable Member has done by giving statements outside of this House suggests that somehow this 
<br/>is not allowable. The virement is a process used for …

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Misrepresentation.  I would like to ask him to produce that statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where I had said that this is not allowed.   I challenge him to produce that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- My ruling is that, he is still coming around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impression that is created on what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>she said.

<div><span>not listen?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, designation persons are provided the authority, it is important for the people 
<br/>outside of Parliament to also understand and also the people in this Parliament.  Designated persons 
<br/>are provided the authority to transfer budgeted funds within the agencies Head of Appropriation.  For 
<br/>example, under Section 16 of the Financial Management Act 2004 states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to vire, the Minister may in writing 
<br/>with or without further appropriation than this Act, authorise the transfer of an unspent 
<br/>amount  in  an  appropriation  category  with  a  Head  of  Appropriation  administered  by  a 
<br/>budget sector agency (other than a parliamentary body) to another appropriation category 
<br/>within that head of appropriation.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Minister  of  Finance’s  powers  under  section  16  of  the  FMA  2004  is  delegated  to  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary under section 10 of the Financial Instructions 2010 to transfer funds within an 
<br/>appropriate  category  as  well.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from  virement  redeployment,  this  process 
<br/>allows the honourable Minister for Finance, with the approval of Cabinet, to authorise redeployment 
<br/>amounts appropriated by the appropriated Act, enforced for administration by the Ministry to the 
<br/></span><span>Heads of Appropriation and appropriation categories to be administered by one or more other budget 
<br/></span><span>sectors.

<br/></span><span>Cabinet, it is put out for public information by the honourable Prime Minister and they used that to 
<br/></span><span>say, “Aha, some kind of funny thing is going because funds are being redeployed.”  There is nothing 
<br/>funny  about  redeployment,  Mr.  Speaker.    I  will  give  you  examples  of  what  happened  during  the 
<br/>FijiFirst reign.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1839 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, for the 2023-2024 Budget, the first redeployment 
<br/>of  funds  amounted  to  $105.2  million  was  to  meet  the  additional  expenditure  demands  for  the 
<br/>following agencies and ministries.  We said very clearly, we did not come with a revised budget. We 
<br/>looked at the expenditure, we redeployed funds ($105.2 million) to meet the new priorities of the 
<br/>new Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The deployment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, included the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF); 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Water Authority of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These were entities where the funds went to.   Fiji Roads Authority, a sum of $36.1 million 
<br/>is to cater for the following commitments, $21.5 million for additional restoration works on the road 
<br/>network which was not there when we came in.  FRA’s budget, whole year’s budget was spent in six 
<br/>months and we had to come and redeploy funds from other ministries to capital expenditure to fix 
<br/>roads.  Sir, $14.6 million from that deployment for the completion of capital projects designated for 
<br/>that year because they had not budgeted properly.  That is why we redeployed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because your question says why from capital to others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second redeployment, excise of $7.9 million was undertaken to meet the funding shortfall 
<br/>as we said quite clearly, and $1.8 million for the Ministry of Education was to cater for the cost of 
<br/>salaries and allowances for teachers in ECE. Similarly,  the  Fiji  Police  Force  had  encountered  a 
<br/>funding  shortfall  of  $6.1  million  to  meet  the  salary  cost  for  our  police  officers  and  payment  of 
<br/>allowances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that the redeployment exercise that was undertaken 
<br/>in the 2023-2024 Budget, the overall expenditure is well within the total appropriation approved by 
<br/>Parliament. The actual expenditure stands at $4.1 billion, which is below the budgeted expenditure 
<br/>of $4.3 billion, so there is no overspending as a whole of Government as was the impression created.  
<br/></span><span>In fact, the overall net deficit is around 3.3 percent for the last financial year; lower than 4.8 percent 
<br/></span><span>as budgeted and this is underpinned by strong tax collections, revenue collections and Government 
<br/>meeting the revenue forecast for the first time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to reiterate the fact that this is a Government which has brought in two budgets, 
<br/>which has stabilised the finances where Government is funding, Government is being funded well, 
<br/>where we have reduced the debt to GDP ratio from 90 percent in 2022 to 78 percent.  This is what 
<br/>you call “prudent financial management”, not the kind of management that we had seen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me complete this for our information because I do not like 
<br/>to go back, but the stupidity of the question requires me to do that. You look at 2018, $10.6 million 
<br/>was redeployed from Head 50 from ongoing rehabilitation and constructions of schools damaged by 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston;</span><span> in 2018, 2019, 2021 and I can give you all the examples of redeployment or virement 
<br/>of fund from capital total expenditure.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statement the honourable Member put out, was all designed to create 
<br/>this  impression  that somehow,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  not  managing  its  budget  properly,  or 
<br/>somehow the Fiji Police is not managing its budget properly. They are always in a budget, every 
<br/>Government has that, and that is why those provisions are there in the Financial Management Act. 
<br/>That is why there is redeployment and virement Because, you can have a disaster, for example, you 
<br/>can  have  an  unplanned  expenditure,  and  you  can  have  capital  expenditure  not  being  undertaken 
<br/>because  of  weather  conditions.  Therefore,  Governments  look  at  where  they  can  reallocate  funds 
<br/>within a particular year. They know that! But still, they are asking about why we are redeploying 
<br/>funds? Why we have virement of funds?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister needs to 
<br/>be reminded that this virement and redeployment is not new. But the question is, that $105.2 million 
<br/>was redeployed in July and 31</span><span>st</span><span> July is the end of the financial year. You redeployed money out of 
<br/>the 2023-2024 Budget, the $7.9 million, and that decision was taken in August. That is what we are 
<br/>questioning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Stop the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I am questioning you!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is a supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Because  you  talk  about  prudent  management,  you  talk  about 
<br/>transparency and accountability. This is the last financial year’s allocation but authorised in August, 
<br/>and that is the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is perfectly fine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have given a very thorough reply to the question that was raised. Now 
<br/>they are talking about the timing, coming in August, whether it is one in minute before time. You 
<br/>have the mandate to do that. So, let us move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not fair! Absolutely not fair!

<div><span>MOU Between Ministry of Agriculture &amp; UN University  
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 200/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on 
<br/>the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry and the United 
<br/>Nations University for Environment and Security? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the question raised by the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Member regarding the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry and 
<br/>the United Nations University for Environment and Security.  I begin by expressing my gratitude to 
<br/>the  Cabinet  for  the  decision  to  endorse  the  partnership  between  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
<br/>Waterways and the United Nations University for Environment and Human Security that has led to 
<br/>the formalising of the MOU between this esteemed organisation and the Ministry.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1841 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations University for Environment and Human Security plays 
<br/>a  critical  role  in  researching  risk  and  adaptation  related  to  the  environmental  hazards  and  global 
<br/>change.  The  United  Nations  University  for  Environment  and  Human  Security  is  the  hosting 
<br/>organisation of the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative and is a leading think tank on climate change 
<br/>and  insurance,  focusing  on  promoting  policies  and  developing  solutions  to  reduce  these  risks  for 
<br/>vulnerable communities and the agriculture sector considering the interaction between environmental 
<br/>and societal factors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Pacific  Insurance  and  Climate  Adaptation  Programme  (PICAP)  was 
<br/>established to enhance the financial preparedness and resilience of Pacific households, communities, 
<br/>small businesses, organisations and Governments against the economic impacts of climate change 
<br/>induced disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The programme initiated in 2021, has successfully introduced the first  climate risk micro-
<br/>insurance products in the Pacific region covering countries such as Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga, and is 
<br/>jointly implemented by the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), United Nations Development 
<br/>Programme (UNDP) and UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security through the 
<br/>Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fiji’s context, the Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme 
<br/>has facilitated insurance payouts to farmers in the Western and Northen Divisions following heavy 
<br/>rainfall in 2023 and 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The upcoming project involving the Fiji Agriculture and Rural Statistics Unit in the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture and Waterways and UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security, 
<br/>aims  to  conduct  the  survey  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  these  parametric  insurance  payouts  on  the 
<br/>economic  decisions  of  beneficiaries,  specifically  farmers  in  Fiji.    The  survey  will  involve  both 
<br/>recipients of the payouts and a control group to provide comparative analysis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the significance of this project lies in its multifaceted benefits to both parties 
<br/>involved,  that  is  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  and  UN  University  Institute  for 
<br/>Environment and Human Security. Socially, the project will provide critical insights into how climate 
<br/>risk micro-insurance can enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations, including women, farmers 
<br/>and individuals with disabilities who are disproportionately affected by climate induced disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economically, the findings will inform policy decisions that could lead to more effective risk 
<br/></span><span>management strategies in the agriculture sector and improve the livelihoods of those farmers insured. 
<br/></span><span>Financially, this project aligns with broader efforts to promote economic resilience at the community 
<br/>level,  by  integrating  market-based  insurance  solutions  into  National  Disaster  Risk  Management 
<br/>Frameworks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN University selected the Fiji Agriculture Statistics Unit within the 
<br/>Ministry as the ideal partner to carry out this survey, due to its proven record of extensive experience 
<br/>in conducting fieldwork across Fiji and managing large-scale data collection on the agriculture sector 
<br/>critically impacted by climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the long-term implications of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
<br/>are significant  to  both  the Ministry and the UN  University  Institute for  Environment  and Human 
<br/>Security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Ministry, successful implementation and analysis of the PICAP payout survey could 
<br/>lead to a more resilient agricultural sector, better equipped to withstand and recover from climate 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>induced shocks. The insights gained could drive the adoption of similar insurance schemes across 
<br/>other sectors, fostering a culture of proactive risk management and financial preparedness in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Ministry  on  the  other  hand  will  benefit  from  the  technical  expertise  and 
<br/>global  perspectives  that  UN  University  Institute  for  Environment  and  Human  Security  brings, 
<br/>enabling more effective implementation and evaluation of the insurance scheme and climate resilient 
<br/>work for the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the UN University, this collaboration aligns to develop and implement innovative climate 
<br/>adaptation strategies. The data gained from this project will contribute to UN University Institute for 
<br/>Environment and Human Security’s global research portfolio in influencing policy and practice in 
<br/>other vulnerable regions worldwide. This project is a critical step in expanding the evidence base for 
<br/>the effectiveness of parametric insurance in Fiji and in the Pacific as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  the  Ministry  appreciates  that  this  collaboration  and 
<br/>achievements  of  this  project  may  open  doors  and  promote  a  sustainable  partnership  for  future 
<br/>research and statistical partnership between the United Nations University and the Ministry dedicated 
<br/>to enhancing resilience against climate change in the agriculture sector. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.

<div><span>Assistance to Farmers Due to Drought and Low Cane Production 
<br/>(Question No. 201/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform 
<br/>Parliament on how the FSC intends to assist farmers in light of the recent drought and 
<br/>subsequent low production of cane? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  actually  sympathize  with  all  the  farmers  in  this 
<br/>country, I myself, am a cane farmer and I will tell you, I just had a </span><span>viber</span><span> message this morning that I 
<br/>am one of the first importer or harvester in this country, some 10 years ago. The cane production has 
<br/>dropped from 15 percent to  20 percent on every  farm this year. The  reason being,  is  not  that the 
<br/>farmers have not done their part, it is because of the climate change and the rain patterns which not 
<br/>helping us in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  the  question  is  very  relevant  honourable  Member.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  respond  to 
<br/></span><span>honourable Pillay regarding  the measures been taken to  assist  the farmers in  consideration of the 
<br/>recent drought, resulting in low production of cane. As we are all aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar 
<br/>is not just an economic pillar but a lifeline for many of our rural communities and the challenges 
<br/>posed by the drought  has been formidable but  I assure you Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of 
<br/>Sugar Industry together with the Fiji Sugar Cooperation (FSC) and the Sugar Research Institute of 
<br/>Fiji (SRIF) are committed to providing comprehensive support to our farmers during the difficult 
<br/>times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last financial year 2023-2024, we took proactive sustainable programmes 
<br/></span><span>by assisting 42 farmers with essential irrigation equipment, including water pumps and pipes. This is 
<br/>also critical in enabling farmers to irrigate their field and mitigate the impact of drought.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  cane  production  was  always  dependent  on  rainfed  production. 
<br/>Whereas  throughout  the  world,  where  patterns  have  changed,  the  relevant  government  have  also

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assisted the farmers to do irrigation and that is what we will be moving into in the coming months 
<br/>and years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising the ongoing nature of these challenges, provisions have been made in the 2024-
<br/>2025 Budget to expand this assistance. We are now supporting an additional 300 farmers through the 
<br/>newly established Irrigation Support Programme and the Small Grant Programme. This expansion 
<br/>underscores our unwavering commitment to sustaining and revitalising the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF has been at the forefront of our efforts to combat the effects of drought.  
<br/>Over the past few months, SRIF have intensified research in rainwater, harvesting and surplus water 
<br/>retention.  In Drasa Lautoka,  SRIF successfully harvested water for the their major drainage systems, 
<br/>trapping rain run-off from the surrounding watersheds. This harvested water is now being utilised to 
<br/>irrigate the research trial areas, demonstrating the effectiveness of small scale irrigation setups. The 
<br/>initiatives is part of a broader strategy by the Sugar Research  Institute to enhance water resource 
<br/>management, ensuring that our farming practices remain resilient, even in the face of water scarcity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week SRIF mobilised heavy treatments to the banks of the Ba River to 
<br/>test the feasibility of deploying large irrigation systems which will be available on loan to farmers. 
<br/>The  system  being  tested,  featured  high-capacity  centrifugal  pumps  capable  of  delivering 
<br/>approximately 780 litres of water per minute to the sprinkler configuration design to cover significant 
<br/>areas. This development is a testament to our commitment to provide practical and scalable solutions 
<br/>to our farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  research  efforts  excel  beyond  immediate  solutions,  SRIF  has  been 
<br/>diligently  working  on  the  development  and  promotion  of  drought  resistant  sugarcane  varieties  as 
<br/>well. These varieties are more resilient to water stress and have potential to maintain better yields 
<br/>under the challenging conditions. This long term research is crucial in ensuring that our farmers are 
<br/>equipped with better tools to withstand future climate challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  the  research,  SRIF  together  with  FSC,  had  intensified  their  outreach  and 
<br/>extension  services,  educating  farmers  on  the  best  practices  for  managing  crops  during  drought 
<br/>conditions. Workshops, field days and on-farm demonstrations are being conducted to ensure that 
<br/>our farmers have access to the latest information and techniques. Sir, SRIF is advising farmers on 
<br/>soil health management with the retention, mulching, and potential use of bio-fertiliZers to sustain 
<br/>growth during dry periods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry along with SRIF and FSC is leaving no stones unturned in our 
<br/></span><span>efforts to assist farmers during this challenging period. The measures we are implementing are not 
<br/>just an immediate response but are part of a broader long term strategy to build a more resilient and 
<br/>sustainable  sugar  industry.  We  will  remain  committed  to  supporting  our  farmers,  shaping  their 
<br/>livelihoods, ensuring the continued prosperity of the sugar industry for the benefit of all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers have lost triple of their income due to drought 
<br/></span><span>and also they have commitments and loans with the banks and the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. For 
<br/></span><span>25 seasons, the production, they will need more money to bring back the production. Also, I have 
<br/>seen around the ratoons are drying up, for the truck owners and truck drivers if there is less cane than 
<br/>less income. Cane cutters, less income as there is less cane to be harvested. Cooperatives also face 
<br/>less income because expenses have increased because of the fuel cost et cetera.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the farmers be compensated to some level with some cash grants? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Minister before you reply to that question. Who 
<br/>decides if the country is going through a drought? Why I am asking this, because during our time in 
<br/>Government, the Government has to decide, that is why we get this funds that is available… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! Nothing has been done so far! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- …to help the farmers, even giving loans. But here, who decides? Is it the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmer or Meteorological Services or the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the drought issue, of course, the Meteorological Office declares the drought and that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when the emergency strikes in but during the reply to the honourable Member ….   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, the question that he is raising is part of the question 
<br/>that I am raising to you.  If that decision lies with the Meteorological Service, the Government should 
<br/>be declaring that there is a drought.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I leave it to the honourable Minister for NDMO, once 
<br/>he declares then obviously everything else kicks in. But replying to the honourable Pillay, he should 
<br/>remember that in the midst of 1999, there was a major drought in this country. At that time when the 
<br/>SVT Government was there, they actually gave out massive grant to the farmers for replanting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am coming back to that. The same Prime Minister is here today.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen, you are not a cane farmer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  very  mindful,  I  declare  my  interest  because  I  am  a  cane  farmer.    The  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  is  also  a  cane 
<br/>farmer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Coming back to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we are monitoring it, we are 
<br/>very  mindful  and  once  we  get  some  indication  from  FSC  on  what  the  farmers  require,  we  will 
<br/>definitely act on it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no assessment done so far.  It is not only the 
<br/>sugarcane farmers who are affected, it is also the crop and livestock farmers those who are under the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  those  who  have  been  assisted.    So,  I  urge  the  Government  if  an 
<br/></span><span>assessment can be done because if there is no assistance given to the farmers, we will continue to see 
<br/>a decline in the production in the coming years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He answers himself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes, that is a statement.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The only thing now is you get  that policy done.  Yes, honourable Rinesh, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you still on the drought too? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to start off by saying, if one is smart enough, they will never say a question is 
<br/>stupid.  The question to the honourable Minister for Sugar, he has spoken about the low production 
<br/>of cane  audit has been seen a lot on social media that complaints are being raised about the long 
<br/>waiting hours at the FSC Mill to offload the cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- The question is coming.  What is your Ministry doing in order to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>combat this issue of long hours drivers take waiting? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a new question and I can come back to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- When will you come back? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- In the next session.

<div><span>Proposed Bus Fare Increase by FCCC 
<br/>(Question No. 202/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics, update Parliament on the proposed increase 
<br/>in students bus fares by the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  The Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) undertook a review of the 
<br/>existing bus fares.  The review has been completed and FCCC has adopted a new fare calculation 
<br/>methodology in consultation with the Fiji Bus Operators Association.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker Sir, the regulated student fare is set at 50 percent of the adult fare at 
<br/></span><span>every stage. So, in other words, they were the bus companies which were kind of subsidizing the 
<br/></span><span>other 50 percent. This long-standing formula is based on the principle that adult fares cross-subsidise 
<br/>the  lower  student  fares  and  in  the  past  the  Land  Transport  Authority  allowed  a  relatively  higher 
<br/>number  of  students  to  be  accommodated  in  a  school  bus  compared  to  the  adult  passenger  limit. 
<br/>However, this policy has been changed and revised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  new  methodology,  the  FCCC  recommended  that  student  fares  be  increased  to 
<br/>approximately 100 percent of the adult fares. This proposed doubling of student fares, Mr. Speaker 
<br/>Sir, will have a significant financial impact on the Government because the Government will continue 
<br/></span><span>to subsidise them. So as part of the Transport Assistance Programme, the Government currently fully 
<br/></span><span>subsidizes the transportation costs for students  from  families with  household  income of less than 
<br/>$16,000 per annum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  apart  from  bus  services,  the  scheme  also  covers  for  Rural  Service  License  (RSL) 
<br/>operators  and  boat  services  in  the  rural  and  maritime  schools.  In  the  2024-2025  Budget,  the 
<br/>Government has allocated a total of $37 million to cater for the transport assistance. There are  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>1846 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>currently about 90,000 students benefiting from this programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the doubling of student fares, the additional cost exposure for subsidized students with 
<br/>blue cards is projected to be around $18 million. Apart from this, there are currently non-subsidized 
<br/>students with yellow cards paying the full fare of 50 percent of adult fares. With the bus fares doubled, 
<br/>the additional cost to these students will be around $5 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet has approved that no additional cost will be borne by any student 
<br/>or their families. Government will therefore subsidise the additional increase in the fares. The total 
<br/>additional estimated cost for transportation subsidy for students with blue cards and yellow cards is 
<br/>around  $23  million  for  2023-2024  budget.  The  current  funding  provision  in  the  budget  will 
<br/>accommodate the increased cost for approximately six to seven months of the new financial year and 
<br/>Cabinet has approved that additional funding will have to be sourced through a budget redeployment 
<br/>later during the year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it is also important to note that the RSL providers transporting students have 
<br/>also been asking for fare increases which have remained stagnant for a number of years like the bus 
<br/>fares. It was discussed during the Budget deliberations that the Ministry of Education will work with 
<br/>the FCCC on the fare determination for RSL operators. The cost implications can only be ascertained 
<br/>after the review.  However, for the transportation subsidy for students with blue cards and yellow 
<br/>cards, this will continue until further notice.

<div><span>Combatting Surge in Drug Trafficking and Usage 
<br/>(Question No. 203/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the 94 percent increase in illicit drug cases recorded in January 2024, can 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Home Affairs and Immigration state what specific measures 
<br/>is the Ministry implementing to combat the surge drug trafficking and usage but clearly 
<br/>concerning methamphetamine and marijuana?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/>The issue of drugs continues to take the centre stage of our discussions on how it has affected our 
<br/>Fijian  community,  especially  our  children.    Recently  there  has  been  a  spike  of  drug  cases  being 
<br/>reported and arrests that have been made.  If I might allude first to the percentage that is alluded to 
<br/></span><span>in the question the 94 percent between the period from January 2023 to January of this year, that 
<br/></span><span>figure has come about because the police have been able to arrest more people.  That has been the 
<br/>reason for the numbers now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had commented earlier in an interview that to me, that is a good thing because now we are 
<br/>catching a lot more people. It means that the police, despite in the past, are much more freer to do 
<br/>these arrests and do their work freely according to the law.  As a consequence, they have been able 
<br/>to arrest more people perhaps in the course of their raids, they have been able to capture more drugs 
<br/>as we have heard of the cases in Legalega and also in Meingunyah in Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we continue as a government to raise awareness on this issue and for the Ministry, 
<br/>we have two particular, at least all of the agencies that are under my portfolio, Immigration, Police 
<br/>and also  the the Anti-Narcotics  Bureau have been going  out extensively  to  the public conducting 
<br/>awareness on drugs, not only by themselves, but also with the use of the community, that is, both the 
<br/></span><span>vanua, lotu </span><span>and civil society in every way possible. I think there is a lot of debate out there now on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1847 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the social media creating awareness.  This is the best thing we can do because at the end of the day, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe and if I might just steal one of the statements made earlier on by the honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar with regards to her statement on AMR, raised earlier by the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health, the whole campaign is about to help people how to make choices. That is the only thing really 
<br/>that we have in our control, so the police can go and raid, people can go into court and that is what 
<br/>is happening.  Any case that comes up, we raid the houses like the case in Lautoka but the thing that 
<br/>we would like to achieve more and that is what we are doing right now in our public campaign is 
<br/>involve our agencies by telling our people, say no to drugs, do not do it, do not engage in it, do not 
<br/>sell it. If you know what is happening, then you must report it to the police or the appropriate agency.  
<br/>That is the only way to control it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also at the same time, we are strengthening all of the units within the Police including that 
<br/>within Immigration and the Ministry to try and stop these drugs from arriving here.  A lot of that is 
<br/>to do our work with our partners; Australia, New Zealand, Americans and the French to be able to 
<br/>halt drugs or gather information as they are coming to our shores because once they land here, it is 
<br/>very hard for us to stop it and the only way to stop it for us, is to motivate and inform our people to 
<br/>stop indulging in drugs.  You must make the informed choice, do not use drugs and if you know of 
<br/>anyone who is peddling drugs, you come out and tell the police, you come out and tell the authorities, 
<br/>that really is the only thing we can do.  We are a small state.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the police in the efforts that they are making.  They come under a lot of 
<br/>criticism obviously, they are being mentioned in this House many times before, but since lately, they 
<br/>have been able to up the ante.  With the police reset, we should be able to do more and also with now 
<br/>coming  up  of  the  Narcotics  Bureau;  the  police  and  Narcotic  Bureau  are  now  working  together, 
<br/>sharing information with our partners and that way, we are able to work better, but we are always 
<br/>talking about our children and the youth consuming drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our effort,  the parents,  I will say it again,  parents,  their children, it is  not  the state or the 
<br/>church  or  the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>,  it  is  first  their  responsibility  to  teach  their  children  do  not  do  drugs.    The 
<br/>conversation is out there, the Government is supporting it, police is arresting people every day.  This 
<br/>case in Lautoka the other day, the police went in to raid a house where they confiscated cocaine, a 
<br/>significant amount in US dollars.  What did they do?  They released their two Rottweilers, and the 
<br/>police were able to handle these dogs and these are killer dogs. This is something that they had been 
<br/>able to do.  I would like to thank them because they are at the forefront of this work.  But to help 
<br/></span><span>them, our community must tell the members of its community, parents must tell children, “Do not do 
<br/></span><span>drugs.”  Police can only do so much; the rest is up to us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  agree  with  the  honourable  Minister  that 
<br/>security border control is a national priority.  I would like to just highlight a case to the honourable 
<br/>Minister that 14.4 kilogrammes of methamphetamine had transited through Fiji from a 24-year old 
<br/>lady from Vancouver, Fiji to Brisbane, and those gaps of exploitation is corroding the DNA of our 
<br/>children, our society and our country as a whole.  After this, honourable Minister, what has changed 
<br/>about the security checks at our airports that Fiji does not remain a point where transits of such drugs 
<br/></span><span>are caught in the future?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  addressed  this  matter  over  a  press 
<br/>conference and some statements before.  I think the procedure under international aviation, when you 
<br/>connect to a destination, your baggage goes straight from the aircraft that you came from to the next 
<br/>aircraft.  I think that is kind of acceptable.  It is only when they come inshore that they go through 
<br/>the checks before they land on the carousels, and that is how we check them.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I think, it also suggests that maybe those in the aviation industry in the world, for those 
<br/>of us in Fiji who decide the policy on this matter, it is not only up to us, it is a global thing on how 
<br/>to try and detect things as they are going from one plane to another.  I think under the current laws, 
<br/>it is from your destination of departure, your next check is your destination of arrival, and that is how 
<br/>it got  captured.  That  is definitely something to consider, and hopefully,  in  the future, those who 
<br/>decide on the international policies to do with transiting luggage, would be able to make some good 
<br/>policy decisions to prevent drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, have we engaged with our development partners, 
<br/>because this is a situation that requires assistance, especially with our borders being porous and the 
<br/>vast open seas that we have?  Have we engaged with our development partners to see if we can get 
<br/>assistance to cover the sea in a better fashion than we do - to seek assistance for that rather than just 
<br/>relying on our own Navy, which we know may not be able to cover the whole sea that we have, 
<br/>maybe more ships or more coastal guards from that perspective?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the short answer is, yes.  There is an elaborate 
<br/>partnership programme, and I had alluded to that earlier, with our traditional partners in this regard.  
<br/>In the Navy, it has always been an ongoing thing.  One of the latest things is under the United Nations 
<br/>Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime  (UNODC).  We  now  have  the  Pacific  Regional  Vessel  Boarding  and 
<br/>Searching Training facility in Togalevu. So, with the UN and Fiji we teach the regional people on 
<br/>how Australians and Americans come on board under IML and teach our guys how to board a ship 
<br/>and how to detect drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, at the same time, under the Transnational Crime Unit (TCU) and that involves all of 
<br/>our boarder agencies - we work with the Australians and New Zealanders, particularly with Australia 
<br/>under the Ministry of Home Affairs we shared a lot of information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the sea, we are limited in our capacity to be able to physically dominate the space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The short answer there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just completely impossible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing we can have is to coordinate the eyes and the ears that look at the intelligence and 
<br/>to track things as they are coming, and the Navy is very, very good and I had alluded to that earlier. 
<br/>They can tracks ships and boats  out  there, and  we work with all of our other agencies and if we 
<br/>suspect  that there is  a ship  carrying  drugs destined  for Fiji, we have our partners also,  to  help  us 
<br/>intercept these boats as they come. But some actually come through, which is unfortunate as they 
<br/>give us trouble.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, because of our very nature it is difficult to dominate every space, but we do our best with 
<br/>our partners to gather intelligence and we have laws that allows us to board and arrest people together 
<br/>under INTEPOL, with Australia, New Zealand and the friends who are helping us mostly in the areas 
<br/>of looking after our waters. We hear funny stories of those that are dealing drugs have a funny way 
<br/>of changing their tactics. They come underwater, they fly over and they drop beacons in the water. 
<br/>Our communities in the Lau Group and Vanua Levu tell us all these stories about things that float 
<br/>out there in the ocean and they do not know where they come from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we cannot dominate it. We need our friends, and we are very grateful to them for helping 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and enabling us monitor and trying to keep our country and people safe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question is, these drugs are 
<br/>not intended for Fiji. It is intended for other markets like Australia and New Zealand and we are just 
<br/>a transition point. We do the drug busting and while we do that, you know the shipment that should 
<br/>have gone to Australia and New Zealand are not going out and given our border control measures 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1849 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that are here, most of these shipments are trapped here and that is how it spills over into Fiji. Also, 
<br/>when it comes to police custody, its tampered and goes out to the streets. It has become Australia and 
<br/>New Zealand’s drug strategy to dump it here, rather than having the bust at their end. What can be 
<br/>done so that this shipment goes to the intended destination and they deal with this problem? We do 
<br/>not have to deal with these issues and also the impacts to our citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. It is a good question, but a perception at this point really, because we do not invite drugs to 
<br/>come here. It is an assessment that we make, so people assume that for some strange reason, Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand will want to allow the drugs to land here so that they do not land there. I do not 
<br/>know how credible that theory is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But one thing we do ask them though, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our interactions, in terms of the 
<br/>surveillance plans that we do, in terms of the information and intelligence sharing that we do with 
<br/>our partners, that is to try and track these drugs and in the sophisticated ways that they trying to bring 
<br/>it to the South Pacific including Fiji and Australia, we would like them to have a greater influence in 
<br/>the deeper battles in the areas that we do not control. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment we do not have the capacity to do that, they share this information with us. In 
<br/>the Navy, if you go there, you will see how they track ships and satellites, but that information is 
<br/>available out there, you can get on the internet and you can tell which boat is where.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But these are the countries that have the ability to look beyond, right into the US continent or 
<br/>even into Asia. So, we are asking them, when you discover these vessels you should try and interdict 
<br/>as it is in the water. Do not give us the information when it is about to land on our shore. But it is all 
<br/>these drug paddlers, all these people who bring these drugs, it is more convenient for them to, and 
<br/>this is common sense, bring it here to a point where you can consolidate, you have a short distance 
<br/>to take, you work out your plan and then you take it across.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Grid cannot see it unless we get the information. So, that is where the partnership comes in, 
<br/>and I do not think there is a deliberate intension Mr. Speaker, Sir, from our partners to allow these 
<br/>drugs to land here. I think we have </span><span>vuvale</span><span> for that matter, so I do not think they are doing that to us. 
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we move on, the only alarm that this whole scenario has provided 
<br/>for us, as a country, is we should be ready. They have released the fierce dogs to the police, very 
<br/></span><span>soon it will be guns against the police, against the people. It would not be in the too distance future, 
<br/></span><span>with all these hard drugs are here, all the way right to my village in Somosomo. We have all these 
<br/>meths and everything, so it is just a matter of time, and I think we should all be working together 
<br/>ensuring that instead of waiting for Australia and New Zealand to react, it is us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What will happen to our police? Our law enforcement? Even down to the Navy? When you 
<br/>go  around  the  islands  you  see  how  open  and  vulnerable  they  are,  but  now  we  are  dealing  with 
<br/>sophisticated instruments and everything because every now and again a boat comes, something just 
<br/>pops out of the water and there you have it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If they cannot send it to their country or destination, then for sure they will be selling it here, 
<br/>and it is quick money! Given the unemployment and the poverty level that we are fighting strongly 
<br/>against, vulnerable people are quickly influenced and enticed in the usage of this. So, that is the only 
<br/>answer, only reply that I would like to continue to provide is, let us be ready. If there is a need for 
<br/>weapons, then we should have it! To help our people combat this.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government’s commitment is to transform the housing sector 
<br/>is  in  alignment  with  Sustainable  Development  Goal  (SDG)  11,  stands  to  create  sustainable,  safe, 
<br/>inclusive  and  resilience  citizen  communities. This  commitment  reflects  Government’s  priority  to 
<br/>improve  Fijian’s  quality  of  life,  enhancing  access  to  essential  services,  infrastructure  and  by 
<br/>developing a housing sector that is resilient to climate change impacts.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  urbanisation  is  rising  both  globally  within  our  country.  By  2050,  it  is

<br/>additional 30 percent of the population is expected to live in urban areas by 2030. This rapid urban 
<br/>growth necessitates adoption of sustainable practises that integrate land development, promote the 
<br/>legislative reforms in enhancing urban planning. Hence, the need to review 2011, thus, the Housing 
<br/>Policy to cater for the increasing demand in complexities of housing issues.

<br/>sector  policy  changes,  issues  and  gaps  with  key  stakeholders  and  collectively  identify  strategic 
<br/>opportunities and recommend areas of priority or priority policy focus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stakeholders present, which included 60 senior representatives from a broad cross-section of 
<br/>the  housing  sector,  participated  in  thematic  group  discussions.  These  sessions  were  created  to 
<br/>capitalise  on  the  surrounding  wealth  of  knowledge  that  converged  together,  met  with  the  diverse 
<br/>perspectives and priorities shared by participants across the housing sector in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building upon an extensive policy review and development process, the Ministry designed a 
<br/>draft of the revised National Housing Policy. The revised Housing Policy integrated sites generated 
<br/>from thorough background research and stable consultations ensuring strong alignment with Fiji’s 
<br/>Strategic Framework such as the three-year National Development Plan (NDP) 2025-2027, the 5-
