<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under Standing Order 40, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anti-Scam Taskforce and National Scam Awareness Week  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  na  Tui  Cakau</span><span>,  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>fellow  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  Hibiscus  Festival  Queens  and  the  reigning 
<br/>Queen, members in the gallery and the people of Fiji who may be listening to this broadcast either 
<br/>through </span><span>Walesi</span><span> or on radio; </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka</span><span> and good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on various occasions, I get asked the question, how do we think the Government 
<br/>is doing? My response is always very simple, “we are rebuilding a house, a house called our beloved 
<br/>Fiji”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise this morning, Mr. Speaker, to inform this august Parliament on the progress that we 
<br/>have made in establishing the “Anti-Scam Taskforce”, something that the other side did not do, along 
<br/>with  the  recently  concluded  National  Scam  Awareness  Week  that  is  aimed  at  addressing  the 
<br/>escalating threat of scams and the urgent need for a coordinated nationwide approach. This is very 
<br/>much in keeping with the attempt to rebuild Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rapid evolution of technology in Fiji has brought tremendous opportunities for growth, 
<br/>communication, innovation, bridging the tech digital divide and access to these essential financial 
<br/>services.  However,  it  has  also  given  rise  to  a  dark  side  that  we  cannot  ignore  -  the  increasing 
<br/>sophistication and prevalence of scams and unscrupulous behaviour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For a fact, the global economy is increasingly shifting towards digitisation with 4.72 billion 
<br/>internet users that represents 60.1 percent of the global population.  The Global State of Scams Report 
<br/>2022 revealed a concerning trend in digital fraud where reported scams increased by 10.2 percent 
<br/></span><span>from 266 million reports in 2020 to 293 million in 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amount of losses from scams surged by 15.7 percent, rising to 47.8 billion in 2020 and 
<br/>55.3  billion  in  2021,  largely  driven  by  investment  scams.  In  fact,  from  our  neighbouring  shore, 
<br/>Australia, 96 percent of Australian have been exposed to a scam in the last five years with half of 
<br/>these contacted daily or weekly.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen a significant rise in online scams and fraud, with many Fijians 
<br/>falling victim to this deceitful tactics. For instance, the Consumer Council of Fiji has received more 
<br/>than 1,700 complaints in relation to all scams since 2019, worth over $3 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have witnessed various types of scams  and fraud, including online scams that employ 
<br/>phishing emails and text messages, as well as impersonation of business owners, Chief Executives 
<br/>Officers, Industry Captains, to facilitate funds transfers via mobile wallets.  Investment scams, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, have also been on the rise, where fraudsters sell accurate and non-existent products or 
<br/>ideas to desperate investors looking to get rich quickly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  eBay  shop  online  recruitment  scam,  one  of  the  largest  in  Fiji’s  history,  has  had  a 
<br/>devastating  impact  on  our  people  and  brought  national  attention  to  this  growing  threat.  The 
<br/>perpetrators preyed on the trust and hope of individuals, leaving them not only financially crippled, 
<br/>but also deeply disillusioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Consumer Council of Fiji and the Fiji Police Force reported that around $3 million was 
<br/>lost to eBay scams.  However, I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the number is a lot higher and we are 
<br/>awaiting for the report from the Reserve Bank of Fiji, through the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), 
<br/>to properly report the extent of the impact of that scam in Fiji and I can tell you, Sir, that the estimates 
<br/>are quite staggering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government took a decisive action and 
<br/>established the Anti-Scam Taskforce. This multi-agency initiative is aimed at tackling the growing 
<br/>problem of fraud through enhanced scam surveillance, strengthening institutional frameworks and 
<br/>targeted awareness campaigns involving various stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Taskforce also has long-term plans to focus on legislative enhancements (and I will speak 
<br/>about that a bit later) and continued educational programmes to empower vulnerable communities 
<br/>and create a safer online environment for all Fijians through vigilance and collaboration. In fact, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, there may well be a need to create a scam agency on its own, given the way things are 
<br/>evolving.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Taskforce, chaired by myself, unites representatives from diverse Government agencies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and private sectors, including the:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consumer Council of Fiji;  
<br/></span><span>Fijian Commerce and Consumer Commission;  
<br/></span><span>Online Safety Commission;  
<br/>Fiji Police Force;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Local Government;  
<br/>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Reserve Bank of Fiji;  
<br/>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Fiji Rugby Union; 
<br/>(8)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Office of the Solicitor-General; and  
<br/>(9)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Telco partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To effectively tackle the increasing prevalence of scams in Fiji, a comprehensive approach is 
<br/></span><span>essential. That is why telecommunication providers, such as Vodafone Fiji and Digicel Fiji, are very 
<br/>much part of this Taskforce, to address the issue of scams more effectively across the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just last week, the most significant initiative spearheaded by the Anti-Scam 
<br/>Taskforce took place - the National Scams Awareness Week. This week-long campaign is a strategic 
<br/>response to the growing threat of scams, designed to educate, engage and empower the general public,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1797 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly our youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The centrepiece of the National Scams Awareness Week was the national symposium held in 
<br/>Suva with over 200 participants participating for the three days. This symposium brought together a 
<br/>diverse group of stakeholders, including Government officials, private sector leaders, representatives 
<br/>from international organisations, technical experts and civil society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  acknowledge  and  thank  the  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund 
<br/>(UNCDF), the Pacific Digital Economy Programme (PDEP), and the Governments of Australia, New 
<br/>Zealand and the European Union, for bringing the National Scams Awareness Week to life. In the 
<br/>span of three days, a series of insightful panel discussions and presentations provided an overview 
<br/>of the challenges related to scam prevention in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we focused particularly on our youth on the final day, as we believe that 
<br/>they  are  front  and  centre  in  terms  of  advocating  for  National  Scam  Prevention  because  of  their 
<br/>prowess  with  mobile  phones  and  technology.  The  youth  from  three  Universities  participated  in  a 
<br/>debate and were considered quite successful. This is only the start, Sir, and we will continue this to 
<br/>ensure that our people protect themselves from this raging scourge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  initiative  extends  beyond  National  Scam  Awareness  Week,  as  the 
<br/>Taskforce actively promotes awareness through billboards across Suva right now, and we hope to 
<br/>move them around the  country. Right now, we have billboards in Vatuwaqa Primary School  and 
<br/>Nakasi roundabout.  Additionally, in partnership with Vodafone Fiji, SMS blasts have been sent out 
<br/>and will continue to be disseminated to further enhance public awareness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Consumer Council of Fiji has launched the National TikTok Competition. This initiative 
<br/>aims to engage our youth and encourage them to create and share more impactful content that raises 
<br/>awareness about the importance of recognising and avoiding scams.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to these national initiatives, the Consumer Council of Fiji has 
<br/>taken the lead in conducting community visits and workshops throughout the country. These face-
<br/>to-face interactions are particularly in areas where access to digital platforms maybe limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By bringing the message directly to the people, we ensure that scam awareness is not just a 
<br/>topic of discussion but is a lived reality. These workshops involve traders, schools, universities and 
<br/>local community groups. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, community engagement is more than ever crucial in our fight against scams. 
<br/>By working with local leaders, community groups and the civil society, we can foster a culture of 
<br/>vigilance and mutual support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Partnerships with the private sector, particularly with industries such as telecommunications 
<br/>and banking, are also critical. These partnerships can help us deploy resources more effectively and 
<br/>ensure that our efforts are coordinated and comprehensive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Taskforce is creating a nationwide awareness on the ongoing scams onshore, I am 
<br/></span><span>pleased  to  inform  this  august  Parliament  that  an  important  initiative  to  strengthen  the  legislative 
<br/>framework is underway, with the support of our donor agencies. This review will be benchmarked 
<br/>against international best practices, ensuring that the laws are not only up-to-date, but also effective 
<br/>in addressing the evolving nature of scams. The consultant who is going to be appointed, intends to 
<br/>provide  key  recommendations  for  areas  of  change,  helping  us  to  align  our  legal  framework  with 
<br/>global standards and enhance our capacity to protect our citizens. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to give an example of how weak our laws are, if a scam is identified and everyone in the 
<br/>country is aware, unless there is a Police complaint, there is really nothing that can be done. Thus, 
<br/>we are hoping that through these legislative changes, if the Reserve Bank of Fiji sees a scam, for 
<br/>example, and identifies it as a scam, they will intervene at that point which will mitigate significantly 
<br/>the impact of scams that we are currently experiencing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the FCCC has joined the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) and the Oceanic 
<br/>Chapter of the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, to enhance its capability to tackle scams more effectively. 
<br/>It  is  aimed  to  raise  awareness,  provide  practical  tools,  facilitate  knowledge  sharing  and  conduct 
<br/>research educational events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  this  partnership,  the  FCCC  has  gained  access  to  critical  tools  such  as,  the 
<br/>ScamAdvisor platform, which enables better direct detection and filtering of potential harmful online 
<br/>scams.  Moreover, the wealth of shared knowledge and expertise within GASA will be instrumental 
<br/>in strengthening our defences against emerging threats.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with these efforts, FCCC is also conducting a state of scams survey in collaboration 
<br/>with GASA. The survey is anticipated to provide valuable insights into the types of scams affecting 
<br/>Fijians and identify strategies for more targeted and effective intervention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are well aware of what we are doing in terms of cybersecurity and you 
<br/>have, on occasions, mentioned it in this Parliament.  The Government, of course, is actively investing 
<br/>in the safety and security of its citizens in the digital space.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of our major initiatives is developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. This important 
<br/>strategy  will  strengthen  our  cybersecurity  posture,  boost  resilience,  and  improve  our  ability  to 
<br/>respond to the ever-evolving cyber threats.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Concurrently, Fiji has also deposited its Instruments of Accession of the Budapest Convention 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was done on a bipartisan basis through this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, we must acknowledge that the issue of scams  is  not unique to  Fiji.  In fact, 
<br/>many of the tactics used by scammers in Fiji are imported or inspired by similar fraudulent schemes 
<br/>that have successfully been executed in other countries.  Countries like the United States, Australia, 
<br/>the United Kingdom, despite their advanced technological infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, 
<br/>continue to grapple with the challenge of preventing and mitigating scams.  These nations have seen 
<br/></span><span>a rise in various forms of online fraud, from phising, identity theft, to complex investment scams that 
<br/></span><span>have cost individuals and businesses billions of dollars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through various means and advocacy on scams and fraud protection, I have always said, and 
<br/>would like to reiterate in this august House, that if the offer seems too good to be true, it is likely to 
<br/>be a scam.  Proceed with extreme caution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us build a brighter future for the general public where trusts, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>integrity and security is upheld.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It, kind of, brings home the  fact that I was raising, honourable Members, 
<br/>on how we could utilise the parliamentary process which is now available, in shortening the long 
<br/>road to getting something done.  Whether it is Cabinet, or the directive should come from honourable 
<br/>Ministers themselves to the House for Committees to scrutinise and do oversight roles to be enabled 
<br/>to do so.

<div><span>At this juncture, I would like to adjourn the House for tea, and in so doing, the Contestants 
<br/>have asked that they take a photo shoot with the honourable Prime Minister and you, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, at our front steps of the building.  Immediately after that, then you can share 
<br/>some tea with the Contestants as well.  I am not forgetting you, Madam, the reigning Queen.   The 
<br/>Parliament is adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.19 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I will now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his designate, to make his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  for  his  statement  this  morning  on  the  Anti-
<br/>Scam and National Scam Awareness Week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  easy  to  get  into  the  digital  space  and  there  is  a  desire  for  complete 
<br/>digitisation,  especially  in  Fiji,  but  along  with  it  and  as  rightfully  pointed  out  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, there is a dark side attached to it and especially now, with artificial intelligence also, there 
<br/>is a lot that goes on that needs for us to attend to with respect to scams, et cetera.  By and large, we 
<br/>seem to be also a very gullible population when it comes to these things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  there  are  quite  few  measures  that  can  occur,  and  one  of  the  most  important 
<br/>cornerstones of all of these would be, and I hope this is the case with the Attorney-General’s Office, 
<br/>that the laws need to be strengthened in order to ensure that these things do not take place.  So, I hope 
<br/>that there is a Bill on the Attorney-General’s table that is going to take this into a better space for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a worldwide phenomenon that has been looked at by everyone, and I think one of the 
<br/>trophy cases is actually what has been done in Singapore.  I think we could learn a lot from it and I 
<br/>am sure the honourable Minister has seen what has actually taken place.  Some things that are helpful 
<br/>to ensuring that we do not have scams, et cetera, is also trying to help and assist those that have been 
<br/>part of it, like anti-scam helplines, et cetera, and it requires also that different Ministries collaborate 
<br/>with each other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, in Fiji, probably have more SIM cards than we have people, and I think 
<br/>this is something that needs to be looked at in terms of addressing how you can actually restrict the 
<br/>SIM cards so that we can keep a track of what is actually happening and this is a very important tool 
<br/>that has actually been used in other countries where you restrict the number of SIM cards that are 
<br/>actually issued to a particular person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think in light of the fact that it requires a lot of heavy involvement from all the 
<br/>stakeholders,  I  think  the  sector  that  needs  to  step  up  also  in  this  is  the  banks,  to  ensure  that  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry is able to do what is necessary and nationally speaking, it is a national problem.  It is not a 
<br/></span><span>political problem, it is something that needs to be dealt with at a different scale, and there are three 
<br/>parts of the society that need to ensure that they are very well versed on this, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>elderly; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>youth; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>our parents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digital education is one of the major things that can help us fight scams, et cetera, that actually 
<br/></span><span>occur nowadays.  What I am actually saying, Mr. Speaker, is that improving digital literacy is an 
<br/></span><span>important tool in fighting these particular scams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope the honourable Minister will be ensuring that the banks play an integral part.  There 
<br/>are massive profits that they actually make, so they can probably send some of those profits back to 
<br/>putting things into institutions that put us in a better space. The National Scam Awareness Week has 
<br/>actually worked well, and I commend the honourable Minister in actually making sure that something  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1801 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is done regarding all of these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look at, maybe, an anti-scam centre.  I know there is one in Singapore, Mr. Speaker, that 
<br/>has been replicated already in Hong Kong.  So, these are examples for us to use and, hopefully, Sir, 
<br/>we can actually get to the bottom of this and to ensure that we actually protect our population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must remember, Sir, that it is not even about $100,000 scam.  For Fiji, even the loss of a 
<br/>$100 through a scam is actually worth a lot to a particular person in Fiji.  So, we must ensure that we 
<br/>get this right and the start point, as I have said right from the beginning, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that 
<br/>we must ensure that we have the proper legal framework done and it needs to be done at breakneck 
<br/>speed to ensure that we actually have that particular foundation for what we need to do to protect our 
<br/>people.  I thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement presented 
<br/>by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  before  I  go  any  further,  I  must  acknowledge  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister for updating this august House on the progress made by the Anti-Scam Taskforce and the 
<br/>National Scam Awareness Week which concluded on 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in an era dominated by digital connectivity, the rise of cyber-related criminal 
<br/>activities has reached unprecedented levels.  Therefore, I commend the Coalition Government for 
<br/>setting up the Anti-Scam Taskforce last year, and I hope and pray that the Taskforce will continue to 
<br/>function and uphold their roles independently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, scammers exist and have made Fiji their home, and I would recommend that 
<br/>more awareness  must be conducted nationwide,  especially  in  rural  areas  and in  our schools  from 
<br/>primary to secondary level.  Our children must be involved in such awareness programmes so that 
<br/>they would be more vigilant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from experience, I have come across Fijian youth being the target of cybercrime. 
<br/>Youth  were  promised  with  overseas  employment  by  paying  lump  sum  of  money.  With  constant 
<br/></span><span>reminders by the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, youth and members 
<br/></span><span>of our society continue to ignore and were easily lured by the perpetrators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a few times, I would be informing the Criminal Investigation Department of 
<br/>possible scam activities and twice, I had assisted the CID in nabbing the main suspect in the wee 
<br/>hours.  It is a very sadful experience to see our fellow Fijians, especially our youth disheartened as 
<br/>most of these youth are unemployed and becoming victims of such evil activity is uncalled for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would strongly recommend that stricter laws and harsher punishments must 
<br/></span><span>be introduced that will deter scammers and future likeminded members of our society.  I thank you, 
<br/></span><span>once again, for this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this is  my  second time in  stressing this, that this 
<br/>morning  has  transpired  with  some  historic  attachment  to  it  because  three  Reports  from  Standing 
<br/>Committees all indicated, through initiatives made by the former government, that investigations be 
<br/>done, and it took all these time to land their report in this House.  By the time the report reached us

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this morning, the file has disappeared, very important people who were involved are no longer there, 
<br/>so we are talking about scams of late by the Deputy Prime Minister He was saying to strengthen the 
<br/>law, and this is because of the interconnectivity of the digital process that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last  few days, we did  not  conclude the day by continuing  with the agenda that has 
<br/>already been agreed upon because we were not connected to some digital thing that was linked to the 
<br/>Prime Minister’s Office, that is, the Govnet.  When the power broke down, everything stood still.  
<br/>We could not function, and I thought Parliament was supposed to be independent – have their own 
<br/>server, et cetera.  But, again, it beats me, and I got very angry that afternoon because this is not the 
<br/>way we are supposed to work here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have reports coming before us, and for me, it is the first time during my tenure as 
<br/>Speaker to come across cases where they have been initiated by government.  That was from our 
<br/>former  Minister  for  Housing,  honourable  Premila  Kumar,  who  initiated  that  investigation  be 
<br/>undertaken but it is only, kind of, a futile exercise that they undertook because the files went missing.  
<br/>Even the former Minister, honourable Bala, is arguing that he was not notified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine, honourable Members, we are hearing that in this House.  This is where we deal with 
<br/>all these laws – the repealing and amendment of laws.  We can only do it if the processes are there, 
<br/>no  matter  how  much  you  try  to  educate  the  young  of  Fiji  today  to  learn  more  about  digital  and 
<br/>connectivity, et cetera, it still does not hammer home the fact that we tried, and we never succeeded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  understand  that  may  be,  Cabinet  should  be  instructing  the  House,  just  like  honourable 
<br/>Ministers do inform the House that this should be referred to a Standing Committee.  Likewise, we 
<br/>should  also  take  the  opportunity  that  we  have  here.    We  have  scrutiny  and  oversight  role  now 
<br/>available for you, honourable Members, to undertake this at a much more faster pace than what the 
<br/>Committee undertakes, and you are able to zero in straight into the cause of the problems that exist.  
<br/>I am only raising this out of concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, we do respect you, Sir, and the honourable Members of Cabinet, 
<br/>we  would  like  to  see  that  more  is  done.    Maybe,  the  Cabinet  Sub-Committee  make  directions  to 
<br/>Parliament that this should be investigated, scrutiny and oversight role should be done here, so then 
<br/>that will allow us to kick in, and we see that this is being done straightaway, like they do in various 
<br/>jurisdictions in Australia and New Zealand.  It just comes automatically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As soon as the word comes from the honourable Prime Minister’s Executive Government, 
<br/></span><span>“We need some investigation to be undertaken here.  How did this person get the job?”  Now, the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry is in a mess, taxpayers’ fund, honourable Members, is being affected, and that is what we 
<br/>are all here for, to scrutinize.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was asked during the campaign of 2018 in Sydney, Australia, “You pray for a government 
<br/>to  take  over,  now  that  the  FijiFirst  has  taken  over.    You  pray  for  Fijians  to  lead,  now  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister is Mr. Bainimarama.  What more do you want?”  I said, “Yes.  We have some democracy 
<br/>now, we have a government in place, half loaf is better than none.  But that is all we have, we do not 
<br/>have full democracy.”  We were kind of a democracy that in every step, it is like a locked step.  It is 
<br/></span><span>being dictated by whoever was in charge at that time.  But these are the things that we have to address, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I would like to stress this once again, 60 cases were highlighted by the Chairperson of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Public Accounts.  That is quite a number of cases.  Then all of a sudden, you 
<br/>cannot do anything on it.  It makes a mockery of all the systems that we have.  I apologise on that, 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and honourable Members of the Government, but that needs to be echoed

<div><span>Combating the Brain Drain Phenomena in the Tourism Industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and  gentlemen;  in  the  tourism  industry,  the  challenge 
<br/>before us is to combat the issue of brain drain.  This challenge is central to ensuring the sustainable 
<br/>growth of our tourism industry which serves as a cornerstone of our nation’s economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the reality about our economy today is that it is bullish, 
<br/>which is very different from what detractors were saying that our economy was going nowhere.  On 
<br/>Friday, Westpac Fiji reviewed its position on the Fiji economy which it had downgraded initially due 
<br/>to, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Stronger than expected sentiments and growth in tourism.  The tourism numbers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are a lot stronger than we expected.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further adding, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The new Fiji Airways service to Dallas is a growth driver, it is a big positive.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The signing of the new Air Service Agreement made in Fiji and USA early last week in Tonga 
<br/>will  open  vast  possibilities  in  the  US  as  articulated  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  in  his 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on Tuesday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of banks, ANZ had earlier upgraded its forecast for Fiji, pegging it at 3.4 percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also riding on the back of tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are committed to creating world-class training facilities that will drive 
<br/>Fiji’s tourism industry forward.   Our strategy includes collaboration with private sector stakeholders 
<br/>and the development of cutting-edge facilities that meet the highest global standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is blessed that a good number of international brands are operating in 
<br/>our country, and I can venture to say they have found a home in Fiji.  These brands have their culture 
<br/>with their ethos, systems and standards that are global and available to our people once they become 
<br/></span><span>part of the brands in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people acquire skills that are marketable globally, that is, it is the easiest way to become 
<br/>a global citizen and after a few years with a brand in Fiji, you qualify to join any of that brand’s 
<br/>property globally. And brands are an indication to travellers that a destination has quality offerings.  
<br/>Let me highlight some of the programmes with the brands hotel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Marriott  Fiji  Training  Academy  offers  structured  training  in  key  areas  such  as  Front 
<br/>Office Operations, Housekeeping Operations, Food and Beverage Service Operations and Kitchen 
<br/></span><span>Operations.  They would have trained some 800 professionals of late.  I was asking the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister  for  Education  of  the  possibility  of  linking  this  Academy  to  the  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission  and  thereby  strengthen  partnership  with  the  Government.    The  Marriot  properties 
<br/>comprise Sheraton Resort and Sheraton Villas, Westin, Marriot Momi and Sheraton Tokoriki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Radisson Blu Fiji is renowned for its robust Train the Trainer programme designed to 
<br/>continuously enhance the knowledge and skills of its people, ensuring that they remain competitive

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and well-prepared for the demands of the traveller today known for its high expectations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hilton has its own Hilton University which is available online for every single position in the 
<br/>industry.  The  courses  include  programmes  from  Harvard,  Lausanne  and  Cornell  Universities,  the 
<br/>three top universities in tourism in the world today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Hilton has a dedicated recruitment executive who recruits on “attitude” and “desire to learn” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as Hilton can train the candidates with skills across most of their businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  three  consecutive  occasions,  Hilton  has  been  awarded  the  Great  Place  to  Work 
<br/>Certification, a global recognition and says much for Hilton in Fiji.  They also won the Regional 
<br/>Team Member Promise Award for Hilton Australasia and the South Pacific which include Australia, 
<br/>New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>InterContinental has seen staff members that departed Fiji return and take back their positions 
<br/>which  is  attributed  to  the  culture  at  InterContinental.  It  has  a  robust  training  and  development 
<br/>programme for its people and evident in all it is Fiji’s properties, that is, Natadola, Holiday Inn, GPH 
<br/>and Crowne Plaza. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shangri-La, the largest resort with some 700 staff members had seen high attrition rates for 
<br/>its people at levels 1 to 3 mostly to Australia and New Zealand.  It has implemented robust hiring 
<br/>and retention strategies including partnerships with educational institutions for training programmes, 
<br/>cross exposure with sister properties and internal promotions for filling critical managerial positions. 
<br/>The training programmes in Shangri-La are tailor-made to suit Fiji are categorized at three levels:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Essential; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Functional; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Leadership Trainings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The past two years have seen intense activities and many challenges post pandemic, they have 
<br/>done very well and known to be a top performer in the Shangri-La Group.  The global brands are 
<br/>known for how well they look after their people, for instance, in the case of Sofitel: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>minimum wage is much higher than the national minimum wage and within three months 
<br/>it increases by 5 percent; 
<br/>bonus scheme are tied to business performance and attendance, that is, if you are not absent 
<br/></span><span>for more than four days, bonus would be in the range of $1,200 net by year end; 
<br/></span><span>access to senior management training, including external placements such as in Australia 
<br/>and even France 
<br/>full medical family insurance for middle management and above 
<br/>educational assistance for courses that benefit both their career and the organisation 
<br/>dedicated learning and development division running a minimum 800 hours of training per 
<br/>month 
<br/>after  six  months  staff  can  apply  for  internal  cross  training  for  other  positions  available 
<br/>within the Resort.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other brands such as Outrigger, Warwick and Wyndham are also operating in Fiji, all with 
<br/>well-established programmes to recruit and train to retain staff. And, of course, we have our very 
<br/>own  Tanoa  Group  with  properties  in  Fiji  and  the  region.    Independent  operators  have  their  own 
<br/>programmes and most are emulating what the big brands are doing.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  recent  phenomenon  is  the  conversion  from  Independent  to  Brand  and 
<br/>many are going that way after COVID-19.  Pre-COVID brands were growing their portfolios mostly 
<br/>through  new  properties  and  less  on  conversion  at  the  ratio  of  80:20  percent;  80  percent  for  new 
<br/>properties,  20  percent  for  conversions.    But  now,  it  is  40  percent  new  properties  and  60  percent 
<br/>conversions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As recently announced, Vanua Levu will have its first brand through Wyndham in Labasa, 
<br/>owned by the Damodar Group.  The hoteliers are all part of Fiji Hotels Tourism Association (FHTA), 
<br/>the  pre-eminent  tourism industry  association  that  represents  their  interests.  Sir,  FHTA  has  a  very 
<br/>powerful voice and plays a big role in combating the brain drain phenomenon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Aviation Services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our aviation sector is a critical component of Fiji's 
<br/>tourism industry, and we have invested heavily in world-class training facilities. Unfortunately, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the brain drain phenomenon is quite severe in aviation. According to International Civil 
<br/>Aviation Organization (ICAO), the number of passenger and cargo numbers will double by 2036. 
<br/>This will call for more pilots, more engineers, more air traffic controllers and other related aviation 
<br/>jobs.  Countries will poach from each other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National University (FNU) is gearing up to this challenge. At its Nadi campus, it 
<br/>trains our people for Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineering (LAME).  It runs for three years 
<br/>taking in 30 intakes each year, the application is about 200 and 300 each year but they can only take 
<br/>30.  Sir, FNU will be adopting the New Zealand standards which takes two years and graduates can 
<br/>qualify for jobs in the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand.  FNU is looking at doubling its 
<br/>graduates each year and the Government of Australia through DFAT is playing a huge supporting 
<br/>role following the visit of the honourable Pat Conroy a few months ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FNU will expand into pilot training and is grateful that Fiji Airways has donated an A330 
<br/>Maintenance and Flight Training Device (MFTD) flying simulator to help in this area. This expansion 
<br/>will cost some $10 million, FNU in Nadi, today is a centre for aviation in the Pacific with huge cost 
<br/>benefits to our neighbours, that is, it costs 10 times as much more to train in Australia than in Fiji, 
<br/>for the cost in Fiji is 10 percent of what they would pay if they trained in Australia or New Zealand.  
<br/>We are also in discussion with certain governments in underwriting a Master's programme in aviation 
<br/>through FNU.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports Limited operates the Fiji Airports Aviation Academy, offering 
<br/>specialized  courses  in  Air  Traffic  Management  (ATM),  Aviation  Fire  Fighting  Services  and  Air 
<br/></span><span>Traffic Safety Electronic Personnel under the Aviation Training Institute Certificate issued by CAAF.  
<br/></span><span>All the courses are recognised by ICAO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The training equips its people to manage the Nadi Fight Information Region (Nadi FIR) which 
<br/>covers some 6 million square kilometres in the Pacific, managed from Nadi.  Of course, such highly 
<br/>trained people are very marketable, and they continue to move to developed countries such Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand, requiring the Academy to continue to increase its intake of trainees.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy in Nadi, stands as beacon of excellence. This fully integrated 
<br/>training centre offers state-of-the-art facilities, including full flight simulators and advance training 
<br/></span><span>devices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the coming weeks, Fiji Airways will be commissioning two new Flights Simulators and 
<br/>two new Flight Training Devices.  These resources provide unparallel training for Fiji Airways flight 
<br/>and cabin crew, as well as for the other global aviation entities reinforcing Fiji’s reputation as a leader 
<br/>in aviation excellence.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Airways  is  a  high  performing  organisation  employing  some  2,200 
<br/>talented employees. It has successfully navigated the challenge of returning its key skillsets through 
<br/>some key effective measures such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remuneration strategy is based on paying competitive, market benchmark salary; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>best practises focus, 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>harnessing the learning culture in the organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership development, with inclusive strategies to improve women in leadership, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our national airline is a source of pride, standing 14</span><span>th</span><span> in excellence in the top 100 airlines 
<br/>globally. It was awarded the best airline in Australia and the Pacific for 2024. I believe all of us, 
<br/>when we fly with our national airline, we know what we are talking about here, the quality of the 
<br/>service is evident and very pleasing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  pilot  trainings  generally,  we  grow  our  own  pilots  through  the  South  Pacific  Aviation 
<br/>Training  Institute  (SPATI)  at  the  Nausori  International  Airport,  the  Pacific  Flying  School  and 
<br/>Advanced Aviation Training (Fiji) Ltd in Nadi.  These institutions with their modern facilities and 
<br/>up  to-date  training  aids  are  producing  graduates  who  now  hold  significant  positions  in  regional 
<br/>airlines such as Fiji Airways, Air Vanuatu and Airlines of Papua New Guinea. Some are flying huge 
<br/>jets in the busy corridors of the Middle East and Europe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inbound Operators: Coordinating the ground arrangements of the tourist is a very challenging 
<br/>task and this falls into the domain of the inbound operators and the like, such as rental car companies. 
<br/>They also conduct their own training, and a leader is the Rosie Academy which has found the brain 
<br/>drain phenomenon as not at all bad, as it allows younger intakes into the industry. Some that have 
<br/>departed have returned as the grass is not always greener at the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Health  and  Wellness  Tourism:  As  we  continue  to  develop  Fiji  as  a  premier  tourism 
<br/>destination, we also focus on emerging sectors like health and wellness tourism.  This niche market 
<br/>offer significant opportunities for growth and requires a workforce trained in specialized areas such 
<br/>as health and wellness  services, spa management  and holistic therapies.   A phenomena here, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, is that people who have made their fortune are now saying, “Take my wealth, give me back 
<br/>my health”, this is a phenomena that we see today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A prime example of this commitment to Health and Wellness Tourism is the Pacific Specialist 
<br/>Healthcare in Namaka, Nadi.  This locally owned facility offers world-class services, and the doctors 
<br/></span><span>and medical staff are mostly local trained in the local School of Medicine and Fiji Nursing Schools.  
<br/></span><span>For general wellness, a number of academies provide training such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Spa Academy Fiji-Essence of Fiji based in Nadi; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Lumiere Academy at Lautoka; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>FIT College working collaboratively with FNU, FNTC and Pivot Point all across Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also  blessed with  a good number of training providers under the 
<br/>watchful  eyes  of  the  Higher  Education  Commission  who  provides  them  with  the  accreditation, 
<br/></span><span>ensuring  the  training  programmes  align  with  industry  needs.    This  requires  close  collaboration 
<br/></span><span>between educational institutions and industry stakeholders to develop relevant, up-to-date curricula 
<br/>that reflect the latest industry trends and demands.  Training Providers include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji National University offering Diplomas, Degrees and Postgraduate Degrees in Tourism 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Hospitality.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of these Training Providers receive Government grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, affordability or money is a significant factor, and the Coalition Government 
<br/>is  committed  to  providing  substantial  financial  support  through  scholarships,  grants  and  other 
<br/>incentives.  These initiatives are designed to make education more accessible and to encourage our 
<br/>people to build their careers here in Fiji.  These financial supports are not merely about reducing the 
<br/>cost of education, they are about creating opportunities for growth, development and long-term career 
<br/>success.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond  traditional  scholarship,  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  has  initiated 
<br/>targeted government grants aimed at fostering innovation and encouraging the development of niche 
<br/>tourism markets.  These grants are available to entrepreneurs and businesses that are developing new 
<br/>tourism products or services particularly in emerging areas such as eco-tourism, cultural tourism and 
<br/>adventure tourism.  By providing financial support to these innovators, we encourage a development 
<br/>of a more diverse and resilient tourism sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for tourism and civil aviation, it is not only about stemming the brain drain, 
<br/>but also to ensure that we do not have any gaps in terms of manpower in our organisations. We have 
<br/>to be able to find replacement from abroad and this requires an accommodative immigration system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  committed  to  resolving  the  challenges 
<br/>relating  to  immigration.    A  Committee  consisting  of  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics; the honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade  and  Cooperatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/></span><span>Enterprises and Communications; plus the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; 
<br/></span><span>meet weekly with the Growth Reset Team who are private sector volunteers and Immigration Senior 
<br/>Officials to resolve issues related to immigration. This involves a focus on all permit processes with 
<br/>a plan to speed up processing.  Automation of work permits is the key focus presently which will 
<br/>lead to significant improvements and expected to go live on 9</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  comprehensive  approach  we  have  outlined  today, 
<br/>highlight  our  commitment  as  a  nation  to  addressing  the  brain  drain  phenomenon,  ensure  the 
<br/>continuing health and sustainability of tourism and civil aviation.  Global Labour Mobility is here to 
<br/></span><span>stay, but our vision is clear to create a tourism industry that only drives economic prosperity but also 
<br/></span><span>serves as a model of excellence in training, career development and innovation. By working together, 
<br/>we can overcome the challenges before us, and build a brighter future for Fiji, a future where our 
<br/>people thrive, our economy prospers, and our tourism industry remains a beacon of excellence on the 
<br/>global stage.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, this is actually a very important topic and 
<br/>I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  giving  us  a  quick  rundown  on  the  brain  drain 
<br/>phenomena. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> According  to  his  own  statistics,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  lost  close  to  16,000  workers  in  the 
<br/>tourism sector in early last year alone.  This left massive, massive labour skills gap and I think one 
<br/>of the solutions that was offered by the honourable Minister was that we would start hiring retirees 
<br/>and recruiting workers from neighbouring Pacific Island countries. This might not be sufficient, but 
<br/>it would help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  we  must  remember  is  that  tourism  is  in  every  Fijian’s  DNA  and 
<br/>because our pride and passion is our people, which has always been so with respect to the industry, 
<br/>we have become a target for poaching our workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  around  the  world,  they  know  the  skills  that  we  have  it  is  not  just  Australia  and  New 
<br/>Zealand, I know Dubai, et cetera, have actually been targeting our workers so that they leave. So, 
<br/>how do we address it?  It is actually difficult, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  remember  the  Castaway  Resort  alone  had  lost  about  70  percent  of  its 
<br/>kitchen staff.  So, when you look at it from a resort perspective, that is quite a lot of staff that is lost, 
<br/>and these are trained staff that have actually gone. So, what do we do? There are only a few things 
<br/>that we can do, and I think it is because it is private sector driven, it is great to see that institutions 
<br/>that are within the industry are actually training all the different hotel operators but yet still, we must 
<br/>look at how else we can actually do this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that can be done is that we have to look at reviewing the pay for all these 
<br/>workers because we cannot compete with what he is being paid.  But together with the pay, you have 
<br/>to look at what benefits can be given to our workers so that they actually stay in the country because 
<br/>you must remember, they are our prized possession.  This is the biggest industry in Fiji, and it requires 
<br/>a concerted effort from everyone.  When you look at the pay, it is actually twofold, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>You have to look at the cost of living and how it is that you are actually going to retain these workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, it is our opinion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in light of the fact that the tourism industry has 
<br/></span><span>grown beyond what  we  can  actually  service it, a lot of profits  have been made so some of those 
<br/>profits  need  to  be  put  back  into  the  workers  themselves.    I  think  it  is  important,  and  we  must 
<br/>remember that this is an industry that this is completely driven by the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a fantastic relationship with the operators, and it requires a constant conversation 
<br/>with the honourable Minister, the Ministry and the Ministries that are involved, and it runs across the 
<br/>board with many different sectors but currently, we are looking at close to, if I am correct, honourable 
<br/>Minister, it is like $3 billion dollars of earnings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are looking at growing this industry.  If you want to grow the industry, you must show to 
<br/>those who want to invest in it, that we are able to service that industry by ensuring that there is a 
<br/>constant supply in terms of the workforce. Encouraging more young people to get into the industry, 
<br/>they will only stay, if they are paid well enough, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of catering for their arrivals, Mr. Speaker, we also need to look at this, currently, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have had a drop in our service ratings. If we compare ourselves to Bali, et cetera, we are sitting at 
<br/>about 6.84 and as a comparison to Bali and Phuket, et cetera, they sit at 8.5.  That service level has 
<br/>actually dropped.  It has dropped not because we wanted it to, it has dropped because of the migration 
<br/>of our skilled workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These other countries that we compete with are actually putting us on a knife edge, and I am 
<br/>glad to see that the honourable Minister has acknowledged this particular problem and he is working 
<br/>with the industry and also our other Ministries, especially the Ministry of Education, to ensure that 
<br/>we do not have a serious problem, also in light of the fact that his neighbour Minister sitting right 
<br/>next to him is actually encouraging more and more investment in that particular area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to grow the numbers, of course, we want to see a million visitors but more hotels 
<br/>means more workers. If we are not able to find a strategic way to keep these workers in our country, 
<br/>we will have a serious problem in actually growing up because investors will look at it and say, they 
<br/>are not able to.  We must all remember this, Mr. Speaker, our pride of possession in our industry is 
<br/>our workers and our hospitability. I thank you, Honourable Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable leader of G-9 Bloc, or his designate for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the Statement and 
<br/>thank  you  honourable  Koya  for  those  comments.    When  I  look  at  the  subject  this  morning  on 
<br/>combating  the  brain  drain  phenomenon,  I  thought  it  was  holistically  in  a sense.    The  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Minister  spoke  on  combating  it  within  the  tourism  sector;  a  very  important  sector 
<br/>industry for Fiji.  It cuts across the other sectors, even to our farmers and our fishermen, and it is 
<br/>important that we keep the industry alive and vibrant and trying to accommodate the increase that is 
<br/>anticipated in the coming years for tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Koya had mentioned, the big  push factor for  Fiji  is  that  our wages pushes 
<br/>people up.  We can engage in the training and train people to be qualified, and they become very 
<br/>marketable to those countries that pay better.  It is not only for Fiji, it is phenomenal worldwide, and 
<br/>that is why we have international labour mobility and this is very fluid workers that are just moving 
<br/>around the world and really targeting those that pay better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had mentioned this in the House before that one of the unique features for Fiji is that the 
<br/></span><span>very push factor that pushes people out is the pool factor for those in big population countries.  The 
<br/></span><span>same wages that we do not like over here is attractive enough for those that come in from some other 
<br/>countries.   Not only that, added to that pool factor of the wage that we have here is the fact that they 
<br/>come and work in one of the preferred tourism destinations in the world - in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, outside of Fiji we will have this pool of people who are willing to come. I think that in 
<br/>order to tackle this brain drain issue, we have almost no other choice but to allow these foreigners to 
<br/>come in and work in Fiji, which then demands that it has to be looked at holistically, and that we set 
<br/>policies that really target getting foreign workers to come in and work, and more importantly also, is 
<br/></span><span>to ensure that when they come in and work in Fiji, that they are well looked after. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  remember  a  story  when  I  was  Director  Immigration,  we  got  this  guy  that  came  in  from 
<br/>Pakistan, I think.  He was somewhere near Korovou.  The job that he was doing was burning CDs 
<br/>and he was just surviving on onions, because there is always this tendency that foreign workers get 
<br/>exploited because they are held to ransom, “You mess up, I will chase you back to your country”. 
<br/>But they had sacrificed so much to be able to come over.  They sell their properties in order to come 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back.  He said that if we send them back, we send them back to nothing almost.  So, it has to be a 
<br/>holistic approach to tackling the brain drain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> We know that in years to come, these people that go out, again, if our policies are right, we 
<br/>then, turn it into a brain drain gain.  They come back as very well-off people, they have a lot more 
<br/>money, they are more educated and more experienced and maybe, they would like to come back and 
<br/>invest in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I commend the service providers in our tourism sector and the effort that they put into 
<br/>trade - our workers, so that they can, at least, fill the gap, but it is this phenomenon of being pushed 
<br/>out and being pulled by the better wages that are offered by our neighbours who are well developed 
<br/>is the problem, I suppose.  I guess it is worth looking at now, for Government to holistically just sit 
<br/>and look at how we manage this fluidity of international labour and turn it around into a net skilled 
<br/>game for  Fiji  as we managed the going  out  and those that are  coming in.   The problem  with  the 
<br/>coming in is that everyone comes in - the workers, the scammers which we have just talked about 
<br/>before, the traffickers who try and sneak in through this fluidity of movement of labour around the 
<br/>world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  commend  the  Ministry,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  and  the  private  sector  and  the  tourism 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>industry in working hard to try and keep this very vital industry for Fiji alive and thriving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Update on the 2023-2024 Water Sector Deliverables 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address this august House on my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians, ladies and gentlemen; I thank 
<br/>you for the opportunity to address and elaborate more on the Water Sector 2023 to 2024 achievements 
<br/>and 2024 to 2025 major plans and status update.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry and the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has made significant 
<br/>strides in both, infrastructural and institutional development, ensuring that the people of Fiji have 
<br/>access to reliable, safe and sustainable water and wastewater services, as constituted and mandated 
<br/>under the Water Authority of Fiji Act 2007.  Allow me to highlight these achievements under two 
<br/>key categories: Institutional Achievements and Infrastructural Achievements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Institutional Achievements include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Launch of the Water Sector 2050 Plan   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a landmark achievement where the Coalition Government launched the Water 
<br/>Sector 2050 Plan in April 2024, a visionary roadmap that outlines Fiji’s water sector 
<br/>and  wastewater  priorities  for  the  next  three  decades.    This  comprehensive  plan  is 
<br/>designed to transform how water services are delivered across the nation.  It addresses 
<br/>the challenges of climate vulnerability, renews aging infrastructure and aligns with the 
<br/></span><span>principles of the circular economy.  Furthermore, it is a crucial step and clear roadmap 
<br/></span><span>in our ongoing efforts for clean and accessible water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Introduction of WAF's e-Service Platform  
<br/>Mr Speaker, Sir, in our commitment to improving customer service, WAF launched its e-
<br/>Service  platform.  This online service  provides  our customers  with easy access to their 
<br/>accounts and allowing them to pay bills and report any queries with just a few clicks.  This 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1811 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>digital transformation is a significant step in making services more accessible and efficient, 
<br/>particularly for those in remote areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Water Production and Non-Revenue Water (NRW) Reduction   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a key issue from August 2023 to July 2024.  The WAF produced a total of 130,771 
<br/>mega  litres  of  water,  demonstrating  our  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  demands  of  our 
<br/>population.   A key  focus has been  on reducing  NRW.   I  am  pleased to  announce  that, 
<br/>through diligent efforts, a reduction in NRW from 47 percent in 2023 to 45 percent in the 
<br/>first half of 2024 was achieved.  This 2 percent reduction may seem modest, but it represents 
<br/>a  significant  accomplishment,  resulting  from  extensive  work  in  leak  detection, 
<br/>infrastructure maintenance and customer engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increased Water and Wastewater Connections   
<br/>The WAF successfully increased water connections by 2,257 and wastewater connections 
<br/>by  96.    This  growth  in  connections  is  a  direct  result  of  the  extension  projects,  which 
<br/>expanded  the  network  to  reach  more  households  and  communities.    The  increase  in 
<br/>connections  reflects the rising demand from  customers to  connect to  reliable water and 
<br/>wastewater services and underscores Government’s commitment to expanding access to 
<br/>clean water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructural Achievements include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Urban Water Projects   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  WAF  has  made  significant  progress  in  enhancing  urban  water 
<br/>infrastructure, to ensure more Fijians have access to reliable water services.  During the 
<br/>2023-2024  financial  year,  a  total  of  31.57  kilometres  of  pipeline  extensions  were 
<br/>completed, benefiting close to 47,350 Fijians.  A key highlight of this achievement is the 
<br/>Sawani to Viria pipelaying project, which involved the installation of 24.5 kilometres of 
<br/>new  pipeline,  directly  benefiting  6,500  Fijians.  This  project  was  made  possible  by  the 
<br/>completion of the Viria Water Treatment Plant, a state-of-the-art facility that has a capacity 
<br/>of 40 mega litres. As a responsible Coalition Government, we shall continue to enhance 
<br/>and expand from developments of previous governments.  As a result of this project, areas 
<br/>that previously experience intermittent water supply are now receiving a consistent and 
<br/>reliable water services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another major accomplishment in the financial year was the completion of the Nabouwalu 
<br/></span><span>Packaged  Water  Treatment  Plant,  a  2  megalitre  facility  that  is  now  serving  over  5,400 
<br/></span><span>Fijians.  This represents a significant improvement in water supply in the Nabouwalu area, 
<br/>ensuring  that  residents  have  access  to  clean  and  safe  water.    We  will  soon  see  the 
<br/>commissioning  of  this  project.  In  addition,  WAF  has  successfully  installed  backup 
<br/>generators  at  14  major  pump  stations.    This  critical  infrastructure  upgrade  ensures  that 
<br/>power supply is available during outages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Rural Water Scheme Projects  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>WAF  has  completed  10  Rural  Water  Projects,  benefiting  various  communities  that 
<br/></span><span>previously lacked access to a proper water supply.  These projects involved the construction 
<br/></span><span>of  new  water  schemes  and  the  installation  of  standpipes  and  shower  heads,  providing 
<br/>communities with a reliable and safe water source. I should add that the Ministry continues 
<br/>to work closely with organisations such as Rotary Pacific Water for Life Foundation, Fiji 
<br/>Water Foundation, Vodafone Foundation, LDS Church, the Australian Government, New 
<br/>Zealand Government and other development partners, to continue to support access to safe 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>water in rural Fiji. These organisations have all made significant contributions in the access 
<br/>of safe and clean water. I commend them for their contributions to the nation, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Rainwater Harvesting Tanks  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, as part of our commitment to ensuring water security in remote areas, 
<br/>3,200 rainwater harvesting tanks was delivered across four regions, benefiting 15,755 
<br/>households. Notably, the most recent deliveries included to the  </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Yasawa areas 
<br/>which have faced drought-like conditions. We have also delivered to low pressure and 
<br/>intermittent supply areas, such as Sakoca, around the Tamavua area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to our infrastructural and institutional achievements, WAF 
<br/>has also strengthened its presence on regional and international platforms, in particular 
<br/>in  regional forums,  in  the 14th  Pacific Water and Wastewater Association (PWWA) 
<br/>and the Water Ministers Forum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to advise that WAF recently represented Fiji at the International Water 
<br/>Association (IWA) and World Water Congress &amp; Exhibition in Canada. This brought 
<br/>together global leaders in water management, and I am pleased to announce that WAF 
<br/>has been recognised and honoured with the Climate Smart Utilities Recognition Award 
<br/>2024.    Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  achieving  this  award  on  an  international  level  not  only 
<br/>recognises the hard work of our staff at WAF, but also the stakeholders who support 
<br/>our organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress made in the past year sets a strong foundation for future 
<br/>initiatives, as outlined in the Water Sector 2050 Plan. Challenges need to be overcome 
<br/>and  opportunities  seized  to  enhance  the  quality  of  life.    I  commend  all  stakeholders 
<br/>involved, particularly with our staff contractors who have all work hard in the mud, rain 
<br/>and at all hours during emergency situations with commitment and dedication to restore 
<br/>water supply when these are cut off through various reasons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  significant  initiatives  and  strategic  plans  that  WAF  has  set  in 
<br/>motion  for  the  2024-2025  financial  year  includes  the  $259  million  allocated  by 
<br/>Government in terms of the current Budget, which will ensure access to clean and safe 
<br/>water  and  these  includes  $135  million  for  capital  expenditure  and  $123  million  for 
<br/>operational costs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)  Water Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  WAF  with  a  significant  allocation  of  $82.07  million  for  its  Water 
<br/>Programme,  is  to  address  supply  challenges  and  improve  infrastructure  across  the 
<br/>region.  A  key  priority  within  this  programme  is  the  NRW  initiative  which  has  been 
<br/>allocated $5 million. This is to address water loss through leaking pipes, which remains 
<br/>a significant issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>WAF  is  engaged  in  a  Performance-Based  Contract  for  NRW  reduction,  specifically 
<br/></span><span>targeting  the  Suva-Nausori  area.  It  also  includes  a  series  of  essential  upgrades  and 
<br/></span><span>expansions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)  Water Packaged Treatment Plant  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The programme includes the upgrades of: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)  Benau Water Treatment Plant; 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>(ii)  Consultancy services for the Wainadoi Water Supply Scheme; and 
<br/>(iii) Construction of the Navua Packaged Water Treatment Plant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)   Water Mains Upgrading Works 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we will be looking into the Central Division: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)  RKS and QVS upgrade works; 
<br/>(ii)  Northern Division: Labasa Operation Upgrade; 
<br/>(iii) Nabouwalu Operational Upgrade; and  
<br/>(iv)  Savusavu Operational Upgrade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Western Division, the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)  Dreketi Feeder Road Upgrade; 
<br/>(ii)  Vuda Rider Water Mains Upgrade; and  
<br/>(iii) Wairabetia Water Mains Upgrade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pipeline Extension Projects 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it is crucial to expand the water supply coverage, particularly in 
<br/>underserved areas:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Central Division:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Korovou to Veinuqa Extension, Lokia Pipelaying Works and Sawani to Colo-
<br/>i-Suva.  This is especially important, especially as it will alleviate the water 
<br/>problems  currently  faced  in  the  Tacirua,  Sakoca,  Tamavua  and  also  into 
<br/>Delainavesi  and  Lami,  and  entail  laying  of  1.43  kilometres  from  Sawani 
<br/>Junction to a new pump station at Buresasa, then to Colo-i-Suva where two 
<br/>new 5 megalitres steel reservoirs will be built, and then down to Khalsa Road 
<br/>in Tamavua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may have heard of the Bilo Extension.  These areas have been without 
<br/>water  supply  for  decades  and  the  Coalition  Government  has  taken  urgent 
<br/>action  to  ensure  that  the  water  pipelines  are  extended,  and  it  is  currently 
<br/>underway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Benau to Rara Pipeline, Nabekavu Mains Extension and Degau Extension. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Western Division:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sigatoka Water Coverage Extension (this include three sub-projects, that is, 
<br/>Vusama,  Navisabasaba,  Nadrala  and  Waibogi  Villages  involving  laying  16 
<br/>kilometres water mains. Some of these villages had suffered from water borne 
<br/>diseases due to contaminated water and we have taken urgent action to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that this extension do happen, and these works are currently being done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The other major one is the Nagado to Nadele Pipeline from the Nagado Water 
<br/>Treatment  Plant.    This  will  significantly  increase  the  discharge  volume  and 
<br/>sustain the growing demand for water in the tourism areas, Nadi, Lautoka.  The 
<br/></span><span>Nagado Water Treatment Plant is an ongoing project nearing completion with

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a  more  modern  and  automated  water  treatment  plant  and  will  add  further 
<br/>capacity and redundancies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  in  terms  of  Asset  Management  Programme  with  an  allocation  of  $8.54 
<br/>million. This is designed for optimal functionality of our systems, and we will include matters such 
<br/>as the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Lami-Nausori Wastewater Masterplan. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Feasibility study for a new water source and treatment plant for the Nadi-Lautoka region.  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The development of a Masterplan for the Suva-Nausori Water Supply, ensuring the long-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>term sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>A Masterplan for the Keyasi Water Supply and Wastewater Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  as  I  speak,  tenders  for  the  masterplans  will  be  advertised  in  the  coming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>weeks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wastewater  Programme,  this  is  a  current  issue  which  will  need  to  be  expanded.  Only  28 
<br/>percent of our population currently has access to sanitation services and projects under wastewater 
<br/>include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The rehabilitation of the Pacific Harbour Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The cleaning and upgrading of the Kinoya Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The installation of new diffusers at the Wailada Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
<br/>(4)   In  addition,  the  Coalition  Governmnent  has  acted  quickly  in  terms  of  the  increased 
<br/>demand and deteriorating water and sewer reticulation systems at Denarau Island. We 
<br/>recognize  the  importance  of  Denarau  to  the  tourism  industry  and  to  our  national 
<br/>economy, especially businesses, employees, and of course, the landowners of Denarau.  
<br/>The  wastewater  and  water  systems  for  Denarau  was  built  in  the  1970s  with  minor 
<br/>enhancements to-date, for basically one hotel, that is, the Regent of Fiji Hotel. Today 
<br/>there are nine resorts with over 2,000 rooms, water park, golf courses, residential lots 
<br/>and a marina with shopping and restaurant complex.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hotel developments are ongoing with plans for substantial developments underway and the 
<br/>Government has prioritised this and provisioned up to $15 million with possible cost sharing in terms 
<br/>of the Denarau Island Infrastructure Design/Build Upgrade Works which has been put to tender. The 
<br/>project will involve the upgrade and replacement of existing sewer pump stations, sewer rising main, 
<br/></span><span>sewer reticulation  and new water mains. Mr. Speaker Sir, we also  note the critical  importance of 
<br/></span><span>spares, and it is something that has been allocated for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, in terms of rural water, that is again an area of importance to the Government: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Rural Water Carting in Non-Metered Areas: $4 million allocated.   
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Rainwater  Harvesting:  $1.4  million  set  aside  and  we  encourage  our  Fijian  people  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to look at this option as a redundancy measure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Rural  Water  Supply  Scheme:  $2.11  million  has  been  dedicated  to  implement  water 
<br/></span><span>supply schemes in the Central, Western, and Northern Divisions to benefit over 4,000 
<br/></span><span>Fijians.   These projects are vital to improving the quality of life in our rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the dry weather recently experienced, I wish to update on the status of catchments.  
<br/>You may be aware, Sir, that we had issued a public advisory through a media release on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> August 
<br/></span><span>advising the public to use water wisely.  Thanks to the trough of low pressure and the rains on 24th

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  25</span><span>th</span><span>,  this  has  brought  temporary  relief  where  in  the  Central  Eastern  14  sources  have  now 
<br/>recovered out of the 17.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Lomaiviti  Group,  there  are  some  areas  which  remain  critical  and  for  the  Western 
<br/>Division, high rainfall was also observed and from these 13 sources, eight are now normal but three 
<br/>are still close to critical. So, I advise all Fijians to still conserve water and take the necessary measures 
<br/>for prudent use of water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Northern Division also experienced low pressure, but rainfall was not as intense and there 
<br/>are still areas which need assistance. Sir, with the unpredictable weather we may face in the next 
<br/>months, we are working closely with the various relevant authorities such as Tourism, Health and 
<br/>Education  in  monitoring  the  situation,  and  of  course,  with  the  Divisional  Commissioners,  we  are 
<br/>working closely with them in alleviating water shortages and providing relief and also through the 
<br/>Government Shipping Services for our maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is expanding its risk for better water services internationally and 
<br/>we need to do that given the limitations of our national coffers. Water cannot be delivered without 
<br/>energy so when we talk about climate financing, the water-energy nexus is crucial, and in this regard, 
<br/>opportunities must be efficiently utilized. We must continue to be reminded that for Small Islands 
<br/>Developing States (SIDS) such as Fiji, availability and accessibility of basic utilities such as energy 
<br/>and water are of paramount importance in terms of daily survival, especially for our grassroots, not 
<br/>only that, but of course water, energy and roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  great  community  grassroot  need  to  champion  these  water-energy  annexes  to 
<br/>alleviate poverty and it is a catalyst for transformational impact on daily lives. So, we need to target 
<br/>that nexus in  terms  of climate financing  in  the scope of  assessing  natural  spring or ground water 
<br/>resources using the latest solar voltaic technology, where the solar powered borehole pumps or even 
<br/>solar power desalination plants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This energy-water nexus, it is programme innovatively using smart national level frameworks 
<br/>which  can  truly  provide  transformational  catalyst  especially  maritime  communities.    Sir,  in  this 
<br/>regard,  we  will  continue  to  work  towards  this  particular  area.    We  are  now  intensifying  Climate 
<br/>Financing Concept Papers and Proposals with the Ministry of Climate Change accordingly around 
<br/>the water and energy with great initial support from our development partners to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  as  already  alluded  to  yesterday  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands,  the 
<br/></span><span>Coalition Government has taken a significant step in its relationship with catchment landowners with 
<br/></span><span>the Cabinet approval for the development of a framework and policy for compensation of standing 
<br/>trees in catchment areas. We, as a government, will continue to listen to all stakeholders especially 
<br/>and to address landowner issues as appropriate within our current legal frameworks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think we will adjourn for lunch now.  When we resume at 2.30 p.m., we 
<br/>will continue with the response from the honourable Leader of the Opposition and that of the Group 
<br/>of 9.  I am also told that the honourable Minister for Justice has withdrawn his Ministerial Statement, 
<br/>as such, upon returning we will update you further.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.32 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition, or his designate to make their response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>very extensive elaboration on the water sector, and in particular the achievements had been achieved 
<br/>over the past financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water  as  we  all  know  is  one  of  the  most  important  things  that  we  have  and  in  fact  its 
<br/>importance is reflected in its listing as one of the SDGs and also that it has a very specific segment 
<br/>in the Constitution which calls for the Government of Fiji to make sure that all of our citizens have 
<br/>safe and clean water.  For having served as a Minister for Water, I know the enormous challenges 
<br/>that are faced in trying to make sure that we deliver that.  Nevertheless, we are bound by the dictates 
<br/>of the Constitution, in terms of making sure that we are able to provide the water that is needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have read with interest the Corporate Plan for the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) which lists 
<br/>all the issues that the WAF has been targeted in this last financial year and also the 2050 Strategy.  I 
<br/>am glad that the 2050 Strategy has come into place.  I know the discussions on this were taking place 
<br/>while I was still a Minister and I am glad that is borne to fruition, now we can see this firmly in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I congratulate the WAF for having that long-term strategy because one of the problems that 
<br/>we have, when we do not have a long term strategy, we do things </span><span>ad hoc</span><span>.  There are a number of 
<br/>things that I just wanted to focus in briefly in terms of the Corporate Strategy that the  WAF has.  
<br/>There are too many things that are covered, so I cannot address all of them, so I just choose to talk 
<br/>on two. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of non-revenue water, it is the water that is produced, we extract from the sources 
<br/>of water, but they do not get to their designation.  They are lost along the way either they are stolen 
<br/>or because of leakages in the pipes that they get lost.  We know that the figure that we know that we 
<br/>have for non-revenue water in this country is around 47 percent, almost half of the water that we 
<br/>extract  from  the  sources  do  not  get  to  their  intended  destination.    This  has  been  a  long-standing 
<br/>problem in WAF largely because of the old infrastructure, I think that is the major issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  target  for  the  2023-2024  Corporate  Plan  was  to  reduce  this  by  5  percent  in  this  first 
<br/>financial year, although the target has not been achieved, the honourable Minister has highlighted 
<br/></span><span>that they have been able to achieve 2 percent, that is a good beginning when we get there.  We need 
<br/></span><span>to be able to get to this, to make sure there is adequate water.  Around this whole issue of the quantum 
<br/>of water being adequate or available to people, there are other issues that revolve around that, the 
<br/>conservation of water.  Maybe one of the other things that I find in that corporate plan is the review 
<br/>of the tariff of water.  This is something that is actually in this plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the challenges that we have in any commodity that we have, when it is too cheap, 
<br/>people do not attach a lot of importance to it.  This is obviously going to be one of the issues with 
<br/>water.  We have one of the cheapest waters in the Pacific and when it is that cheap, people are not 
<br/></span><span>going to conserve it and I notice in the plan, there is a call for the review, and I would like to hear 
<br/></span><span>the Government’s intent on the actual review of the plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second thing that I have, since I only have a minute and 30 seconds, I forgot where I put 
<br/>my notes.  There are some very important targets in terms of meeting of 100 percent of customers’ 
<br/>expectations in the customer charter.  We did not have any feedback on that and there is one important 
<br/>target that we have.  For the greater Suva area to return the 24/7 water supply.   I think this is still a

<div><span>1817 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>challenge for us and I am hoping and congratulate the honourable Minister for what they have been 
<br/>able  to  do  so  far,  but  on  those  two  particular  areas  on  the  non-revenue  water  and  meeting  that 
<br/>expectation of 24/7 water supply, it is a huge challenge.  This is something that people continue to 
<br/>complain about, and I wish the Government well in trying to make sure that we can achieve that for 
<br/>the benefit of all of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  upon  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Group  of  9  Bloc  or  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank honourable Usamate for his 
<br/>contribution.  I am grateful to the honourable Minister for his comprehensive Ministerial Statement.  
<br/>I noted that the Minister has covered the broader subject on water sector deliverables, particularly 
<br/>the update on the execution under the 2023-2024 Financial Year and the capital programme for the 
<br/>2024 – 2025 Financial Year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the honourable Minister for emphasising on rural water access.   He 
<br/>mentioned 11 rural water projects carried out in 2023.  The issue of water is paramount to our people.  
<br/>During my recent visit to the voters in the Northern and Western Divisions and parts of Naitasiri last 
<br/>week,  it  was  clear  that  water  was  their  foremost  concern.    From  our  rural  communities  it  was 
<br/>consistently clear and urgent that they need access to clean and safe water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Historically, Mr. Speaker, rural water supplies are often being overshadowed by the urban 
<br/>needs, but we are beginning to see a positive shift in focus because of what we believe to be, the 
<br/>provision in the Constitution guarantees the right to water for all Fijians and that means it will be the 
<br/>responsibility of the Government to see this right is observed.  We have a commitment towards the 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goals (SDG6) that advocates for water accessibility to everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  members  of  this  august  House  recognise  that  the  rural  communities  face  significant 
<br/>challenges in accessing clean water.  Issues such as contamination from agricultural runoff, improper 
<br/>waste disposal and insufficient sanitation facilities contribute  to this problem.  Contamination not 
<br/>only pose health risk but also leads to water borne diseases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the remote locations of many of these rural communities means 
<br/>that residents often have to undertake long and strenuous journeys to collect water.  That will affect 
<br/>women, children and even elders. One of the studies that was done by the World Health Organisation 
<br/>titled “Drinking Water, Sanitations and Hygiene” in emergencies indicates that individuals require 
<br/></span><span>between 50 litres to 100 litres per day to meet basic hygiene needs and physiological needs.  So those 
<br/></span><span>with access to only about 20 litres of water daily face significant health risk frequently encountered 
<br/>by the rural population, including our maritime communities. We have lots of families, as we know, 
<br/>the households here in Fiji today who are vulnerable and exposed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a recent Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) Report in July 2024 highlighted 
<br/>that 96,000 Fijians or about 12 percent of our population primarily from the rural areas lack access 
<br/>to  safe  and  clean  drinking  water.    I  want  to  sincerely  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>commitment in addressing these pressing issues.  As the honourable Minister outlined, the rural water 
<br/></span><span>plan  is  vital  to  improving  water  management  and  ensuring  sustainable  development  for  rural 
<br/></span><span>communities.    While  we  acknowledge  the  efforts  by  previous  governments  in  this  sector,  it  is 
<br/>encouraging to hear the honourable Minister with a renewed focus and determination to resolve these 
<br/>issues.  I am hopeful that that progress will be a swift one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2024-2025 Budget, the allocation of $82.3 million for water programmes, including 
<br/>$7.5 million for rural initiatives, this significant funding should facilitate substantial improvements

<div><span>in  water  access  for  many  rural  communities  in  the  coming  months.    Once  again,  I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for his Statement in reassuring the people of Fiji, especially those in the rural 
<br/>areas.    Your  message,  honourable  Minister  will  surely  bring  hope  and  encouragement  to  those 
<br/>grappling with water crisis watching this Parliamentary session.

<div><span>Suicide Prevention 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of this 
<br/>august House, distinguished guests, members of the public virtually viewing this parliamentary 
<br/>session, a good afternoon to you all.  Allow me to brief this august House on an issue that needs 
<br/>a coordinated and multi-sectoral public health response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Working very closely with the National Committee on the Prevention of Suicide, we will 
<br/>be  commemorating  World  Suicide  Prevention  Day  on  Tuesday,  10</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  with  the 
<br/>launch of the Suicide Prevention 2024 theme: </span><span>“Change the narrative with a call to action, start 
<br/>the  conversation.”</span><span>    I  am  respectfully  starting  this  conversation  with  you  here  in  this  august 
<br/>House  and  across  the  nation,  with  our  viewers  across  the</span><span> </span><span>globe.    We  need  and  must  work 
<br/>together.  According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 800,000 people die by 
<br/>suicide every year, which means one person every 40 seconds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, the suicide and attempted suicide statistics gathered by the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force in six years from 2016 to 2021 revealed a total of 1,276 suicide and attempted 
<br/>cases; an average  of 213  cases  per year with about half the number leading to deaths.   The 
<br/>highest number of suicide and attempted suicide cases were recorded in 2019, with 244 cases 
<br/>and the Western Division recorded the most cases every year for the six years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Changing the narrative of suicide is about transforming how we perceive this complex 
<br/>issue and shifting from a culture of silence and stigma to one of openness, understanding and 
<br/>support.  A call to action encourages everyone to start the conversation on suicide and suicide 
<br/>prevention.  Every  conversation,  no  matter  how  small,  contributes  to  a  supportive  and 
<br/>understanding society.  By initiating these vital conversations, we can break down  barriers, 
<br/>raise awareness and create better cultures of support in our churches, mosques, sporting fields, 
<br/>and kava sessions.  Let us start this conversation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  WHO  Comprehensive  Mental  Health  Action  Plan  (2013-2030) 
<br/>underlines suicide as the second most common cause of death among young people between the 
<br/></span><span>ages  of  15  years  to  29  years  across  the  globe.    Every  individual  suicide  has  far  reaching 
<br/></span><span>emotional,  social  and  economic  consequences  and  deeply  affects  the  families,  global 
<br/>communities and nations across the globe.  I am inviting Members of this august House, your 
<br/>Ministries and everyone listening and watching this session, please wear a yellow or orange 
<br/>article of clothing, wrist band or hair band on Tuesday, 10</span><span>th</span><span> September to indicate that you are 
<br/>advocating that life is for living, that a life lost to suicide is a life to many.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I call on my colleagues on both sides of Parliament to get your staff, students, teachers, 
<br/>families and to all Civil Servants to wear orange or yellow on the day and on most days, to help 
<br/></span><span>advocate  for  suicide  prevention  and  save  a  life.  You  can  also  join  us  from  Tuesday,  10</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span><span>September, 2024, via livestream on the Ministry of Health and Medical Services social media 
<br/>page at 8.30 a.m. and also in the evening, a candle light vigil from 6.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. at Ratu 
<br/>Sukuna Park.  Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>enlightening the general public in Parliament on the importance of suicide cases and mental health 
<br/>and wellbeing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to know that suicide is a major health problem with  far reaching social, 
<br/>emotional and economic consequences and as you alluded, more than 800,000 die every year and is 
<br/>the fourth leading cause of death among 15 to 29 year olds which is really worrying.  In Parliament 
<br/>or even leaders outside, we always talk about the future generation. We are doing everything now for 
<br/>the future generation but the fourth leading cause of death among 15 to 29 year olds is suicide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  is  considered  to  have  one  of  the  highest  suicide  rates  in  the  world  and  according  to 
<br/>statistics, it has been revealed by Lifeline Fiji that a Fijian citizen will attempt to take their life every 
<br/>36 hours, and the youngest victim was a seven-year-old child. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ingestion of pesticides, hanging and firearms are the most common methods of suicide 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>globally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is why paraquat was banned in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, World Suicide Prevention Day on 10</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024, with the launch 
<br/>the Suicide Prevention 2024 theme, ‘Change the Narrative with All of Action: Start the Conversation’ 
<br/>is a great initiative.  The more we talk about this, the more we normalise this in society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2015 was the first year when the Suicide Prevention Day was celebrated in 
<br/>schools. I think on a social media recently, a mother posted of her young boy who was in Year 9.  It 
<br/>was a normal day, he went to school, by the time he came home he had killed himself already, and 
<br/>she is looking for reasons as to why he did so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, suicide shrouded in stigma, shame and misunderstanding. This means that 
<br/>people do not often ask or seek for adequate help. Prevention of suicide cannot be accomplished by 
<br/>one person, organisation or institution, and it requires support for the whole community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here are the few recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Restrict and monitor the sale and usage of fertilizers and pesticides which can be used as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an attempt to suicide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>We need to restrict networks that are fuelling drug usage, social media bullying and threats. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>We need laws that penalise those who bully, harass and threaten others on social media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  recently there was a matter viral  on social  media where a  </span><span>TikToker  </span><span>had 
<br/>killed himself because he was being bullied on social media.  In fact, what I see on </span><span>Tiktok</span><span> is people 
<br/>threatening each other, giving their addresses and say, “I am at this address, come and fight with me”.  
<br/>It is quite surprising that people do these things and children have access to this kind of content in 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corporations and businesses must be made compulsory to conduct wellness programmes and 
<br/>suicide awareness weeks under their corporate social responsibility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we can 
<br/></span><span>do as legislators is to increase financial support to St. Giles and various NGOs to equip them with 
<br/></span><span>more resources, aimed at substance use prevention, mental health, reduce risk, re-enforce protective 
<br/>factors  by  providing  social  support  to  vulnerable  individuals,  follow  -up  care,  raising  awareness, 
<br/>fighting stigma and supporting those who have deranged by suicide which, hopefully, the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance can consider in the next budget.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  needs  to  be  more  dialogue  and  discussions  within  households, 
<br/>religious groups, communities and a society as a whole, and I am glad the honourable Minister really 
<br/>emphasises on this point.  It serves as a reminder that suicide prevention is a public health priority 
<br/>and urgent action is required to make sure that suicide mortality rates are reduced.  By creating hope 
<br/>through action, I assure the people of Fiji that we are committed to this shared responsibility and that 
<br/>there is hope, and that we care, and we want to support them and through collective actions, we can 
<br/>achieve the desired outcomes of these pressing issues, leaving no Fijian behind.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, the honourable Minister's words reflect a 
<br/>deeper societal concern that affects each one of us - the grim and saddening scenario of suicide in 
<br/>Fiji, and we appreciate his dedication to this cause and the launching of the Suicide Prevention 2024 
<br/>initiative  next  Tuesday.  The  theme,  ‘Change  the  Narrative  with  the  call  to  action  -  start  a 
<br/>conversation’, is not just appropriate but extremely crucial to our collective effort in dealing with 
<br/>suicide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am reminded of two key scriptures from our </span><span>Holy Bible</span><span>. The first one, </span><span>Deuteronomy 30:19</span><span>, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>represents the sanctity of life where the Lord says, I quote,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that you and your children may live”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This passage sets forth a profound truth, every life is invaluable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In </span><span>Galatians 6:2</span><span>, he urges us to show empathy to our fellow beings. The Apostle Paul wrote, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I quote, “Bear one another's burden, and so fulfil the law of Christ."  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both  scriptures,  Mr.  Speaker,  impress  the  importance  of  preserving  life  and  lending  an 
<br/>empathetic ear to individuals battling with the pressure of life.  We have seen the ripple effects it 
<br/>sends in families, neighbours and in our communities.  We ought to create an environment where our 
<br/>people can openly discuss their predicaments, how they feel, how they are valued, to be heard and 
<br/>be understood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Professor and Director of the Hamilton Counselling and Psychology Department, Dr. Karen 
<br/></span><span>Mason, is writing a note which says, “Why should a church observe the National Suicide Prevention 
<br/></span><span>Month, the month of September?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I read through his research, he said in 2018, (before the pandemic) that more people died 
<br/>of suicide than from  drug-related death.   According  to  the latest  data from  the Centre of Disease 
<br/>Control and Prevention, the number of suicide deaths in the United States continues to climb.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, here in Fiji, the faith-based organisations are an integral part in shaping our 
<br/>society's moral, ethical and spiritual transformations.  The influence of these organisations can be 
<br/></span><span>productive  in  creating  a  compassionate  approach  towards  individuals  experiencing  distress. 
<br/></span><span>Moreover, they can contribute to creating a supportive environment for prevention efforts. However, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to be better looked after by the Government in terms of resources and 
<br/>capacity building.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that the faith-based organisations in Fiji has got the biggest reach in 
<br/>our  local  settings.  They  must  not  only  be  used  as  a  rubber  stamp  in  the  consultations  for  new 
<br/>government initiatives but be seen as a tangible tool in dealing with the many challenging social 
<br/>issues that we face in our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Suicide Prevention 2024 Programme should not just be a campaign but 
<br/>a necessitated movement to preserve, to cherish and honour life. The ecumenical faith-based bodies 
<br/>in Fiji are frontline warriors in creating a society filled with understanding, empathy, and love.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I firmly believe, if given recognition and the critical support by Government, we can be rest 
<br/>assured that our commitment geared towards the successful implementation of this initiative will be 
<br/>a success. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Christians view suicide prevention as part of our call to love our neighbours.  
<br/>As we love ourselves, it is our duty to reach out to those that are suffering, extend emotional and 
<br/>spiritual  support  and  start  the  conversation  in  changing  the  narrative  sounding  mental  health 
<br/>discussion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we can create that space in which those that are struggling with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suicide can find hope, solace and most importantly, find help. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  think  the  challenge  offered  by  the  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Health and Medical Services needs to be taken up.  He has asked us for our support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  I  remember  correctly,  one  of  my  predecessors  here,  Mr.  Pita  Nacuva,  being  a  former 
<br/>Speaker, a former international rugby player, he excelled in his work front, right up to his career in 
<br/>politics.  One  day,  it  was  a  sad  day  one  of  his  children  took  her  own  life  and  the  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament then were all badly affected from that tragedy. Even if the son or daughter of a well-off 
<br/>person, when you suffer this kind of fate, we all feel it, whether is to do with the suicide or drug 
<br/>problem, which is another upcoming case that is before us now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take it that the offer given by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, I 
<br/>would ask for your permission honourable Members if the print on the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> could be in 
<br/></span><span>bold letters, so as to remind us of the fate of Mr. Pita Nacuva’s daughter when she took her own life. 
<br/></span><span>It  affected the whole lot of us in the House then because you never know when will this kind of 
<br/>tragedy strike you and make you part of that. It was difficult moment for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rehabilitation Centre in Tamavua is still being talked about and I do not know when they 
<br/>will start building the rehabilitation centre. St. Giles is not a rehabilitation centre but here, we are 
<br/>talking about drugs and suicide.  These are issues that are before us right now and we need to begin 
<br/>to start talking with other people who are affected seriously. You cannot understand these kind of 
<br/>people.  They do not talk, they do not share their views but all of sudden, they take their life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was serving my jail time in Nadera for five months, I served my time with some of 
<br/>the  people  who  were  seen  as  delinquents  of  the  Nadera  area  and  the  church  looked  after  them.  I 
<br/>shared my meals with them, and it was a sad occasion for me because it taught me a lot of lessons. 
<br/>How the churches, as alluded to by the honourable Ravunawa, went out of their way to try and help 
<br/>our society of different ethnic background yet they were there.

<div><span>Some, we can tell the mind is not 100 percent there but, again, all they wanted is love, all 
<br/>they wanted is some attention to be bestowed on them.  That is not coming from the parents, that is 
<br/>not coming from the family but we, as citizens of this country, can play our role there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not an easy one, it is not an easy challenge but again, the data as alluded to by honourable 
<br/>Ritesh Sharma and honourable Ravunawa will be on the increase all the time, it will never decrease.  
<br/>The population is building up, social problems are too many to address or to name, but I hope if you 
<br/>can agree with me that we ask the Secretary-General to, please, make that statement made by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services in bold statement so as to remind us in future 
<br/>that that challenge was offered to us, and either we did something about it or we almost did nothing 
<br/>about it.

<div><span>Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Platform for Labour Ministers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; I rise to update this august House on the Blue Pacific Big Oceans States 
<br/>(BPBOS) Platform for Labour Ministers with the focus on one voice for the International Labour 
<br/>Organization (ILO), Pacific Island Member States on Employment related matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  BPBOS  Labour  Platform  was  established  by  the  Government 
<br/>representatives of the 11 ILO Member States in consultation with their social partners.  Fiji is the 
<br/>current Chair of the BPBOS while the Government of Cook Islands holds the role of the Secretariat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the BPBOS is to bring together leaders and representative 
<br/>from  the  Pacific  Island  nations  to  discuss  common  employment  challenges,  opportunities  and 
<br/>strategies for sustainable development.  The BPBOS is a body for the Pacific Island nations to seek 
<br/>technical expertise and guidance on employment related matters. It will be the voice of the Pacific 
<br/>Island nations in: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Advocating or raising awareness on the impacts of Climate Change on employment and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>developing resilient societies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening compliance and promoting decent work conditions in the maritime labour 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector and assisting with trade agreements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening the spirit of tripartism in the Pacific in line with ILO Convention 144. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Amplifying the voice of the ILO Pacific Member States within the International Labour 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conference and the Asia-Pacific Group Forums. 
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Promoting decent work and advancing social justice. 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Assisting Member States in meeting the obligations on ILO instruments. 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Connecting with key stakeholders to assist with the unique challenges faced by the Pacific 
<br/>Island Member States relating to labour mobility and skills development, labour standards 
<br/>and compliance, labour law reform and progressive management of labour relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to delve in the establishment of this Labour Platform.  Sir, during 
<br/>the 2017 International Labour Conference, a tripartite meeting was called on Friday, 9</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2017 
<br/></span><span>for all Pacific Island Member States of the International Labour Conference (ILC) participants from 
<br/></span><span>Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands attended this meeting.  All expressed 
<br/>a common wish to have regular meetings at each ILC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  the  2019  Conference,  a  second  tripartite  meeting  was  called  on 
<br/>Wednesday, 12</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2019.  The participants were Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Cook 
<br/>Islands. It was unanimously decided that a Terms of Reference (TOR) would be adopted by the larger 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>group of Pacific Island States during the Pacific Tripartite High Level Forum on Climate Change and 
<br/>Decent Work in the Pacific on 24</span><span>th</span><span> to 27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2019 in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that Pacific Tripartite High Level Forum, the Labour Ministers requested a presentation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the Big Ocean States and further made significant changes to the draft Terms of Reference (TOR), 
<br/>amend  the  name  of  the  platform  to  align  and  recognise  our  region  under  a  single  appellation  as 
<br/>defined by our Pacific Leaders, and restructure the platform as the regional government platform, 
<br/>given  that  both,  the  social  partners,  that  is,  the  workers  and  the  employers,  have  existing 
<br/>corresponding platforms and to channel their voices accordingly.  The two are Pacific Islands Private 
<br/>Sector Organisation (PIPSO) and Pacific Islands Council of Trade Unions (PICTU).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  on  25</span><span>th</span><span>  July,  2019,  the  Blue  Pacific  Big  Ocean  States  (BPBOS)  Labour 
<br/>Resolution was accepted and signed by the Ministers.  This was to reaffirm our joint commitment in 
<br/>establishing the platform and finalising the content and adoption of the TOR at the 50</span><span>th</span><span> Pacific Island 
<br/>Forum on 13</span><span>th</span><span> to 16</span><span>th</span><span> August in Tuvalu.  Following the signing of the Labour Resolution, the Labour 
<br/>Ministers voted for a new Chair, Vice-Chairs and Secretariat for two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Labour Minister, my predecessor, was elected as the Chairperson while the two Vice-
<br/>Chairpersons were from Kiribati and Samoa.  The Labour Minister from Cook Islands was elected 
<br/>as the Secretariat.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2024 at the High Level Tripartite Dialogue on Decent Work 
<br/>and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent held  on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> to  26</span><span>th</span><span> April here in  Suva, the 
<br/>Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations was reconfirmed as Chair of the 
<br/>BPBOS and Cook Islands as the Secretariat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regrettably,  nothing  had  been  done  since  2019  for  this  course,  for  the 
<br/>reasons best known to the former Chair.  In June 2024 at the 112</span><span>th</span><span> Session of the International Labour 
<br/>Conference in Geneva, the Pacific Member States met at the PIFs office.  In attendance were the 
<br/>tripartite  representatives  from  Australia,  Cook  Islands,  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  Fiji, 
<br/>Kiribati, New Zealand, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Secretariat presented and distributed the TOR.  All the members present at the meeting 
<br/>agreed to the proposal, thereafter as the Chair, I requested the Secretariat to meet to finalise the TOR 
<br/>and the way forward for the BPBOS Labour Relations platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the functions of the BPBOS Labour Platform are to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Facilitate collaboration and building of synergies along ILO Pacific Islands Member States 
<br/></span><span>around the issues of social justice, decent work and good faith employment relations with  
<br/>coordinated efforts and mutual support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthen  the  visibility  and  capacity  of  participants  to  advocate  and  support  a  unified 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific voice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Provide and/or utilise relevant tools and information for advocacy, dialogue and awareness 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regarding Pacific issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Support the ILO Pacific Island Member States in attending employment related meetings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Facilitate discussions on Pacific Labour issues and aim to increase resources towards the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interest of the BPBOS from international organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the outcome of the ILC meeting in June 2024 and re-confirmation 
<br/>of  Fiji’s  chairmanship,  swift  action  has  been  taken  to  revamp  and  advance  the  work  of  BPBOS 
<br/>Labour platform.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a two-day meeting was held on 26</span><span>th</span><span> and 27</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 in Auckland to 
<br/>review the draft Terms of Reference for the BPBOS Labour Minister’s Platform.  This meeting was 
<br/>held at the Fiji Trade Office.  The Government as the Chairperson of BPBOS and the Secretariat 
<br/>represented by the Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Government of Cook Islands,   
<br/>and respective delegations from both countries.  The two-day meeting was a success and it saw the 
<br/>completion of the review of the draft TOR for the BPBOS Labour Ministers Platform for circulation 
<br/>to the respective Labour Ministries at the ILO Pacific Islands member states for their perusal and 
<br/>feedback.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two-day meeting was fully funded by the ILO Office for the Pacific 
<br/>Island countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Labour Platform is the key to recognising and aligning the 
<br/>Pacific region under a single Pacific voice on employment issues and ILO agendas.  This Labour 
<br/>Platform is crucial for the ILO Pacific Island member states on the emphasis of raising visibility and 
<br/>having a common voice in the Pacific at the international arena, where issues that affect the Pacific 
<br/>are to be heard, particularly decent work, employment issues, labour mobility and climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we,  the  small  islands  states  of  the  Pacific  are  always  lost  when  we  are 
<br/>lumped  together  with  the  Asia  region  because  it  is  called  Asia-Pacific.    Asia  has  its  own  unique 
<br/>problems, which is more like conflicts and the rest of it, whereas, we, in the Pacific are small island 
<br/>states, and our problems are totally different from them hence the need for us to have a united voice 
<br/>as SIDS of the Pacific, so that we are able to amplify our voice at the international arena and make 
<br/>ourselves heard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my sincere appreciation through the ILO Office of the 
<br/>Pacific Island countries for their continued support and commitment towards the ILO Pacific Island 
<br/>member  states  in  advancing  social  justice,  not  forgetting  the  full  support  from  the  Fiji  High 
<br/>Commission in Wellington and Fiji’s Trade Office in Auckland for hosting our two days meeting to 
<br/>complete the review of the TOR.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- So that problem is not only existing in the parliamentary representation, 
<br/>IPU.  Now I have heard it from you, Sir.  You also have a problem with getting your group organised.  
<br/>As I have said a while ago, we had the same problem in IPU when it comes to recognising the Pacific 
<br/>as  a  regional  body  because  Indonesia  also  wants  to  be  part  of  the  Pacific,  because  they  share  a 
<br/>common boundary in having their borders fronting or be part of the Pacific Ocean. In that way, some 
<br/>of the countries that come to our meetings go to that meeting because they are part of the Pacific, but 
<br/>the  rest  of  us,  we  are  completely  lost  and  when  it  comes  to  staging  or  staking  our  plea,  that  the 
<br/></span><span>member countries of the 13 countries in the Pacific their problem be taken in by the international 
<br/></span><span>bodies, especially going into COP meetings, they refer us to the United Nations definition again.  So 
<br/>we are simply at a loss, like you have just stated, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now we Chair SIDS, and you may have heard the honourable Leader of the Opposition asking 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister of how best the situation could be addressed?  That is a problem we 
<br/>are encountering, we do not know where we are.  Are we part of the 13 or part of just five or six that 
<br/>comes up with the name “Pacific”, and the big countries (our neighbours) pick their sides where they 
<br/>go to because of the support they need.  That is a very interesting point you brought up, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister.  I hope the executive would be listening intently to the plea that you have sounded.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate for their response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations.  I would like to thank 
<br/>the honourable Minister for a very comprehensive Statement.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Blue Pacific Big  Ocean States Platform  plays a critical  role in  identifying the Pacific 
<br/>Labour Region regarding labour and employment issues as well as the ILO agendas. This platform, 
<br/>as you all know, was established in 2019.  We are proud that Fiji was the first country elected to 
<br/>Chair  the  BPBOS  meeting  and  continues  to  hold  the  position  under  the  leadership  of  the  current 
<br/>honourable Minister.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we hope that the honourable Minister will emphasise the importance of this 
<br/>labour platform in enhancing visibility and the ways of the Pacific nation and also within the Asia-
<br/>Pacific  Region.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  need  to  strengthen  the  need  for  a  unified  voice  in 
<br/>international  discussions  and  issues  affecting  the  Pacific,  particularly  concerning  decent  work, 
<br/>employment matters and climate change. We do hope that the Terms of Reference drafted will serve 
<br/>its purpose and start calling  all Pacific Island States to raise a unified voice regarding labour and 
<br/>employment issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this labour platform is very crucial for the ILO Pacific Members States to 
<br/>raise visibility in the region.  We anticipate that under the single umbrella, labour and employment 
<br/>issues will be top of the agenda. My plea to honourable Minister is for his Ministry to carry out an 
<br/>awareness  programme  regarding  the  Blue  Pacific  Big  Ocean  States  Labour  Platform  so  that  our 
<br/>citizen and stakeholders are well informed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister for being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Chairperson of BPBOS Labour Platform and we understand that Fiji will benefits a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, while we acknowledge this effort and demonstration of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership, we are compelled to seek some pertinent queries based on the facts at hand: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>What tangible benefits have we derived from the BPBOS Labour Platform initiatives to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>date? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>How would you assess the effects of all these efforts on better employment opportunities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and workplace relations in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>What  efforts  are  being  made  to  make  the  voice  of  all  member  Pacific  Island  State 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>represented and equally heard within the BPBOS? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Given our present financial constraints, how sustainable is our present level of involvement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and what are the plans to securing long-term funding for these initiatives? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>How do these international commitments allow us to address both now and into future the 
<br/>immediate  labour  and  employment  challenges  our  people  face  around  things  like  the 
<br/></span><span>creation of jobs and increasing wages? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The BPBOS Platform offers a unique  opportunity for us to come together and share good 
<br/>practices  and  promote  policies  that  will  improve  employment  opportunities,  productivity  and 
<br/>workplace relations throughout the Pacific. Together, we can make sure that our labour markets are 
<br/>resilient and inclusive, able to meet the changing needs of the global economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the honourable Minister’s leadership in this regard. It is only 
<br/>through  such  initiatives  that  we  can  collectively  have  a  voice  and  be  able  to  make  meaningful 
<br/></span><span>progress for all Pacific Islanders.  In saying that, however, we must not lose sight of the fact that we 
<br/></span><span>should  not  be  complacent  or  deviate  from  ensuring  those  benefits  that  come  with  tangible  and 
<br/>measurable outcomes for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  upon  the  honourable  leader  of  the  Group  of  9  Bloc  or  their

<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations for his Ministerial Statement this 
<br/>afternoon.  I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to the big work that you have carried 
<br/>within the Ministry of Employment and also to your current term as the Chairperson for BPBOS.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Labour Ministers Platform is an united 
<br/>commitment  by  all  ILO  Pacific  Island  Member  States  to  advocate  for  the  rights  and  welfare  of 
<br/>workers across our Pacific Island nations.  In the phase of global challenge, economic instability and 
<br/>employment, it is imperative that the Pacific present a cohesive and powerful voice to the ILO on 
<br/>employment related issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that our islands are not only rich in natural resources but also 
<br/>in  human  potential.    Therefore,  we  must  prioritise  the  creation  of  sustainable  and  decent  work 
<br/>opportunities  that  empower  our  Pacific  people,  promote  social  inclusion  and  enhance  economic 
<br/>resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by presenting a united front, we in the Pacific, can amplify our voices and 
<br/>ensure that unique perspectives of Blue Pacific Big Ocean States are heard and considered in global 
<br/>employment discussions with emphasis towards a future where every worker in our region enjoys 
<br/>the rights, protection and opportunities they deserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Blue Pacific Big Ocean States platform will reaffirm the ILO Pacific 
<br/>Island  Member  States  commitment  to  advancing  the  principles  of  social  justice,  equality  and 
<br/>sustainable  development  for  our  Pacific  Islanders  as  one  voice  to  shape  a  brighter  future  for  the 
<br/>Pacific people.  Thank you so much, Sir, for the opportunity.

<div><span>Antimicrobial Resistance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not often that I get to deliver 
<br/>my  Ministerial  Statement  but  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity.    I  stand  before  you  IN  this  august 
<br/>assembly today to address a matter of utmost importance - the relentless battle against Antimicrobial 
<br/>Resistance, commonly known as AMR, or as the media would like to call it superbugs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, AMR, as the World Health Organization (WHO) defines it, occurs when a 
<br/>bacteria, viruses,  fungi  and  parasites  no  longer  respond  to antimicrobial  medicines.    You  may  be 
<br/>aware of antibiotics which the doctor might  have given you when you were sick, this is  one type 
<br/></span><span>of antimicrobial medicine.  It is the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials that is leading to AMR.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  May  2015,  during  the  68th  World  Health Assembly  in  Geneva,  Switzerland,  the 
<br/>global community  took  a  decisive  step  to  adopting  the Global  Action  Plan  on  Antimicrobial 
<br/>Resistance.  Since then, our collective efforts have gained momentum - a momentum that extends 
<br/>beyond Fiji's shores, encompassing our region and the entire world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>jeopardises 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, AMR is not merely a scientific concern, it is a threat to our very existence. 
<br/>It 
<br/>advancements  of  modern 
<br/>imperils the  hard-won 
<br/></span><span>medicine. Antimicrobials,  our  medical  cornerstone,  underpin  surgical  procedures,  infectious 
<br/></span><span>disease management,  and  fundamental  patient  care.   Imagine  a  world  where  these  vital  tools  lose 
<br/>their effectiveness due to resistance.  A world where simple injuries could mean hospital admissions 
<br/>or a  world  where  diseases  such  as  Pneumonia  can  no longer  be  treated.  We  cannot  afford  such 
<br/>a scenario.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1827 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  alarm  bells  rang  in  2016  when  a  report  chaired  by Jim  O'Neill  called 
<br/>“Tackling Drug-Resistant Infections Globally:  Final Report and Recommendations - The Review 
<br/>on Antimicrobial Resistance" predicted that by the year 2050, 10 million deaths will be attributed 
<br/>to AMR globally, surpassing the deaths from cancer and diabetes.  The bugs are getting stronger, 
<br/>yet there are no new antibiotics to treat them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  report  from  the  World  Bank  in  2017  titled “</span><span>Drug-Resistant  Infections</span><span>:    A  threat  to 
<br/>Our Economic  Future”,  framed  the  economic  cost  of AMR  and  the  impact  that  it  would  have  on 
<br/>the world in the not-too-distant future, predicting that an estimated 3.8 percent of global GDP could 
<br/>be lost annually and push 28 million people into poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By 2019, the WHO had reported that 1.27 million deaths globally had been a direct result of 
<br/>AMR infections and contributed to the deaths of an additional 4.95 million people. The numbers are 
<br/>piling up as we face escalating challenges from micro-organisms, and Fiji is not immune.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recent years, we have faced outbreaks of formidable foes like the </span><span>Acinetobacter baumannii 
<br/></span><span>and other  carbapenem-resistant  organisms  (CROs) within  our  major  health  facilities.    these  are 
<br/>what we call, and as I alluded to, as super bugs. These challenges remind us that the battle against 
<br/>this  silent  pandemic  is  far from  over.  Yet,  we  remain  vigilant  and  resolute, steadfast  in  our 
<br/>commitment to protect our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have made significant strides in enhancing our capacities across the various aspects of 
<br/>healthcare,  be  it  in  surgical  interventions,  advanced  dialysis,  or  critical  care.  However,  let  us 
<br/>remember that even the most sophisticated medical procedures can be rendered futile, if our patients 
<br/>fall prey to infections caused by resistant organisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But this is not a cause for despair; it is a call to action. It shows us the importance of our 
<br/>ongoing  efforts  and  the  need  to  strengthen  our  resolve.  Together,  we  can  ensure  that  our 
<br/>advancements in healthcare are not undermined by the threat of antimicrobial resistance. We will 
<br/>continue  to  fight,  innovate,  and  protect  the  health  of  every  Fijian,  ensuring  that  no  life  is  lost  to 
<br/>preventable and treatable infections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Fiji’s  mitigation  strategy,  we  are  not  passive  observers  in  this  fight.  Fiji  has  a  robust 
<br/>mitigation strategy -the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP AMR). Launched 
<br/>in November 2022, the NAP AMR outlines key goals, milestones and collaborative partnerships. Our 
<br/>path forward lies in unity - knowing our adversary and acting collectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The One Health approach to mitigating AMR mandates that we work collaboratively across, 
<br/>not only human health, but also with our animal health and partners in the environment space. This 
<br/>cross-sectoral  approach  recognises  the  importance  of  data  sharing,  cooperation  and  the  multi-
<br/>disciplinary approach, and the importance of the ecosystem we all share. One Health is not only a 
<br/>method but also a powerful tool in our arsenal against AMR. I invite my colleagues in animal health 
<br/>and environmental health to work together to stop this global threat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  National  Action  Plan  on  AMR  in  hand,  strong  cross-sectoral 
<br/></span><span>collaboration  and  good  governance  mechanisms  in  place,  there  is  hope  yet  for  our  people.  Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>National Antimicrobial Resistance Committee (NARC) has led the way in the Pacific and globally 
<br/>on the path of AMR mitigation strategies, and I commend the tireless efforts of the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  awareness  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  our  shared  fight.  It  is  not  confined  to 
<br/>healthcare professionals alone, but for every citizen, whether child or parent, holds a stake. We must

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>educate,  empower  and  engage.  Our  battle  against  AMR  begins  with  understanding  what  we  are 
<br/>fighting against.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all learnt a valuable lesson during COVID-19, the need for proper hygiene practices such 
<br/>as hand washing, the use of masks to prevent the spread of diseases and germs, and the need to protect 
<br/>ourselves  from  old  and  emerging  diseases  using  vaccines.  The  message  must  go  out  there  that 
<br/>together, we can prevent needless deaths and suffering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  2015,  NARC  has  consistently  organised  World  AMR  Awareness  Week  from  18</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>November to 24</span><span>th</span><span> November. This is an important global occasion during which we recognise the 
<br/>threat of AMR and the importance of spreading awareness on how we can protect ourselves. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, awareness is our weapon, and together, we shall prevail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Take heed when doctors and pharmacists tell you to finish your course of antibiotics and do 
<br/>not  ask  for  antibiotics  when  your  healthcare  professional  says  you  do  not  need  it.  Do  not  share 
<br/>antibiotics with friends and family. Every little bit helps, and we must listen to professional advice 
<br/>when it is given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Get vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases and eat a balanced and healthy diet to 
<br/>boost  your  immune  system.    Use  antibiotics  and  antimicrobials  rationally,  whether  you  are  a 
<br/>healthcare professional or a member of the public, we all have a role to play.  Educate other members 
<br/>of your family and your friends on the importance of preventing AMR, remember, we are all in this 
<br/>together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us remember that our fight against AMR transcends borders. 
<br/>It  is  a  shared  responsibility,  one  that  unites  us  in  safeguarding  our  health,  our  future,  and  the 
<br/>generations to come. Our actions today will determine the future we live in tomorrow. Let us come 
<br/>together, from all sectors and walks of life, to fight this common enemy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir and I want to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>very interesting presentation. Not all of us are familiar with AMR, but I want share my experience 
<br/>when I was with Consumer Council of Fiji.  It was 2015 that we conducted a survey with the help of 
<br/>the World Health Organization (WHO), just to understand the perception people had about AMR.  
<br/></span><span>We found that barely 27 percent of our population knew what this AMR was.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So based on that information, with the help of WHO, awareness materials were prepared.  So, 
<br/>I am quite familiar with the area of work that was done at that time, and I am glad that the honourable 
<br/>Minister is continuing with this work.  It is not one time work, it is going to be lifelong, and we need 
<br/>to continuing working in this area to raise awareness.  At the end of the day, it is the people.  It is the 
<br/>choices they make.  And if they make the right choice, it will only help in controlling AMR.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As he highlighted, AMR is not a matter to be taken lightly, that is what we have heard, and it 
<br/></span><span>is a silent but a deadly threat which is looming over Fiji.  He had shared the examples of superbugs 
<br/></span><span>found in the hospital.  Obviously, it is a sign that we are very much into this issue, and we need to 
<br/>address that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also agree with him that many household believe a doctor is no good, or dentist is not good 
<br/>when they visit  them and they are not given antibiotics, and that thinking  needs to be out of our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1829 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>minds, and some messages needs to go in that area so that people are more attuned to the fact that 
<br/>you do not need antibiotics for every illness, like cold and flu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it not a just cultural norms that we have that we start blaming the doctor for 
<br/>not  giving  the  antibiotics,  but  the  spread  of  antibiotic  resistance  bacteria  is  driven  by  doctor’s 
<br/>prescribing antibiotics when they are not needed, they are also situations of that nature.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Patients  not  completing  the  antibiotic  causes,  they  will  not  complete  as  soon  as  they  feel 
<br/>better, they will stop, and whatever they have saved they will pass it on to any other relative who is 
<br/>not well.  They will say, “See, I took this medication, I feel good now, you should continue with it”, 
<br/>so that becomes a problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Purchasing  antibiotics  over  the  counter  is  a  huge  problem.    You  do  not  need  a  doctor’s 
<br/>prescription.  You can walk into a pharmacy and the pharmacist will give you antibiotics. That is 
<br/>how easily antibiotics are available.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this overuse of antibiotics in agriculture, as he 
<br/>mentioned, also fuels the spread of resistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  lack  adequate  infection  control  measures  in  hospital,  also  in  clinics, 
<br/>especially in rural areas where resources are limited.  While the 2023-2024 Budget allocated around 
<br/>$12 million for diagnostic equipment, and as you told us during Committee of Supply, procurement 
<br/>failures have left these clinical tools were not bought around that time.  This poses doctors to rely on 
<br/>a very broad spectrum of antibiotics and accelerating resistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  overprescription  of  antibiotics  without  proper  testing  is  transforming  a  once  treatable 
<br/>infections into life threatening conditions, without proper diagnostic tools our medical professionals 
<br/>are left blindfolded in a battle against resistant bacteria.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  antibiotics  are  misused  in  agricultural  sector  as  well.    Livestock  are 
<br/>routinely  dosed  with  antibiotics,  not  just  to  treat  infections,  but  to  prevent  them,  creating  fertile 
<br/>ground for resistance bacteria that can spread to humans.  Where are the Government’s efforts to 
<br/>enforce responsible farming practices? We should be encouraging best practices and disease control, 
<br/>such as proper housing of animals, better disinfection procedures and isolation of sick livestock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one area that we seriously need to look at is the imported meat products that 
<br/>comes to our shore. We need to check for antibiotic resistant contamination.  Our current surveillance 
<br/>systems are inadequate, riddled with data gaps, as the honourable Minister highlighted, and that is 
<br/></span><span>also contributing to the AMR crisis.  So, strengthening the systems and imposing strict regulations 
<br/></span><span>around antibiotic use is not a choice, it is a necessity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we do not fail to address AMR, there is going to be high mortality rates, longer hospital 
<br/>stays, increased treatment cost, economic losses as he highlighted because people are forced to take 
<br/>extended time off work due to prolonged illnesses and AMRs spreading across borders carried by 
<br/>international travellers and through global trade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, all in all, Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Minister is trying to address the issues, and I 
<br/></span><span>think we all need to help him, including the public who are listening. They need to take care of their 
<br/></span><span>own health so that we can all collectively assist with this battle against AMR crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is quite interesting what you have stated, honourable Kumar, that is the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture on the meat.  I remember the Assistant Minister for Agriculture telling me 
<br/>that they also provide antibiotics, I think to the </span><span>bulumakau</span><span>.  So, his role is not much different from

<br/>of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of 
<br/>Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
