<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES AND  
<br/>OTHER ENTITIES’ 2019-2022 AUDIT REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Audit Reports on Public Enterprises 
<br/>and Other Entities for the audit year ending  from 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 which 
<br/>was tabled on 8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I, as Chairperson of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Public Accounts do move the motion and take this opportunity to speak on 
<br/>the motion on the review of the Audit Reports on Public Enterprises and Other Entities for the audit 
<br/>year ending from 2019 to 2020 and 2021to 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as one can see from the Report, they were for the audit years ending 2019 
<br/></span><span>to 2020and 2021to 2022, that is, during the previous Government’s reign and there are few important 
<br/>points to note.  The 2019 to 2020 audit accounts were sent over to the then Speaker on 17</span><span>th</span><span> September, 
<br/>2021and  referred  to  the  Committee  on  23</span><span>rd</span><span>  September,  2021  and  was  not  looked  into  before  the 
<br/>Government changed hands.  So, there were 11 financial statements, 11 audit opinions, 10 qualified 
<br/>or unmodified and one qualified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021-2022, the audit report was sent over to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/>and referred to the Committee on 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023.  It covered 30 financial statements, out of those, 25 
<br/>were issued with qualified opinions and five were with modified opinions which included Walesi, 
<br/>Fiji, Food Processors Fiji, Fiji Rice PTE Limited and Yaqara Pastoral Company Pte Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I have already highlighted some of the common findings identified by the Committee and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to reiterate the significant matters that needs to be brought to the attention of the House for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span> Editor’s Note:  Reply to Written Question No. 171/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Housing and Local  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure I.

<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/>2019-2022 Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consideration  includes  the  delay.    Public  enterprises  and  other  responsible  Ministries  to  address 
<br/>significant  delays  in  submission  of  quality  draft  financial  statements  for  audit.    They  have  to  be 
<br/>carried  out  by  those  respective  Boards  and  those  in  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  and  those 
<br/>Ministries responsible, including the Permanent Secretary and the Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We believe that the previous Government did not carry out its supervisory role on this.  As 
<br/>an example, we note a lot of delays, the worst is Fiji Investment Corporation Limited which has not 
<br/>provided its accounts for audit from 2006 and also Viti Corporation’s last audit was in 2007.  Apart 
<br/>from that, there were system issues, staff issues and continue to other issues as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second is qualified opinions that needs to be rectified as soon as possible 
<br/>by the current administration.  The third is the auditor needs to be an external auditor or a certified 
<br/>one for all State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and should have the powers to carry out audit.  Their 
<br/>financial or performance on those organisations that receive funding from the Government directly 
<br/>or indirectly to ensure that the findings can be reported to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few that are still outside the ambit of the Office of the Auditor-
<br/></span><span>General and they are Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Sugar Corporation.  We wish to thank Fiji Airways, 
<br/></span><span>they have already produced theirs last month, Air Terminal Services, Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries 
<br/>Limited and Fiji Ports Corporation Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the findings, there were recommendations as well based on those 
<br/>findings  and  we  wish  that  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  carried  out  most  or  all  of  those 
<br/>recommendations  including  one  that  I  probably  assume  is  important  which  is  all  these  Public 
<br/>Enterprises  to  be  well  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises,  as  well  as  Ministries 
<br/>responsible.  Even better, to have a separate ministry of its own with the Minister, so as not to fall 
<br/>back  into  what  happened  in  the  last  Government,  where  a  Minister  was  responsible  for  a  lot  of 
<br/>portfolios. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for that, I also have a list of speakers supplied by the two Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprise and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable H. Chand; 
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Aviation; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  on  this 
<br/>motion.  Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for their 
<br/>thorough Report and for presenting practical recommendations, which is cost effective that we must 
<br/>consider seriously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are vital to our nation’s economic growth.  
<br/>They manage crucial infrastructure such as, ports, housing, transport utilities, financial services and 
<br/>agriculture.    They  provide  services  that  are  not  just  essential  for  our  daily  lives,  but  also  for  the 
<br/>functioning of businesses across the country.  Many of these SOEs operate as monopolies, and we 
<br/>know, EFL, Fiji Airways and many more, which means there is no competition to drive innovation, 
<br/></span><span>improve efficiency or deliver better services to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1715 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While SOEs are meant to serve the interest of the people and the private sector, their track 
<br/>record  is  often  marred  by  inefficiency,  bureaucracy,  corruption,  lack  of  competition  and 
<br/>mismanagement.  These are recuring issues that demand immediate and serious attention.  We all 
<br/>know that when SOEs  fail to  be profitable or break even, they become  a financial burden on the 
<br/>Government, draining resources that could otherwise be invested in crucial sectors like, health and 
<br/>education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot allow our economic progress to be held back by inefficiencies 
<br/>within the SOEs.  Reform is essential and we must continue to create opportunities for private sector 
<br/>engagement or Public-Private Partnerships.  The Committee made eight recommendations, and being 
<br/>a Member of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, we also received some of these reports 
<br/>on SOEs, not all, but few reports come to us.  Based on our experience, working with these reports, 
<br/>I fully support the recommendations made by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendations  1  and  2  suggests  that  smaller  public  enterprises  with  similar  nature  of 
<br/>businesses  or  synergies  should  be  merged.    This  is  to  be  done  to  enhance  strategic  direction, 
<br/>governance and improve cost efficiency.  For example, shared services, this can allow entities to pull 
<br/>resources  such  as  accountants,  HR  personnel,  internal  auditors,  and  even  accounting  software,  a 
<br/>similar arrangement we had introduced with the Ministry of Local Government with all 13 Municipal 
<br/>Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a clear example is Fiji Meats Industry Board (FMIB) and Yaqara Pastoral.  
<br/>These  entities  are  struggling  with  no  clear  direction,  both  operating  at  a  loss.  Yaqara  Pastoral  is 
<br/>engaged in cattle farming to produce high quality beef, while FMIB is in the business of slaughtering 
<br/>animals.    The  FMIB  is  finding  it  difficult  to  keep  its  abattoirs  operational  daily  due  to  low 
<br/>throughputs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that FMIB has land worth around $31.9 million, 
<br/>which is not producing any results, it is just there.  They are not using it to create revenue.  A single 
<br/>board could oversee both operations more effectively and we know that when the boards are separate, 
<br/>they become territorial, but if you have a single board, there will be a single vision, and they will be 
<br/>able to drive the process to success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  SOEs  consistently  fail  to  submit  annual  reports  or  operate 
<br/>commercially, it points to a deeper issue - the appointment of Board of Directors.  Are we appointing 
<br/>fit and proper persons to look after these entities?  We must stop appointing Permanent Secretaries 
<br/>and CEOs to other Boards when they fail to manage their ministries or companies.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need merit-based appointments, selecting individuals with strong financial or commercial 
<br/>expertise. If board members are not delivering, the Government must be prepared to replace them.  
<br/>It is concerning that some SOEs are unable to submit timely Annual Reports. They rely on private 
<br/>accounting  firms  to  prepare  their  financial  statements  and  strategic  plans.  This  raised  a  serious 
<br/>question,  why  are  we  paying  the  CEOs  and  financial  officers  if  they  cannot  perform  this  basic 
<br/>function? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also recommended that the Ministry of Public Enterprises 
<br/></span><span>be  established  as  a  standalone  Ministry.  This  Ministry  would  focus  on  modernising  processes, 
<br/>strengthening  institutional  capacity,  developing  a  corporate  culture,  implementing  the  Public 
<br/>Enterprise  Act  and  monitoring  SOE  performance  to  ensure  efficient  service  delivery  and  better 
<br/>returns for the Government.  I just want to highlight that not all SOEs are commercially based. There 
<br/>are some which are created to perform basic functions for the public, they are not expected to generate 
<br/>any massive revenue. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/>2019-2022 Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SOE portfolio has a total asset-base of over $9 billion in 2022, yielding 
<br/>only $30.8 million in dividends during the COVID period. The Government is expecting a lot more 
<br/>in dividends from these SOEs, now that the situation has normalised, we are back into business and 
<br/>so forth.  However, even considering that, this return is far too low for the scale of assets involved; 
<br/>$9 billion is a lot of money. It is evident that a dedicated Ministry is justified to oversee and optimise 
<br/>the performance of SOEs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government initiated the reform process with the enactment of 
<br/>Public  Enterprise  Act  in  2019  to  improve  SOE  governance  and  commercial  frameworks.    The 
<br/>legislation  places  a  single  Minister  in  charge  of  overseeing  SOEs.  This  clearly  defines  Director 
<br/>duties, sets out governance practices, simplifies SOE legal structures and clarifies the processes for 
<br/>community service obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Asian Development Bank’s Finding Balance 2023 Report 
<br/>which I understand, honourable Gavoka was the chief guest, Fiji’s SOE portfolio was among the best 
<br/>performance in the region from 2015 to 2020 largely due to the various reforms.  However, the Report 
<br/>also identified gaps in the Act. There are no specific deadlines for the SOE to submit their accounts 
<br/></span><span>to the responsible Minister nor is there a requirement for these accounts to be presented in Parliament. 
<br/></span><span>This is the finding of ADB.  However, in my personal view, individual legislation guiding the entity 
<br/>has provisions on the submission of Annual Reports to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, the FijiFirst Government established for the first time a government company called 
<br/>Asset Fiji Limited to allow divestment of shares to the private sector without selling Government 
<br/>assets, as we saw with the past government.  The honourable Prime Minister is very well aware of 
<br/>the sale of Government Shipyard and the National Bank of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government divested shares in Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, 
<br/>Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited and the Government Printery and when that was done, there 
<br/>was a lot of noise being made that we had sold the assets. In fact, the assets were invested into Asset 
<br/>Fiji Limited and the shares in business were divested to private companies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that the Government remains committed to 
<br/>improving our SOE to deliver better results for our people. We have a duty to all Fijians to ensure 
<br/>that  these  enterprises  fulfil  their  intended  roles  and  contribute  meaningfully  to  our  nation’s 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not normal for this thing to be brought up during 
<br/>one of these debates as we only have 10 minutes.  I have a prepared text of 103 pages and most of 
<br/>the things that I will say will come from both sides of the House, and I thank the honourable Member 
<br/>who has just taken the floor, for highlighting some of the issues that are also highlighted here in this 
<br/>contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the general recommendation, she has spoken on some of those.  I will very, very generally 
<br/>and quickly go over the first one on public enterprises should merge for better strategic direction as 
<br/>reported  by  the  Committee.    The  comments  are  noted,  and  the  Ministry  will  explore  the 
<br/>recommendations further and the entities themselves and the stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was just thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that, perhaps we can relook at the procedures in our 
<br/></span><span>parliamentary  processes,  particularly  with  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and  the  various 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1717 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations  they  make,  particularly  also  in  the  case  where  we  are  looking  at  almost 
<br/>generational reports that cover so many years and all the enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to that, perhaps it would have been better if we put all our 
<br/>comments from the Ministries and the Accounting Officers and CEOs of those entities to have their 
<br/>recommendation put back to the Committee in a matrix.  They make the matrix and look at those and 
<br/>see if they can recommend to Government a series of actions that can be taken to better the systems, 
<br/>improve the awareness of Government of what is going on in the public enterprises and also inform 
<br/>the people about the performance of their enterprises.  That is, perhaps, something for the Committee, 
<br/>and I do not know which Committee, we will put that recommendation to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening  its  monitoring,  that  is  also  taken  into  account  and  your  response  in  the 
<br/>recommendation  is  that  some  of  these  are  aligned  to  the  Companies  Act  2015  and  support  the 
<br/>modernisation  of  operations  within  our  public  enterprises  and  the  various  recommendations  that 
<br/>touch on that aspect will continue to be improved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  fourth  general  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is,  all  public  enterprises 
<br/>accounts are updated by 2025.  That is noted and the Public Enterprises leadership will be encouraged 
<br/>to complete the actions in accordance with that recommendation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the fifth general recommendation, on the size, strength and opportunities and potentials, 
<br/>et cetera, the response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the Ministry of Public Enterprises is a standalone 
<br/>Ministry under the leadership of the Prime Minister at the moment.  It could be reallocated to another 
<br/>Minister.  It is a big responsibility.  When the Prime Minister is looking after Foreign Affairs, as well 
<br/>as the Public Service, perhaps, it warrants the commitment of a dedicated Minister to look at those.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has a total of 31 positions with 22 filled.  There are nine Technical Officers and 
<br/>13 Administration and Accounts Officers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the technical positions are understaffed.  
<br/>However, the Ministry is currently in its recruitment phase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sixth general recommendation, the enterprises should focus on their core business and 
<br/>ensure they achieve the 10 percent return.  The response to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is noted and prior 
<br/>to 2019, public enterprises were required to provide the 10 percent return as required on equity to 
<br/>Government.  However, given the unique nature of their respective operations, this may not be the 
<br/>most  equitable  course  of  action.    Certain  public  enterprises,  particularly  those  in  the  agricultural 
<br/>sector, operate in a very competitive environment, while others are doing remarkably well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  following  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  many  of  these  entities 
<br/>suffered losses and were not obliged to provide any form of returns and were scrutinised to utilise 
<br/>whatever profits they generated back into their operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  seventh  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Ministry  to  follow-up  those  public 
<br/>enterprises’ accounts that are not up to date, the Ministry will work in very close collaboration with 
<br/>the relevant stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  eighth  recommendation  that  all  public  enterprises  should  thoroughly  review  their 
<br/></span><span>current  accounting  systems  and  consider  implementing  an  accounting  system  that  would  provide 
<br/>accurate  and  timely  financial  reporting,  including  a  uniform  system  that  can  be  used  by  all  and 
<br/>consolidate all as well, the comments are also noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  However, it is very important 
<br/>to note that each public enterprise differs in nature of operations and sizes, as having a uniform system 
<br/>may not work for all entities, as they are part of different sectors and industries.

<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/>2019-2022 Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  the  Committee  findings,  the  Fiji  Hardwood  Corporation’s  audit  was 
<br/>completed, and Financial Statement was issued for signing on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> June, 2022.  The company is yet 
<br/>to return the Financial Statement, and the Committee asked, why?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, delayed the signing as there was a change 
<br/>in the Board composition.  The matter has been addressed and the Board has signed the 2018-2019, 
<br/>and the 2019-2021 Audit Report is in progress and now with the Office of the Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Viti  Corporation  Limited’s  response  to  the  observation  there,  Viti 
<br/>Corporation delayed the 2008-2009 signing as there was also a change in the Board.  The matter is 
<br/>currently in the process and being addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the re-organised entity of the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, the audit is yet to commence 
<br/>and also the Committee asked, why? This matter has already been addressed.  Audits from 2014 to 
<br/>2018 have been completed and signed and 2019 is in progress and with the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Yaqara Pastoral Company’s 2016-2017 Report, the Statement was sent for signing in 
<br/></span><span>2020 with a qualified opinion.  The opinion was requested to be amended for signing in 2021 but 
<br/>was not signed when the audit report was finalised and sent to Parliament on 17</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021.  
<br/>Now, the account has been finalised but with the modified opinion of 2018-2019 and the question 
<br/>from the Committee was, why?  The response to that is that they have been completed and signed.  
<br/>The 2020 audit is in progress with the Office of the Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Food  Processers  Limited  is  another  problematic  enterprise  with  the  2010  Audited 
<br/>Financial Statements finalised in January 2023, while the 2011-2019 audit is completed and will be 
<br/>coming in the next audit report.  The question was, “why?” The response to that is that the preparation 
<br/>of  financial  statements  was  delayed  as  current  management  had  limited  information  from  the 
<br/>previous years which hindered the drafting of the statements.  Furthermore, during the finalisation of 
<br/>the  audit  of  the  respective  years,  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  completed  its  exercise  at  its 
<br/>discretion which the company did not have control over. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will round off here and leave the rest of the issues with the Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members contributing to this debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion.  Thank you, Sir, for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, I would like to thank the Committee for a very detailed Report.  I would 
<br/>like to thank the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and Committee Members for the detailed Report.  
<br/>My contribution to the motion will be very brief.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noted from the Report that most of the public enterprises are not doing well in terms 
<br/>of profit and service delivery.  Some of the public enterprises would not survive without Government 
<br/>financial support. It is high time that public enterprises should strategise and do well to make profit 
<br/>and provide better services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of financial reporting, sound financial management is needed for 
<br/>both quality and timeliness by many of the entities.  I have noted from the Report that except for Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Public  Trustees  Corporation  Limited,  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB)  and  Fiji  Broadcasting 
<br/></span><span>Corporation (FBC), all other entities have major problems with timeliness.

<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1719 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the idea that some of the smaller public enterprises which have 
<br/>the same nature of business should merge for better strategic direction, governance, management and 
<br/>cost efficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the financial reporting, all the public enterprises, with the assistance of Ministry 
<br/>of  Public  Enterprises,  should  thoroughly  review  their  current  accounting  system  and  consider 
<br/>implementing  an  accounting  system  that  would  provide  accurate  and  timely  financial  reporting, 
<br/>including using a system that can be used by all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Standing Committee on Public Accounts met, the Fiji Coconut 
<br/>Millers Board in May this year, the Committee came to know that on 14</span><span>th</span><span> February last year, a boiler 
<br/>experienced an internal tube leaking which resulted in an explosion. I am not really sure whether the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Employment is aware of this issue or not. Management should ensure that 
<br/>our  employees  are  protected  and  provided  with  an  environment  which  is  safe  for  our  workers.  
<br/>Incidents  of  this  nature  can  be  avoided,  and  workers  are  not  put  at  risk  if  the  directors  and 
<br/>management are proactive.  During our physical visit to Fiji Coconut Millers, we saw that it needs 
<br/>urgent attention and upgrading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  some  public  enterprises  are  not  doing  well,  one  entity  stands  out  and  that  is  Fiji 
<br/>Airways.  Fiji Airways has performed extremely well both, in profit and service delivery, and they 
<br/>have won many awards recently and this is mainly due to the previous Government’s commitment 
<br/>to  keep  our  Airline  from  collapsing  during  the  COVID-19  period.    Today,  we  can  see  the  huge 
<br/>contribution Fiji Airways is making to our tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it was for some of the honourable Members sitting across, who suggested 
<br/>that we should return the planes or let Qantas with minority shares manage our airline, it would have 
<br/>resulted in disaster.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity, I support the motion and thank you for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time that you have given me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak briefly on the State Enterprises, which 
<br/>according to my colleague, honourable Premila Kumar, play a vital role in our economy, given their 
<br/>vast  asset  base  which  is  $9  billion,  plus,  their  contribution  to  GDP,  employment  generation  and 
<br/>provision of public services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today’s headline in </span><span>The Fiji Times</span><span> says that our debt is now $10 billion and 
<br/>growing.  I am one who is not worried about our debt when I see the asset base of our State-Owned 
<br/>Enterprises (SOEs).  There is only one part of the equation.  I believe the fundamentals for Fiji’s 
<br/>economy is very strong and we can pay off our debt without any fear that we would fail in doing that 
<br/>which has plagued other counties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had a bit of time in the banks in my younger days and a fundamental in lending money is to 
<br/>ensure that the borrower has the ability to pay.  For Fiji, we have the ability to pay our debt and I just 
<br/>wish everyone not to spend too much time worrying about our debt.  It is manageable, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>and that there should be no fear as some people like to create.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is 2</span><span>nd</span><span> September.  We came into power in December 2022, and we 
<br/>were  telling  you,  “Wait,  the  economy  is  going  to  grow”.    Right  now,  Sir,  the  dialogue  on  the 
<br/>economy, the tone is bullish.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Westpac, on Friday, upgraded their forecast on our economy.  They initially said, “Look, we 
<br/>thought it was not going to go this way”, but you read the papers on Friday, Westpac said, “There 
<br/>are strong fundamentals in the Fijian economy”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    ANZ  has  upgraded  their  growth  to  about  3.4 
<br/>percent.  We were telling you to wait for it, it will come, and it has come.  The economy now is on a 
<br/>very strong platform, and it is now very bullish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was looking at other possibilities for the SOEs.  I was at the listing of the 
<br/>Sun Insurance at GPH about a week ago and the last time we had a public listing was with the Denarau 
<br/>Marina in 2019.  So, it has taken all these years for another company to be listed publicly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be the new regime.  The people in charge now are going to be aggressive, and we 
<br/>will see more companies listing in the stock exchange and some of them could be from SOEs.  There 
<br/>is huge opportunities to list the SOEs and bring in that liquidity into our system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the case of New Zealand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SOEs were privatised and help pay off their 
<br/>debt.   New Zealand today, I believe, their debt  to  GDP is about  24 percent,  and it is through the 
<br/>privatisation of the SOEs.  So, people of Fiji, do not be worried, you are in good hands.  We have 
<br/>very strong fundamentals here and our SOES is part of the confidence going forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the recommendations of the Committee and I repeat 
<br/>what I have said, that the fundamentals are good, SOEs have a bigger role to play and the people of 
<br/>Fiji should be comfortable for the fact that the economy is in good hands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good that the Government has seen the light 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and converted as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I base my short contribution on the ADB Country Partnership Strategy.  It talks about the 
<br/>performance of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).  Thank you, honourable Minister for Finance, for 
<br/>smiling because it talks about the improvements, particularly the profitability that the changes of the 
<br/>2019 reforms have brought. So, these are the backgrounds that we need, apart from the work of the 
<br/>Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for such 
<br/>a good Report.  It forms the basis for this discussion, particularly for the way forward as well.  So, 
<br/>apart from the ADB Country Partnership Strategy Report, Sir, every now and then I keep referring 
<br/>to the World Bank Country Private Sector Diagnostic Report because it also has specific reports on 
<br/>the performance of SOEs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar, Sir, it has an asset base of around $9 billion, 
<br/>probably something that is more than what FNPF has for now. So, if we can use this well to our 
<br/>advantage, again, this will be good for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation for talking 
<br/>about the economy, this is what we have been saying all along and this partnership needs to continue. 
<br/>Debt is not a new thing, as long as it is well managed and our ability to repay, it is good rather than 
<br/></span><span>just focussing on per capita debt to GDP ratio previously. So, this is good, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1721 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have read the Report, I will not repeat what has been stated previously, but perhaps share 
<br/>some of my thoughts on some of the recommendations given, what has progressed over the years, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly with the few agencies that are highlighted in the Report.  I wish to say 
<br/>this because it is important that I probably raise this issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Coconut Millers, Pacific Fishing Company, Fiji Rice, Food Processors, 
<br/>Yaqara Pastoral, Fiji Meat Industry Board, but I want to say is although the recommendation by the 
<br/>Chairman is for us to have a special dedicated Ministry to look after our public enterprises, I fully 
<br/>support that and if Government can afford, of course, it can seriously consider that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, what I want to stress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the link between the Ministry of Public 
<br/>Enterprises and the line Ministries, given the role that these SOEs provide and the services as well. 
<br/>For example, Yaqara Pastoral. The honourable Minister for Agriculture knows the frustration that 
<br/>we  went  through  and  as  a  result,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  the  team  that  is  in  Papua  New 
<br/>Guinea (PNG) avoided Fiji and went to PNG, but Fiji was their preferred destination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two issues with Yaqara Pastoral that led to some of the developments. One issue, 
<br/>Sir, is the reason we brought this new beef breed. What  I am trying to say is, although it is with 
<br/>Ministry of Public Enterprises, there must be some arrangements in place in terms of the operational 
<br/>and working relationships between the Ministry of Public Enterprises and the other line Ministries.  
<br/>The limousin breed is with Yaqara Pastoral but we cannot access that breed because it is with that 
<br/>other Ministry.  That is why we brought Senepol, Droughtmaster and Wagyu as an example, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For your information Sir, Yaqara Pastoral has a lot of funds now from Fiji Water, but what 
<br/>are we going to do with it to expand and improve Yaqara Pastoral?  This was raised to us when I was 
<br/>in the Natural Resources Committee by the team in Yaqara Pastoral and this is the opportunity to 
<br/>raise it here with you, Sir.  The funds are there, but when can we make the decision so that it can be 
<br/>implemented?  This linkage is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the previous speakers has talked about biosecurity. Again, agriculture has an interest 
<br/>in the work that biosecurity does. When we brought these new breeds, we had to fly the animals again 
<br/>to Melbourne and then fly it over to Fiji because biosecurity cannot allow it just to come through 
<br/>Sydney and then picked up by the airlines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have talked to the honourable Minister for Finance already about some of the frustrations 
<br/>from  the  past  and  I  am  sharing  this,  Sir,  because  this  needs  to  be  addressed.    If  you  may  have  a 
<br/>separate a ministry to look after Public Enterprises but the link between the service providers and the 
<br/>line  ministries  still  needs  to  be  maintained  and  there  must  be  some  clear  guidelines  and  working 
<br/>relationships established because it is important for the economic growth and so forth. That is one of 
<br/>the issues that I wanted to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the recommendation about merging some of the entities Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues 
<br/>I know previously that sort of stopped most of these was the decision to convert loans into equities, 
<br/>because some of these agencies have loans from God knows but still have not been written off or 
<br/>whatever  the  decision  to  be  made.  An  example  was  Food  Processors  and  Fiji  Rice  Limited.  The 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Minister  for  Education  would  know  all  these  because  he  was  in  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/></span><span>Committee back then with Mr. Manu Korovulavula.  These loans were there from those days but yet 
<br/>no decision was made, particularly conversion of these loans into equities so that we can move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps just a comment on the governance, this is one of the key issues, but I am optimistic, 
<br/>these things can change, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There has been some significant improvement in some of 
<br/>these entities - AMA, Rewa Rice, Fiji Hardwood, et cetera, it can change.  Let us bring in fit for 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>2019-2022 Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purpose appointments in the board and, of course, in the management as well and very important is 
<br/>the scrutiny, the monitoring.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you,  Chairman  of  the  Committee  apart  from  Public  Accounts,  this  led  monitoring 
<br/>processes will be very useful in terms of the way forward and particularly the role that this Parliament 
<br/>plays as well.  We do not only allocate resources, but we have to ensure that we monitor effectively 
<br/>and efficiently, so that we can have the return, because that return will provide the employment, will 
<br/>reduce our import levels and then raise our export levels and bring the much needed dollars to Fiji as 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  conclude  by  stating  that  Government,  I  have  also  read  the  factsheet  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance, I am quite worried by what you listed under “Challenges” honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance, because the main thing is, you are in Government, fix it!  It can improve and of course 
<br/>there are huge potentials, but if Government can seriously look into this because that will help us in 
<br/>the long-term. There are so many things, time is limited for the debate, but of course let us continue 
<br/>with these healthy dialogues because it is important for the country and of course the way forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully endorse the Report and look forward to more dialogue on it in future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister and 
<br/>all the honourable Ministers and honourable Members from the other side who have spoken on the 
<br/>motion. I want to thank the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, my Assistant 
<br/>Minister for Finance for producing, with the help of his Committee Members such a good report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The history of State ownership in the economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an old one. We started 
<br/>during independence, the imports substitution strategy and State involvements. State ownership of 
<br/>entities was the best way to take the economy forward, to build infrastructure, to set the economy on 
<br/>a  path  of  sustainable  growth.  As  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  stated,  the  Ministry  of  Public 
<br/>Enterprises, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is responsible for public enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a bit amusing to hear some of the honourable Members from the other side, when they 
<br/>talk about appointments, when they talk about governance, if I could say this, I know they will not 
<br/>like this. For 15 years to 16 years of a kind of dictatorship that we had and the appointments, the 
<br/>opportunities that, that government had to do, the reforms, they did not do that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it 
<br/>is this Government, a democratic one which has provided the transparency, the accountability and 
<br/></span><span>the freedom for public enterprises to now actually undertake some of those reforms after 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last session, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we presented the Annual Reports and the accounts of 
<br/>Fiji Airways in which Government owns majority shares. We understand the issues because State 
<br/>ownership is pervasive in Fiji’s economy. I agree with the Committee’s recommendation on some of 
<br/>the ways in which we can move forward. Fiji’s state footprint appears to be much larger than perhaps 
<br/>some of our peers within the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Business  of State, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we put  it in  another way as well apart from  State-
<br/>owned enterprises is done in a variety of ways. We have different sectors, different types of presence, 
<br/>different shareholdings, different models and it make sense sometimes to have those different models 
<br/>so that we can do things differently in different sectors. You might have to have a different model in 
<br/>the communication sector for example, in the airline industry, in the tourism industry. So, these are 
<br/>important considerations for any Government to ensure that State owner enterprises are functioning 
<br/></span><span>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1723 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is true, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from an economic point of view, sometimes as I said, the role of 
<br/>Government in the business sector especially when Government owns commercial entities can be 
<br/>quite  pervasive,  it  can  crowd  out  investment  from  the  private  sector.  It  may  stifle  competition  in 
<br/>certain sectors because of Government’s presence and Government comes out in every now and then 
<br/>there is an issue to provide subsidies, to provide support so all those variables, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do 
<br/>have an intake on how State-owned enterprises do and how they affect the private sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recommendations  that  the  Committee  has  made,  I  have 
<br/>foreshadowed  some  of  those  in  the  last  two  budgets.  We  said  very  clearly  that  SOE  reforms  are 
<br/>necessary for us to unleash some of the economic potential in the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  is  absolutely  right,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  The fact that we have a very bullish, country laden with confidence in the economy is 
<br/>a  direct  result  of  the  Government’s  leadership  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  in  the  area  of 
<br/>reforms, openness and freedom, but also in the last two budgets, we set a reform agenda Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, that has now showed results. We are now a Government which is properly funded, our revenue 
<br/>base for the first time (honourable Kumar was saying that our revenue forecast is too optimistic), 
<br/>surpassed our forecast for the last financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  And  this  is  the  first  time  ever  that  the  Government  has 
<br/>collected that kind of revenue and our forecast is on target and beyond target. The honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is also right when he is talking about 
<br/>the  confidence  of  the  private  sector  in  terms  of  businesses  because  we  have  shown  that  we  are 
<br/>managing our deficit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our debt to GDP ratio in two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is from 90 percent down to less than 80 
<br/>percent and that is a direct result of what this Government has done in the last two budgets and setting 
<br/>up the confidence. So, SOEs that we are now dealing with, if I can just show honourable Kumar and 
<br/>others on the other side, just by reading some of the timelines.  The worst Government ever in the 
<br/>history of this country where annual reports did not come on time, where audit reports did not come 
<br/>on  time,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  today  presented  reports  from  the  Attorney-General’s 
<br/>Office from 2006.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I read the audit is not completed as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2023, there are audits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>that are pending prior to 2018 and I do not want to name all these entities. There are a whole list of 
<br/>public enterprises that have not produced reports and when the Assistant Minister and the Chairman 
<br/>of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  makes  this  recommendations  to  say,  we  need  Ministers  and 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries to think about getting the reports on time, this is exactly what he means and 
<br/>he has provided this list of entities with the report that have not completed the audit reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually should shame some of the honourable Members from the 
<br/>other side who are saying we did this, we did that when we were in government. Because if entities 
<br/>cannot produce annual reports on time, if they cannot get the audits done on time, obviously, they 
<br/></span><span>cannot  manage  those  entities  well.    We,  as  a  government,  or  the  Ministers  on  this  side,  we  are 
<br/></span><span>determined to get that right! We are determined to get audit reports on time, we are getting annual 
<br/>reports to Parliament on time and that is going to improve the accountability of SOEs and as I have 
<br/>said in the budget, we are open to reforming further, looking at possibilities of privatising, looking 
<br/>at models where we can work with the private sector, looking at models where we do not distort the 
<br/>competition in the economy.  We were not doing that. And there are many instances and examples 
<br/>of  people  who  were  appointed  that  rigged  off  nepotism,  there  were  senior  civil  servants  from

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ministries  sitting  on  the  boards  and  creating  all  kinds  of  distortions.  We  are  changing  that,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we are making sure that our governance, the freedom that the Government is giving to 
<br/>SOEs, Boards, and we are not interfering in those Boards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that gives the confidence that creates the confidence in the economy 
<br/>among the investors, and that is what honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism 
<br/>and Civil Aviation was referring to when we were seeing good signs, bullish signs, confidence in the 
<br/>economy and it is showing in our revenue and the projects that are starting.  That is part of the reform 
<br/>that we are also doing in our public enterprises.  That is the leadership that the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and this Government is providing in managing our economy better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the honourable Members who 
<br/>have  contributed  to  the  debate,  and  look  forward  to  these  public  enterprises  and  other  entities  to 
<br/>improve  their  overall  performance,  and  most  importantly  the  implementation  of  the  audit 
<br/>recommendations.  As stated before, these reports are from 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 and they are 
<br/>old reports from the previous government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we came up with most of the recommendations to move those enterprises forward 
<br/></span><span>to improve further.  Firstly, on the audit reports and the governance; secondly, the timeliness of those 
<br/>audited reports; and thirdly, is the lesson that can be brought in from those public enterprises and 
<br/>SOEs with the reform that this Government is doing.  It is good that we are deliberating on these 
<br/>reports  now,  Sir,  because  as  I  stated  earlier,  this  is  an  area  that  probably  was  sleeping,  there  is 
<br/>potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The performance should increase further hopefully after this as we put in strategies to improve 
<br/>from the recommendations.  Just an example, if we have $4.2 billion assets with 4 percent return, 
<br/>that is around $168 million; and if it is 8 percent, that is around $336 million; if it is $9.2 billion 
<br/>worth of assets, that is around $368 million at 4 percent and $736 million at 8 percent.  So, there is 
<br/>potential, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
