<div><span>Distribution of Solar Freezers – Rural Fishing Communities 
<br/>(Question No. 169/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry update Parliament on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>distribution of solar freezers to rural fishing communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the distribution of solar freezers to Fiji’s 
<br/>coastal and rural communities is a programme that is designed to address the challenges faced by our 
<br/>isolated fishing communities, particularly, in preserving their catch and ensuring that fish products 
<br/>maintain their quality as they make their way to the markets. This initiative was a result of extensive 
<br/>consultation with these communities with the goal of preventing fish spoilage, reducing post-harvest 
<br/>losses  and  enhancing  the  overall  value  of  their  catch.  It  also  aligns  with  our  commitment  to 
<br/>environmental  sustainability,  supporting  the  going  green  concept  by  utilising  renewable  energy 
<br/>resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  the  collaborative  efforts  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  other 
<br/>Government  agencies  and  international  partners,  the  Ministry  has  distributed  a  total  of  33  solar 
<br/>freezers  to  rural  fishing  communities.  This  includes  21  solar  freezers  distributed  to  the  Eastern 
<br/>Division, benefitting communities in Lomaiviti, Kadavu and Lau.  The Western Division received 
<br/>nine solar freezers that were delivered to the coastal villages in Yasawa, Ra and Nadroga/Navosa.  
<br/>The Northern Division received five solar freezers which were provided to remote islands of Yadua, 
<br/>Kia and Cikobia.  The Central Division received three solar freezers which were distributed to areas 
<br/>including Qoma and Yanuca Island.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues encountered was that the 
<br/>solar freezers were not only distributed by the Ministry of Fisheries and their donor agencies,  but 
<br/>were also distributed by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection and the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural and Maritime Development through the Commissioners as assistance to our rural communities. 
<br/>One of the issues raised was the different agencies that provided solar freezers and the back-up that 
<br/>was provided in regard to the solar freezers.  I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if she has 
<br/>faced this issue and if she can look into the matter so that the provision of these solar freezers are 
<br/>centralised so that it is easier to monitor and maintain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  inform  the  honourable 
<br/>Member that  as of this financial year, the procurement of solar freezers is  done entirely  with  the 
<br/>Ministry.  So,  the  Ministry  will  procure  the  solar  freezers  and  distribute  it  accordingly  to  the 
<br/>communities that ask for this assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  And  the  ones  that  were  supplied  by  the  other  donors,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Women is also involved in it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  like  what  the  honourable  Member 
<br/></span><span>mentioned, in the past, other Government agencies were also donating solar freezers which were then 
<br/>distributed  to  the  communities  by  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries.  But  as  of  this  year,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Fisheries  has  decided  to  take  on  the  initiative  to  continue  this  assistance  by  budgeting  for  the 
<br/>procurement of solar freezers and distribution to the various communities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1711 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her answer. I am 
<br/>wondering, how does the Ministry calculate the impact of these solar freezers? Is it just ticking off 
<br/>the box that the solar freezer is in, or do you have some sort of a measure to ascertain the impact it is 
<br/>having on that community? What sort of things are you looking at? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will allow that question to be answered, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the distribution of solar freezers to our rural 
<br/>fishing communities, as mentioned earlier, the Ministry has distributed a total of 33. With respect to 
<br/>the impact, the communities are assisted with solar freezers because of their geographical location 
<br/>and  accessibility.  They  do  not  have  accessibility  to  ice  plants  where  they  can  purchase  ice  and 
<br/>preserve their catch.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are four factors that the Ministry uses to determine who can receive this assistance: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)  Accessibility and isolation; 
<br/>(ii)  Community readiness and organisation; 
<br/>(iii)  Previous engagement and data sharing; and 
<br/>(iv)  Donor and partner priorities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>answers that she has provided. I had raised a question of other government agencies that distribute 
<br/>the solar freezers, more so with the divisional Commissioners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is when we visit the different islands, the question arises, will 
<br/>the Ministry of Fisheries repair the solar freezers even though it is distributed by other agencies? Just 
<br/>because of the storage of fish, they think that the Ministry of Fisheries becomes responsible for those 
<br/>units that was distributed by other Ministries and agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, with this initiative, we have seen considerable 
<br/>success and we are also aware of the challenges that have arisen with the distributed units. So, there 
<br/>have been reports of technical issues with solar panels, invertors and battery systems, particularly in 
<br/>areas  with  inconsistent  sunlight  and  extreme  weather  conditions.    So,  the  Ministry  is  actively 
<br/>addressing these issues by working closely with the suppliers to improve the technology and tailor-
<br/>made systems to the specific needs of each location of each community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outcome of the 2020 Meeting of PRC4CD 
<br/>(Question No. 170/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the outcome of the 2020 Meeting of the Pacific Regional Council for Early Childhood 
<br/>Development?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member 
<br/></span><span>for  the  question.  Even  though  I  cannot  update  Parliament  on  the  outcome  of  the  2020  Meeting 
<br/>because  I  was  not  yet  a  Minister  then,  nevertheless,  the  Early  Childhood  Development  topic, 
<br/>especially the policy as it is now, has been a topic of discussion for some time and, therefore, I will 
<br/>share my experience and what has transpired since taking office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In early February 2023, there was a regional meeting which involved Pacific Island nations 
<br/>that met in Nadi that endorsed the Early Childhood Development and all agreed that it be recognised 
<br/>respectfully in the region.  That being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the current development of 
<br/>Early Childhood, what is Early Childhood Development?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the first 1,000 days of life for an infant, and studies have shown that 
<br/>there is an investment case in terms of a dollar being invested into Early Childhood Development, 
<br/>there is a return of $13 worth of investment.  Therefore, I can say that Fiji, within the region, is taking 
<br/>the lead and we are very grateful to the previous Administration for ensuring that Early Childhood 
<br/>Development is a priority of Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health together with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection and other relevant Ministries and stakeholders, have formed a steering 
<br/>committee  and  did  consultation.  Last  month,  Cabinet  endorsed  the  National  Early  Childhood 
<br/>Development  Policy  and  the  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Accountability  Learning  Framework.  
<br/>Cabinet has also endorsed the Early Childhood Development funding under the respective Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women and Children and Social 
<br/>Protection, to be provided through the normal budgetary process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, I can also say that as part of the new National Development Plan that is 
<br/>also being factored into the Early Childhood Development Policy, as I have said, Fiji is one of the 
<br/>leaders  in  the  region  and  we  are  very  grateful  to  the  previous  Administration  and  the  current 
<br/>Government on how it is prioritising Early Childhood Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not only ensuring the first 1,000 days of life but we are also ensuring that maternal 
<br/>health  is  where  development  starts.  So,  we  are  looking  into  the  development  and  welfare  of  our 
<br/>mothers during the early stages and in doing so, we want to ensure in our future generation in terms 
<br/>of combatting NCDs, in terms of combatting other current challenges we are facing now, ensuring 
<br/>that we start from an early age, ensuring that our younger generation get the support in terms of their 
<br/>development, they are able to make wise and good choices. Something I believe was not available to 
<br/>the current generation as we speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the current status of the Early Childhood Development, it is a policy now and in the 
<br/>space of the meeting on PIFS in Tonga, I was very fortunate to attend a day, sponsored by UNICEF, 
<br/>to  share  Fiji’s  experience.  Fiji  is  grateful  to  our  development  partners,  MFAT  and  UNICEF,  for 
<br/>assisting us in this space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister, I have a question. You have 
<br/>just mentioned UNICEF.  In every early childhood workshop, meeting or whatever we may call it, 
<br/>one of the key items  on the agenda is  nutrition  because  for Fiji  particularly,  we have issues with 
<br/>anaemia, stunting and apart from those, under nourished.  How is this being handled together with 
<br/>the key agencies involved?  Again, I keep asking about Fiji’s Food and Nutrition Security Policy, 
<br/>where is it now because this is a key agenda when it comes to the multilateral partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span><span>for  his  supplementary  question.    In  short,  yes,  nutrition  is  part  of  Early  Childhood  Development 
<br/></span><span>Policy, as well as immunisation and education.  The Food and Nutrition Policy links with the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture and I hope very soon we will meet and sit down and see how best that can be brought 
<br/>to the table so that it is adopted. But in short, yes, nutrition is very much part of the Early Childhood 
<br/>Development Policy.
