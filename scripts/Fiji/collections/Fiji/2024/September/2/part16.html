<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst we pray that there are no fatalities during fire emergencies, it is 
<br/>with great sadness that we reveal that lives have been lost during the past fire emergencies, as

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wish to convey our sincere condolences to all the families who have lost 
<br/>loved ones in past years. We can always rebuild our homes, but we cannot bring back the life of a 
<br/>person lost during a devasting fire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is leaving no stones unturned in empowering the 
<br/>NFA in its service delivery and quest in ensuring fire safety. The Coalition Government has given 
<br/>priority to the institution. The people’s government knows that the safety of all Fijians is paramount 
<br/>and  will  ensure  that  fire  safety  and  delivery  of  emergency  services  is  enhanced  to  build  resilient 
<br/>communities and effective emergency services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period July 2021 to July 2024, the three main causes of fire have 
<br/>been electrical, arson/suspicious and unattended cooking. In their efforts to minimise electrical fires,
<br/></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the NFA has been relentless in advocating for safer electrical materials to be installed in our homes. 
<br/>The attitude of buying cheaper electrical materials to install in homes has been very costly at the end 
<br/>for homeowners who have lost everything in a fire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  NFA  is  working  through  its  strategies  in  addressing  its  key  outputs, 
<br/>envisioning to create a lasting impact on the community by reducing the likelihood of fire-related 
<br/>incidents and fatalities, preserving property, and fostering a culture of safety.  In doing so, the NFA 
<br/>has stepped up its awareness campaigns by conducting house to house visits, school visits, as well 
<br/>as community awareness programmes. From January 2021 to July 2024, the NFA has conducted a 
<br/>total of 31,037 house to house visits, 1,170 school visits and 983 community awareness programmes. 
<br/>A total number of 388,033 people have been reached through the three modes of awareness stated 
<br/>above.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to these modes of awareness, the NFA has also implemented its 
<br/>Integrated Community Fire Wardens and Emergency Response Framework. Under this Framework, 
<br/>the NFA operations staff teach specific members of a community on fire safety prevention, first aid, 
<br/>evacuation  procedures  and  how  to  be  first  responders  to  any  fire  and  rescue  emergency  in  their 
<br/>respective communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Community Fire Wardens are provided with two weeks of rigid training 
<br/>in basic firefighting and emergency skills, such as initial response assessment, first aid, evacuation 
<br/>procedures,  et  cetera,  the  catalyst  for  such  a  community  programme  is  simple.  These  trained 
<br/>Community  Fire  Wardens  will  implement  an  initial  response  as  first  responders  in  case  of  a  fire 
<br/>emergency in their communities. This is embedded upon the fact that practising of any change needs 
<br/>to start at home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  its  implementation  in  2021till  to  date,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  NFA  has  rolled  out  its 
<br/>Integrated Community Fire Wardens and Emergency Response Framework to 107 communities and 
<br/>has since commissioned 1,842 Fire Wardens. Under the NFA’s Five Year Strategic Plan, each of the 
<br/>21 stations across the nation must implement the Framework to four communities annually within 
<br/>its operational area. We wish to thank all the communities who have put their hands up to be part of 
<br/>this  Framework  and  for  all  the  commissioned  Community  Fire  Wardens  who  are  now  diligently 
<br/>monitoring their respective villages and settlements to engage in fire safety practices in their homes 
<br/>and within their surroundings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  understands  the  role  that  the  NFA  plays  in 
<br/>keeping the community safe and endeavours to fully support the NFA in fulfilling its roles as an 
<br/>emergency service provider.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, a highlight of the role of NFA will be to provide an understanding 
<br/>of why this Coalition Government is committed to the enhancement of the NFA. From July 2021 to 
<br/>July  2024,  the  NFA  attended  a  total  number  of  11,349  emergency  calls.    These  emergency  calls 
<br/>include  structural  fires,  small  fires,  rubbish  fires,  bush  fires,  car  fires,  road  accident  rescues  and 
<br/>ambulance responses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  2021  to  July  2024,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  NFA  attended  to  536  small  fires;  3,959  non- 
<br/></span><span>property fires (rubbish fires and bush fires); 492 road accident rescues; 206 vehicle fires; and 1,635 
<br/>ambulance responses. These attendances are all  in  the scope of the NFA’s roles and capabilities. 
<br/>Emergency calls for special services, private fire alarm attendance, swift water rescue and ship and 
<br/>boat fires make up the rest of the emergency calls received by the NFA for the period July 2021 to 
<br/>July 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>iii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  NFA  is  responding  to  all  emergency  calls  inside  the  legislated  fire 
<br/>boundaries and outside the boundaries. During the period being questioned, NFA noted that a high 
<br/>percentage of emergency calls were from outside the boundaries. The legislation is only applicable 
<br/>inside the boundaries, which means that property owners outside the boundaries are not paying any 
<br/>form of fire levy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NFA is now working with the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>in reviewing the current boundaries and extend where necessary to be better placed with resources 
<br/>to  address  the  fire  and  emergency  calls  within  its  ambit  of  operations.  With  the  project  almost 
<br/>completed, a submission will be submitted for Cabinet’s endorsement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, fires in commercial and industrial structures are at a minimum. This is owing 
<br/>to the regulatory framework that empowers the NFA to vet building plans and conduct inspection on 
<br/>commercial and industrial premises, to ensure compliance with the National Building Code and fire 
<br/>safety related standards. From 2021 to date, the NFA Structural Fire Safety Department has vetted 
<br/>1,226 building plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same period, they have inspected a total number of 14,862 business premises across 
<br/>Fiji.  With  limited  resources  and  a  heavy  workload,  the  NFA  stays  committed  to  ensuring  that 
<br/>structures and premises visited by the public are fire safe for occupation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in ensuring that the NFA continues to provide this essential service for the 
<br/>nation of Fiji, the Coalition Government is the first Government that has given the NFA the budget 
<br/>required under financial provisions of the National Fire Service Act 1994, that is, 25 percent of its 
<br/>annual budget. In doing so, it has provided the funding for its operations, the sum of $6.1 million. I 
<br/>am  also  happy  to  announce  that  this  is  the  biggest  budget  ever  received  by  NFA  from  any 
<br/>government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  funding  will  assist  the  Authority  in  meeting  the  expenses  for 
<br/>communication  and  ICT  upgrade,  fire  station  expenses,  motor  vehicle  repairs  and  maintenance, 
<br/>procurement  of  firefighting  equipment,  staff  recruitment,  procurement  of  uniforms  and  personal 
<br/>protective equipment and personal emoluments. The funding will also assist in commissioning the 
<br/>Community Fire Wardens as per their strategic plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is devoted to NFA’s quest to be not only the best 
<br/>in  the region  but  internationally recognised in  its sphere of operational  excellence. The aspect  of 
<br/>ensuring good and robust human capital becomes vital.  In doing so, it realises that its firefighters 
<br/>are exposed daily to health and physical risks. The Authority has ensured not only a well calculated 
<br/>insurance and medical care for its employees, but it has gone beyond that scope to maintain that their 
<br/>families have some assurance in the times of life after their delivery of services has ceased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Authority  has  been  able  to  provide  its  operations  staff  a  20  percent 
<br/>increase in wages and salaries. Perhaps, it may be worth noting that the last increment was in 2017 
<br/>for NFA employees. This increase was made possible by the Coalition Government. The strategy is 
<br/>to recognise the hard work done by the Authority and its employees and provide a just reward for 
<br/></span><span>their commitment and unwavering support to the Authority’s operational plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has embarked onto ensuring staff empowerment, 
<br/>technical  training,  and  development  for  our  Firefighters.    The  NFA  has  embarked  on  strategic 
<br/>alliances  that  can  leverage  excellence  in  service  delivery,  knowledge  sharing  and  harnessing 
<br/>technical superiority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>iv. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 17th April, 2024, the NFA now has an MOU with Queensland Fire &amp; 
<br/>Emergency services, based in Brisbane, Australia.  This MOU, which is part of the Fiji-Australia 
<br/>Vuvale Partnership, will be the impetus of a five-year collaboration between the two agencies. It will 
<br/>focus on training, technical support, fire data analysis, mentorship, and equipment exchange.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The NFA was also supported in being a part of the inaugural World Fire Congress that was 
<br/>held in Washington D.C., USA. This event culminated with the signing of a Charter by the 58 Fire 
<br/>and Emergency Service organisations represented from around the world. With that, NFA has set a 
<br/>platform for global collaboration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker.  Sir,  with  NFA’s  five  Strategic  Goals  being  “NFA  Transformation”,  NFA 
<br/>recently launched its new uniforms, symbolising the transition from the old to the new, in line with 
<br/>their Five Year Strategic Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we stand together with NFA in ensuring Fire Safety and efficient delivery 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Emergency Services for all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to this question.
