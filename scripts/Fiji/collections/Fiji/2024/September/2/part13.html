<div><span>Current Status and Funds of PIDF 
<br/>(Question No. 161/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprise and Veteran Affairs 
<br/>inform Parliament on the current status and functions of the Pacific Islands Development 
<br/>Forum? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Naivalurua had a stint as Permanent 
<br/></span><span>Secretary  for  Foreign  Affairs  and  is  fully  aware  of  the  circumstances  on  the  establishment  and 
<br/></span><span>functions  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Development  Forum  (PIDF).    However,  in  the  interest  of 
<br/>parliamentary processes and public information, I have the honour to answer the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  are  all  aware,  the  PIDF  was  established  in  2013  and  mirrored  the  foreign  policy 
<br/>direction of the previous Administration. The establishment of the PIDF was part of a policy crafted 
<br/>to fill the void that emerged when Fiji’s traditional partners held Government then, accountable for

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>breaches of democratic principles and rules-based order that underpin the foundations of our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PIDF was recognised as an international organisation on September the 4</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>of 2015 and was admitted as an official Observer to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) 
<br/>in December 2016.  The organisation signalled a desire by the Pacific Small Island Developing States 
<br/>(PSIDS) to engage directly with development partners to address goals in areas such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate change; 
<br/>Food and energy security; and 
<br/>Ocean conservation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  PIDF  comprises  of  12-member  PSIDS,  civil  society  organisations  and 
<br/>private sector. Key achievements for PIDF, it benefitted Fiji and our PSIDS on a number of fronts, 
<br/>with key accomplishments that I will outline here: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Suva Declaration which was used as a reference point for PSIDS lobbying at COP21 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and contributed to the successful outcomes at the Paris Negotiations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  Nadi  Bay  Declaration  which  voiced  the  Pacific’s  deep  concern  for  the  “lack  of 
<br/>comprehension, ambition or commitment by developed nations” towards the consequences 
<br/>of the climate crisis on vulnerable Pacific nations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Solarisation of the official residences and landmark sites for the Pacific Heads of States 
<br/>supported by UNDP, the UN Office of the South-South Cooperation and the Republic of 
<br/>India.  Fiji had extended that to include the residents of the Head of Arab Government and 
<br/>the Prime Minister’s residents, not just limited to the Head of State or His Excellency the 
<br/>President’s residence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Research and Innovation Ecosystems to Address the Impact of Climate Change in the Pacific 
<br/>(RERIPA)  with  the  overall  objective  to  strengthen  the  Research  and  Innovation  (R&amp;I) 
<br/>ecosystem of small Pacific Island countries. The question also was raised at the recent Pacific 
<br/>Island Leader’s Forum in Tonga, but we managed to allay any fears of any breakaway with 
<br/>the response I gave to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PIDF operates in a crowded space and is not immune to the challenges faced 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by regional organisations. Some of these challenges are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Mandate  issue  due  to  the  highly  contested  regional  space  and  the  evolving  regional 
<br/>architecture,  PIDF  as  the  youngest  regional  organisation,  continues  to  face  the  issue  of 
<br/>relevance in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Leadership – PIDF continues to be branded as a “Fijian entity” and is negatively denoted to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>duplicate the existing regional body PIF Secretariat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Financing – voluntary membership contributions impact on the commitment towards work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Governance Structure – the cost for maintaining the current structure is relatively high. 
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Capacity of the Secretariat – in the original design of the organisation, the Secretariat was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not intended to be a technical organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The way forward for PIDF, in view of the context that brought PIDF into being, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the complexity and multi-layered challenges which PIDF faces, and the outcomes Government 
<br/></span><span>seeks from this entity, it is prudent to have an organisation that is in tune and responsive to the needs 
<br/></span><span>of Fiji and its people.  As such, we are undertaking a review of PIDF with the support of partners to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1687 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>repurpose and re-orientate to a “fit for purpose” organisation that will draw on lessons learned while 
<br/>furthering national and regional interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have received the views of some Pacific Island countries to maintain the 
<br/>PIDF’s </span><span>raison de’etre</span><span> (reason for being) regardless of the name of the organisation, as it serves their 
<br/>interests as well.  PIDF  has been plagued by some management issues,  which we have corrected 
<br/>through prudent internal controls, oversight and improved governance and accountability structure. 
<br/>The PIDF is under review and is transitioning towards becoming an integrated entity that focuses on 
<br/>project delivery across sectors and geographical boundaries. Here, we are leaning towards a fully 
<br/>projectized business model to take this organisation forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  has  had  dialogue  with  current  donors  who  are  pleased  to 
<br/>continue supporting existing projects and moving into new ones.  They are satisfied with the current 
<br/>interim arrangement where the entity is, for the time being, managed from the Ministry of Foreign 
<br/>Affairs,  with  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  Foreign  Affairs  as  its  Interim  Secretary-General,  while 
<br/>ensuring independence of operations with sound oversight on a two-tier accountability and oversight 
<br/>process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An  innovative  role  that  donors  can  play  in  the  governance  structure  under  discussion  is 
<br/>receiving positive feedback.  Lessons from  other regional  entities are  also  being  capitalised here.  
<br/>Thus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new organisation will soon be recognised as an integrated development 
<br/>centre.  Whatever name it will be eventually given is immaterial.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The purpose and goals that it will pursue for Fiji and its neighbours is more important.  It will 
<br/>be a project delivery organisation that is able to receive projects from across Ministries and sectors. 
<br/>It will focus on functional responses through Pacific-specific, nature-based solutions that focus on a 
<br/>model of green growth in blue economies that is in tune with the sustainable development principles.  
<br/>This  will  also  institute  incubators  to  boost  sustainable  development.    An  important  focus  of  the 
<br/>governance structure will be in the monitoring, evaluating and learning components. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regionalism  is  an  important  development  strategy  in  the  Pacific  and  the 
<br/>soon-to-be Integrated Development Centre (IDC), for a want of a better term, will progress strategies 
<br/>that ensure the interests of relevant sectors including the Pacific family, are upheld.  In the process, 
<br/>we envisage that the IDC will elevate support for local sectors and PSIDS’ agenda in partnership 
<br/>with Governments, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and the Private Sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The IDC will be supported as a research and project-oriented organisation with a mandate 
<br/>that will complement regional and sub-regional organisations and actively support the 2050 Strategy 
<br/>for a Blue Pacific Continent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new IDC will reflect an organisation that is agile 
<br/>to enhance the delivery of our national and regional interests under the SDGs, 2050 Strategy for the 
<br/>Blue Pacific Continent and Fiji’s foreign policy pillars of Sovereignty, Security and Prosperity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reviewed IDC will portray a development and program 
<br/>focus which will position it as the delivery arm to work across Government and non-government 
<br/>systems within Fiji’s neighbouring PSIDS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Prime Minister, one of the objectives for PIDF was South-
<br/>South Cooperation and in terms of South-South Cooperation, one of the major issues as part of that 
<br/>was to do with national capacity development.  In light of the fact that we have had some serious 
<br/>migration issues, not just for us but also for our Pacific Island regional neighbours, has the PIDF 
<br/>somewhat erased the anti in terms of us getting more of that out of the PIDF? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has been the perception, but I can assure the 
<br/>honourable Member that at the recent PIDF Leaders Meeting, we assured everyone that it is still a 
<br/>regional rather than a national entity, that is also taking very seriously the interest of the Smaller 
<br/>Island Developing economies of the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is forwarded to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister for a point of clarification.  The clarification is that, for the amendments to the PIDF Charter, 
<br/>including name change of organisation requires a two-thirds majority of the members of the Summit 
<br/>and the adoption of a special resolution of the Conference. So, in the light of this, how can Fiji alone 
<br/>change the name or function of PIDF or were other members consulted on this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  maybe,  I  have  stated  it  wrongly.  That  is  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proposed name that will have to be taken to the Member States next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know the reason as to why PIDF was created 
<br/>and  over  the  years,  Fiji  Government  has  been  giving  funds  to  PIDF,  and  in  the  last  budget,  $1.2 
<br/>million was given to PIDF.  We have also read reports that has come out, there is an overlap in the 
<br/>work  of  PIDF  and  PIFS.    In  that  situation,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  is  the 
<br/>continued  support  to  PIDF  justified  and  whether  that  money  should  be  directed  to  national 
<br/>development? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point raised by the honourable Member is very 
<br/>relevant or the points are relevant, and they are all part of the review that was being undertaken and 
<br/>will  come  up  with  recommendations  and  how  we  move  forward  will  depend  on  how  the  voting 
<br/>happens when the members decide on the movement forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just to shed some light on the issue at stake here – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>PIDF, where it is heading, name change, et cetera, there will be overlaps.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be organising a meeting sometimes next year and approval has been given by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister. They have discussed this in the Business Committee, to see how best the 
<br/>Pasifika  is  integrated  in  its  development,  it  is  fully  represented,  and  at  the  same  time,  you 
<br/>Parliamentarians ought to be leading the fight there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  ought  to  be  leading  the  work  there.  The  decision  should  come  from  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament (MPs), and we are trying to organise a meeting next year in Nadi, which was an outcome 
<br/>of the meeting in Palau.  We can get ourselves better organised because the Pacific Islands Forum 
<br/>(PIFs) is already there, the only thing left now is PIDF. Some have branded PIDF as a Fiji outcome, 
<br/>dominated  by  Fiji  but  yet,  with  the  Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS)  under  the  Inter 
<br/>Parliamentary Union (IPU), we are already chairing SIDs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition is chairing SIDS but when we try and identify SIDS 
<br/>as part of the Pasifika or the Blue Ocean, that is where the dilemma is.  It is difficult because Indonesia 
<br/>would also like to be part of the Pacific. They have their borders fronting the Pacific Ocean, yet there 
<br/>is a bit of a controversy in how they have annexed West Papua.  Then you have the decolonisation 
<br/></span><span>issue.  These are issues that can be better addressed by us, Parliamentarians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You, honourable Members, can better address this, and you take it up through PIF, right up 
<br/>to the IPU, because we have a voice there. That is why we attend COP meetings, just to ensure that 
<br/>the outcome of all the meetings sink down to parliamentary level.  Otherwise, bureaucrats will be 
<br/>running the show, and we are at a loss. That is why we are saying the gap exists, honourable Premila 
<br/>Kumar, because in putting forward certain organisations to be, kind of, a yardstick of ensuring that

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1689 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we  have  a  say  in  what  comes  our  way  through  the  very  existence  of  those  bodies,  it  becomes  a 
<br/>misnomer again because MPs are not there. It is only the bureaucrats who are there.  I am not pointing 
<br/>a finger at the bureaucrats, no!  It is you, honourable Members, who should have a say in this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          The honourable Prime Minister has raised this, even in the PIF meeting in Tonga, and also in 
<br/>trying to re-organise the PIDF.  We are hoping that with the approval that he has already given, that 
<br/>this meeting that we will be hosting next year in Nadi, we will be inviting regional governments.  We 
<br/>have about 13 or 14 regional governments in the Pacific and, hopefully, we can get something passed 
<br/>in that meeting that fairly represents the people who have been elected and given the mandate by the 
<br/>people to represent them in their parliament. That is all I want to share.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Secured Transaction Reform - Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 162/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  update  Parliament  on  the  Secured 
<br/>Transaction Reform, including the Personal Property Securities Registry administered by 
<br/>the Reserve Bank of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, lending as we all know can entail significant risks and without acceptable 
<br/>collateral to secure the payment is a key issue for credit institutions, you know, who would largely 
<br/>rely on what we call immovable assets land and those entities on land and most Micro, Small and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises may not possess them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, lending secured by moveable property was riskier particularly in the absence of 
<br/>legal and institutional challenges to protect secured parties’ interests in the event of a default.  So, 
<br/>the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) with the technical assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
<br/>and the Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) of the ADB led the secured transaction reform 
<br/>essentially to unlock movable financing for MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was in four phases: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase 1 - drafting the legal framework; 
<br/>Phase 2 - establishing the necessary infrastructure; 
<br/>Phase 3 - developing products and services tailored to MSMEs using movable property 
<br/>assets; and  
<br/>Phase 4 - evaluating the impact and promoting the uptake of these products and services by 
<br/>MSMEs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, aims to  support the creation and modification of lending 
<br/>products secured by movable assets. When you talk about movable assets, could be personal property, 
<br/>cars, et cetera, you know, to name a few. To date, several banks and credit institutions have developed 
<br/></span><span>or  adjusted  their  products  to  leverage  movables  financing.  This  includes  simplifying  lending 
<br/></span><span>applications criteria, introducing value chain and invoice financing products particularly for women 
<br/>led MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RBF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continues to maintain what we call Personal Property Securities 
<br/>Registry  (PPSR).  While  working  with  the  ADB  and  the  PSDI  to  encourage  banks  and  credit 
<br/>institutions  in  developing  new  and  modified  lending  products  to  improve  finance  to  MSMEs,  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular,  based  on  a  baseline  survey  conducted  in  2023,  a  sample  of  randomly  selected  1,200 
<br/>MSMEs are being considered for movable financing for the purpose of evaluating the impact of the 
<br/>reform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, around 18 finance promotion workshops have been conducted 
<br/>across Fiji this year with banks, credit institutions and finance companies to encourage the adoption 
<br/>of these new products amongst MSMEs. The target is to reach 1,200 MSMEs randomly selected as 
<br/>part of a 2023 MSME Baseline Survey to measure the reforms impact. To date, at least 500 of them 
<br/>have agreed to share their data with lenders for potential financing. The RBF continued to promote 
<br/>further uptake among the remaining MSMEs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PPSR, managed by the RBF, has recorded over 120,000 notices filed by more than 120 
<br/>client  accounts  including  banks,  credit  institutions,  finance  companies,  other  creditors  and  their 
<br/>agents such as law firms.  So, the Registry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, essentially in an online notice board of 
<br/>security  interests  enabling  lenders  and  the  creditors  collectively  called  secured  parties  to  register 
<br/>notices at any time and place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  allows  anyone,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conduct  public  searches  on  property  rights  over 
<br/>collateral. This is particularly helpful for prospective secured parties as well as buyers of personal 
<br/>property in private transactions. So, for an example, if you want to buy second hand car or something 
<br/>and you want to check whether it is free of existing security interest. You could simply go to the 
<br/>Registrar and publicly search for that information. As of 31</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2024, the PPSR hosted 119 client 
<br/>accounts including six commercial banks, four credit institutions, 45 law firms, four credit unions 
<br/>and  a  range  of  other  secured  parties,  including  finance  companies,  hire  purchase  companies  and 
<br/>motor vehicle dealerships and individuals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  cumulative  filings,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  type  amounted  to  $124,762  filings  including 
<br/>initial 71 percent amendment 4.9 percent, termination 16.5 percent and continuation notices of 7.6 
<br/>percent. So, majority of these filings are made by commercial banks, credit institutions including Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank.  The PPSR services have remained free. For the initial two years following its 
<br/>launch the ADB and PSDI provided funding for the annual maintenance of the Registrar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023, with the impending expiry of the fee period, the RBF Board resolved to continue to 
<br/>subsidise the annual cost of maintaining the Registrar for a further three years to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May 2026.  So, 
<br/>to avoid the need for iterative requests for amendments in future and given the potential for indefinite 
<br/>extensions  for the fee-free period.  It  was agreed that the amendment  reflect  no fee to  be charged 
<br/>unless as determined by the Registrar for the following reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>include the administrative burden for implementing fees; 
<br/>in the best interest of the RBF to continue to promote filings; and 
<br/>linked well with efforts underway to promote new and modified lending products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  such  the  Registrar  is  now  amended  to  provide  that  no  fee  is  to  be  charged  from  the  date  of 
<br/>commencement of the Act until such time has determined by the Registrar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PPSR is the cornerstone of the Secured Transaction Reform providing an efficient and 
<br/></span><span>transparent mechanism for establishing property rights over personal property by lenders and other 
<br/>conditions.  So, with the amendment to the Personal Property Securities Regulations 2019, the RBF, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue to offer fee-free services to its clients and the public search function 
<br/>remains available free of charge, 24/7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the groundbreaking 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1691 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initiatives of FijiFirst and the Government then supported the Bill that was introduced in Parliament.  
<br/>Today, we can see the result of that particular new Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whenever I travel abroad, I always used to see these buildings carrying this 
<br/>small messages which says, “You can take loan for gold”, and I wondered how that was possible. 
<br/>Through this particular legislation, it is possible today. So, my question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>is, how is the Government ensuring that all stakeholders, including financial institutions, consumers 
<br/>and MSMEs, are fully engaged in benefitting from this initiative? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  As  I  have  said  earlier,  there  is  active  campaign,  there  are 
<br/>workshops, and as I have said, a lot of these institutions are actually finding it very useful and people 
<br/>themselves are also finding it useful.  That is the reason why RBF is keeping it fee free, we want 
<br/>more people to use that, and more and more MSMEs are using moveable assets as security and it 
<br/>provides the lenders, including banks who are using that to be able to assess and provide loans. So, 
<br/>it is working. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Awareness is not there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  what  I  have  said,  that  workshops  and  awareness 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>campaigns are being held.  You can do that as well, honourable Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister for continuing the good work that is put in place to put that measure in place.  I think 
<br/>this  is  something  that  is  of  interest  to  a  lot  of  us,  as  you  have  said,  micro,  small  and  medium 
<br/>enterprises.  So, specifically, the issue that was raised here about awareness, what specific measure 
<br/>are you making sure to get to these people?  A lot of them do not probably access a lot of the normal 
<br/>mechanisms that we have, so how is it that we get to those who can really benefit from this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as I have said earlier, the RBF and 
<br/>the  data  on  the  register  shows  that  we  still  need  more  awareness.  We  still  need  to  get  financial 
<br/>institutions to support this and buy in to the use of the register and that is why we have asked RBF, 
<br/>banking institutions and other institutions with whom we have meetings to discuss this, to go out and 
<br/>promote this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RBF itself, will be conducting workshops, awareness campaigns so that MSMEs and the 
<br/>institutions are aware. It is just the people and those who are involved in MSMEs, they may not be 
<br/>aware of it, and that is the idea that we need to promote this more aggressively through various forms 
<br/>of campaigns that I have talked about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you still not satisfied? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You will never be satisfied.

<div><span>Status of the Upgrade of Nautoloulou/Cora Road 
<br/>(Question No. 163/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>1692 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on the status upgrade work at the Nautoloulou/Cora Road in 
<br/>Wainunu, Bua? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Regarding the Nautoloulou/Cora Road in Wainunu, Bu,a  Cora 
<br/>Access, according to information provided to me, is 4.2 kilometres inland from the main Kubulau 
<br/>Road towards the coast, while Nautoloulou is 810 metres side road from Cora Access. Most of these, 
<br/>are  on  freehold  properties  within  the  </span><span>Tikina  </span><span>of  Wainunu,  Bua,  and  currently  it  is  not  part  of  the 
<br/>programme,  but  we  have  worked  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  through  the 
<br/>Commissioner’s Office in terms of addressing some of the concerns of the residents there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The access into freehold properties is an issue in terms of the various families who are there 
<br/>and some at times, have fenced off part of their portion and we are looking at further discussions on 
<br/>that. They will need to surrender portion of the land for the road, if we need to move it to make it a 
<br/>public access, so that is something we will need to discuss further with the freehold landowners, so 
<br/>we can have further dialogue on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- At least, you are moving, you can have more dialogue on that.  I thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister.  I just want to say that in the last session of Parliament, I was complaining about 
<br/>the Hibiscus Highway, and I am glad to see that it has begun to improve over this past few weeks.  
<br/>There is still a lot more work to be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, on this particular road, when you ask for freehold land to be given, is there any 
<br/>thought of compensation or is it according to the will for them to give it as a gift, in this case, for it 
<br/>to be bequeath to FRA? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is part of compulsory acquisition in terms of public access, 
<br/>but we, as a government, it is always important to dialogue with them in terms of that.  Personally, I 
<br/>know  that  there  is  compulsory  acquisition,  but  we  need  to  look  at  what  needs  to  go  back  to  the 
<br/>landowners, as we move forward, because if we extrapolate that into the future, there would be huge 
<br/>economic benefits for any public access, not only for this one, but speaking in general.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- If I remember correctly, we have never done compulsory acquisition ever 
<br/>in Fiji. No, there is always this dialogue going on. That is why all the old Queens Road and the old 
<br/>Kings Road get reverted back to the landowners. So, it is an interesting topic, and that is why the 
<br/>honourable Minister is saying more dialogue, more </span><span>talanoa</span><span>, and then we take it from there. </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu,</span><span> we will move on.

<div><span>Fiji’s Plan on PACER Plus 
<br/>(Question No. 164/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>Plan on Pacer Plus? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, hopefully the way I have answered the 
<br/>question kind of provides the answer, Sir. Our involvement in PACER will rely fundamentally on 
<br/>whether it is good for Fiji. So, in terms of questions on market access and the like, it will be very 
<br/>much dictated on what we actually see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1693 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, the trade imbalance is quite significant. Some may argue that because of the 
<br/>tourism  flows,  that  vary balance  but  that  is  another  view.    I  think  as  a  country  that  is  seeking  to 
<br/>diversify its economy, it is important that we actually try and do more in terms of exports to both, 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand. That is certainly one motivation that is motivating me to look at PACER 
<br/>closer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in terms of direct investment into Fiji, we can see that there are a lot of activities in 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand, and it would be good to benefit from that as well.  So, in response to 
<br/>honourable Koya’s question, Sir, everything that we will do regarding PACER, will be done as long 
<br/>as Fiji’s economic interests are protected and out of it, generally diversify the Fijian economy which 
<br/>I am sure the whole House agrees is long overdue and is something that we should try and achieve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, definitely the deficit is huge 
<br/>and you have mentioned about the potentials to increase particularly more of trade from Fiji into 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key constraints is the facilities that we have. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/>the  negotiations  and  liaison  with  the  other  agencies  because,  to  facilitate  this,  we  have  funded 
<br/>programmes – the Pacific Horticultural and Agriculture Market Access (PHAMA) Plus and Market 
<br/>Development Facility (MDF) because our development partners, Sir, are aware that we lack proper 
<br/>facilities, and we do not qualify in terms of their quarantine regulation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have just talked about PIDF this morning.  Based on the 1994 UNDP Report on Human 
<br/>Security People Centred Development and that is why I asked the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/>We are very interested now in your National Development Plan. So, my question, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister is the importance of these programmes and the continuation of it because some of 
<br/>these are temporary, how are you handling this and what are the prospects in further extending these 
<br/>programmes to facilitate this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the honourable Leader of 
<br/>Opposition asked about those particular two agencies, the MDF and PHAMA Plus because certainly 
<br/>from the Ministry of Trade, if you like, using them as extensively as we can. Just to give you some 
<br/>examples, Sir, the discussions around the kava industry, we have used them in particular, because of 
<br/>the  research  they  have  done  -  PHAMA  Plus,  into  kava.  Also,  we  are  now  talking  to  MDF  about 
<br/>scaling up a study on kava. I know I have talked quite boldly here about a billion-dollar industry, but 
<br/>it is always good to back it up with some analysis. Sir, MDF is actually going in discussion about 
<br/>them assisting with that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, one of the things I realised, was somewhat shocked when I 
<br/>went on the New Zealand Trade Mission, the Australian Government said, “you already have market 
<br/>access pathways for more than 20 crop products from Fiji into New Zealand.”  Therein lies a bit of a 
<br/>challenge  as  well,  which  is  why  we  are  reaching  out  to  MDF  and  PHAMA  Plus,  talking  about 
<br/>pineapple and some other products like that. The medicinal cannabis study was actually done through 
<br/>MDF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, to be quite honest, from the short time I have spent in Government, MDF 
<br/></span><span>and PHAMA Plus are two very good agencies that are actually helping with what we are trying to do 
<br/>in terms of economic diversification.  They are responsible for helping expand the BPO sector.  I was 
<br/>on the other side in the outsource industry executive committee and we actually used MDF to do a 
<br/>scoping study on BPO and then assist the BPO to set up its structure which is now currently running 
<br/>on its own.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in a nutshell, Sir, in response to the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s question, those 
<br/>two agencies are quite effective in my view in terms of what they do and certainly now from our 
<br/>position, we will continue to use them as best as we can to ensure that we explore opportunities and 
<br/>pathways for further economic diversification.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  a $1 billion trade deficit is rather huge and I know 
<br/>when I was the former Minister for Trade, a lot of work was undertaken by the Ministry of Industry 
<br/>and Trade.  They conducted impact assessment just to understand that if they sign up with PACER 
<br/>Plus, what would be the impact on the country itself?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my biggest concern at that time and it remains now is the fact that Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand are not accepting our produce from the Pacific.  In Australia, you will find  </span><span>uto 
<br/></span><span>(breadfruit) in abundance and it is coming from Sri Lanka.  The distance is big, whereas from here, 
<br/>it is a short distance.  So, we need to, sort of, create a pathway to get more of our produce into our 
<br/>Pacific Island countries, particularly when it is fresh, not frozen. It is a huge challenge because we 
<br/>know protection is one way of survival and, perhaps, that could be one of the reasons why some of 
<br/>our produce cannot reach these markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I would like to ask the honourable Minister, are you talking to these two countries for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them to help us to allow this produce to enter their markets? Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the short answer is, yes.  We do recognise 
<br/>that it is called the non-tariff barriers and because of the sovereignty of the two countries, they do 
<br/>have barriers in terms of biosecurity particularly, and other requirements, and there has been an active 
<br/>discussion with them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  other  positive  outcome  during  the  FijiFirst  time  was  when  they  actually  managed  to 
<br/>create a pathway through the ports just recently because of working together with Australia.  I am 
<br/>trying to remember the type of treatment that was used, I think, the “hot air treatment”, so that is the 
<br/>type of collaboration that we will need to continue to be able to try and get our market access through.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very briefly, Sir, you probably would have heard me now and again talk about Fiji Water 
<br/>creating agricultural export commodity and some other potential exporters.  The very reason for that 
<br/>is, it is nice to have the market access, but we need to produce things at scale.  So, the announcement 
<br/>around  commercial  agriculture  is  quite  particularly  driven  to  us  ensuring  that  once  these  market 
<br/>access pathways are clear, we can actually maximise them.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now discovering some very big interest in pineapple, for example, so we are working 
<br/>together with PHAMA Plus and MDF to, hopefully, try and create that pathway but underlying that 
<br/>is a private sector partner, who can be foreign or local, that kind of drives the opportunity, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, yes, it is going to be an ongoing challenge and in our active conversation, we have some 
<br/>very  good  people  in  Biosecurity  who  are  pushing  Fiji’s  interests,  and  we  hope  to  ensure  that 
<br/>particularly, the non-tariff barriers, are continually addressed. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a quick question to the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span><span>Honourable Minister, just post the conclusion of PACER Plus, there used to be an Office of the Chief 
<br/>Trade Adviser (OCTA) where appointments were done, et cetera to assist in all these negotiations. 
<br/>Now that we are moving forward in trying to see if we can finalise it with respect to Fiji, will we be 
<br/>appointing someone to provide that extra expertise for us as an independent person or are we just 
<br/>relying on our own expertise?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, currently as the honourable Koya will know, there are 
<br/>some  very  experienced  trade  negotiators  now  in  our  trade  team,  and  what  we  intend  to  do  is 
<br/>supplement that with the external advice as appropriate, particularly with PACER. We will certainly 
<br/>go down the road of some external advice to just supplement what our local team can do. I think that 
<br/>will be adequate for now, but if there is need for further resourcing, I am sure the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance will reach out to  you, if required, but certainly for now, there is a budget already for 
<br/>current support.

<div><span>Government’s Future Plan on the CBUL Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 165/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament 
<br/>on  the  Government’s  future  plans  for  the  Committee  on  Better  Utilisation  of  Land 
<br/>Programme that was introduced in 2008? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise in response to the question raised by the 
<br/>honorable Leader of the Opposition  regarding  Government’s future plans for the Committee on the 
<br/>Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL) programme that was introduced in 2008.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has been providing an annual budget, through the Ministry 
<br/>of  Agriculture,  since  2008  for  the  operation  of  CBUL.  This  initiative  was  created  to  motivate 
<br/>landowners to</span><span> </span><span>lease their land for productive agricultural use, as opposed to leaving it unutilised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Landowners were given the chance to renew expired agriculture leases, if they lack the means 
<br/>to make use of the land. The subsidy for lease payments to individual landowners through the CBUL 
<br/>programme was increased from 6 percent to 10 percent over the last few years. Initially, the emphasis 
<br/>was  placed  on  the</span><span> </span><span>sugar  industry.    However,  it  has  gradually  expanded  into  other  agricultural 
<br/>commodities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CBUL programme aimed to motivate landowners to give quick consent 
<br/>to lease their land for agriculture purposes.  However, there was a lack of feedback regarding the 
<br/>impact of</span><span> </span><span>the annual expenditure of </span><span>$</span><span>6.9 million due to poor monitoring and evaluation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet’s endorsement for the CBUL Programme had expired in 2022 and 
<br/>the last payment of $6.9 million was paid to landowners through iTLTB in the 2023-2024 financial 
<br/>year.  Since the impact of the CBUL programme on agriculture production was not that clear, we did 
<br/>not have approval from the Ministry of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was no budget allocated for the programme in the 2024-2025 financial year. Some of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the areas of concerns at the moment are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there may be leases that are active but are not under agriculture production; 
<br/>there may be leases that have expired; and  
<br/>leases  that  have  been  rezoned  for commercial  development  but  may  still  be  under  the 
<br/>CBUL assistance programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the concerns on the CBUL programme, the Ministry recommends 
<br/>that consultations be carried out with iTLTB to agree on a way forward, and below are some potential 
<br/>strategies:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the CBUL programme is to be extended, there needs to be active monitoring by the land 
<br/>administrators on its impact on agriculture production and development, as there is a need 
<br/>to  show  the impact  and  return  on  investments  of  public  funds  invested  under the 
<br/>programme. The  CBUL  programme  will  have  to  be  coordinated  through  the  land 
<br/></span><span>administrators, preferably the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, which is the custodian of more 
<br/></span><span>than 82.5 percent of our land.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1697 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The ALTA Schedule of Values will also need to be reviewed to address the outdated land 
<br/>value which has been a concern to landowners over the years. This review and updating of 
<br/>the ALTA Schedule of Values should ensure that land is leased at a comparable rate to the 
<br/>current market rate, ensuring maximum benefits to the landowners. There is a draft Cabinet 
<br/>Paper that is being circulated to carry out a review of the ALTA Schedule of Values for 
<br/>feedback and support before taking it through DSC and Cabinet for endorsement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  in  conclusion,  if  CBUL  is  to  continue,  it  is  essential  for  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture to supply the lists of agricultural leaseholders who require assistance, determined by the 
<br/>productivity of their land.  The main emphasis should extend beyond the lease renewal subsidy.  It 
<br/>should also encompass financial assistance for farmers to enhance their productivity further.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERURATU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. I 
<br/>think the key question that I have is, you have talked about the ALTA Schedule and, of course, the 
<br/>possibility of the continuation. If it is going to be reviewed, particularly on the performance as well, 
<br/>how  will  this  be  distributed  amongst  the  key  stakeholders  that  are  involved  in  the  CBUL  work, 
<br/>particularly  on  the  performances  and  with  the  landowning  units  that  are  responsible  as  well  in 
<br/>ensuring that leases are available? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  in  answer  to  the  question,  the 
<br/>honourable  Member  is  fully  aware  because  during  his  time  as  Minister  for  Agriculture,  we  were 
<br/>handling  CBUL  in  the  Ministry.    The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  was  simply  like  a  post  office;  we 
<br/>received the funds, it comes under Head 30 as part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget, we request 
<br/>for the RIE, and we take the whole funds and pass it on to iTLTB.  The impact of the programme 
<br/>was not monitored by the Ministry because we simply were the post office for the funds. It appeared 
<br/>under our budget, but we passed the whole sum to iTLTB to administer and dish out the funds to the 
<br/>list of landowners that they provided.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The gist of the whole matter is, as custodian of taxpayers’ money, we need to keep account 
<br/>of how those funds have been used and what has been the outcome, what has been the impact of the 
<br/>funds when given out.  That has not been very clear under this programme.  Should we revisit the 
<br/>programme, which I think was noble in its original intent to fasten the approval of landowners for 
<br/>leases, to have their land leased out rather than having it idle, that was a very noble intent by the 
<br/>government at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture and iTLTB failed miserably because we did not come to terms 
<br/>with the monitoring and evaluation part to see what the real impact of the programme was using some 
<br/>parameters, like agricultural production, and we can go on into crops and livestock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his reply. I am 
<br/>glad to see that in CBUL too there will be more of an emphasis on making sure there is a measurement 
<br/>of outputs that come out of it. When CBUL was first put in place, it was largely done in relation to 
<br/>sugar. In CBUL too, will this also be looking at a greater extent at the dairy sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Is that just a general statement or are you asking a question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A question, Sir, on the dairy sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The simple answer is, yes. Since it has now gone from sugar into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>non-sugar, dairy is part of non-sugar. Yes, honourable Member.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  the  answer  that  you  have 
<br/>given and the need for review of CBUL.  Four years now, landowners have been requesting if there 
<br/>could be an increase from 10 percent, and more.  Even the Unimproved Capital Value (UCV) we 
<br/>have is only at 6 percent and CBUL has come in with an additional 4 percent and has given some 
<br/>value to the return of leasing out of land, given landowners in most cases are passive land providers 
<br/>and land is always locked in for a very long time.  If  that could be considered in the review, and 
<br/>increase of that percentage more towards the market value and also more proper coordination too 
<br/>with iTLTB, given that they are now pushing that landowners are to utilise land or to lease land, to 
<br/>move into entrepreneurship rather than only giving out leases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.-  Mr. Speaker,  I thank the honourable Member for raising that 
<br/>concern from the landowners because that is a real concern regarding native land. It is quite unfair 
<br/>when you look at how the two parcels of land sitting side by side (freehold land and native land).  
<br/>Same kind of multi-million dollar view but when it comes to the value of the two parcels of land, the 
<br/>native land is always of a lower value because of what the honourable Member has raised.  So, we 
<br/>will have to consider that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I ask a question, what is now the fate of ALTA? Honourable Usamate 
<br/>is  talking  about  6  percent  to  10  percent  increases.    These  are  well  explained  in  this  particular 
<br/>legislation and that legislation overrides the Native Land Trust Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have clarified with CEO of iTLTB, and this is one of the 
<br/>reasons why I raise this.  Sir, ALTA is in existence but that provision on CBUL is just to fast-track 
<br/>things but I think the key question now is the review of ALTA.  I think iTLTB is working on it.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  review  of  the  rates  is  based  on  the 
<br/>provisions under ALTA and that still continues, but one of the hiccups we had in the Ministry was 
<br/>when there was a decision to wipe out the Land Resource Planning Division.  The Director of that 
<br/>Division is the gazetted officer under ALTA.  So, when we wiped out the Division, that is why we 
<br/>do not have a review.  When I came in as Minister, I brought back that Division.  Now the process 
<br/>of reviewing the rates under ALTA has already started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There are beautiful clauses in there, bad husbandry that is usually executed 
<br/>by a Permanent Secretary for Agriculture or a Scientific Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture.  These 
<br/>are all wonderful parts of the law that in most cases protects the interest of our Indian descent farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  the  veto  powers  in  the  </span><span>Bose  Levu  Vakaturaga</span><span>  in  the  past.    The  Indian  descent 
<br/>farmers, ALTA was their protection.  It is great to hear that you will be reviewing that but again, 
<br/>what  baffles me is  that it is  still in  existence, and you brought  in  CBUL.  Where does that leave 
<br/>ALTA?  It cannot be in existence somewhere, that is part and parcel of the day to day life of farmers 
<br/>under ALTA.  You have got Toko Town lands, those are 999 year leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tribunal  decisions  have  been  made  there  because  of  the  predominant  use,  including  the 
<br/>marginal lots in the cane areas of Qeleloa, et cetera.  I am just raising that as a point of interest for 
<br/>me because I work under the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Ministry for 30 years.  It is hard to try and put that under the 
<br/></span><span>carpet and leave it there when it is very much still in existence.

<div><span>30-Year National Review Report - Beijing Platform for Action

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1699 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the Beijing Platform for Action 30-Year National Review Report? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  THE  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers,  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament;  good 
<br/>afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the leadership of our Prime Minister in 1995, Fiji endorsed the Beijing 
<br/>Declaration and Platform for Action.  It was a comprehensive global agenda for the achievement of 
<br/>gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls. Since then, the UN Commission on the 
<br/>Status of Women has taken stock of progress on this platform for action every five years and for Fiji, 
<br/>I am pleased to update this House that last month, Cabinet had endorsed the Beijing Platform for 
<br/>Action (BPfA) 30-Year National Review Report.  So, it has been 30 years, and 30 years, we are again 
<br/>under  the  able  leadership  of  our  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  bring  this  event  which  will  be 
<br/>celebrated next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The BPfA process provided an opportunity for Fiji to undertake its national review of the 12 
<br/>critical areas highlighting significant achievements and challenges of women and girls over the past 
<br/>five years.  These critical areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are clustered into six dimensions which includes 
<br/>areas such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inclusive development; 
<br/>social protection;  
<br/>freedom from violence; 
<br/>stigma and stereotypes;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>gender responsive institutions; and 
<br/>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>environmental conservation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji BPfA Plus 30 Review Report drew extensive insights from the Fiji Country Gender 
<br/>Assessment (FCGA) which was approved by Cabinet in 2023 and the work that was conducted by 
<br/>the  previous  government  to  get  to  that  point.    I  acknowledge  the  contribution  of  my  two  former 
<br/>women Ministers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FCGA was undertaken over the course of two years and realised through a Whole of 
<br/>Government and inclusive consultation process with various stakeholders.  In this context in building 
<br/>upon  the  extensive  consultation  process  for  the  FCGA  and  other  key  recent  national  strategic 
<br/>initiatives, the BPA Plus 30 Report also benefitted from further consultations and input from civil 
<br/>society, women’s rights organisations, whom I would like to also acknowledge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the preparation of the report for next year was made much easier with the 
<br/>FCGA.  It is important to underline that despite the gendered impacts of the global health pandemic 
<br/>and the continued effects of the climate crisis, Fiji has made strides in advancing gender equality 
<br/>over the last five years.  These achievements, as you know, are attributed to the development and 
<br/>implementation  of key Whole of Government  Gender Equality  Policies.  These strategic national 
<br/>efforts  involved  partnerships  as  I  had  mentioned  with  the  civil  society,  NGOs,  faith-based 
<br/></span><span>organisations and women’s right organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  furthermore,  the  Report  underscored  Fiji’s  commitment  to  a  Whole  of 
<br/>Government evidence-based and transformative approach in rolling out these initiatives and this was 
<br/>commended  very  well  at  the  Women’s  Ministers  Meeting  and  Triennial  Meeting  in  the  Marshall 
<br/>Islands  where  our  counterpart  women  Ministers  around  the  Pacific  would  like  to  get  more 
<br/>information and also help them to develop such policies in their own countries.  As you know, this

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>includes the National Action Plan to prevent gender-based violence and the upcoming Fiji Women’s 
<br/>Economic Empowerment National Action Plan, and Phase Two of the Gender Responsive Budgeting 
<br/>and Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity Development Initiative (ICD).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to at this point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, clarify to members of the public that there 
<br/>is a difference between gender transformative (the use of those words) and transgender.  There were 
<br/>some confusion on social  media about  this  and of course there were a lot of criticisms  about  the 
<br/>initiative, but I would like to clarify that this is not such the case.  Gender Transformative Institutional 
<br/>Capacity Development Initiative looks at rolling out or gender mainstreaming across ministries and 
<br/>agencies in terms of planning, budgeting and having policies to that effect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights significant achievements in critical areas 
<br/>including our social protection policies.  Of course, we know all our six programmes that we currently 
<br/>run, looking at specifically supporting women in the areas of Family Assistance Scheme, Care and 
<br/>Protection Allowance for Children, Social Pension Scheme, Rural  Pregnant  Mothers Programme, 
<br/>Food  Voucher  Programme  as  well  as  the  Transport  Allowance  and,  of  course,  the  Disability 
<br/>Allowance Scheme as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also highlights the challenges that remain, that whilst we celebrate our educational 
<br/>achievements and robust legal and policy foundations, there is a need to ensure these translate into 
<br/>real impacts.  What does this mean?  That is equal participation in the formal economy.  Even though 
<br/>we have over 50 percent of women graduates, we still see a very low participation  in  the formal 
<br/>economy on the labour participation of women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  is  the disconnect  there?   Mr. Speaker, this is  all part of the development of the  Fiji 
<br/>Women’s  Economic  Empowerment  Plan  and  that  is  to  look  into  that.    It  also  includes  access  to 
<br/>financial resources, there are efforts being made and I thank the line Ministries involved including 
<br/>the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises where women are becoming 
<br/>the focus of the provision of micro-finance for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also lack of leadership roles in both public and private spheres and 
<br/>we all need to  do better  to  commit to  more women participating  in  these  roles.  The Report  also 
<br/>highlights the high incidents of gender-based violence including technology facilitated gender based 
<br/>violence and also in the area of women’s health.  I thank the honourable Minister for Health and his 
<br/>team in their commitment in hopefully developing a policy to deal with cervical cancer in Fiji which 
<br/>is the number one cause of death for women in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, going forward, following the submission of this Review Report, we now 
<br/>anticipate Fiji’s participation at the Regional Review at the Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference in 
<br/>Thailand from 19</span><span>th</span><span> November to 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2024 which Fiji has been nominated to be the Vice-
<br/>Chair.  In preparation for the Conference in November, we aim to bring together CSOs, our faith-
<br/>based organisations and women’s organisations as well to present the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Women and I thank the UN Women Fiji Multi-Country Office for 
<br/>collaborating with our team in the Ministry to prepare for this and our Government delegations which 
<br/></span><span>Fiji will be part of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we approach this remarkable 30</span><span>th</span><span> Anniversary of the Beijing 
<br/>Platform for Action in 2025, the Beijing Platform for Action +30 Review Report will showcase not 
<br/>just statistics but the resilience and successes of our Fijian women and girls in all their diversity. Fiji 
<br/>stands as a leader, stands at this pivotal juncture, one we will not only celebrate our achievements 
<br/>but also confront the challenges that continue to persist in the struggle for gender equality and an

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>1701 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urgent call for action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, where there is support for the BPfA but in relevance 
<br/>to gender equality inclusion, gender based violence and women protection, I would like to give the 
<br/>honourable Minister a reality check because the Fiji Police statistics states that 25 percent of crimes 
<br/>against women increased in June, 39 percent increase in July, a young lady died from a ferris wheel 
<br/>incident and we have a child that got injured at the Hibiscus Festival as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of talk about a better future, policies, events, that is fine.  What 
<br/>about the present? While there is support for BPfA and the Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan, 
<br/>what action is your Ministry taking to take care of these women who are victims of these crimes in 
<br/>Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Sharma for the question.  I want to start off 
<br/>by stating that it is not just the Ministry’s responsibility to deal with gender-based violence. It is the 
<br/>whole of Government, whole of society approach that needs to be undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is correct, in the last ten years, the statistics have not changed where two 
<br/>out of three women continue to face violence in their lifetimes.   So, it has not changed under the 
<br/>previous government and so with the development and implementation of a National Action Plan, 
<br/>the key words are “prevention of violence before it starts”.  We do need to take a different approach 
<br/>to actually address the root causes of violence against women and girls and that is patriarchy, it is 
<br/>currently being implemented …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Be yourself! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Yes,  it  was  actually  10  years,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  under  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>previous government as well…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is happening now…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- If honourable Sharma, honourable Kumar and other Members were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paying attention, we are now looking at key settings under the National Action Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Microwaving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. L.D. TABUYA.- In fact for the very first time, our traditional leaders have said that 
<br/>they have even come together to be called by Government, by our Ministry to even discuss gender 
<br/>based violence. It has never been done before and for the very first time, our Great Council of Chiefs 
<br/></span><span>as well as our provincial chairs have come together to discuss this matter, Mr. Speaker, because we 
<br/></span><span>need to address the root causes of it and that is patriarchy.  With these settings, it also includes the 
<br/>health setting as well as the education setting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           We are working with our line Ministries to be able to address this in the education curriculum 
<br/>to educate our children about gender-based violence, about violence against children and developing 
<br/>healthy relationships between boys and girls. Values based education, this is something that they did 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not  address  in  the past,  Mr. Speaker, and this needs to  be inculcated in  the education curriculum 
<br/>which is part of the education curriculum review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Also in the health setting, Mr. Speaker, children do present themselves as too late or even 
<br/>women, the abuse has happened but how do we support the health system in terms of educating our 
<br/>people, educating our children and women as well as boys and men?  Boys and men have not been 
<br/>engaged in the past, Mr. Speaker.  This is something we will be doing differently this time; to talk to 
<br/>our men and boys.  They cannot be left out of the equation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we implement this National Action Plan, we will be conducting a survey, and 
<br/>this survey will inform a communications campaign and the messaging to members of the public on 
<br/>how to prevent violence before it starts and that is within the four-year plan.  It has already been, yes 
<br/>you are right, one-and-a-half years and we have another two-and-a-half years to go. We thank the 
<br/>Australian Government for supporting this initiative as we continue to roll out the implementation of 
<br/>this plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>bringing this topic into this Parliament. Just to let the honourable Minister know, whatever you say 
<br/>now, were all done during our time. However, we have to move forward.  Now, there are certain 
<br/>things that are not being covered, not even in Parliament, not even by laws and it is of great concern.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can learn from other countries like, for example, coercive control. Coercive control is 
<br/>now taken very seriously in other parts of the world, and we would like to see that this is also included 
<br/>in your plan, change the legislation and make it criminal so that we can protect women who suffer in 
<br/>silence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not for you too.  I will ask when I want to ask. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need champions in the area, we need champions 
<br/>in this area, we need more men to stand up and protect women and we need more champions in this 
<br/>Parliament.  Women issues should not be left to women to solve because it is not created by women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. S.D. TURAGA.- We know that! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You know it but what are you doing about it? Do something, knowing 
<br/>is not good enough, do something about it. You are in the Government, change the laws, enforce the 
<br/>laws, just do not work on the surveys, plans, implementation and consultation. We have to move 
<br/>away from it; action is what we need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Sorry, Mr. Speaker,  I just want  to  respond to  honourable  Premila 
<br/>Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Mr. Speaker, there was a statement she made that was actually incorrect and I would like to 
<br/>correct her. In the last 10 years, they have not conducted a survey to men and boys and women and 
<br/>girls.  In our survey that we will be conducting, we will be conducting to …

<div><span>           MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  …  question  men  and  boys  as  well,  and  this  has  never  been  done 
<br/>before.  We are doing this under this National Action Plan. We need to include our men and boys, 
<br/>and honourable Kumar brought up a very valid point, thank you. We do need male advocates for 
<br/>gender equality, and I thank the honourable Member’s initiative that will be coming soon, thank you, 
<br/>through the CWP that we may be seeing that kind of initiative here in Parliament where we do address 
<br/>the issue of coercive control as a crime.  So, we are working on that also as a Commonwealth Women 
<br/>Parliamentarians Group.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the honourable Minister. 
<br/>Thank you for talking about women empowerment, but two of our senior diplomats just got sacked 
<br/>from our Foreign Missions and they are now pursuing their cases. One is the Deputy PRUN in New 
<br/>York and one is the Counsellor in Australia. Is your Ministry going to investigate this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Mr. Speaker, our Ministry has  not  received any  formal complaint 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about these sacking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I will live it to the line Minister concerned to address that.  If any 
<br/>complaints comes to the line Minister’s desk, that is, the honourable Prime Minister, and if there is 
<br/>any issue about them on the basis of being a woman, then we may or may not be involved.  I will 
<br/>leave it to the discretion and the decision of the line Minister concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  five  about  minutes  ago  you  responded  to 
<br/>honourable Rinesh Sharma, where you said that the root cause of gender based violence is patriarchy.  
<br/>Is that evidence-based, honourable Minister, and could we see it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of literature proven by statistics on the 
<br/>basis that patriarchy is a root cause of gender inequality and that is the unequal power  between men 
<br/>and women in decision making.  I exhort Members who have questions about this to, please, have a 
<br/>read on it.  We have conducted the evidence-based, all of government and society approach in the 
<br/>National Action Plan, which is already documented and the survey conducted by thousands of Fijians 
<br/>identified patriarchy as the root cause.  This is the first Government document, first official document 
<br/>to  actually  state  that  patriarchy  is  the  root  cause.    That  is  actually  an  achievement  in  itself,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, coming from the thousands of Fijians who were consulted and surveyed for the National 
<br/></span><span>Action Plan to prevent gender-based violence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I had asked gender-based violence not equalities because 
<br/>she mentioned the root cause of gender based equality now.  I was actually talking about violence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- She has responded by saying that the survey they conducted brought out 
<br/>this continuance of gender based violence, based on patriarchal position because we are a developing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country.  Everything we will try and strive for, we have to come to understand or first of all, try and 
<br/>understand fully where we are; we are a developing nation.  We are tied by traditions and cultures; 
<br/>ours is better even though its patriarchal.  Then you have the ones that exist in very extreme situations 
<br/>like the Talibans, et cetera.  That is a different kind of world altogether that they live in, they do the 
<br/>worst of the worst and as such, I kind of agree with that finding that at least that has come up - the 
<br/>patriarchal influence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In Fiji, that is the way it is, the culture and tradition are mostly patriarchal.  In other parts of 
<br/>the Pacific, you go up to Micronesia, it is matriarchal. That is in our world.  At least, we are kind of 
<br/>moving ahead slowly, but compared to some other countries in the region, it is quite difficult.  Tonga, 
<br/>for instance, they could not ratify that because their Commissioner of Police punched the wife, so 
<br/>tradition and culture still very much operates in that area.  I hope I am sharing that to bring some 
<br/>light into what we are discussing here.

<div><span>Benefits of PPP for the Healthcare Sector 
<br/>(Question No. 167/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the benefits of the Public-Private Partnership approach for the healthcare sector (and I am 
<br/>sure he is not going to tell us it is going to depend on the survey)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Usamate for 
<br/>asking the question on behalf of the honourable Maharaj who is not here with us. Nevertheless, I will 
<br/>try and answer with the best of my ability.  Are you referring to PPP in general or in particular to 
<br/>Aspen Lautoka Hospital or the GP Scheme?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- In general. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He has fired the question, the bullet still has not  landed, so he is making 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some adjustments again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I will answer the question based on what we, as a 
<br/>Ministry  faced,  not  from  any  survey  done.  There  are  benefits  of  PPP,  as  you  are  well  aware.  As 
<br/>previous government you should be well aware of the PPP arrangement and how it was brought in 
<br/>during  COVID-19  and  the  PPP  arrangements  with  Aspen  Medical  so  basically,  you  would  know 
<br/>most of the answers to this question. As we would say in Taveuni, </span><span>taro va Wainikeli</span><span> - you ask when 
<br/>you already know the answer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That being said, Mr. Speaker, I will try and answer it first from the perspective of PPP with 
<br/>GPs and what the Ministry is also doing in terms of the new arrangements and the programmes that 
<br/>are in place, then touch a little bit on the issue with Aspen Medical. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before touching on the benefits, since taking office, we have noted the challenges in trying 
<br/></span><span>to ensure that PPP goes ahead and, at the same time, in terms of monitoring and evaluation  - the 
<br/></span><span>impacts it has on why it was made in the first place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are well aware that it was done during COVID to assist with the busy schedule of public 
<br/>hospitals  but  then,  it  moved  further.  So,  there  are  numerous  PPPs,  together  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Health and the private sector.  That is to do with laundry, security and other services like radiology, 
<br/>et cetera, which are being outsourced when the need arises.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1705 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the benefits of the PPP arrangement, as we speak, we have the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Free Medicine Scheme. So, 59,000 individuals have been registered under this Scheme to 
<br/>date.  
<br/>Kidney Dialysis Subsidies Scheme where 419 individuals have been registered  and  are 
<br/>doing it.   
<br/>PPP for GPs where 17 are engaged as of 2021 and currently, 59 GPs are engaged in the 
<br/>Scheme todate.   
<br/>54  Hospitals  have  outsourced  security  services  and  five  Hospitals  have  outsourced 
<br/>housekeeping services - CWM Hospital, Labasa Hospital, Nadi Hospital, Sigatoka Hospital 
<br/>and Navosa Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With any agreement, there are also risks and if preparatory work is not done right, then what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are currently experiencing are the risks from those issues.  Some of the risks include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)  Poor understanding and application of the concept of Public Private Partnership (PPP). 
<br/>(2)  Weak institutional capacity in the public sector agencies.   
<br/>(3)  Donor-driven PPPs that lose momentum and the interest die down. 
<br/>(4)  Lack or weak monitoring which is an area we are trying to improve on.   
<br/>(5)  Limited sustainable resources. 
<br/>(6)  Political affinities and inability to sustain the PPP arrangement.  
<br/>(7)  Peace and order at PPP site. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, the arrangement between Government and Health Care 
<br/>Fiji, which is the concessionaire, on how it manages Aspen, as it is, they have brought in new services 
<br/>that has improved the quality of services at Lautoka Hospital, such as the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Modern Accident and Emergency Department; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New radiology equipment; 
<br/>a theatre; 
<br/>a Cardiology Unit which tends to look after, I can say, low risk cardiac cases; 
<br/>open cardiac surgery; and  
<br/>other areas within the Lautoka Hospital and also the new Ba Aspen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, the benefits are there but in terms of how planning was done, I believe it was not done 
<br/>properly.  Since taking office, it was the first time for me, together with the Permanent Secretary and 
<br/>our Senior Executives at the Ministry of Health, to be looking at the Concessional Agreement.  I 
<br/>believe,  if  anything  that  has  to  do  with  health,  it  should  involve  health  from  the  initial  stages  of 
<br/>partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, it is something that Government is trying to look at how best we can come out 
<br/>of  it  because  as  it  is,  they  are  employing  our  former  staff,  and  they  are  providing  much  needed 
<br/>services within the Western Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have mentioned some of the benefits in both, the PPP arrangement between the GPs and the 
<br/>current one we are having with Lautoka Aspen and Ba, and I am willing to take questions with regards 
<br/>to any clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I want to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for informing this House that there are benefits on Public Private Partnership (PPP).  Thank you for 
<br/>the honest answer.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the Budget Debate, I did raise this, but the answer was not given or 
<br/>provided  that  before  Aspen  took  over  the  Ba  and  Lautoka  Hospitals,  what  was  the  cost  of  the 
<br/>operations at that point in time? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Bala,  for  your 
<br/>supplementation question. As I had alluded to, the Ministry of Health was not involved in the initial 
<br/>arrangement or the concessional agreement.  Therefore, I cannot answer the question that he is asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just asking what was the cost of operations for Ba 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Lautoka Hospitals before Aspen took over?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am not asking you, you are not the Minister for Health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- It is much less than what you are paying right  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question.  We thank the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  the  answer,  especially,  on  the  benefits  of  keeping  the  PPP.    He  has  also 
<br/>mentioned about the monitoring and evaluation of how this programme has been rolled out.  With all 
<br/>the PPP agencies that are available whether it be Dental, General Practitioner (GP) or private hospital, 
<br/>there was accreditation done by the Fiji Medical and Dental Council for the facility, the specialist 
<br/>licence, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been a lot of deaths lately in our public sector.  So, we must keep the PPP, enhance 
<br/>it and improve it.  My question to the honourable Minister is whether accreditation was done with 
<br/>the public sector, as well in carrying out their healthcare services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  By law, accreditation is  a must  before you  are 
<br/>allowed to practise.  For doctors, accreditation is done by the Fiji Medical and Dental Council.  I am 
<br/>sure he knows this very well.  For nurses, accreditation is done by the Fiji Nursing Council, as well 
<br/>as other cadre.  To answer his question, yes, by law, accreditation is a must before anyone is allowed 
<br/>to practise locally or coming in from overseas to try and practise in Fiji.

<div><span>FRA Plans for Road Extension – Tawake to Wainika Village  
<br/>(Question No. 168/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport update Parliament on plans by the Fiji Roads Authority to extend the road 
<br/>from Tawake to Wainika Village in the Udu Peninsula in Cakaudrove? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for that question.  In terms of 
<br/></span><span>the route from Tawake to Wainika in the Udu Peninsula, that is part of the Rural Roads Programme 
<br/></span><span>in terms of the programme of Fiji Roads Authority (FRA).  As of now, there have been progress in 
<br/>terms of the survey works.  It is about 10 kilometres within the </span><span>District</span><span> of Tawake, Cakaudrove, and 
<br/>currently progressing with final design, including alignment detail, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also due diligent processes to be undertaken in terms of the land, environment and 
<br/>also social safeguard requirements before the project begins.  So, it is crucial that these are all covered 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in order that the project progresses smoothly and meets the needs of the community, of course, with 
<br/>their input into the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of design, as I have mentioned, we are looking at the completion of the complete 
<br/>design  and  technical  specifications,  that  due  diligence,  as  I  have  mentioned,  and  also  a  tentative 
<br/>budget.  It is not in the current budget, but once that work is complete, we envisage to include that in 
<br/>the 2025-2026 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>informing us of the plans for this road which has been talked about at the end of 2022, and we were 
<br/>looking forward to it.  I am just trying to confirm with the Minister whether the road from Lagi down 
<br/>to Tawake that will connect with the new one, is that road in working condition, and if it is not, is 
<br/>that something that you will also upgrade? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, according to Manager North, that has been part of the 
<br/>current maintenance programme but I will have to double check with him. We will need to crosscheck 
<br/>with him again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  just  clarify  because  in  2022,  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics visited the area and that was about Wainigadru to Wainika.  You have 
<br/>talked about Tawake to Wainika.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem with Lagi to Tawake is the hill.  You have to do a big cut on the hill from Lagi 
<br/>to Tawake, so that it becomes accessible.  That is the big challenge.  So, is it Tawake to Wainika or 
<br/>Wainigadru to Wainika. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is sharing his experience from up there in the North. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The question is Tawake to Wainiika and that is the information 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that has been provided to me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question. Honourable 
<br/>Minister, one of the problems in the past but I am not sure about now, after the road has been designed 
<br/>and constructed, is trying to get the PSV vehicle to service those roads, especially the heavy ones.  
<br/>The aggregation part of the road to be able to accommodate heavy PSV vehicles such as carriers and 
<br/>buses, is that part of this project, or is it only like a one stop shop for the construction of road?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noticed that the one in Cakaudrove, especially in the Wailevu area for the Vuadomo Road, 
<br/>Natua Road and Vunidamoli Road, they have been constructed but they are having the problem of 
<br/>trying to get PSV vehicles on those roads.  What measures are you taking to ensure that roads are 
<br/></span><span>being constructed and accredited to service heavy PSV vehicles?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, definitely, if we construct roads, of course, they should 
<br/>cater  for  PSV  vehicles.  From  my  understanding,  that  should  be  done  accordingly  as  per  the 
<br/>specifications and technical requirements when we do roads.  So, when it is done, it is according to 
<br/>those  specifications  which  will  definitely  cater  for  all  vehicles,  including  PSV  vehicles,  such  as 
<br/>public buses and carriers or taxis.

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  accept  that  there  have  been  issues  after  roads  are  done  and  the  maintenance,  but  that  is 
<br/>something we are working on to ensure that, that programme maintenance is monitored and done as 
<br/>and when it is needed rather than being left there to deteriorate, like in the last 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of what had happened with the withdrawal or closure of PWD, it has impacted on 
<br/>the programme maintenance because they were based on location in various areas in Fiji with the 
<br/>required equipment, such as graders, rollers, deep truck - the basic equipment.  That was withdrawn 
<br/>and, definitely, that created problems because you withdrew that public service and replaced it with 
<br/>private contractors.  Unfortunately, that standard has not matched, or the efficiency does not match 
<br/>with the operations of the depots.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suppose, moving forward, that is something as a government, you and us, it is not us against 
<br/>you,  we  need  to  work  together  and  have  the  right  mix  in  terms  of  moving  forward.  So  that  is 
<br/>something  we  are  looking  forward  to  in  terms  of  acquisition  for  the  depots  to  supplement  the 
<br/>programme maintenance side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           MR. SPEAKER.- He wants the right mix. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, just leading on the supplementary question about 
<br/>PSV access to these villages. The base permit for these PSV vehicles from the village to towns need 
<br/>to be considered as well in the specification. I just want to ask the honourable Minister if that is part 
<br/>of it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We are moving from PWD, FRA to LTA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  not  answer  that  because  there  is  a  question  on  that  tomorrow  to  be  asked  by  honourable 
<br/>Tuinaceva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I finish, we had discussed land acquisition, that is clearly specified in Section 27 of 
<br/>the Constitution, I mean your Constitution, necessary public purpose.  So, it is clearly specified there 
<br/>in terms of the owner who will be promptly paid an agreed compensation for property. There is also 
<br/>a framework which had been developed by FRA regarding that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  There are various steps in terms of that acquisition including the various social economic 
<br/>analysis  which  needs  to  be  done,  including  proper  consultation  before  any  project  is  started,  that 
<br/>needs to be all paid for and dealt with. So that is the process being followed.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this junction for the purposes of complying with 
<br/>Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government 
<br/>in Parliament to move a suspension motion. 
<br/></span></div>
