<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- The following honourable Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statements under Standing Order 40: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives, Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister may speak up to 20 minutes.  After the Minister, I will then invite 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the Statement for no more than 
<br/>five minutes.  There will also be a response from the leader of Group 9 Bloc, or his designate, to 
<br/>speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Visit to the People’s Republic of China 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I present my Ministerial Statement in relation 
<br/></span><span>to the State visit to the People’s Republic of China, may I offer words of condolences to Maoridom 
<br/></span><span>on the passing of His Majesty, the Maori King, last week.  He was a great friend of Fiji.  He made a 
<br/>special request to visit </span><span>Na Turaga Bale na Vunivalu of Bau</span><span> when he visited and responded favourably 
<br/>to the invitation of the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and to be present at the Council of 
<br/>Chiefs Meeting in  Deuba.  Also, he made himself available  and responded positively  to  the kind 
<br/>invitation  from  His  Excellency  the  President,  to  be  at  a  dinner  at  the  State  House,  which  I  was 
<br/>honoured to have hosted.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1671 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our condolences go to the Maori people of New Zealand.  I would like to also record our 
<br/>appreciation to the Maori people in New Zealand for their role in the development of sports in Fiji, 
<br/>particularly, the days of the Maori All Blacks.  We have a special place also in our relationship with 
<br/>the Maori people.  In that, one of our late chiefs, Ratu Tiale Vuiyasawa, who found it difficult to join 
<br/>the Colonial Forces of the time, applied to join the Maori Battalion.  But he had to have an English 
<br/>name, so by deed poll, he added “Wimbledon” and they gave him the qualification to join the Maori 
<br/>Battalion that fought in Palestine at the time, until the end of the war when he returned to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have that special  relationship, and we would like to honour him with our letter of 
<br/>condolences, and you will probably be getting an application from the honourable Minister of iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs later on, to be excused from a day’s sitting to represent the Government at his funeral later 
<br/>this week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our visit to the People’s Republic of China was a great demonstration of the 
<br/>friendship that we enjoy with this great power, not only economic, but also in military and political 
<br/>power in the world.  I acknowledge the presence of His Excellency, the Ambassador of the People’s 
<br/>Republic of China here in Fiji.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>those listening in, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all.  My friend, His Excellency 
<br/>Zhou Jian, thank you for your very kind invitation in facilitating the visit to your great country. I also 
<br/>greet those who are watching us on television, livestream or listening in to the radio.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have addressed your Chair, your position in addressing our condolences 
<br/>to  the  people  of  New  Zealand,  the  late  King,  and  dispatching  a  condolence  letter  to  our  High 
<br/>Commissioner in New Zealand – Ratu Inoke Kubuabola.  There was an earthquake in Tonga on the 
<br/>day he died.  We felt it, I thought there was going to be some siren, but they are so used to it in Tonga.  
<br/>I said,  “no siren?” The  honourable Prime Minister said,  “no,  we only  get  a siren when there is  a 
<br/>tsunami warning.”  “What about the buildings crashing?”  He did not have an answer to that.  As I 
<br/>have said, he was a dedicated leader and a friend to the leaders and chiefs of Fiji. He also joined the 
<br/>chiefs of the Pacific in their gathering in Hawaii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the Ministerial Statement and acknowledging the presence 
<br/>of His Excellency the Ambassador this morning, I also watched the television programme last night, 
<br/>where our representative, Robert Lee, spoke on Chinese TV.  I was proud to describe our Ambassador 
<br/>to China, His Excellency Robert Lee, to President Xi Jinping as an ethnically Chinese descendant 
<br/>from  Fiji,  one  of  the many  successful  Chinese  families  we  now  have  in  Fiji,  who  are  now  Fijian 
<br/>citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The bilateral relationship we have with the People’s Republic of China is founded on mutual 
<br/>respect and co-operation, and we observe the "One China Policy" which has been a</span><span> </span><span>key pillar of our 
<br/>bilateral relationship since 1973. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Since assuming  office in 2022, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  primary goal  has been to strengthen 
<br/>relationships  with  Fiji's  bilateral and  multilateral  development  partners. The  ultimate  goal  is  to 
<br/></span><span>restore  Fiji's  position on  the  global  stage  as  "friends  to  all, enemies  to  none",  and  fortifying  our 
<br/></span><span>foreign policy principles of sovereignty, security and prosperity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that these are also the principles that guide the leadership 
<br/>of His Excellency, President Xi Jinping, of the People’s Republic of China.  In that spirit, I have been 
<br/>keen  to  deepen  ties with  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  and  was honoured  to  accept  their  very 
<br/>gracious invitation extended by Premier Li Qiang for the Official Visit to be conducted from 12th 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>August, 2024 to 21st August, 2024.  The visit marked a significant step in strengthening bilateral 
<br/>relations and we also explored new avenues of co-operation to benefit our nations and people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Fiji recognises that the People’s Republic of China is the 
<br/>sole  legal  government  of  China  in  line  with  the  United  Nations  resolution  on  the  “One  China 
<br/>Principle”.  China’s longstanding relationship with Fiji as a true friend who stands firm, particularly 
<br/>when  we  face  difficult  periods  of  isolation  from  traditional  partners  following  our  own  political 
<br/>upheavals here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that after 1987, when everyone turned away, China stayed 
<br/>on.  That is when we started the Look North Policy internationally. Locally, we have our Look North 
<br/>Policy for Vanua Levu.  Sir, for my delegation and I, the Official Visit was both, humbling and very 
<br/>thought-provoking.  The visit gave me the privilege to witness for myself, the remarkable progress 
<br/>that had been achieved by China in just three decades since my previous State visit in 1994.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 30 years, China had experienced an unprecedented transformation.  Since 
<br/>1994, China’s Gross Domestic Product has increased from just over US$560 billion to a remarkable 
<br/>US$18.5  trillion  today.  This  is  a testament to  China’s strategic vision, innovation  and pursuit  of 
<br/>economic development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same period, China has elevated its GDP per capita from a modest US$470 to now at 
<br/>around US$13,000 per capita.  This has translated to a significant improvement in the standard of 
<br/>living of the Chinese people. This achievement is even more impressive, given China’s population 
<br/>which has grown from approximately 1.2 billion in 1994 to over 1.4 billion today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, China has significantly reduced its poverty rate, lifting hundreds of millions 
<br/>out of poverty, from poverty alleviation to poverty eradication.  I was given a book written by the 
<br/>man  himself,  President  Xi  Jinping,  “</span><span>Up  and  Out  of  Poverty</span><span>”  -  great  reading  for  all  leaders  and 
<br/>aspiring leaders.  China has significantly reduced its poverty rate, lifting hundreds of millions out of 
<br/>poverty in that programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  comparison,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  Fiji  has  also  made  significant  strides  in  its  own 
<br/>economic development,  it is on a much different scale.  Fiji’s own GDP has grown from US$1.9 
<br/>billion in 1994 to approximately US$5.8 billion today. He has not looked angrily at me to say that I 
<br/>am wrong, so I believe it is correct (referring to HE Zhou Jian, Ambassador of China).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  GDP  per  capita  has  similarly  improved,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  increasing  from  around 
<br/>US$2,500 in 1994 to over U$6,200 today.  These figures reflect steady progress in a country with a 
<br/>population that has grown from just under 750,000 in 1994 to around 980,000 today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While our progress is notable, a comparison to the People's Republic of China highlights that 
<br/>significant difference in scale and speed of development between our two countries. This highlights 
<br/>the importance of recognising our unique challenges, and the need to continuously adapt and learn 
<br/>from global success stories.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  delegation  and  I witnessed  once impoverished  villages become 
<br/></span><span>communities  where  residents  have grown  healthier  and  wealthier  through strong  leadership  and 
<br/>commitment  in  the implementation  of  policies.    The  remarkable development  progress  of  China  is 
<br/>largely attributed to a fundamental shift in the mindset of its people. Seeing the great progress made to 
<br/>lift these communities out of poverty, I was reminded of the Chinese proverb, and I quoted this to them, 
<br/>and they smiled, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and he can feed 
<br/>himself for a lifetime."

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1673 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  what  we  witnessed  in  China  is that  the  Government  provided  the necessary 
<br/>enabling environment, while it was the people that truly drove development progress.  The Official visit 
<br/>to  China's  Yunnan,  Fujian  and Zhejiang  Provinces,  started  with a  visit  to  those  three  remarkable 
<br/>into  China's 
<br/>Provinces. 
<br/>ongoing development  efforts  and  facilitated  deep and  considered  analysis  of  our  own development 
<br/>history, our own development journey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three  Provinces  provided valuable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Our  visit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>insights 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I travelled by bullet train, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We were almost running late, and I thought, has 
<br/>someone contacted the driver?  They told me, “No, there is no driver.”  I said, “Oh!”  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>each Province showcased unique strengths and innovations that can serve as lessons for our small island 
<br/>economies, particularly in areas such as poverty alleviation and sustainable development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Yunan Province, Mr. Speaker Sir, I was deeply moved by the infrastructure development 
<br/>and connectivity that have been established to uplift rural communities. Yunnan Province is the most 
<br/>ethnically diverse  Province  in  the  People’s  Republic  of China  with  51  ethnic  groups. The 
<br/>achievements  made  in  alleviating,  and  in some  cases,  eradicating  poverty, is impressive. It  is 
<br/>instructive and commendable that the Government of China has endeavoured to ensure that really no 
<br/>one is left behind.  My delegation and I witnessed this in the minority ethnic villages in Yunnan, who 
<br/>have been lifted out of poverty in a steady, focused and tailored programme of interventions over the 
<br/>last 30 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our visit to Malipo County in Yunnan was eye-opening, and we witnessed first-hand how 
<br/>modern infrastructure has transformed the once poverty-stricken county - helping to lift its residents 
<br/>out  of  poverty.  Basic  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  housing  and  healthcare  facilities  are not  just 
<br/>symbols  of  progress,  but  also  links that  connect  the  rural populations  to opportunities  for  a  better 
<br/>future. That  experience reinforced my belief in the importance of investing and in revitalising the 
<br/>rural, interior and maritime economies in Fiji, to ensure a level playing field for economic prosperity 
<br/>for all citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  visit  to  Fujian  Province  showcased  the  innovative  technological 
<br/>advancements  that  are  driving  China’s  economic  growth.    State-of-the-art  logistics,  software  and 
<br/>automation systems at the Xiamen Port have made it one of the world’s busiest ports, ranked in the 
<br/>top 20 in the world at 13</span><span>th</span><span> place, receiving an average of 45 vessels daily.  Again, I saw cranes and 
<br/>all these machines on the wharf, and I was looking to see if there were any operators.  Then they took 
<br/>me  to  the  room  where  young  men  and  women  were  operating  those  cranes  and  things  that  were 
<br/>working on the wharf.  No one was on the plant itself.  Given its advanced infrastructure and strategic 
<br/>location, Xiamen Port plays a critical role in fostering economic integration across the maritime Silk 
<br/>Road trade between Asia, Europe and Africa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  delegation  and  I  witnessed  first-hand  how  China  is  committed  to 
<br/>reducing its carbon footprint.  It is a lesson, not only for Fiji, but for the rest of the world.  I have 
<br/>been hijacked by time, and I will stop here.  I would like to pay my respects again to His Excellency 
<br/>the Ambassador, the political and community leadership of China, and I would like to commit to 
<br/>them the friendship and also the understanding of the Government and the people of Fiji to assure 
<br/>the future of peace, security and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I also acknowledge the presence of His Excellency, the Ambassador from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>China, in the gallery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  now  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his  designate,  to  make  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I quickly respond to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister’s  Ministerial  Statement,  I  also  wish  to  echo  our  condolence  and  sympathy  to  our  Maori 
<br/>brothers and the people of New Zealand for the sad loss of the Maori King.  Our thoughts and prayers 
<br/>are with them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I also congratulate QVS for the Deans win last week.  I am a bit reluctant to say this, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congratulations for the win, honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I thank the honourable Prime Minister for finally making the visit to China.  I know that 
<br/>it is long overdue.  Unfortunately, there was an incident last year that prevented the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister from making his State visit to China, but thank you, Prime Minister, Sir, for finding time, 
<br/>despite the busy schedule that you have to make that important visit to China.  You have highlighted 
<br/>it, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>China is strategic, China is important for us as a small country with very less influence, but 
<br/>we  always  want  to  make  ourselves  relevant,  particularly  within  the  Foreign  Policy  that  we  have.  
<br/>Friends like China are the ones that support us, particularly being part of the permanent five - they 
<br/>are a voice for us when it comes to our very difficult time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  go  back  to  our  Foreign  Policy,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  know  that  it  is  important, 
<br/>particularly,  for  the  honourable  Prime  Minister.    You  have  talked  about  the  guiding  principles 
<br/>because  Fiji  will  always  follow  a  policy  aimed  at  maintaining  a  stable  and  sustainable  system  of 
<br/>international  relations  based  on  international  law  and  the  principles  of  equality  among  States  in 
<br/>respect  of  national  sovereignty,  independence,  territorial  sovereignty,  non-interference  in  internal 
<br/>affairs of States and respect for international treaties as embodied in the UN Charter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have talked about the bilateral relationship that we have with China and, of course, this 
<br/>is something that we also respect China for, being an economic power, political power, as well as 
<br/>military  power.    They  also,  under  this  mutual  respect  and  co-operation  agreement,  live  to  this, 
<br/>particularly with the non-interference, given the problems that we went through, honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, Sir.  Again, the underlying interest for Fiji’s foreign relations is formed by the principles 
<br/>of friends to all and enemies to none.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to deliberately bring this to the attention of the House because I know, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the process of reviewing our Foreign Policy and coming 
<br/>up with a White Paper. I have been part of the consultation, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I did 
<br/>attend to the invitation, and I have also spoken my heart out to the team, particularly when I was 
<br/>asked about  the geo-politics.  You have stated it, honourable Prime Minister, during our difficult 
<br/>times, that China was with us and that is why it is important that we maintain this strong relationship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I studied our relationship way back when I did an essay, honourable Prime Minister, as part 
<br/>of my Junior Staff Officers (JSO) Course and that is when I saw the “Look North Policy” that we 
<br/>stated way back in1987  that established the Kalabu Tax Free Zone.  That was part of your Look 
<br/>North Policy.  We have always maintained that. China is important to us and China has set so many 
<br/>good examples. On one extreme, it is a superpower, it is developed, but on the other extreme as well, 
<br/></span><span>it is still a developing country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have a lot to learn from them in terms of 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure development and the economic environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the bell is ringing.  You would recall, Sir, in Palau we 
<br/>saw a lot of tourists from East Asia. I know that we are flying to Dallas on 10</span><span>th</span><span> December, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister, but there are economic potentials, particularly in terms of tourists and trade 
<br/>as well with the four Provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi. I know there has been 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1675 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recent visits by the previous government on these four southern Provinces within China and there are 
<br/>potentials, particularly for trade and, of course, tourism.  I do not have time to go into it. There have 
<br/>been some discussions previously, but I hope that we can pick that up to ride on the visit that has 
<br/>been taken by the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to also thank China.  His Excellency is in the House, and we still acknowledge China 
<br/>for their contribution to the development of this country.  Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for 
<br/>your Ministerial Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the leader of G-9 Bloc or his designate, I would 
<br/>also like to acknowledge the presence of Mr. Tevita Koroi and his good wife out there in the gallery. 
<br/>He used to head the, is it the Fijian Teachers or the Fiji Teachers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- Fijian Teachers Association.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is back from the US.  It is great to see our people coming back to their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>homeland. Welcome, Mr. Koroi, and your good wife once again to your Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, good morning to you.  I rise to respond very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>briefly to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Prime Minister for a very comprehensive Statement on his State visit 
<br/>to the People’s Republic of China.  For someone who has had the honour and privilege to have served 
<br/>and seen China in the manner in which they have grown and developed as a great nation, I can testify 
<br/>and admit that the Statement by the honourable Prime Minister is something that is not only inspiring, 
<br/>but something that we really can learn a lot from as a small nation like Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our relationship with China goes back a long way. The key pillar, as we 
<br/>have heard this morning from the honourable Prime Minister, is based on the One China Policy.  Fiji 
<br/>has stood firm on this Policy since we established the relationship. I am made to understand that the 
<br/>primary purpose of this visit was to strengthen and deepen our relationship again with China.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also heard from the two speakers that China was one of the few countries that stood 
<br/>firm with us in our days in which we had great difficulties and remained so as of today. There is so 
<br/>much  we  can  learn  from  China  to  grow  our  nation.  Reading  the  report  by  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister, he has visited key Provinces and that is a clear testimony of models that have demonstrated 
<br/>how China has grown and developed in the last 30 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From Yunnan Province, we have seen a model of how poverty has been able to be turned 
<br/>around, but only through people focussed, people-driven strategy to change the Province around, but 
<br/>also through hard work, commitment and perseverance by the population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard about his visit to Fujian Province and we have seen how technology has been 
<br/>applied to drive a great nation like China.  There are many things that we can pick up from Fujian 
<br/>Province to grow and develop our small nation. Fujian Province is a key province in the development 
<br/></span><span>of one of our projects in the West on mushrooms.  We acknowledge that, Your Excellency, for the 
<br/></span><span>great  work that your team did here, and Zhejiang Province too on his visit to the great  capital of 
<br/>Beijing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the key lesson that we can draw from after the visit by the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>that we hope to apply when our National Development Plan is going to be released is how a nation 
<br/>like China, through its revitalisation programmes, its ability to turn things around from the resources 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that  it  has;  a  people-focused,  people-driven  and  above  all,  a  very  clear  strategic  vision  in  what  a 
<br/>nation wants to achieve in the years ahead of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am excited of the great lessons that the honourable Prime Minister has picked, learnt and 
<br/>explored from China, and I look forward to some of these ideas that could be put into place in our 
<br/>attempt to drive our nation forward, especially in the implementation of our National Development 
<br/>Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, we support your report this morning and on that note, you have 
<br/>the assurance of the G-9 Bloc support to your initiative and measures to drive and move Fiji forward 
<br/>for a better future for our Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn the House for morning tea. 
<br/>When we return, we will offer the floor to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for

<div><span>Implementation of Commitments Under the IEPA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, </span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau</span><span>, the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, and to those of you who may be listening to 
<br/>this broadcast; </span><span>ni sa yadra</span><span> </span><span>vinaka </span><span>and good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to inform this august House of the implementation of the commitments 
<br/>under the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) and assure you, Sir, that your Coalition 
<br/>Government is acutely attuned to our beloved country’s trading and market access needs. In this case, 
<br/>we are securing our market access into the European Union.  This was the reason we recently sought 
<br/>Cabinet  endorsement  for  the  implementation  of  the  Market  Access  Commitment  under  the  IEPA 
<br/>between the European Union (EU) and the Pacific States.  This decision, Sir, reflects Fiji’s ongoing 
<br/>commitment to strengthening trade relations with the EU and safeguarding the interests of our key 
<br/>export sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, IEPA has a long history, and the previous government will remember this 
<br/>well.  The EU has historically provided unilateral trade preferences to the African, Caribbean and 
<br/>Pacific (ACP) Group of States under the Lome Convention since 1975.  Due to the pressure from the 
<br/>World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO)  to  bring  in  WTO  rules  consistent  to  the  preferences  that  were 
<br/>provided by the EU to the ACP, these were replaced by the Cotonou Agreement with the objective 
<br/>of  aligning  EU’s  trade  agreements  with  WTO  rules.  Thus,  the  concept  of  Economic  Partnership 
<br/>Agreements (EPAs) were born. Each of the ACP regions began negotiating EPAs from the year 2000. 
<br/>Formal negotiations between the Pacific and the EU began in 2004.  The WTO deadline for the EU 
<br/>and  the  ACP  was  eight  years  to  conclude  the  WTO  compatible  EPA  by  2008.  None  of  the  ACP 
<br/>regions were able to meet this deadline, including the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that preferences were coming to an end in 2008, those ACP countries with significant 
<br/>export trade to the EU had the option of initiating an interim EPA to maintain their trade preferences.  
<br/>Sir, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Fiji chose to take this route in November 2007 to protect sugar 
<br/>and fish exports respectively. The initial IEPA still had outstanding and contentious issues, which 
<br/>was the reason the comprehensive EPA negotiations with the Pacific continued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  signed  the  IEPA  in  2009  and  with  comprehensive  EPA  negotiations  stalled  due  to 
<br/>differences in the position on issues of fisheries management in the Pacific, Fiji applied the IEPA in 
<br/>July 2014.  This was done to ensure that Fiji could continue to export its products, particularly sugar, 
<br/>to the EU. The decision to provisionally apply was also made due to the EU’s decision to withdraw 
<br/>preferences for those ACP countries that had not signed nor ratified the IEPA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  Fiji  had  provisionally  applied  the  IEPA  in  2014,  Fiji  had  not  implemented  the 
<br/>provisions  of  IEPA,  including  the  reducing  and  eliminating  of  duties  as  per  Fiji’s  market  access 
<br/>commitments.  The IEPA allows us to send our products to the EU without paying duties or tariffs.  
<br/>In return, Fiji has to make similar commitments or what is generally known, Sir, as “Reciprocity in 
<br/></span><span>Trade”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of an essential pillar of IEPA, Fiji agreed to allow certain products from the EU to be 
<br/>imported into Fiji duty free. Key items, however, were excluded from this commitment to protect 
<br/>Fiji’s  revenue  and  developing  industries  or  what  is  known  as  the  “Exclusion  Basket”.    Since  its 
<br/>signing,  Fiji  has  benefitted  from  this  arrangement  particularly  in  the  sugar  sector  where  the  EU 
<br/>member countries collectively accounted for a maximum of up to 90 percent of our total sugar  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>1678 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite challenges, such competition and fluctuations in the global sugar prices, the EU has 
<br/>been a consistent and reliable destination for our exports, contributing significantly to our foreign 
<br/>exchange earnings and providing employment opportunities for our people. The IEPA has opened up 
<br/>opportunities to export goods such as tuna, ginger, mineral water and garments with exports to the 
<br/>EU reaching a peak of $132.4 million in 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  we  do  not  reciprocate,  there  is  a  danger  that  preferential  or  duty  free 
<br/>access into the EU for Fiji goods under IEPA may be stopped, threatening the present volume of 
<br/>exports.  Thus, implementing our market access commitments under IEPA is crucial. This means, 
<br/>Fiji needs to open its markets to goods from the EU under the terms of IEPA.  This involves removing 
<br/>tariffs and taxes on imports, on certain products, making it easier for goods from the EU to enter 
<br/>Fiji’s market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  ensure  that  the  tariffs  committed  for  elimination  under  IEPA  are 
<br/>effectively removed, Fiji will take several very important steps. This includes establishing a dedicated 
<br/>team  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  these  tariff  changes,  ensuring  that  they  are  correctly  and 
<br/>efficiently applied. To support this, we will also develop a clear and straightforward set of guidelines 
<br/>that will help customs officials and businesses understand and follow the new rules. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, we will review, and if necessary, update process documents to ensure it aligns 
<br/>with the agreement. We recognise the importance of awareness which is why we will conduct training 
<br/>sessions  and  workshops  for  customs  officers,  trade  officials  and  other  key  stakeholders.    These 
<br/>sessions will equip everyone involved with the knowledge and skills needed to implement the tariff 
<br/>removals effectively.  To keep businesses and the public informed, we will also provide clear and 
<br/>accessible  information  through  our  Ministry’s  website  and  with  direct  engagement  with  business 
<br/>groups. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we move forward, we will continually monitor the process to ensure the tariff 
<br/>eliminations are having the desired positive impact on our economy.  This will allow us to address 
<br/>any challenges that may arise promptly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  we  will  maintain  ongoing  communication  with  the  EU  to  resolve  any  issues  that 
<br/>might come up during the implementation, ensuring that this transition is as smooth and beneficial 
<br/>for Fiji. Through these steps, we are committed to fulfilling our obligations under the IEPA while 
<br/>supporting the growth and development of our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  due  to  astute  negotiations  by  Fiji’s  Trade  Team,  Fiji’s  market  access 
<br/>commitment has been reduced from 80 percent to 75 percent through technical amendments made in 
<br/>the last few years. This translates to removing tariffs on 4,916 individual items for imports originating 
<br/>from the EU.  Currently, fiscal duties on 32 percent of these lines are already at zero due to the More 
<br/>Favourable Nations (MFN) level, meaning that Fiji only needs to liberalise the remaining 43 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementing reduction in import duties on the remaining 43 percent is estimated to result in 
<br/></span><span>a revenue loss of approximately $737,000 per annum. This estimate is based on the average of import 
<br/></span><span>duties  generated  over  the  past  six  years,  specifically  on  the  tariff  lines  Fiji  has  committed  for 
<br/>elimination under the IEPA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  current  benefits  in  trade  far  outweigh  any  revenue  loss  that  may 
<br/>eventuate  from  the  elimination  of  tariffs  on  EU  goods.    We  presently  export  items  such  as  tuna, 
<br/>ginger, mineral water, garments and kava to the tune of $132 million as mentioned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, after our decision to implement IEPA, the global sourcing provisions for canned 
<br/>and processed tuna or fish will be activated by the EU as part of their commitment.  These flexible 
<br/>rules of the IEPA will allow Fiji to source fish from approved foreign flagged vessels outside of the 
<br/>EEZ, process it onshore, and export duty free into the lucrative market of the EU as Fiji fish.  Fiji 
<br/>will then enjoy similar success that PNG has experienced by using this global sourcing provisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership remains vital for Fiji’s economic growth and development. 
<br/>It aligns with our broader trade and development objectives, particularly in terms of diversifying our 
<br/>export base and reducing our reliance on a limited number of trading partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation of IEPA market access commitment marks a significant step forward in 
<br/>strengthening Fiji’s trade relations with the EU.  By implementing these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji not 
<br/>only  safeguards  its  existing  markets  access,  but  also  opens  up  new  opportunities  for  growth, 
<br/>particularly  in  the  fisheries  sector  through  the  global  sourcing  provision.    The  Ministry  remains 
<br/>committed to engaging with the EU to ensure that we continue to benefit from this very important 
<br/>partnership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Opposition, or his designate, for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and 
<br/>fellow Members of Parliament, I want to thank the honourable Minister for his regular updates on 
<br/>these very important Agreements that we are part and parcel of and continue on with the negotiations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as rightfully pointed out by the honourable Minister, the notification of the 
<br/>provisional application of Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) took place in 2014 and 
<br/>this was, as you have rightfully pointed out, in order to protect our trade in goods and services and 
<br/>our quota and access exposed to the European Union (EU) and was really done to avoid disruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are cumbersome processes that are involved in getting all these done 
<br/>which is a barrier to our trade with the EU, especially with respect to rules of origin, et cetera, and 
<br/>this is one of the reasons why it has taken many, many years to actually complete, and in order to 
<br/>also be in compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements, et cetera, these things 
<br/>take a long time to complete.  It is a good thing to see that these things are being done and the market 
<br/>access commitments have actually been approved by Cabinet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tariff liberalisation will only help Fiji but, again, there is a word of caution 
<br/>on it  - we must be ensuring  also  that we do not  interfere in  our policy space,  et  cetera, with  this 
<br/>particular Agreement. I think there is a great team that is actually involved in getting all these done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The global sourcing issue that has been raised with respect to fish will also mean that more 
<br/>of our fish are able to enter into the EU, especially with fish that have been sourced from different 
<br/>foreign-operated vessels.  But we must also be mindful of the compliance that we have to reach with 
<br/>respect to the EU market standards, Mr. Speaker, Sir. These are the things that are important to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Much debate has been held over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the IEPA and this 
<br/></span><span>is something that concerns a lot of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.  Now, ACP 
<br/></span><span>countries initially are very reluctant to get to the end of this EPA purely because they were considered 
<br/>to have too many bottlenecks, et cetera, and development also is centred at this particular Agreement 
<br/>with respect to most ACP countries.  Also, with biosecurity regulations, we need to be updated and 
<br/>strengthened because it hugely has an important aspect of our trade with the EU.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the aspects also that comes out of this particular Agreement is promotion of agriculture 
<br/>development  and  trading  services,  tourism  development,  et  cetera,  investment  protection  and 
<br/>promotion and goods and fisheries. These are hugely important parts of this Agreement, so there is a 
<br/>steady progress that has been made on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  also  had  a  very  devastating  kava  ban  and  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned this, that has been lifted in Germany and should be very good for Fiji and our kava exports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  market  access  on  trade  and  in  goods,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  EU  has  always 
<br/>interpreted WTO requirements regarding the degree of liberalisation with these EPAs and the regions 
<br/>to liberalise.  They are also coming back and saying that we need to liberalise about 80 percent of 
<br/>our trade with the EU.  It actually said that it was supposed to be done within 15 odd years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given that they are giving us duty free and quota free market access, this is 
<br/>something that is really important that needs to be done quickly and I would like to congratulate the 
<br/>honourable Minister and the Ministry of Trade Team, in trying to get all of these done because it is 
<br/>very important for our goods and services. It opens up the massive market for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, as I have said earlier, there are certain things that we need to strengthen, but a word 
<br/>of caution - it is something that we are, as a developing country, realise also a little bit along the way, 
<br/>that many of the ACP countries that had signed it were regretting it afterwards because it interfered 
<br/>with that particular space.  It is  a very delicate Agreement, but  I am glad it is moving along  at  a 
<br/>particular pace where we are actually being protective of our own policy space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it can only be good for Fiji, but we must learn from the examples that are 
<br/>being shown to us, especially by the Caribbean countries that have gone a little bit further than we 
<br/>have, as well as the African countries.  So, the ACP is a good vessel for us to learn from and I wish 
<br/>the honourable Minister well in the further negotiations that needs to be completed.  Thank you very 
<br/>much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the outset, the G-9 Bloc sincerely appreciates 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications for his comprehensive update on the implementation of the Market 
<br/>Access  Commitment  under  the  Economic  Partnership  Agreement  (EPA)  between  the  European 
<br/>Union  (EU)  and  the  Pacific  Island  States.  Notably,  his  extensive  work  in  securing  Cabinet’s 
<br/>endorsement for this implementation is also much appreciated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  partnership  with  the  EU,  which  is  one  of  the  greatest  GDP  globally,  is  an  important 
<br/>strategic  move  for  Fiji  and  all  Pacific  Island  States.  This  agreement  promises  an  opportunity  for 
<br/>diversified  trade  and  potential  economic  growth.    The  implementation  of  Market  Access 
<br/>Commitment could specifically lead to increase accessibility to numerous markets as alluded to by 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  our  MSME’s  possibly  facilitating  cooperation  and 
<br/>economic prosperity for all parties involved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to request further clarification on these specific 
<br/>measures and consistent updates for all stakeholders to be taken by the Ministry to ensure that this 
<br/>commitment will indeed bring adequate and tangible benefits for our domestic industries, ensuring 
<br/>that Fiji and Pacific Island States businesses, especially the MSME’s can effectively leverage this 
<br/>agreement which is crucial to realising the targeted economic benefits.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1681 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we trust that the Ministry is also taking into account the potential 
<br/>challenges  that  are  posed  by  such  agreements  with  binding  commitments  on  environmental 
<br/>protection, climate change and labour rights.  It is well known that such economic agreements which 
<br/>poses potential benefits, they often require significant adaptation to the local industries. It would be 
<br/>helpful to understand more about this support and the transitional aid that is to be provided to Fiji 
<br/>and the Pacific Island States in navigating this process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  it  would  also  be  beneficial  for  us  to  understand  the  environmental  implications  to 
<br/>increase  trade  activities  that  could  emanate  from  this  agreement.    Thank  you  once  again  to  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his relented efforts in driving our economic growth and his 
<br/>adaptation to maintaining open communication about this development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this side of the House that I represent, we look forward to engaging further on this critical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subject and I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coastal Fisheries Development Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers</span><span>,  </span><span>honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers</span><span>,  </span><span>the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni 
<br/>sa yadra vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  deliver  a  statement  on  the  Coastal  Fisheries Development 
<br/>Programme implemented by the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry through our servicing centres in 
<br/>the Central, Eastern, Northern and Western Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.    Speaker,  coastal  fisheries  resources  are  fish,  invertebrates and  plants,  including 
<br/>associated  habitats,  which  occur  within  customary fishing  rights  areas.  These  fisheries  resources 
<br/>poverty 
<br/>economic 
<br/>provide 
<br/>alleviation, community resilience, and the empowerment of licensed fishers and communities.  These 
<br/>resources and associated habitats are under stress due to threats of high fishing pressure, increased 
<br/>coastal development, sedimentation loading and pollution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and nutrition, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>employment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>security 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>growth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>food 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  estimated  annual  production  of  coastal commercial  and  subsistence 
<br/>fisheries is about 30,700 tonnes annually. This estimation is challenged by the hundreds of landing 
<br/>sites and the 850 coastal communities that depend on these resources for food and income.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coastal  Fisheries  Development  Project's  primary focus  is  to  address 
<br/>these threats with clear goals and objectives - addressing overfishing in coral reef areas, supporting 
<br/>food security for our coastal and maritime communities, sustainably maximizing economic returns 
<br/>for our licensed fishers, and enhancing coastal fisheries management and conservation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last year, the Ministry issued 2,816 inshore and 27 deepwater snapper fishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>licences to support livelihoods and contribute to economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising  the  need  for  Fijians  to  access  nutritious  food  and  safe  protein sources  and 
<br/></span><span>support livelihoods, the Ministry provides accessibility to ice services from the 24 Fisheries Service 
<br/>Centres across the country, with training delivered to licensed fishers and fishing cooperatives on the 
<br/>post-harvest and the use of ice to preserve the seafood quality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  30  fishing  cooperatives  have  been  registered,  and appropriate  training  and 
<br/>equipment  have  been  provided  for  the  start-up. The  primary  purpose  is  to  create  investment  and

<div><span>financial stability for fishers, maximise their economic return from fishing, and give them access to 
<br/>any assistance provided through government or financial agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.    Speaker,  the  Ministry  deployed  13  Fish Aggregating  Devices  (FAD)  to  address 
<br/>overfishing  in  coral  reef  areas, relieve  fishing  pressure  on  the  principal  reef  fish,  and  promote 
<br/>pelagic fishing to support local demand for pelagic fish.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  four  community  projects  were  established  in the  Western  Division  for 
<br/>sandfish  ranching  and  mangrove  crab  fattening  to support  the  growing  market  demand  for  these 
<br/>coastal commodities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On focussed activities for 2024 to 2025, Mr. Speaker, in this fiscal year, the Ministry will 
<br/>continue to support coastal fisheries and scale up existing projects and activities to improve outcomes 
<br/>and effectiveness. The Coastal Fisheries Development Project has five main work programmes that 
<br/>include the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)   Pathway  to  market  initiative  that  provides  essential  support  for licensed  fishers  to 
<br/>access better markets, including the improvement of processes along the value chains. 
<br/>(2)   Exploring the pelagic and deep-water snapper fisheries will relieve fishing pressure on 
<br/>coral  reef  areas  and  maximise  economic  returns for  licensed  fishers  and  fishing 
<br/>cooperatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)   Scaling up the locally managed marine areas through species management, ranching, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the grow-out of cultured high-value coastal species such as sandfish.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)  Minimise  illegal,  unreported,  unregulated  fishing  in  Fiji's  coastal waters  through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monitoring, compliance and surveillance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)   Training and awareness are needed to improve coastal fisheries resource value chain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the management of coastal fisheries resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  project  underscores  the  need  to  put  less pressure  on  the  coral  reef  area, 
<br/>particularly on fishing key coral reef fish, such as parrotfish, which has an important ecological role 
<br/>on  the coral  reefs.    The  focus  is  on  exploring  pelagic  and  deep-water  snapper fishing  to  increase 
<br/>economic returns and create more opportunities for fishermen and fishing cooperatives. Equipping 
<br/>them with proper boats and fishing equipment and deploying FAD links them to registered fishing 
<br/>cooperatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coastal  Fisheries  Development  Project  also  addresses  the needs  of 
<br/>communities  living  in  the  highlands  who  depend  on  rivers  and streams  for  food  and  income.  It 
<br/>focusses on improving the value chain of the eel fishery in the highlands, which has an existing niche 
<br/>market in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry is also encouraging Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to develop 
<br/>high-value  coastal  species  for  sustainability and  to  meet  market  demand.  Most  of  our  high-value 
<br/>coastal  species  are heavily  fished  and  must  be  developed  and  improved  to  create  income 
<br/>and opportunities for our communities and contribute to export earnings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Coastal Fisheries Development Project will undertake fish collection trips 
<br/></span><span>in  the  maritime  islands  because  accessing  the  primary  market  in  urban  areas  is  difficult.  Fish 
<br/>collection trips will be conducted in Lau, Kadavu, Lomaiviti and the Northern Division, as well as 
<br/>the Western Division, to connect the fishers to the primary market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry will continue to undertake more awareness and focus training in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities and engage in exhibitions to educate and increase awareness of the importance of

<div><span>marine and fisheries resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  continue  to  increase  monitoring,  compliance  and 
<br/>surveillance in our coastal areas regarding illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and ensure that 
<br/>users comply with all fisheries laws and regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  much  work  is  needed  in  the  coastal  area  to  ensure the  management  and 
<br/>development  of  coastal  fisheries  resources  meet the  daily  needs  of  Fijians.  Still,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Fisheries is determined to deliver on what is expected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  will  ensure  that  proper fundamentals  are  set  to  support  these 
<br/>projects, ensuring their longevity and effectiveness in relieving pressure on our depleted fish stocks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last but not least, before I take my seat, I would like to acknowledge and thank 
<br/>the Queen Victoria School U18 Team for successfully defending the Deans Trophy.  I would like to 
<br/>thank  all  the  schools  and  their  teams  for  participating  in  the  2024  Fiji  Secondary  School  Rugby 
<br/>Season. </span><span>Vinaka Saka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Minister.  You jumped from fisheries to rugby, so that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interesting fishing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Fisheries in her brief to Parliament this morning on a very important subject in regards to coastal 
<br/>fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think the main issue and I thank the honourable Minister for bringing up this 
<br/>subject  because  most  of  our  costal  and  island  communities  greatly  depend  on  the  income  that  is 
<br/>generated by this initiative. She has clearly articulated the various positive moves that have been 
<br/>carried out in helping these coastal communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if we think and consider the plights of our coastal communities – think of  Yadua 
<br/>Island off the coast of Bua, Cikobia to the Northern Point of Udu Point, Wailagilala Island - a coastal 
<br/>community, a small island that consists of a few members who have migrated to Taveuni and have 
<br/>considered that now as their home because the resources have depleted and they could not afford to 
<br/>stay on the island anymore.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Yanuca between Rabi and Taveuni, and then you look at Ono-i-Lau, the 
<br/>most south-eastern portion which also includes Vatoa, there is nothing. If you look at agriculture, 
<br/>they do not even have land to cultivate. If you look at forestry, nothing grows on rocks, it is basically 
<br/>bushes, and if there are any birds that might fly around these islands and drop a few sandalwood 
<br/>seeds among the rocks, they will be able to cultivate sandalwood.  Why I am saying this, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>it is important to emphasise the situation that these isolated communities are being put in, not by 
<br/>force, but basically, this is the place they were born and brought up when they come to populate Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My plea to Government is to provide the resources and assistance to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Fisheries to be able to help these isolated communities. They have nothing else. The sea is their 
<br/>main  source  of  revenue.  We  need  to  give  them  assistance  so  that  they  can  do  better.  I  think  the 
<br/>honourable Minister has stated that the preservation of sea resources will enable them to trade these 
<br/>resources. The source to market also depends on shipping that connects these very isolated islands 
<br/>and communities which will enable them to generate revenue from these resources. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  had  created  some  semblance  of  trying  to  generate  interest  in  the  bartering  system  and 
<br/>especially in Lau and the outer islands in Vanua Levu. They trade with their relatives who live in 
<br/>cities and towns their resources, and their relatives buy things that they need which is loaded on to 
<br/>the ship. This benefits their daily living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I plead to Government to look at this very seriously because if not, 
<br/>these small communities as I have stated, like Naqelelevu, they will leave their islands and move to 
<br/>towns because they need to live and look after their children and their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Koroilavesau,  for  that  very  thought-provoking 
<br/>statement that you have just made.  There is  a Fijian tradition known as  </span><span>veisa</span><span>, where we prepare 
<br/>something of equal value to reciprocate when the other people from the mainland come to us.  It is 
<br/>an organised visit, so that is how we trade – we barter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking  at  the  Lau  Seascape,  the  very  mentioning  of  the  islands  that  you  have  stated, 
<br/>honourable Koroilavesau, is something that leaves a question mark too for us who have open waters.  
<br/>Before we still have our </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> out there in Wailagilala and the ones off Udu Point, but it is amazing 
<br/>that  in  the  Lau  Seascape,  they  have  organised  themselves  with  the  support  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Fisheries, and they have allowed them to exist.  That is the Yagasa Reef, belonging to the Turaga na 
<br/>Tui Nayau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am hoping if something could be organised along those lines, as you have suggested, through 
<br/>the Minister for iTaukei Affairs and the Ministry of Fisheries to, sort of, revitalise the usage of all 
<br/>the </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> there, as a way of ensuring that they get that steady supply of  meat, or whatever, to be 
<br/>able to exchange or, sort of, barter, to keep things going economically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all I want to add to your statement, Sir, and I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now offer the floor to the leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement 
<br/>and I fully support the sentiments expressed by honourable Koroilavesau on the issue about coastal 
<br/>fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just mention one upfront, it is said here that it is the Coastal Fisheries 
<br/>Development Project. I hope that if it is still a project, that it will be run as a programme because the 
<br/>funding for it is much better.  When you run a project, at the end of the financial year, workers will 
<br/>have  to  go  home,  and  they  wait  again  for  the  new  financial  year  to  come  back.    But  if  it  is  a 
<br/>programme, they will stay and it provides them stability in their work and they will do their best 
<br/>because  for  Coastal  Fisheries  Development,  management  will  be  an  ongoing  thing.    We  are  a 
<br/>maritime nation, we are a group of 300 islands, and it will be an ongoing work, and I suggest that if 
<br/>it is still run as a project that Government can, perhaps, look at it so that it be run as a programme 
<br/>and be funded as a programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we compare our coastal fisheries to the other fisheries that we have, which is the offshore 
<br/></span><span>fisheries,  I think we can agree that it is our offshore fisheries that is  managed better.  I think the 
<br/></span><span>reason behind the better management of our offshore fisheries is because of the links that we have 
<br/>regionally, through the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), internationally through the 
<br/>Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).  Because of those organisations, there 
<br/>is good data that they get out of our offshore fisheries, and it is through the management of those 
<br/>fisheries, it is done very well because of the data that they get. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1685 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem with our coastal fisheries, I think, is data.  There is very little data that we have 
<br/>on the variety of resources that we have – fish, invertebrate, as the Minister mentioned, plants, and it 
<br/>is that lack of data that all of a sudden, we say, “Let us stop beche-de-mer. It is now over-fished.”  
<br/>So, because we cannot track and manage those resources well because of the lack of data, maybe that 
<br/>is an area that we need to look at and really, in trying to find development partners who can come in 
<br/>and assist  us  and provide us with  good data on the various resources  that we have in  our coastal 
<br/>fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we look at coastal fisheries, inshore fisheries versus our offshore fisheries, I stand corrected, 
<br/>but I think it is our inshore fisheries that contributes more to our GDP than our offshore fisheries.  
<br/>Even though we have a lot more export from our offshore fisheries, but it is our coastal fisheries that 
<br/>provides more to our GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  remember when  I was  the Permanent  Secretary for Fisheries and  Forests, we did  a very 
<br/>quick  calculation  and  study  on  how  much  money  spins  locally  just  from  coastal  fisheries  and  it 
<br/>amounted between $30 million to $60 million in a year.  That is the amount of money that circulates 
<br/>locally in our local economy because of our inshore fisheries from the commodities that we sell, the 
<br/>fuel that we buy for boats, so there is a lot that our coastal fisheries does to keep our economy alive 
<br/>by circulating that money locally in our local economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is always this balance between development and management and conservation, and I 
<br/>think that work - that balance in development and management and conservation is done well if we 
<br/>have data.  I think that is an area that we need to, perhaps, invest in, and get good data for our coastal 
<br/>fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  her  Statement,  and  I  certainly  support  the  sentiments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expressed by honourable Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will proceed to the next item.
