<div><span>The above do not include the allowance disbursed directly to students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Students who were awarded scholarships and study loans in 2023 and 2024 are still in their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>active bond term as they are first and second-year students respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2014 to-date there are 21,685 students who have either absconded, are inactive or are 
<br/>yet  to  graduate  and  their  bond  term  has  expired  and  equates  to  around  $160  million  of 
<br/>investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Breakdown  by  institution  cannot  be  released  as  it  will  cause  reputational  damage  to  the 
<br/>Tertiary Education Institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trend recorded is that students who had very low marks and were provided with a study loan 
<br/>to do degree programmes prior to 2021, attracted high attrition rates from technical colleges, 
<br/>adding to the high non-completion of programmes of study.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>TSLS has various strategies in place to address the issue of non-completion.  TSLS provides: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span> </span><span>Learning Enrichment Services to all our sponsored students to assist in their academic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pursuit to improve retention and completion rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>Students with scaffolding support to enrich their learning journeys.   
<br/>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>Weekly Learning Enrichment Sessions.  These sessions are provided to students at 
<br/>flexible hours which includes essential topics such as time management, preparing for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>v. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exams,  managing  the  coursework,  allowance  management  and  the  importance  of 
<br/>mental health amongst others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iv)</span><span> </span><span>An At-Risk Student Intervention strategy, that has been put in place through the recent 
<br/>amendment to TSLS Act during the 2024-2025 budget.  As per amendment to TSLS 
<br/>Act, it is mandatory for Tertiary Education Institutions to provide reports on “at-risk” 
<br/>students.  This is to ensure that Tertiary Education Institutions have learning support 
<br/>and  remedial  programmes  to  improve  retention  and  completion  rates.    Tertiary 
<br/>Education  Institutions  are  required  to  identify  and  provide  reports  to  TSLS  on  all 
<br/>students who are at-risk of failing their courses by mid-term.  TSLS has strengthened 
<br/>its policies by implementing intervention strategies for students who are at-risk failing 
<br/>and necessary assistance is provided to the students to avoid the risk of failure as a 
<br/>proactive measure.  This is the initiative of the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(v)</span><span> </span><span>Confidential  Personal  Counselling.    TSLS  provides  a  safe  space  and  conducive 
<br/>environment  for  all  students  who  may  be  in  need  of  confidential  one-to-one 
<br/>counselling.  Students who are facing any issues that is affecting them academically 
<br/>can reach out to TSLS and the necessary counselling services are available to assist 
<br/>them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(vi)</span><span> </span><span>On Campus Visits to meet students and create awareness of the support available to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(vii)</span><span> </span><span>Online Flexible Interactive Sessions where students can join in and talk about issues 
<br/>that  may  be  affecting  them,  and  at  the  same  time  begin  conversations  on  the  best 
<br/>solutions  to  face  the  challenges  ahead.    Students  can  join  these  sessions  from  the 
<br/>comfort  of  their  homes,  or  schools  as  online  sessions  are  a  lot  more  convenient.  
<br/>Session times are early mornings while they commute to school, or in the afternoons 
<br/>and evenings when the students are done with their classes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(viii)</span><span> </span><span>Work Skill Development and Industry Mentoring to sponsored students where TSLS 
<br/>connects students to professionals from the industries such as Accounting, Engineering 
<br/>and Teacher Education.  This allows students to hear from the industry professionals 
<br/>on what to expect from the profession they have chosen post-graduation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ix)</span><span> </span><span>Support Sessions for Suspended Students to maintain effective communication with 
<br/>all suspended students throughout the term of their suspension, providing guidance and 
<br/>ways on how best to improve academically and get supported on how to re-enter the 
<br/>Tertiary Education Institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(x)</span><span> </span><span>Learning Enrichment for Overseas Students who are studying abroad. 
<br/>(xi)</span><span> </span><span>Post-Graduation Care and Employer Connect Services.  Through this, TSLS provides 
<br/>assistance and guidance to its sponsored students post-graduation.  The TSLS Post-
<br/>Graduation  care  services  equip  graduates  on  the  basics  while  searching  for 
<br/>employment such as resume writing and preparing for interviews.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(xii)</span><span> </span><span>Employer Connect Portal (ECP).  This is an in-house developed portal that connects 
<br/>new graduates with potential employers.  Employers can sign up for the portal and post 
<br/>their  vacancies,  and  the  same  will  be  visible  to  all  graduates  that  have  signed  up.  
<br/>Graduates  can  upload  their  resumes  and  interest  towards  positions  and  employers 
<br/>carryout shortlisting on the same portal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government will work with TSLS on further strengthening the policies to 
<br/>ensure  high  completion  rate  and  ensure  transparent  and  accountable  management  of 
<br/></span><span>government funding and there is maximum return from taxpayer investment in higher 
<br/></span><span>education.
