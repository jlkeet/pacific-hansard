<div><span>Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  please,  kindly  take  note  that  I  have  received  legal  advice  that  by 
<br/>operation of Section 11(1) of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act  2014, the new Determination 
<br/>made by Parliament on 24</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, which was published in the Gazette on 30</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, had 
<br/>superseded  the  2020  Determination.  As  a  result,  the  2020  Determination  had  been  effectively 
<br/>revoked,  and  the  2024  Determination  has  established  that  the  current  salaries  is  at  100  percent 
<br/>effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024. You are now on 100 percent.  You all seem to be looking at the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics.
