<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE - REVIEW REPORT ON THENADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE - REVIEW REPORT ON THE  
<br/>NADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute on the motion before the House.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would like to commend the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for a detailed report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noted from the Report that the Committee has come up with key findings and some 
<br/>very good recommendations. I fully support the recommendation of the Committee that Nadi Town 
<br/>Council should identify a suitable dumpsite for the ratepayers of Nadi which will save cost in terms 
<br/>of transportation to Lautoka.  Currently, rubbish is transported all the way to Vunato, Lautoka which 
<br/>is very costly; hundreds of tonnes of rubbish are taken to Lautoka from Nadi which means extra cost 
<br/>to  ratepayers.    I  urge  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  the  newly  appointed  Special 
<br/>Administrators to put their thoughts together and address the issue at the earliest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other important area which cannot be overlooked is a recreational area.  
<br/>Recreational area plays a very important role in enhancing the quality of life in an urban environment 
<br/>by providing residents and visitors with spaces for outdoor activities and relaxation. There is need 
<br/>for more recreational areas for the people of Nadi and visitors to Nadi, including the tourists. There 
<br/>are only a few recreational areas in Nadi which was done some years ago and that needs upgrading.  
<br/>The Special Administrators and CEO should come up with innovative ideas and share ideas with the 
<br/>Council and the Ministry of Local Government, upgrade and also come up with more recreational 
<br/>areas in Nadi for the people of Nadi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another finding of the Committee is outstanding rates. All efforts should be 
<br/></span><span>made  by  the  Council  to  collect  the  outstanding  rates.  The  Councils  should  come  up  with  better 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024               Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1951 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategies  so  that  a  huge  number  of  outstanding  rates  can  be  collected  and  utilised  for  important 
<br/>developments and maintenance work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many important places in Nadi which needs maintenance. I will 
<br/>talk on only one, I have identified one important place which needs maintenance and upgrading and 
<br/>that is Nadi Bus Stand.  During my recent visit to Nadi, in fact, when I was coming to Suva yesterday, 
<br/>I went to the Nadi Bus Stand.  The reason why I went to the Nadi Bus Stand because some concerned 
<br/>citizens of Nadi raised concern regarding the state of the bus stand.  I saw that the Nadi Bus Stand is 
<br/>in a very bad condition. The bus stand is outdated and rusty, ceiling and boards are falling apart. I 
<br/>took photos and will send them to the honourable Minister, benches at the bus stand needs repairing. 
<br/>It is a health hazard; we are putting our students and people at risk.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment, 
<br/>Productivity and Workplace Relations and the honourable Minister for Local Government to look 
<br/>into this without any delay. We do not want to see people getting injured or losing their lives from 
<br/>the hazard, which I have just highlighted. I am sure the Nadi Town Council Special Administrators 
<br/></span><span>and CEO are fully aware of the very bad condition of the Nadi Bus Stand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know what is stopping the Council from carrying out maintenance work. Is it finance? 
<br/>Priority should be given to this important area and maintenance should be carried out without any 
<br/>delay.  Nadi  Bus  Stand  is  used  by  thousands  of  people  daily,  which  also  includes  thousands  of 
<br/>students, visitors and tourists.  At the moment, it is an eyesore.  Nadi Town Council is known for 
<br/>actively contributing to the tourism sector in Fiji, but this poor condition of the bus stand reflects 
<br/>badly on Nadi Town Council and also on the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you have an area in mind for this dumpsite in Nadi?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I went to the bus stand yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I have taken 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some photos which I will be sending.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Dumpsite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Dumpsite, no, I have not. I will leave it to the Administrators and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Local Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion. I do so as a resident 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Nadi for eight years, having lived in Waqadra, Bountiful and, of course, CAAF Compound.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues that I wish to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need for acknowledging the 
<br/>landowners.  There must be close collaboration with the landowners in terms of policy discussions.  
<br/>It has happened in the past when there are new policies and when there was a meeting held at the 
<br/>town hall, it is the other ratepayers that attend.  As for the </span><span>iTaukei, </span><span>they do not go and attend these 
<br/>kind of forums.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is important is the </span><span>veitalanoa</span><span>.  Council should go and visit the villagers.  We have the 
<br/></span><span>Gone  Turaga  na  Tui  Nadi,  Momo  na  Tui  Nadi,  Marama  na  Tui  Saunaka,  </span><span>and  likewise  the  </span><span>Tui 
<br/>Nawaka.  </span><span>Three chiefs and, of course, for the Namaka Area, </span><span>na Momo na Tui Sabeto.  </span><span>There must be 
<br/>acknowledgement and collaboration between the Councils and the </span><span>Vanua.</span><span>  It is very important.  We 
<br/></span><span>can all go - </span><span>talanoa tiko </span><span>wherever we go, but it should start from home, and this is something that we 
<br/></span><span>have lacked over the years. I hope that under the Coalition Government, with the reform being done, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>1952 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we  see  a  major  improvement  in  terms  of  closer  collaboration  between  the  </span><span>Vanua  </span><span>and  the  Local 
<br/>Governments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second issue which I acknowledge and has been made by the honourable Minister and 
<br/>also by honourable Koya, is the lack of landfill.  It is a pity that we are in this state, but the issue has 
<br/>been  recognised.    The  former  Minister  sitting  there,  but  it  has  been  recognised.    I  am  sure,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, if you approach the landowners, there are potential sites where this can be done.  It is 
<br/>just a matter of sitting down to address this issue because Nadi, being a premier town closer to the 
<br/>Airport, it must have an incinerator on its own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You need to open your mind and open your eyes as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) Project, I 
<br/>understand that the Japanese Government has funded the 3Rs Project, in partnership with Nadi and 
<br/>Lautoka Town Councils, to reduce waste.  There was a team that went to Japan, until now, we are 
<br/>yet to see what has been implemented.  They need to pick on these issues, and I guess one of the 
<br/></span><span>problems is the constant change of the management.  It is noted in the Town Council.  So, the question 
<br/></span><span>goes back, who appoints them?  Why sack them? Why do people have to retire?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a tendency of appointing people and sacking them.  Obviously, there is no forward 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plan for that, and that is one of the problems that we saw at the Nadi Town Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Nadi  River  Diversion  Project,  this  is  a  constant  issue  that  I  had  actually  faced.    I 
<br/>experienced three major floods in Nadi, Waqadra Area, Vesi Street.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the 
<br/>houses were actually up to the roof level.  We urge the Town Council and all authorities to address 
<br/>this issue. Also, on the issue of how can they be assisted financially?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  some  cases,  all  household  belongings  were  damaged  and  some  of  them  just  within the 
<br/>poverty line.  There should be a policy to assist these people.  I speak on behalf of the people who 
<br/>live in Nadi, in Waqadra and the downtown area, most of them are just struggling to live, so this is 
<br/>an important issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Do you not know the work of the Local Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  On  the  issue  of  drainage  which  the  previous  Government  did  not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>address it in the last 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue is the need for cemetery.  Enamanu Cemetery is an eyesore.  
<br/>Sometimes, it is opened three or four times.  You can even spot who owns these graves. So, the Town 
<br/>Council needs to look for new sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go overseas to Australia or New Zealand, they have high respect for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those who have gone before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024               Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1953 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- But this has not changed in the last 16 years.  Under the leadership 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of honourable Nalumisa, this will be done, I can assure you that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Sixteen years, you cannot compare that to two years, not even two 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years.  Poor execution!  That is what I call. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  been  great  work  on  the  review  of  the  Local 
<br/>Government  Act  and,  again,  I  encourage  a  close  collaboration  with  the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>.    Sometimes,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it is only the people who are the people whose voices are heard.  What about those who 
<br/>cannot be heard?  This is the reality in Fiji.  </span><span>O koya ga e domo levu, e levu na nona i lavo, e rogo.  
<br/>Ia, o ira na ka lalai, e sega soti.  Ena sega ni rawa ni vaka tiko ‘qo na veivakatoroicaketaki e Viti.  
<br/>Meda rokovi ira tiko o ira na i taukei ni qele, meda rogoci ira talega na cava era sotava. </span><span> We must 
<br/>listen to them.  This Government will listen to them.  We promise, we deliver, and that is the change 
<br/>between this Government and the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an issue that is noted and it is across the board, the poor collection of rates.  
<br/></span><span>It has been addressed, and the Government will strive to work with the new Council.  We have an 
<br/></span><span>upcoming election so people can take ownership of their town, they pay their rates on time, so there 
<br/>will be lots of money for infrastructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  God is watching, my friend! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one thing that touches me when I go to Namaka is 
<br/>the pirate taxis.  Why does it thrive these days?  Because those who have taxi metres do not operate 
<br/>after 6.00 p.m.  So, the question is something that the Council has to deal with.  How can this be 
<br/>tailor-made?  How can we address this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of people actually make a living out of this.  I know it is unlawful, but then the question 
<br/>again is, what about those who are licensed to operate at a certain time, but they choose and pick and 
<br/>at what time?  This is an issue that the Nadi Town Council has to address.  It cannot ignore that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- LTA matter, you should know that!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  need  to  establish  a  one-stop 
<br/>business  licence  shop.  There  is  a  need  for  a  centralised  one-stop-shop  for  applying  for  business 
<br/>licence,  to  eliminate  the  inconvenience  of  residents  travelling  to  Suva,  or  multiple  offices  for 
<br/>document verification for approval.  There is a discussion within my Ministry in terms of placing one 
<br/>of our officers from the Registrar of Titles, at least, two days in a fortnight, so that it can address the 
<br/>request from landowners in terms trust deeds.  So, they do not have to come all the way to Suva.  We 
<br/>are also going to place them in other towns.  They will come for training to the Registrar of Titles 
<br/>Office so they can do these services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before, in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you come to Suva to do that.   If you are living 
<br/>in Koro, you have to come and get your registered birth certificate in Suva. That problem has been 
<br/>resolved.  Done!  Soon, </span><span>qaravi.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, does not go out to do awareness.  So, basically what 
<br/></span><span>I am saying is that the people living in the maritime, are left out.  That is the change we promised 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this country, led by the honourable  Prime Minister, and of course,  these are my colleagues.  This is 
<br/>the change we promised.  We are actually empowering the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the motion.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  and  honourable  Vanawalu  for  their  hard  work.    We  hope  that  there  will  be  some  good 
<br/>governance in the near future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I look at the statements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, paragraph 5 of the Auditor-General’s Report 
<br/>says, “The Council was unable…”; paragraph 6 says, “There was unreconciled…”; paragraph 7(a), 
<br/>“The Council was unable…”  So, the question is, who appointed these people?  Why was no action 
<br/>taken?  But with the Coalition Government, we hope we are going to set new standards.  I support 
<br/>the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House.  As 
<br/></span><span>we dig into the findings of the Report, it is imperative to acknowledge the weaknesses that have been 
<br/></span><span>identified within the Nadi Town Council.  The financial health of the Council is a pressing concern, 
<br/>with  outstanding  rates  approximately  amounting  to  $3.4  million.    This  figure  includes  both,  the 
<br/>current  dues and  arrears, with  only  about  $243,000  collected in  the financial year, representing a 
<br/>mere 11 percent of the total owed.  Such a situation is untenable and poses a significant barrier to the 
<br/>Council's  ability  to  finance  essential  services  and  infrastructure  projects  that  our  community 
<br/>desperately needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights the Council's struggle with rate collection, which has 
<br/>led to reliance on legal action to recover outstanding dues. The Committee has rightly recognised 
<br/>that  pursuing  these  matters  in  court  is  necessary  to  deter  non-compliance  and  ensure  that  all 
<br/>ratepayers contribute their fair share. This approach, Sir, while essential, underscores a deeper issue 
<br/>- the need for a more proactive and engaging strategy to communicate with the constituents about 
<br/>their responsibilities and the importance of timely payments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to funds and challenges, the Report points to depressing need 
<br/>for improved infrastructure in Nadi Town.  Residents have voiced their concerns regarding the poor 
<br/>road conditions which has not been adequately maintained.  The Committee has engaged discussions 
<br/>with the Fiji Roads Authority to address these issues, seeking their assistance in upgrading the roads 
<br/>that are vital for the safety and mobility of our community. It is crucial that we continue to advocate 
<br/>for these improvements, as they directly affect the quality of life of our residents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has emphasised the importance of partnership 
<br/>in addressing these challenges.  Collaboration with organisations such as JICA and the Australian 
<br/>Government are essential for the successful completion of the ongoing projects. The Committee is 
<br/>actively working to finalise these projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Nadi  Town  Council  faces  significant  challenges  that  require  our 
<br/>collective effort and commitment. The weaknesses identified in the Report, particularly regarding 
<br/>financial management and infrastructure, must be addressed with urgency. The solution proposed by 
<br/>the  Committee,  including  legal  action  for  rate  collection,  improve  communication  and  strategic 
<br/>partnerships are steps in the right direction.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1955 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the hard work of the Council and would like to thank the current, 
<br/>CEO, Mr. Muni Gopal Reddy and his team, for working tirelessly to meet the expectations of the 
<br/>ratepayers and other stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the outskirts of Nadi Town, there  is the Saunaka Land Purchase Co-
<br/>operative  Society  Limited,  but  it  still  has  issues  pending  with  the  Nadi  Town  Council  and  other 
<br/>stakeholders. This Co-operative was established in 1970 with 15 members, and later with additional 
<br/>members, increased to 30 in the years 2009 to 2010.  In 2018, instead of full subdivision, a piecemeal 
<br/>subdivision was carried out and titles were issued under the land depository period. Due to this, Sir, 
<br/>most of the members, stakeholders and beneficiaries refused to pay their town rates. According to 
<br/>the  Co-operative,  members’  multiple  emails  have  been  sent  to  the  Nadi  Town  Council  and  no 
<br/>response has been received to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  out  of  56  acres,  14  acres  has  been  purchased  by  the  members,  with  the 
<br/>remaining allocated to access roads. Moreover, for some reasons, 18.5 acres of members’ land has 
<br/>been misappropriated by the previous Saunaka Land Cooperatives Board, and that has been labelled 
<br/>as balance spent.  This issue has been raised with the Nadi Town Council and the Titles Office, but 
<br/>no response has been forthcoming, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Nadi Town Council to look into the plight of this Saunaka Land 
<br/>Purchase Cooperative Limited so that proper development can take place, and outstanding rates can 
<br/>be recovered by the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also urge the honourable Minister responsible to conduct an investigation into the affairs of 
<br/>this Saunaka Land Cooperative Limited and its previous Board so that the current members can move 
<br/>on with their allocated lots for the development of the Nadi Town Council and improvement of Nadi 
<br/>as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  to  support  the 
<br/>recommendation  put  forward  in  the  Report  and  advocate  for  necessary  actions  to  implement  the 
<br/>solutions.  Together, we can build a better future for Nadi Town and its residents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  intend  to  adjourn  Parliament  for  afternoon  tea. 
<br/>When we return, we shall be inviting the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics to make his contribution as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The House adjourned at 4.40 p.m.

<div><span>Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.37 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for his motion 
<br/>and also thank all the honourable Members, including the honourable Minister, for his contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just confine to two issues that were raised by honourable Members, 
<br/>one, of course, is with respect to solid waste management.  In the National Development Plan (NDP), 
<br/>one  of  the  sub-chapters  7.4,  has  been  devoted  to  the  solid  waste  management  Key  Performance 
<br/>Indicators (KPIs), policies and strategies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is dealing with a significant solid waste management problem now.  
<br/>Obviously,  increased  economic  activity,  changing  consumption  patterns,  even  in  the  rural  areas, 
<br/>consumption patterns – products that were not used are now being used and there are different kinds 
<br/>of activities, which generate a lot of solid waste – informal settlements, increasing urbanisation, so 
<br/>at the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, only 0.2 percent of the total waste is, kind of, recycled in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the NDP, as part of the KPIs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, solid waste disposal through 
<br/>collection and disposal by Municipal Councils is about 182,000 tonnes nationally.  The target in the 
<br/></span><span>NDP for the next three years – 2025-2027, needs to take it to 250,000 tonnes, and between 2025-
<br/></span><span>2029 to about 350,000 tonnes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at how we can increase recycling plants and the target 
<br/>key  indicators.  The  targets  in  the  plan  are  one  in  the  Western  Division  and  one  in  the  Northern 
<br/>Division. The Western Division in the next first three years (2025–2027) and landfills again target 
<br/>for one in the Western Division, Northern Division, we have talked about rubbish dump in Nadi. 
<br/>Those are immediate short-term targets, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for solid waste management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Nadi, it is a serious concern because the nature of waste has also changed in rural areas, 
<br/>for example the use of diapers. People use it in the rural areas because there is no provision to dispose 
<br/>of them, we are not encouraging disposal methods. They bring it to the urban areas, hoping that the 
<br/>town and city Councils will collect and dispose. It is an ongoing issue for many of the municipal 
<br/>councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue is the Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project. This project is 
<br/>one of the most critical long-term initiatives underway. This project which aims to reduce the flood 
<br/>risks that have historically impacted Nadi, continuous to be a priority for both the Nadi Town Council 
<br/>as well as the for the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reference was made to the support by international partners such as 
<br/>Japan. As I said, the project is designed to mitigate flood risks that have long threatened that area’s 
<br/>infrastructure  and  economy.  So,  while  significant  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  drainage 
<br/>systems and reinforcing riverbanks, additional resources will be required to review those further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can inform Parliament that we have received the final Technical Report 
<br/>by  the  Australian  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility  Programme  (AIFFP),  and  I  want  to  thank  the 
<br/>Australian and the Japanese Government for working together.  There were some concerns about the 
<br/>original design, the way in which the first and second phase was going to be conducted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Technical Report that has been submitted by AIFFP addresses that and one of the donor 
<br/>partners has already committed grants. So, this project is going to be a big project and it is going to 
<br/></span><span>cost  us  significant  resources.  At  the  moment,  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  we  are  looking  at 
<br/></span><span>policies and strategies, to ensure that we look for more grant financing for this project because under

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1957 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>climate resilience projects, these types of projects are very, very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am confident now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that given the completion of the Technical Report and 
<br/>given the support that the Japanese Government is already providing, we should be able to move on 
<br/>this project as soon as possible. Other supportive infrastructure by Government around Nadi, is the 
<br/>dredging works at Denarau in which we had allocated about $5.5 million in the 2024-2025 Budget. 
<br/>As we know, Denarau is one of the key areas that contributes to the tourism economy. It is part of 
<br/>the Government's broader effort, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to mitigate the cost of flooding and strengthen 
<br/>critical tourism infrastructure. These dredging works will protect Denarau shores, improve drainage 
<br/>and safeguard this infrastructure against rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions, which is 
<br/>quite frequent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  the  Nadi  River  Flood  Alleviation  Project,  we  have  also 
<br/>prioritised the allocation of funding to upgrade drainage systems to reduce the impact of the kind of 
<br/>flooding  that  we  would  have  seen  in  the  past.    So,  in  the  2024-2025  Budget,  we  have  allocated 
<br/>additional  resources  to  the  different  Ministries  -  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  and 
<br/>Ministry of Sugar and Multi-Ethnic Affairs, because we believe that some of the drainage works that 
<br/>need to be done beyond the town boundary is having an ultimate impact when there is a lot of rain 
<br/></span><span>and cyclones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because of those works not being carried out beyond the towns and cities, they ultimately end 
<br/>up in those areas, so as part of the overall projects by Government, both in the 2023-2024 Budget, 
<br/>but more significantly in the 2024-2025 Budget, we had provided additional funding for drainage 
<br/>works throughout the country and I think some of the work has already begun. Some were done last 
<br/>year, and we can see the positive impact of that kind of drainage work beyond the town and city 
<br/>boundaries and is having a positive impact on towns and cities as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, the other issue that the honourable Minister for Justice raised was 
<br/>that their rate collection was a big problem over the last many years, and we are addressing that now. 
<br/>We are also saying to vendors and those using the services of towns and cities that a certain level of 
<br/>user pay is required because everyone, and those who live in the cities and town boundaries but more 
<br/>importantly those who live outside of these boundaries, use these services on a regular basis, so town 
<br/>and city councils must have adequate resources. Government cannot continue to inject funds to run 
<br/>these town and city councils, and we are hopeful that after the elections, more understanding and 
<br/>campaign amongst the ratepayers where this culture of self-financing and the ability of town and city 
<br/>councils to provide services to the people will be enhanced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for a very constructive 
<br/>deliberation from the honourable Members this afternoon and we believe most of the issues raised 
<br/>have been addressed by the honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Sir,  once  again,  the  Committee  would  like  to  thank  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government  for their timely submission in  response to  the Committee’s recommendations in  this 
<br/>august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee looks forward to the successful implementation of these recommendations in 
<br/>which we significantly contribute to the growth and prosperity of Nadi Town Council. On this note 
<br/>Sir, I have no other comments on this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.
