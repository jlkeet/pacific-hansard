<div><span>Status of Timber Treatment in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my statement on the status of timber treatment in Fiji.  I am 
<br/>delivering this  statement because the issue of selling  sub-standard treated timber on the domestic 
<br/>market  is  a  cause  for  concern  and  has  become  one  of  the  critical  national  interest.    Last  month 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar raised this issue in the media and so did the Consumer Council of Fiji, 
<br/>raising a crucial question on the role of the Ministry of Forestry in this regard.  I must thank the 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Premila  Kumar  and  the  Consumer  Council  of  Fiji  for  raising  this  important  issue 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>especially  when  we  are  faced  with  serious  challenges  relating  to  the  incursion  of  the  Asian  sub-
<br/>terranean termites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you may all know, the main purpose of treating timber with chemicals is to 
<br/>protect the timber from insects and fungal decay making it more durable and being able to last longer 
<br/>in service.  Without treatment, many species of timber including pine will not be suitable for use in 
<br/>exposed and ground contact situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  timber  treatment  therefore,  substantially  extends  the  service  life  of  timber, 
<br/>particularly those with lower natural durability classes including a number of our native timbers and 
<br/>our main plantations species.  It must however be noted that the treating of timber with chemicals is 
<br/>not  compulsory.    This  is  because  some  untreated  timbers  from  species  such  as  pine  can  be  used 
<br/>without  any  problems  for  some  specific  end-users  especially  for  non-load  bearing  and  in  fully 
<br/>protected situations and out of ground contact.  Also, low grade timbers destined for boxing purposes 
<br/>are not normally treated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, at the same time, there are native species, the hardwood of which are naturally 
<br/>durable and do not need to be treated. So, in the market, one has a choice of purchasing either treated 
<br/></span><span>or untreated timber depending on one’s requirements.  It is only when a timber processor elects to 
<br/></span><span>undertake timber treatment that the current legislations come into play to ensure that certain quality 
<br/>and safety standards are met. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  currently  regulates  the  operations  of  all  timber 
<br/>treatment plants in the country as required under the Forest Regulations of 1992.  As we speak, we 
<br/>have 29 registered timber treatment plants and so far, 14 are licensed to operate this year.  These 
<br/>plants are licensed annually and are monitored on a quarterly basis.  The monitoring of these plants 
<br/>focuses on operator competency, health and safety control where timber samples are located on a 
<br/>monthly basis for testing, looking at the concentration and penetration of preservative chemicals in 
<br/>the timber to ensure that these are within required standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, different end-users have different levels of chemicals with assigned buildings 
<br/>including H2 which is used for interior use and is fully protected from the weather and not in ground 
<br/>contact. H3</span><span> </span><span>for exterior use not in ground contact, H4</span><span> </span><span>are posts which have low risk and in ground 
<br/>contact, H5</span><span> </span><span>posts which are high risk and in ground contact, H6 posts and poles which are usually of 
<br/>marine use. All licensed timber treatment plants should have the appropriate branding gears which is 
<br/>low risk and ground contact; H5 posts which are high risk and in ground contact; H6 posts and poles 
<br/>which are usually of marine use.  All licensed timber treatment plants should have the appropriate 
<br/>branding gears to enable them to brand their treated timbers, showing the treatment plant ID number, 
<br/>the chemical use and the hazard level to which the timber has been treated.  One end of every piece 
<br/>of treated timber should be branded as described. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Forest Regulations 1992 mandates the Ministry of Forestry to licence 
<br/>and monitor the operation of timber treatment plants but does not authorise the Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>to ensure that timber users only buy timbers which are treated according to the legally prescribed 
<br/>standards.  We can only advise and offer our assistance in the proper specification of timbers and in 
<br/>the inspections to ensure that the specifications had been followed.  The Ministry of Forestry had 
<br/>been working tirelessly over the years carrying out awareness and training with timber retailers and 
<br/>hardware shops and using the radio talkback shows and the </span><span>Nai Katalau</span><span> television programme to 
<br/>educate and raise awareness to the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consumers need to know and understand what they are buying for and what 
<br/></span><span>they need to ask retailers as well as seek in the specifications, the level of treatment and what hazard 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>level that timber is suitable for.  As this issue of substandard timbers continues to be a challenge, 
<br/>especially in the face of incursion of the Asian subterrain termites, the Ministry is at the moment 
<br/>exploring the possibility of developing a timber marketing regulation to also oversee the operation 
<br/>of timber retailers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that treating timber with chemicals is not only part of 
<br/>the solution.  Proper design of buildings and proper specification of building materials go a long way 
<br/>in ensuring that we are better protected, especially against the termites. I thank you for the opportunity 
<br/>to speak, Mr Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think the advice is very important, as we are trying to find a way in the 
<br/>timber market for the solution to enable us to get good timber.  There is some advice, we from the 
<br/>islands, use coconuts a lot.  Coconut is oily and it does not need to be treated.  We have a senile tree 
<br/>that is 60 years to 70 years old, that is a good enough timber to take care of your timber needs for a 
<br/>new building.  Maybe people are not used to it, but those are some of the sound advice coming from 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Forestry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her 
<br/></span><span>deliberation  this morning and highlighting the facts surrounding timber treatment.  I think when we 
<br/></span><span>look back in the olden days, timber treatment was not available then.  I remember correctly back in 
<br/>my  village  in  Kadavu,  the  technology  and  the  idea  of  timber  treatment  was  not  readily  available 
<br/>during my young days.  I remember even in buildings of Fijian </span><span>bure</span><span>, the villagers used to use the 
<br/>sandalwood tree as their posts.  These posts used to be the one that lasts longest, </span><span>yasi</span><span> and </span><span>vesi</span><span>, because 
<br/>of their natural strength and hardness in the fibre that is made out of these.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  highlighting  these  facts  because  there  seems  to  be 
<br/>confusion  within  our  local  population  on  the  laws  regarding  treatment.    I  know  that  non-treated 
<br/>timber mostly are rejected by people in the rural areas thinking that the life span of untreated timber 
<br/>is much shorter than the treated one.  But her explanation this morning basically means that there are 
<br/>other ways, as you have alluded to, Mr. Speaker, the traditional way of treating timber to make their 
<br/>life span longer.  I remember in the rural islands they have been treating pine by soaking them in 
<br/>seawater for a week. The only difficulty in that is when they bring out to construct it is very hard to 
<br/>put nails through it. The timber pine basically hardens, and it is very difficult to use nails. It basically 
<br/>will need holes to be drilled and the use of bolts and nuts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, she highlighted the different and the various types of treatment of timber. 
<br/>I think out of the eight types of treatment the main treatment is to treat against insects and termites.  
<br/>In my trips around Lautoka I found out the attack of termites and the destruction that is caused. I 
<br/>think, honourable Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and honourable Sashi Kiran have 
<br/>been in charge of a group that actually looked at this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was in a wedding in Girmit Centre two weekends ago. It is amazing to see these termites 
<br/>when the light goes on 6 o’clock in the evening. They almost clog the lights that are hanging around 
<br/>the Girmit Centre where the wedding was held. But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed that by 9’oclock all 
<br/>the termites have gone. None to be seen.   Now, I would like to ask, honourable Sashi Kiran if she 
<br/>can explain to me the fiasco on this habit of termites that not only in the Western Division but now 
<br/>it  has  moved  to  the  Northern  Division  around  Labasa.  I  understand  from  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Minister Sashi Kiran that they actually go underground. They creep to about 15 metres and then can 
<br/>come up in cane fields and actually eat into standing cane. So, it is a huge problem, but I thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister for highlighting the issue so that we can at least learn and be more informed of 
<br/></span><span>the different aspects of treatment of timber and the termites and insects that attack timber.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is very interesting, honourable Member.  Maybe honourable Assistant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Women can share what sort of oil she uses.  I think that is a kind of repellent to those 
<br/>kind of insects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call upon the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the G-9 Bloc thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very timely statement and advice on the issue and we have nothing further to add.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>TSLS Delegation to Sydney and Canberra 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>fellow Members of Parliament and all those joining us live through the livestream across the globe 
<br/>and  from  the  comforts  of  their  homes;  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  present  my  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement on the recent Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Service (TSLS) delegation visitation which I 
<br/>led to Sydney and Canberra in Australia and the outcomes achieved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be remiss of me not to mention that this is the first time that the 
<br/></span><span>Government, in this case, the Coalition Government has set budgetary allocation to visit sponsored 
<br/></span><span>students studying under the TSLS overseas scholarships in Australia and New Zealand and similar 
<br/>visit is done by other governments across the globe who sponsor students at universities overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the visit is to check on student wellbeing and welfare and 
<br/>have direct audience with university executives and students in order to work out solutions raised by 
<br/>students,  or  the  respective  universities  and  the  visit  coincided  with  strengthening  and  expanding 
<br/>partnerships with universities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS was established in 2014, and overseas scholarships started in 2019 
<br/>under the organisation.  There was no visit to the students until 2023.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year I 
<br/>was fortunate to be part of the TSLS delegation, which included: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Ro Teimumu Kepa - TSLS Board Chair 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Dr. Hasmukh Lal - Chief Executive Officer 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Staff from TSLS and the Ministry of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  universities  visited  included  the  University  of  New  South  Wales,  Western  Sydney, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>University, The University, Newcastle and the University Canberra.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  the  intentions  of  the  travel,  the  Coalition  Government 
<br/>introduced  a  new  scheme  on,  the  current  financial  year,  to  have  more  citizens  to  access  PhD 
<br/>scholarships to boost Fiji's human capital. This is the newly introduced scheme called Cost Sharing 
<br/>Overseas PhD Scholarship. Under this agreement the universities will cover tuition fee while TSLS 
<br/>will pay stipend, airfare and any other cost associated with the study.  As such, the taxpayers of Fiji 
<br/>will save around $300,000 tuition fee for a four-year PhD programme and will have graduates of top 
<br/>quality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 3rd July, 2024, the University of Newcastle was the first university to 
<br/>come on board for the cost-sharing overseas PhD initiative. During the visit, I witnessed the signing 
<br/>of the cost-sharing overseas PhD MOU between TSLS and the University of New South Wales and 
<br/>Western Sydney University and I thank these two universities for development perspective towards 
<br/></span><span>Fiji.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1913 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also had the opportunity to visit the world class Brumbies sport facility at 
<br/>the University of Canberra, where TSLS will send prospective students to pursue qualifications in 
<br/>sport science and sports medicine. This is a model where the university has a partnership facility for 
<br/>learning, teaching research and sports excellence with ACT Brumbies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the visit of the four universities, the delegation emphasised to the 
<br/>universities  the  intentions  of  the  scholarship  investment  designed  in  developing  human  capital, 
<br/>particularly  on  the  introduction  of  a  new  overseas  scheme  called  Scholarships  for  Merit-based 
<br/>Postgraduate  Diploma  Specialisation,  In-service,  overseas  training  and  the  increased  quota  in  the 
<br/>scholarship for merit-based undergraduate overseas scheme from 40 awards to 80 awards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The universities were also requested to ensure pastoral care is provided to assist students in 
<br/>adjusting to the fast-paced environment of learning they are in, whereby peer mentoring services to 
<br/>students is emphasised to assist students in coping with their academic requirements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the meeting with the students, they were notified of the TSLS policy 
<br/>changes, such as increasing bond services from 1.5 times to 2.5 times.  Increase in termination penalty 
<br/>up to 50 percent for students who default their bond services with special emphasis on scholarship 
<br/></span><span>academic  obligation  since  the  probation  period  has  decreased  from  three  probations  to  two 
<br/></span><span>probations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  visiting  the  sponsored  students  at  the  four  universities  I  was 
<br/>overwhelmed  with  the  response  that  was  received  from  the  students.  The  sponsored  students 
<br/>commended  the  Coalition  Government  for  providing  them  with  the  opportunity  to  undertake 
<br/>programmes at an overseas university. The students also commended the support services provided 
<br/>by  the  universities  and  TSLS  in  achieving  their  educational  goals  overseas  and  assisting  them  in 
<br/>adapting to the new environment overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And the sponsored student showed commitment towards completing their programmes and 
<br/>returning to serve the country. I assured the students that the Coalition Government will continue to 
<br/>assist and invest in the youths as they are the future of a country and as such it is a responsibility of 
<br/>the sponsored students to serve their scholarship bond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the student highly acknowledged the visit as it was motivational, and they 
<br/>saw Government’s seriousness and commitment to their studies. It cost Government around $300,000 
<br/>to fund, one undergraduate student in the Overseas Scholarship Scheme when compared to $30,000 
<br/>to  $40,000  at  a  local  university.  To  have  commercial  return  of  service  to  the  country  against  the 
<br/>investment, the bonding of overseas scholarship is now 2.5 times the duration of the study.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon meeting with the sponsored students at the universities, I was alerted 
<br/>on the need to review the Education Curriculum to allow students a smooth transition from secondary 
<br/>school to universities, specifically in the areas and subjects of mathematics, physics, and computer 
<br/>science.  It was highlighted in the visit that there is a vast difference between what is learned in Year 
<br/>13 in Fiji and what is taught in the universities in overseas.  These sponsored students were assured 
<br/>that the curriculum innovation and transformation from ECE to senior secondary is one of the priority 
<br/>areas  of  the  Ministry  and  as  such  the  Ministry  is  working  towards  the  reviewing  of  the  school 
<br/>curriculum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Overseas Scholarship Scheme, TSLS funds the programme which 
<br/>are part of the national priority areas but not offered by the local universities. A total of 60 students 
<br/></span><span>are currently enrolled in areas such as cyber security, software engineering, veterinary science, data 
<br/></span><span>science,  actuarial  science,  forensic  science,  architectural  engineering,  chemical  engineering,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>biomedical  engineering,  environmental  engineering,  mechatronics  engineering,  speech  pathology 
<br/>and  renewable  energy  at  the  New  Zealand  and  Australia  based  universities.    With  increasing 
<br/>scholarship quota at the undergraduate level and the introduction of new scholarship schemes, more 
<br/>Fijians will be pursuing quality education in Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is faced with competing priorities and challenges and for Government 
<br/>to alone invest skilling people, to mitigate gaps in our workforce, is a challenge with other competing 
<br/>national priorities and therefore, during the visit I had the opportunity to lead the delegation to the 
<br/>bilateral meeting with DFAT where the delegation was joined by His Excellency Ajay Bhai Amrit, 
<br/>Fiji's High Commissioner to Australia who coordinated the meeting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Fiji  has lost approximately around 2.5 percent  of its population  through 
<br/>permanent and circular migration. It is evident that Australia is the one highly preferred destination 
<br/>country.  It  is  noted that the Australian Awards Schemes are also  given to  our citizens, which we 
<br/>highly acknowledge, but there is no monitoring in place, on how long the graduates effectively serve 
<br/>in Fiji after graduation.  As such, our bilateral meeting with DFAT in Canberra discussed ways the 
<br/>students on the Australian Awards can be bonded by the Fiji Government through TSLS.  This will 
<br/>ensure  that  Fiji  does  not  lose  Australian  Scholarship  Awards  Graduates,  and  they  serve  at  least 
<br/></span><span>minimum of five years in Fiji and be cleared from the bond services by TSLS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst other discussions with DFAT, the delegation acknowledged the 
<br/>Australian Government in its budget support to the Fiji Government and made recommendations that 
<br/>the Australian Government considers providing targeted funding for specific job skills, training under 
<br/>the  Vuvale  Partnership.    The  proposed  budgetary  supports  towards  vocational  programmes  and 
<br/>degree programmes which are offered by local universities in the areas where Fiji lacks the discipline 
<br/>and skills shortages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, curriculum innovation and transformation from ECE to senior secondary 
<br/>school is one of the priority areas discussed DFAT.  The Ministry is working to develop a concept of 
<br/>curriculum innovation and transformation. We are pleased to inform this august House that DFAT 
<br/>has assured support for Fiji's curriculum review, which will be assisted in parallel with the Australian  
<br/>curriculum review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as curriculum review is enhanced, it is expected that teachers’ skills will 
<br/>need to be upgraded, and this was also discussed with DFAT to set up a teacher upskilling platform 
<br/>on digital training assessments.  The Ministry of Education, Mr. Speaker has started dialogue with 
<br/>other bilateral partners on assistance for online learning for both, teachers and students, and DFAT 
<br/>along with the World Bank and ADB, and some other agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be celebrated that Fiji on the education front is spending scholarship 
<br/>on  its  own  and  through partnerships  with  the  Australian  universities  for  example  the  PhDs.    The 
<br/>intentions whereby TSLS is the driving force along with the Fiji Higher Education Commission and 
<br/>our stakeholder tertiary  providers. We wish to inculcate  a  culture of research-driven policies that 
<br/>encapsulate  innovations  and  entrepreneurship  for  development  resolutions,  and  in  doing  so,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education is driving the establishment of a Fiji National Research Council or a proxy to 
<br/>allow researchers to receive grants to conduct research on Government policies and challenges. The 
<br/>proxy can be a model to begin with research grant based at TSLS and then full scoping to establish 
<br/>entity on its own.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the visit by the TSLS delegation, we were able to secure the pro-
<br/></span><span>bono  service  of  two  distinguished  professors  who  are  from  Fiji  to  help  in  the  establishment  of  a 
<br/></span><span>Research  Council.  They  are  Professor  Dharmendra  Sharma  from  University  of  Canberra  and

<div><span>Professor Satish Chand from University of New South Wales. We are very grateful to the gentlemen 
<br/>for their support towards the development of Fiji’s research capabilities and we will look forward to 
<br/>the support of our other esteemed sons and daughters of Fiji in the area of education research to join 
<br/>us in this noble development intention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  also  pleased  to  report  that  DFAT  has  assured  the 
<br/>assistance of the Australian Research Council to help in the setting up of Fiji's National Research 
<br/>Council, which had been agreed by law to be set up in 2017 under the National Research Council 
<br/>Act of 2017, which, however, is yet to be implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude the investment that Government is doing in quality education 
<br/>and in research degrees; Fiji will reap benefits in three to four years’ time and beyond and we need a 
<br/>strong and bold vision in education to ensure that we build an inclusive nation that empowers our 
<br/>citizens.  The Coalition Government’s commitment to education, we will definitely make a measure 
<br/>in roads in our development intentions accordingly and we thank all stakeholders for working with 
<br/>us to make these aspirations happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just before I take my seat, may I also extend my sincere appreciation to His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency the High Commissioner to Australia, Mr. Ajay Amrit Bhai, his hardworking staff and the 
<br/></span><span>amazing Fijian diaspora for the warm traditional welcome accorded to us as we visited Canberra.  
<br/>The  usual  Fijian  hospitality  and  fervour  was  on  display,  and  I  wish  to  say  </span><span>vinaka  vakalevu  na 
<br/>veivakataukeitaki, na loloma kei na veikauwaitaki.  </span><span>We trust we were able to satisfy those queries 
<br/>especially on the education sector sufficiently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu </span><span>honourable Minister for Education for that very thought-
<br/>provoking tour that you have undertaken and your discussions with your counterparts in Australia.  
<br/>The Legislature is pushing for some recognition of how best it could endeavour into more research 
<br/>to be undertaken, especially when the honourable Attorney-General has highlighted that there are 
<br/>only six drafters with the Solicitor-General. Most of the time they are tied up, there is delay in the 
<br/>work not only for the Committees, even for private motions from honourable Members. That is still 
<br/>to be seen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We would like something similar to the Ministry of Health where they do a Public Health 
<br/>Master’s and that should encourage and then given a budget allocation.  But the concern raised by 
<br/>the  Australian  Government,  I  think,  needs  to  be  noted  very  seriously,  honourable  Members  and 
<br/>honourable Ministers.  Please, see the concern that is coming from graduates, we do not know where 
<br/>they are, they are provided with some scholarships and then they vanished.  In this regard, we are 
<br/>just registering our interest here, honourable Minister for Education, the legislature.  We need drafters 
<br/>and we are pushing very hard for an in-service training to be conducted by the various officials here 
<br/>who are highly qualified and stand ready to pursue further education in law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education for his Ministerial Statement on Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Services and the recent 
<br/>visit by TSLS team to Australia.  TSLS gives scholarships to Fiji students to go and study abroad.  
<br/>My questions are:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Who decides which programmes to be funded?  Is it only TSLS making this critical decision 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or Higher Education Commission Fiji is also involved in this decision-making?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Does  such  decision  have  regard  to  the  new  National  Development  Plan,  meaning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>professional needs of the country?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  tertiary  educational  loan  scheme  was  introduced  in  2014  by  the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government, with the focus on achieving the best educational outcomes for Fiji and 
<br/>ensuring that funding spent on scholarships and loans, which would result in contribution to the Fiji’s 
<br/>economy growth, workforce development and livelihood.  The TSLS has spent $1.44 billion from 
<br/>the  budget  to  assist  around  70,000  students  in  last  10  years  of  operation.    The  total  amount  of 
<br/>taxpayers’  money  spent  has  indicated  huge  contribution  to  Fiji  that  is  prioritised  through  tertiary 
<br/>education and training programmes.  Previously, all students meeting the educational requirements 
<br/>at any tertiary institution, were given loans but that is not the case today.  There are many students 
<br/>who have received admission into programmes at universities but are studying privately because they 
<br/>did not qualify for the scholarship or loan.  That is around 19,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  previous  government  established  a  sustainable  funding  model  for  tertiary  education, 
<br/>creating a revolving fund for future students intending to study in tertiary institutions.  Unfortunately, 
<br/>this Government has created an unsustainable financial model, where every year taxpayers fork out 
<br/>around $150 million for tertiary education. The Government has imposed 50 percent penalties for 
<br/>forfeiting bonds if they wish to seek opportunities offshore.  How does this help our graduates or the 
<br/>economy?  Remittances sent by unemployed students working abroad can contribute positively to 
<br/>our foreign exchange.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government decision to write off student debts in the last budget has 
<br/>cost over $600 million directly equating to the current budget deficit.  Converting the student loan 
<br/>scheme to a scholarship is not sustainable for a small economy like ours.  Even larger economies like 
<br/>Australia, continue to maintain a loan scheme for tertiary education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, $150 million 
<br/>would have gone towards other important developments.  The Government is given budget support 
<br/>by Australia and New Zealand.  Students in these countries are on Higher Education Contribution 
<br/>Scheme.  We hope that the TSLS team that visited Australia have learnt the sustainable financial 
<br/>model of funding tertiary education which reduces financial burden on taxpayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Group of Nine or their designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You just stand up and continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I was waiting for the yellow card to come out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the very informative statement on their 
<br/>visit.  I  wish  the  students  who  are  studying  under  the  Scheme  well.  I  urge  them  not  to  waste  this 
<br/>wonderful opportunity and finish their studies. We have nothing further to add.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I acknowledge the presence, honourable Members, of Ms. Malimali in the 
<br/>Chambers. It is hard to miss her, honourable Members. She has been the centre stage of attraction all 
<br/>these how many weeks. All the best, Ms. Malimali.

<div><span>National Museum and National Art Gallery 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this august House, ladies 
<br/>and gentlemen who are here in the gallery and those listening from their homes, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a Ministerial Statement to share with you the progress the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry is undertaking in the effort to strengthen a transformed culture sector for Fiji. One such is 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the national museum, a statutory body established through the Fiji Museum Act of 1929 to manage, 
<br/>protect and provide our national collection of objects and treasures which relays stories of Fiji’s rich 
<br/>culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  and  over  again  we  learn  from  diplomatic  and  international  visitors 
<br/>alike that more than often the best place to learn Fijian history, people’s heritage and culture is at the 
<br/>Fiji Museum.  Our new National Sustainable Tourism Framework highlights the importance of our 
<br/>cultures, traditions and creative industries in promoting a holistic experience for our tourists.   Now 
<br/>this  begs  the  question,  are  we  doing  enough  to  support  our  national  museum,  the  iconic  cultural 
<br/>institution that has been in existence since the 1900s? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  acknowledge  past  governments  and  their  efforts  to  support  the 
<br/>museum progress, it has always been an </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> and piece meal assistance.  In addition, these efforts 
<br/>fall short of addressing the serious neglect that the institution had endured in the past years.  However, 
<br/>tangible  changes  are  progressively  manifesting  in  the  form  of  innovative  exhibitions  and 
<br/>infrastructural expansion at the National Museum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Members of this august House and the general public have been to the 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Museum in recent days, what you see is the result of hard work put in by staff, management, and 
<br/></span><span>its Board of Trustees past and present.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  are  the  real  people  that  work  behind  the  scenes,  to  ensure  that  our  people,  our 
<br/>international visitors, our senior citizens, our youths and our children get to see the renewed Museum 
<br/>offering an interactive experience that has been stagnant for the last 30 years. Through fundraising 
<br/>efforts of the </span><span>Tokani</span><span> - friends of the Museum, sponsorships, mini-donor assistance from embassies, 
<br/>cost-cutting measures carried out by the Museum board and management during and post COVID-
<br/>19 assisted in the expansion you would have seen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  extend  my  </span><span>vinaka  vakalevu</span><span>  to  these  individuals  and  institutions  for  your 
<br/>kindness and assistance which came in when the Museum most needed a shoulder to lean on. And 
<br/>this new look National Museum, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not the end to efforts by this Government and 
<br/>the Ministry to  ensure that it gets  the support it needs to  transform  itself into a national  standard 
<br/>museum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  old  history  gallery  has  been  rebranded  to  focus  on  our  creative 
<br/>communities.  Its main objective is to engage visitors to learn and appreciate the artistic and creative 
<br/>excellence  of  our  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  communities  and  other  communities  who  call  Fiji  home.    It  looks  at 
<br/>techniques and making of cultural treasures such as </span><span>masi</span><span>, woven fibre materials, pottery including 
<br/>associated  rituals,  ceremonies  and  governance.    In  this  new  financial  year,  the  Government  is 
<br/>providing the Fiji Museum $970,000 for its Operational Grant and $700,000 for Capital Upgrade 
<br/>Works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we want such independent statutory institutions to stand on its own, 
<br/>the Government must first take lead in making serious investment so that the Museum can become 
<br/>sustainable in the near future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased funding will complement works that have already progressed 
<br/>at this stage. The installation of solar panels promoting energy efficiency had progressed to phase 
<br/>two which will reduce electricity bill  for the Museum and alternate as  main source during power 
<br/>outages in Suva. Having a steady supply of water through the installation of water tanks and pumps 
<br/></span><span>at the Museum will alleviate issues of unplanned water cuts especially when there is a high visitor 
<br/></span><span>entry numbers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mapping  out  a  comprehensive  and  aligned  waste  and  sewerage  system  in  and  around  the 
<br/>Museum infrastructure is critical and works have also begun. The Museum will also commence with 
<br/>groundwork necessary to build its new state-of-the-art collections storage facility which will cost $2 
<br/>million. This will replace the current  old building which was built in the 1970s and has not been 
<br/>renovated ever since.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my sincere gratitude to the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for 
<br/>facilitating  our  request  in  amalgamating  the  property  lease  area  for  the  Fiji  Museum.    Since  the 
<br/>building of the current Museum in 1955, the Museum lease space has always been relegated to the 
<br/>existing length and width of the building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now this has expanded to include the two former Nawela Hostel Building which housed the 
<br/>Museum administration and staff offices. This lease expansion has allowed the Museum to expand 
<br/>its  facilities  and  ensure  safe  and  security  of  its  premises.  The  renovation  of  the  Nawela  Hostel 
<br/>Building  will  be  completed  in  this  financial  year.  The  office  will  allow  open  space  working 
<br/>environment for staff and dedicated rooms for specialized units to carry out their work such as the 
<br/>Archaeology Laboratory and the Exhibition Workshop.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The setting up of a robust IT system for the Museum includes fire alarm, protection and CCTV 
<br/></span><span>camera system is being planned and will be fully installed before the end of this financial year. This 
<br/>will ensure the security of our national collection and premises from hazardous threats that could 
<br/>lead to loss and ruin of our National Museum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our National Museum is continuing with an implementation of its in-house 
<br/>activities  to  ensure  that  it  fulfils  its  mandate.  The  development  and  rolling  out  of  the  museum 
<br/>education material is aimed at promoting interactive learning for our young people when they visit 
<br/>the Museum. It is a 360 degrees archaeology project which is an ongoing digital initiative that will 
<br/>ensure that the general public, diaspora Fijians, developers and visitors are able to see heritage sites 
<br/>and monumental features that are located in remote or inaccessible places around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Museum  collections’  project  funded  by  the  United  States  Embassy  Cultural 
<br/>Preservation  Grant  has  commenced  and  will  soon  recruit  cultural  youth  interns  to  help  in  the 
<br/>documentation and community engagement aspect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  increasing  activities  and  development  necessary  for  the  Fiji 
<br/>Museum, it has its fair share of challenges. Management is currently working on recruiting qualified 
<br/>and  experienced  individuals  to  fill  vacant  positions  so  that  our  National  Museum  can  deliver  its 
<br/>mandate to the Fijian people. The Fiji Museum is also looking at having a sustainable funding source 
<br/>to complement the annual grant given by the Government. This is key to business continuity and 
<br/>independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the care needed to protect 10,000 objects, textiles, archaeological materials, 
<br/>natural  historic specimens, photographs and documentary heritage need to be amplified if we are 
<br/>serious about safeguarding our cultural heritage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  ask  our  fellow  Members  of  this  august  House  and  the  general  public  to  rally  around 
<br/>supporting our National Museum in its effort to create an inclusive space for everyone. Our collection 
<br/>effort  will  foster  the  new  direction  that  the  Fiji  Museum  is  undertaking  with  the  focus  on  the 
<br/>celebration of our history, our identity, our heritage and our culture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, honourable Minister, for that very important information 
<br/></span><span>of the collection of artefacts that belongs to Fiji. Just a word of advice, it will be interesting if you

<br/>the honourable Minister.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, we will move on and I now call on the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Opposition or his designate to make their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for a very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comprehensive statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know that the vision of the Fiji Museum is to inspire, promote and 
<br/>to respect all cultures in Fiji, with its mission is to become a world-class museum. We understand 
<br/>that this will enhance its reputation by working locally, nationally and internationally to maintain and 
<br/>strengthen its focus on the diverse cultures of Fiji. It will be a place where the tangible and intangible 
<br/>heritage of these cultures is safeguarded and made accessible to communities, community members 
<br/>and  researchers.  This  innovative  and  imaginative  exhibits  and  programmes  will  serve  local 
<br/>communities and be a significant draw for all visitors and it will also make a difference in people's 
<br/>lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are aware that the Fiji Museum is to install and set up displays inside 
<br/></span><span>the museum galleries, using objects that are kept in storage, and I understand this is being currently 
<br/></span><span>done.  The  idea  is  to  create  a  theme  based,  storyline  display  with  associated  captions  and  short 
<br/>narratives  based  on  archival  materials  including  photographs,  illustrations  which  may  tell  a  story 
<br/>about the object.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that displays are done externally by various institutions and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>museum should encourage that any set-ups should be done inside the museum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, mobile exhibits can be  done, and all care must be taken to protect these 
<br/>exhibits. We hope that the Fiji Museum will put all its efforts into the realising that all cultures and 
<br/>ethnic groups have a piece of history. Currently, there are many histories, stories, artifacts, songs, 
<br/>cultures and traditional aspects that are not well documented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly recommend that the Ministry set-up a taskforce to move around 
<br/>the nation and acquire the artifacts and expressive arts and have it recorded and documented. This 
<br/>may mean that we go beyond our shores and acquire from people of our diaspora who have settled 
<br/>elsewhere. I understand that the Ministry will be venturing into this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before it is too 
<br/>late and our piece of history will be lost forever, I urge the Ministry to forge ahead with this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also a need for the Government to consider a building and funding a second small 
<br/>museum set-up in Nadi to cater for the tourism industry and get much needed revenue. There are 
<br/>many artefacts, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that are not displayed due to the lack of space in the current museum 
<br/>and these artefacts can be used in the second museum, let us say, supposedly to be built in Nadi and 
<br/>there is a request for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the museum for their restorative work done so far and 
<br/>hope  that  people  of  this  nation  will  use  it  to  their  advantage.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  the 
<br/>opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or their designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement 
<br/></span><span>this morning. The important value, the important aspect of the museum preserving the history of our 
<br/></span><span>nation. In addition to the preservation of our cultural and heritage history, Fiji, a small nation has got

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a big war history. From 1917 during the Labour Corps days, World War I, World War II, those that 
<br/>went to the Malayan campaign and so far, even now the Peacekeeping era. I am urging perhaps, if 
<br/>those that are looking after the museum, the renovations and the enhancement that is happening now, 
<br/>if we can also look at the idea of having a section or accepted building as a war museum like all the 
<br/>other countries do, to capture that part of Fiji’s history in the various campaigns that our ancestors 
<br/>went and participated in bravely, a fair number of them resting in those far away countries, for those 
<br/>that have passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I certainly support the work that is being put towards the enhancement of our museum. We 
<br/>hope that Government will continue to support the enlargement of the area and also perhaps think 
<br/>about the idea of preserving our war history and looking a war museum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Your  suggestion  is  a  noble  one,  it  would  be  interesting  to  see  how  the 
<br/>former soldiers who were given a spade, a fork and a knife after giving their life for the country. It is 
<br/>sad, but that is reality, and I do not know if they still have those around as if mooted by honourable 
<br/>Naupoto, you need to have a war museum as well, it will be very interesting.
