<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - RAKIRAKI TOWN COUNCIL 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Rakiraki  Town  Council 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report for the year 2019 which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Social Affairs was 
<br/>referred the Rakiraki Town Council Annual Report for the year 2019 on 4</span><span>th</span><span>  July 2023.  Pursuant to 
<br/>Standing Order 38(2), therefore, the Committee was referred to the review of the Annual Reports as 
<br/>pursuant to its mandate, as stipulated in Standing Order 110(1)(c).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rakiraki  Town  was  legally  declared  on  Thursday,  4</span><span>th</span><span>  July  2010.    The  Public  Service 
<br/></span><span>Commission  approved  the  use  of  an  office  space  in  the  Government  rented  complex  at  Vaileka 
<br/>House, where official operations commenced on Monday, 6th July 2010.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, as part of its deliberation, conducted a site visit to the new Rakiraki Market 
<br/>Complex and held a public submission with the CEO and the Administrator. The Council officially 
<br/>raised concerns with regards to extensive flooding that has occurred in Rakiraki over the years. They 
<br/>requested that this be addressed through regular dredging. It was also highlighted that the Council 
<br/>was moving towards digitalisation of their services through initiatives, such as the new website to 
<br/>keep track of applications and the introduction of QR payments via MPAiSA to enhance customer 
<br/>convenience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also discussed with enthusiasm was the Council’s proposal for a satellite 
<br/>town in Waimicia, Nalawa, Ra, and the proposed extension of its Town boundaries. As part of the 
<br/>Committee's recommendation, the Committee had highlighted the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>An urgent need to support the regular dredging of rivers to mitigate flooding in Rakiraki 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Government to reconsider providing annual grants to small municipalities like Rakiraki 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to carry out their service delivery within time of request.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Support the establishment of the proposed state line town in Waimicia, Nalawa, Ra and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carrying out  all necessary feasibility studies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry of Waterways to reinstate the annual grant to maintain the dangers within the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The retention of the Fiji Sport Council ground for sports and other recreational purposes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the people of Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>To expedite the process of converting the first floor of Rakiraki Market for commercial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>office space, and SMEs operators to generate additional revenue for the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>The Council to have regular meetings with Fiji Road Authority (FRA) in terms of regular

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024               Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1959 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the Committee’s recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this  Review Report, the Committee highlighted the various areas that 
<br/>need  to  be  strengthened  by  the  Council,  and  relevant  recommendations  were  formulated  for 
<br/>resolution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to inform you that I have a list supplied 
<br/>by the honourable Whips. There will be three speakers from each side, who will be speaking for 10 
<br/>minutes. The batting will be undertaken by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Lal; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S. Nand; and  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my brief contribution to the deliberation 
<br/></span><span>in this august Parliament on the Review Report of the Rakiraki Town Council 2019 and I would like 
<br/>to thank the Chairman and the Members of the respective Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  deeply  concerned  by  the  continuous  failures  of  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government to deliver on the most basic needs of our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we continue to 
<br/>face increasing urbanisation and raising cost of living, this Government is content to sit on their hands 
<br/>offering nothing but empty promises and delays.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this neglect is hurting the very people they are supposed to represent. The 
<br/>poor,  the  working  class,  the  small  business  owners  who  are  struggling  to  make  ends  meet.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, let us talk about this Rakiraki Municipal Market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What have you built? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You do not have to pay! What are you talking about? The Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and your Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, let us talk about Rakiraki Municipal Market. When it was 
<br/>first designed, there was a clear vision and provision for a concrete mezzanine floor so that that can 
<br/>be converted into office spaces for commercial use and for small businesses. So, I would like to ask, 
<br/>because we, the Committee met with the management of Rakiraki Town Council, and they said to us 
<br/>that they have asked for the funds but the funds has not been given. I want to thank him. He is a very 
<br/>honest  Minister.  He is  shaking  there, because he knows it! And  I want to thank him! As the line 
<br/>Minister he is responsible for responding to me! I do not want to hear from others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the vision for a better infrastructure and to help Rakiraki Town 
<br/></span><span>Council to generate additional funds. The smaller Councils can say whatever they want to say, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>1960 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report  30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are struggling, crippled by the lack of funding. And I was surprised that, unfortunately, he is not 
<br/>here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Finance has just said, that he has provided funds to the respective 
<br/>departments or the Ministry, Ministry for Waterways. So where is the money? Because, when we 
<br/>went there, they basically said there is no more Challenge Fund. So, where is this Challenge Fund 
<br/>that he is talking about? Maybe tomorrow you can answer. But the message that we got from the 
<br/>management  of  Rakiraki  Town  Council  that,  that  Challenge  Fund  had  been  stopped  by  the 
<br/>Government. Simple as that! So, the Minister can respond to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, another glaring issue is the Government's failure to 
<br/>formalise the FSC ground which includes the golf course and settlement areas which were basically 
<br/>granted to the Council some years back. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this delay is unacceptable to the Rakiraki 
<br/>Town Council and the people of Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask Government to direct FSC to immediately formulate the agreement 
<br/></span><span>that was reached by the Rakiraki Town Council and the FSC some years back, as I have mentioned.  
<br/></span><span>Apart from the Sports Council’s facility in Rakiraki, there is no other ground, that is the only one.  
<br/>We were very successful in our negotiations with Fiji Sugar Corporation at that time and they gave 
<br/>that  ground,  golf  course,  and  there  were  few  tenants  residing  in  that  area.  I  hope  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister will definitely look into this issue. Someone told me that the honourable Minister for Sugar 
<br/>has stopped it, he should worry about sugar, not the grounds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government's  non  funding  for  our  towns  and  city  is  worrying  and 
<br/>growing challenges in our urban areas. While the people of Fiji tighten their belts and suffer, the 
<br/>Coalition Government is unable to focus on what truly matters, that is, the delivery result for the 
<br/>people.  The  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  whenever  I  speak,  he  always  says  swimming  pool, 
<br/>swimming pool, swimming pool.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is where all the money is going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You better go and swim there, then you will know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians were promised before and during Elections for a Municipal Election.  
<br/>The people trusted them at that point in time and voted them that the Municipal Election would be 
<br/>held in the first 100 years or within six months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 100 days or within six months, I ask, where is that promise? In fact, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it was a total lie, and it is also against the Electoral Act 116(4)(c).  I will put that matter 
<br/>to rest. Maybe the honourable Attorney-General can look into that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Sacked one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call on this Government to immediately provide the 
<br/></span><span>necessary funding so that the Rakiraki Town Council can complete these capital projects that I had 
<br/></span><span>mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024              Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1961 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time for this Government to start addressing the real issues affecting 
<br/>the lives of the ordinary Fijians.  Rakiraki Town Council has identified a dumpsite which will be 
<br/>used  by  Tavua  Town  Council  as  well  because  the  municipal  councils  have  common  issues  and 
<br/>problems.  So, they have identified a dumpsite which will be used by Rakiraki Town Council and 
<br/>Tavua Town Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But what they need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because they do not have funds.  They are requesting 
<br/>the Government for funds to carry out the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and therefore I call 
<br/>on  the  Ministry  of  Environment  to  assist  this  small  Council’s  request.    I  believe  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Environment comes under the honourable Prime Minister’s portfolio and I know he will definitely 
<br/>listen to the request of Rakiraki Town Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during our visit, we also went and talked to the market vendors.  
<br/>They do not know the rule and the laws, but they asked us if we can remove the market stall fees and 
<br/>charges to which we said as a Committee, we do not have such powers, it is only the honourable 
<br/>Minister.  I said to them what was right that it is the Government's call and the line Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the Government to consider, based on the high cost of living and the 
<br/></span><span>long spell of drought that the people of Rakiraki has faced, to remove the market stall fees and charges 
<br/></span><span>for a period of time, so that these poor people can be assisted. The people of Fiji are watching and 
<br/>they are tired of waiting, waiting and waiting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate that 
<br/>is  before  the  House.    I  will  provide  my  recommendations,  as  well  as  my  input  to  the  key 
<br/>recommendations as shared by the Chairman of the Committee this afternoon.  Before I do that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to respond to some of the comments that were shared in this august 
<br/>House by the former Minister, honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first is on the Rakiraki Market.  I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he does not read his 
<br/>Budget Book.  If he had read the Budget Book properly, he would know that Rakiraki Town Council 
<br/>has been provided a budget of $342,044 to upgrade the first floor of the Rakiraki Market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next  comment  is  on the municipal elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has the audacity to 
<br/>come and ask this august House about when we are going to have the Local Government Election.  
<br/>In the last Sitting, I was waiting for him to ask me that question, but he was not here.  I presented my 
<br/>response on when the Elections will be held. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other comment is on the dumpsite.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has now been telling this House 
<br/>that they have already identified.  No, they have not identified the site, so he is lying in this House.  
<br/>Both Councils are still trying to locate a dumpsite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The Management is saying here and is written in the Report that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have identified a location.  So, who is telling the truth?  I do not lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, they are still looking for a dumpsite around Tavua 
<br/>and Rakiraki areas.  I was there, they showed me the site, but I still have reservations because some 
<br/>people are still farming around that area.  So, that is something that I want to share in this House, 
<br/>they still have not actually confirmed the site because a lot of review is going to be done before we 
<br/>can give confirmation in this august House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other comment is on the market stall fees.  What we are trying to do now is to move away 
<br/></span><span>from that mentality of giving assistance to Councils, like Rakiraki Town Council.  That is something 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>1962 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report  30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that I have been driving at my Administrators, as well as Executives, and is something that we also 
<br/>want to share with you, the importance of maintaining whatever things that we do, we must make 
<br/>sure that the operations are carried out at a very sustainable way.  I think that is something that you 
<br/>need to understand before a Council suggests this type of ideas in this august House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  thank  the  Committee  for  coming  forward  with  very  good 
<br/>recommendations.    These  are  very  pertinent  and  very  important  for  the  development  of  Rakiraki 
<br/>Town and the surrounding areas, as well as to the committers and those who visit Rakiraki Town.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that has been a recurring issue, Mr. Speaker, is the need to dredge the two 
<br/>Rivers, which is the Penang River and the Nakauvadra River.  That is something that I have also 
<br/>shared in this House in the morning, that we are also having consultations and collaboration with the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways to assist the Council in coming forward with a strategy, not only to address 
<br/>this in a short period of time but, at least, provide a long-term solution on the issue that the people of 
<br/>Rakiraki  are  facing.  The  central  government  to  consider  providing  annual  grants  to  small 
<br/>municipalities like Rakiraki to carry out service delivery.  These are some of the things that we are 
<br/>also trying to do now, to bring back some of the services that used to be provided by the Councils, to 
<br/>assist the Councils in providing the services better to the ratepayers and also the people of Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another very important issue is on the establishment of a growth centre or a satellite town 
<br/>like  Waimicia  in  Nalawa,  Ra.    I  think  this  is  very  important  because  you  are  not  only  trying  to 
<br/>promote  economic  activities  around  that  area  but  also  bringing  services  closer  to  the  people  of 
<br/>Nalawa and also districts that are close to Waimicia as it is quite far for those </span><span>tikina</span><span> in the inland of 
<br/>Ra to come to Rakiraki to do their business as well as shopping.  At the moment, the Ministry is also 
<br/>doing  a feasibility  study on this aspect  and hopefully when we next  come to  Parliament, we will 
<br/>confirm on the progress of the growth centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue is on the FSC ground, as alluded to earlier by honourable Bala, something that 
<br/>we are also in consultation with the with the Minister for Sugar on the possibility of the Council to 
<br/>lease the FSC sports ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we speak there is an event happening on the same ground. The honourable Minister for 
<br/>Fisheries and Forestry was there last Saturday to open the Rakiraki Carnival.  One of the plans of the 
<br/>Council is to upgrade, given the contract and the lease by FSC to upgrade that place to a good sports 
<br/>ground that will be used, not only by Rakiraki as well as surrounding areas and the people of Ra.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the upgrade works on the first level of the Rakiraki Market, in my response in the morning, 
<br/>it is not only that, but there is also an issue of water leaking from the roof when there is a heavy 
<br/>downpour going down to the ground floor that affects those market vendors who sell products at the 
<br/>ground floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is part of the project that the Ministry and the Council will be carrying this out in this 
<br/>current financial year with an allocation of close to $342,000. He also said it correctly, that is also 
<br/>one of the avenues of the Council to create more space for SMEs as well as small businesses be able 
<br/>to operate from. This also adds additional revenue to Rakiraki Town Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  issue  of  road  upgrades  at  Rakiraki,  something  that  we  have  also  been  having 
<br/>consultation with Fiji Roads Authority on the need to have continuous regular upgrades of the road 
<br/>that service town as well as surrounding areas of Rakiraki. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue on the Council, if you go to Rakiraki now, on the coastal side there are more 
<br/></span><span>hotels  coming  up.  This  is  one  area  that  the  Council  hopes  to  explore  and  provide  better  services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024              Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1963 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because  a  lot  of  tourists  are  coming  and  going  to  those  hotels  around  the  coastal  areas  closer  to 
<br/>Rakiraki  Town.  It  is  really  growing  and  booming  right  now,  and  we  also  anticipate  having  more 
<br/>tourists visiting Rakiraki Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  I  must  thank  the  current  administrator  as  well  as  the 
<br/>administrators  for  Rakiraki  Town  Council  and  the  staff  who  have  been  working  tirelessly  in 
<br/>delivering services to the people of Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also work hand in hand with the Council as well as the administrators while 
<br/>looking forward to the Local Government Elections to ensure that the Council continues to provide 
<br/>better services to the people of Rakiraki and also to the people that use Rakiraki Town.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>I support the motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the Review Report of Rakiraki Town 
<br/>Council 2019. Rakiraki is a small town with just over 500 ratepayers and the town is located beside 
<br/>a river and is a flood prone area. On average, Sir, Rakiraki Town gets flooded four times a year and 
<br/>we have heard this from the honourable Minister earlier.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Flooding occurs when there is continuous heavy rain in the Nakauvadra Range and its valley. 
<br/></span><span>During any flood, the Fiji Police control the town, and they close the main entrance and their exit to 
<br/>control movement in the town. Public service transport gets affected during flooding and traffic flow 
<br/>only  resumes  when  flood  water  recedes.  Apart  from  the  main  town  area,  other  nearby  areas  like 
<br/>Naqoro Flats, Qalau Road, Waimari Road, FSC Road, Korotale Road and Rewasa Road also gets 
<br/>flooded.  Sir, you can see the number of people affected and also there are some schools nearby and 
<br/>when it starts raining in the afternoon, teachers have to release the students early so that they can 
<br/>reach home in time. I have experienced that, that as a student and also as a teacher where students 
<br/>have to be released early because of flooding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, while talks in regard to the river realignment is ongoing, the Council has proposed to the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways for regular de-silting and dredging of rivers especially the Nakauvadra and 
<br/>Penang Rivers.  However, this is not happening, Sir, as the machines have not reached Rakiraki.  The 
<br/>Rakiraki Town Council have requested for this for a number of years, and the Council has been told 
<br/>by the Ministry of Waterways to clean the drains and the chamber. The sad thing is, the Ministry of 
<br/>Waterways has stopped giving grants to smaller municipalities to look after drainage as they used to 
<br/>receive before. Sir, I strongly urge the Ministry of Waterways to reinstate the annual grant to maintain 
<br/>the drainage within the municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, to increase revenue for the Council, I suggest the Council should expedite the process of 
<br/>converting the first floor of Rakiraki Market into commercial offices. I request the Government to 
<br/>move its other offices in Rakiraki to the market building in order to help the Council increase its 
<br/>revenue so that it is able to better serve the people of Rakiraki.  Initially when the market was built, 
<br/>the first floor was kept as accommodation for those women who come from afar to sell their produce 
<br/>at the market. Currently, only two to three women are using the accommodation on a weekly basis, 
<br/>especially on Thursdays and Fridays. Since there is a lot of space available on the first floor, this 
<br/>space  can  be  used  to  earn  some  revenue  for  the  Council.  This  space  can  be  rented  out  to  the 
<br/>Government or other businesses or MSMEs to generate additional revenue for the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of dumpsite, a lot of complaints have been received from nearby 
<br/>residents  and  the  management  of  the  Naria  Primary  School.  This  school  is  sitting  just  beside  the 
<br/>dumpsite and the school faces this problem of flies buzzing in the school buildings and the compound 
<br/></span><span>all the time. The school management spends a good amount of money to buy sprays to keep away

<div><span>the  flies.    When  there  is  a  dump  fire,  the  school  buildings  get  covered  with  smoke,  making  it 
<br/>inconvenient for the children and teachers to focus on their work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The school management and the residents have, on numerous occasions, complained about 
<br/>these issues Health Department and a petition was also signed and sent to the District Officer Ra 
<br/>some years ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But nothing was done about it, and instead of relocating the dump, 
<br/>the Tavua Town Council has also started dumping rubbish from Tavua at this site, from last year. I 
<br/>think it is a burden on the taxpayers of Tavua, taking their rubbish all the way to Rakiraki and I am 
<br/>surprised the Minister has just said that the dumpsite has not been identified, but it is clearly written 
<br/>in the Report!    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  clearly  says  that  a  dumpsite  has  been  identified  in  Rabulu  and  I  urge  the 
<br/>authorities to speed up the process and relocate the dump from Naria, so that there is no destruction 
<br/>to the students of Naria school and the residents of the nearby areas can live in a clean environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this, I support the motion before the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  I rise to speak in support of the motion regarding the Rakiraki 
<br/></span><span>Town Council 2019 Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just reflecting on the comments by the other side of 
<br/></span><span>the  Parliament,  by  the  esteemed  honourable  Members,  there  you  can  kind  of  sense  a  bit  of 
<br/>forgetfulness perhaps, or an inability to remember what they were doing in the last 16 years. If you 
<br/>look at all these issues, if we were in Government for 16 years, we would not have these issues. When 
<br/>you  think  about  it,  this  is  a  2019  Report,  so  between  2019  and  2022,  nothing  was  done  and  the 
<br/>honourable Minister has already mentioned that he has started doing all these things within 18 months 
<br/>or maybe 22 months. Well, converting the first floor of the Rakiraki Market Extension, just  as an 
<br/>example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my purpose today, I think the honourable Minister has covered the Report 
<br/>quite comprehensively. So, I thought I should share some thoughts around a couple of things in. One 
<br/>of them I have mentioned before, and that is of course, another sort of gift from the other side of the 
<br/>Parliament, the untimely nature of the Financial Reports in the Town Councils. We talked about Nadi 
<br/>Town Council Report, and that was in 2016. This report here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 2019 and I know 
<br/>for a fact that the honourable Minister is working very hard to try and get everything up to date. That 
<br/>is  fundamental,  when  you  want  to  govern  -  the  timeliness  of  financial  information!  That  is 
<br/>fundamental, and so you know whilst the reports are noted, I am hopeful that by the time we finish 
<br/>this Term, we will actually get a lot of these Reports up to date. So that, we can move forward on a 
<br/>more  timely  basis.  And  everybody  knows  when  we  start  talking  about  history,  it  is  pretty  much 
<br/>valueless. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing I thought to share was, I agree with honourable Bala and also 
<br/>the other honourable Members that have spoken, that Rakiraki has a challenge because it is a small 
<br/>town. Just reading through the statistics, there is only 403 ratepayers in Rakiraki. But the question is, 
<br/>as a Government, are we doing about it? What we are trying to do in this economic diversification 
<br/>exercise is to create more economic activity around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Water  is  talking  about  commercial  agriculture,  they  are  based  in  Ra.  The  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture  is  about  to  do  a  research  centre  in  Caboni  in  Ra,  that  will  significantly 
<br/>activate a lot of economic activity. We are talking at the moment about rehabilitation of cocoa in Ra.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- How will you increase the base? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024              Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1965 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is exactly what I am saying, that will increase the base 
<br/>of the economy. That increases the economic activity in the economy, and the revenue comes in, 
<br/>which they can use in the in Town Council. What the honourable Minister talked about hotels is, 
<br/>there is a hotel at Wananavu being re-built at the moment. On completion, it will be a very highly 
<br/>valued hotel. Again, a lot more activity, a lot more spending in the towns, and a lot more money for 
<br/>the Town Council. So, what this Government is all about, it is not only about lamenting about the 
<br/>number of ratepayers but trying to do something about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought of touching very briefly on another matter.  I know I have 
<br/>raised this before, and I hope that at some point, we can just really revisit this issue on the Report. 
<br/>As I said, whilst I do know that legally we are obliged to  debate every single report, the value of 
<br/>debating  reports  that  are  dated  is  somewhat  in  question.    But  other  than  that,  I  congratulate  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for starting to action the items. The other thing I thought I would just note very 
<br/>quickly, and I am sharing this with some of the honourable Members on the other side of Parliament 
<br/>in terms of the flooding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will tell you about the example from Tailevu at the moment. The honourable Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways decided to restart the Drainage Board.  Mr, Speaker, Sir, it is a significant 
<br/></span><span>change that has happened in Tailevu right now. The effectiveness of the Drainage Board and how it 
<br/></span><span>is actually starting to clear the waterways, I get constant compliments now on the clearing of the 
<br/>waterways.    I  am  sure, the honourable Minister  has  similar plans for Ra. In terms of, again,  as  a 
<br/>Government that is trying to action items and provide solutions, we are doing a lot on this side of the 
<br/>Parliament. I thought I would just end on that note and support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  commend  the  honourable  Committee 
<br/>Members for presenting this report. To start off with, I would like to request the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  &amp;  Medium  Enterprises  &amp; 
<br/>Communications, to be slightly original.16 years, saying it over and over again, is now immune to 
<br/>the ears. Come up with  something original!  I would  say, it is  almost  two years now, start  taking 
<br/>ownership!  It  is  almost  two  years  now!    Always  giving  it  away  to  someone  else  is  not  taking 
<br/>ownership. Be original! If you cannot say anything good, I think it is better to keep quiet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also just a quick one. He said that the Drainage Board is being started and 
<br/>it will make a lot of difference. I schooled in Rakiraki during the 1990s, the Drainage Board was still 
<br/>there, and flooding still occurred. So just shifting the thing from Waterways to Drainage Board, will 
<br/>not change things. Doing work will change things! You have to get the work done! Name change 
<br/>does not make things happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  small  municipalities,  such  as  Rakiraki  Town,  play  an  important  role  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overall operation and health of a society or the communities attached to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the findings in the Report is the occurrence of flooding. A lot has been discussed this 
<br/>morning during the question raise by honourable Niudamu.  A lot of discussions has happened in the 
<br/>last number of years, but the problem still persists. Blaming the previous Government and current 
<br/>Government will not get things done. It is time we take ownership. It is time we look at the plight of 
<br/>the people. It is time we put our foot down and make it happen. Let us get the work going. And the 
<br/>issue needs to be holistically looked at, only the Ministry for Housing and Local Government cannot 
<br/>solve the issue. It has to be holistically looked at. The Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>and Ministry of Sugar, all these Ministries need to work together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to find the cause of siltation to address the issue. Why is it happening? Probably the 
<br/></span><span>agriculture system is not correct, the cultivation methods are not correct, or the forestry methods are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>1966 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report  30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not correct. That is why the silt is getting into the river. We need to address the holistic thing. Stop 
<br/>the siltation from happening and then dredge the rivers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honestly speaking we cannot totally blame the Ministry of Housing. Everyone needs to work 
<br/>together. Every Ministry needs to work together, and it is time that we stop blaming that this side of 
<br/>the Parliament did not do their work or that side of Parliament did not do their work! Get your tools 
<br/>together and start doing the work! Blaming is cheap, doing the work is a hard thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The frequent flooding in Rakiraki, the effects of it is not only to the town. The consequence 
<br/>of flooding is beyond the municipal boundaries. It affects the people. When the town has been flooded 
<br/>it  affects  not  only  the  shop  owners  it  affects  the  market  vendors.  It  affects  the  service  station 
<br/>operators. It affects people who want to go to the hospital on the other side. We need to start looking 
<br/>after our people. We need to do the work. It is affecting people’s lives, and we cannot take it lightly. 
<br/>Every time we raised the issue, oh, these people have not done it for the last 16 years! Fine, they have 
<br/>not done it! But you are not doing anything, so what makes you any different? Get the work done!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Riverbed erosion, I have seen in Rakiraki one of the building’s foundation has been washed 
<br/>away. Those things need to be looked at. That is the safety of the people that is in line. Again 16 
<br/></span><span>years, try to be different. Stop blaming! Get the work done! And being a small municipality, it does 
<br/></span><span>not mean it can be ignored. And I find this Government is ignoring it and he is talking about all the 
<br/>agriculture  projects  that  is  going  to  be  held.  We  need  to  get  commercial  projects  happening  in 
<br/>Rakiraki  so  that  the  economy  improves.  We  need  to  look  commercially!  We  need  to  activate 
<br/>Rakiraki! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And the FSC Mill, yes, correctly pointed out! It is a promise by the Government. Put your 
<br/>money where your mouth is, get the mill going. Stop playing with people’s emotions! Oh! We will 
<br/>rebuild the mill. If it is not possible stand up and say we cannot do it! However, if it is possible, get 
<br/>the work done! Build the mill! Churn the economy!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge everyone in this Parliament, stop blaming each 
<br/>other. Get your tools, get the work done! And 16 years, try to be more creative, Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Cooperatives, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises &amp; Communications!  It is really sore to the ears – the 16 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Firstly, I would like to thank the Chairperson and Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Committee for the compilation of the Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to,  particularly,  touch  on  one  of  the  key  findings  in  the 
<br/>recommendations of the Committee, which is the proposal for a satellite town in Waimicia, Nalawa, 
<br/>Ra.  As development expands and moves away from the town area, the proposal to have a satellite 
<br/>town in Waimicia is welcomed, especially for most of us whose villages are very far from Rakiraki 
<br/>Town.  This is an opportunity for us to have our own little town closer to the districts of Nalawa, 
<br/>Saivou and Nakorotubu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, there is a service station there, there are a few shops there and also an established 
<br/>Police Post, which makes the area very safe.  I think in a few months’ time, there will also be a newly 
<br/>constructed supermarket and a shopping mall in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this time to thank the Chairman, the Special Administrator and staff of 
<br/>Rakiraki Town Council for having the foresight in identifying Waimicia as a proposed satellite town 
<br/></span><span>for Ra.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, that once all the feasibility studies have been conducted and the satellite 
<br/></span><span>town becomes an established commercial area, the Council will think of renaming Rakiraki Town
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1967 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Council to Ra Town Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe a lot has been said in this august House 
<br/>on this Report.  For most of the deliberations, we believe there is work to be done and as we have 
<br/>heard in this Chamber the importance of getting the work done and the implementation of the work 
<br/>by the Council.  Hopefully, from the Committee’s perspective, the eight recommendations from this 
<br/>Report will be taken into consideration and the Ministry of Local Government, which is the arm of 
<br/>the Government, will actually look at how best the implementation has to go through, the monitoring 
<br/>aspect of it, so that at the end of the day, the holistic debate that we did this afternoon will benefit 
<br/>our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank, once again, the Ministry of Local Government for providing a timely response to 
<br/>the  Committee’s  recommendations.    On  that  note,  Sir,  I  do  not  have  any  other  comments  on  the 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
