<h3>ANNEXURE I</h3>
<div><span>ANNEXURE I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reply to Written Question No. 225/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and 
<br/>Waterways (Ref. Page 1943)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATERWAYS 
<br/>(Hon. V.T.T.K. Rayalu) 
<br/></span><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reply to Question No. 225/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have been foundational 
<br/>to the world’s Digital Economy.  One of the most significant advancements in the ICT space that has 
<br/>connected  millions  globally  is  mobile  communication.    Mobile  communication  has  undergone 
<br/>several generational shifts, starting with 1G for voice calls, 2G for voice and SMS, 3G for voice, 
<br/>SMS and basic mobile data, and 4G, which brought high-speed internet and video streaming.  Now, 
<br/>we are amid the next revolution: 5G.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  newest  generation  of  mobile  cellular  technology,  5G,  promises  unprecedented 
<br/>opportunities.    It  offers  ultra-low  latency,  ultra-fast  internet  speeds,  and  the  potential  to  connect 
<br/>millions  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  devices,  among  other  innovations.    The  International 
<br/>Telecommunication Union (ITU) contextualises this in numbers to Mobile Broadband Data rates of 
<br/>up to 10Gbits per second, latency as low as 1ms and a connection density of 1 million devices pe 
<br/>square kilometre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since Commercial deployment, 5G has reached 40 percent of the world population and is in 
<br/>its early stages  of deployment across the Pacific Island Countries (PICs).  High-speed broadband 
<br/>services  like  5G  are  critical  for  enhancing  digital  connectivity  and  empowering  citizens  to  fully 
<br/>participate in the global digital economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  successful  rollout  of  any  advanced  technology  at  the  national  level  requires  careful 
<br/>analysis of needs, scope and resourcing.  This applies to 5G as well.  5G has been rolled out in many 
<br/>developed  countries  globally  and  we  have  seen  some  great  examples  of  how  technology  can  be 
<br/>leveraged to improve the productivity, access and quality of life of citizens.  However, at the same 
<br/>time we have also witnessed poorly managed rollouts which has widened the digital divide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key Initiatives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji boasts one of the strongest telecommunications infrastructures in the Pacific, a position 
<br/>strengthened by the recent introduction of Starlink and the anticipated arrival of Google’s Tabua and 
<br/>Bulikula subsea cables.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  number  of  activities  have  been  undertaken  by  the  Department  of  Communications 
<br/>(Department) under the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, MSMEs and Communications (Ministry) 
<br/>for  the  introduction  of  5G  in  Fiji,  including  the  development  of  a  5G  roadmap  and  the  requisite 
<br/>governance, legal and regulatory framework – including commercial spectrum licensing framework.  
<br/></span><span>This is part of a concerted effort by government, regulator and service providers to properly deploy 
<br/></span><span>5G technology.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has also been significant interest expressed from Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to launch 5G in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After executive and technical discussions between the Ministry, Regulator and the MNOs, 
<br/>the  Ministry  issued  5G  testing  licences,  allowing  operators  to  test  5G  equipment.    This  ensured 
<br/>MNOs could conduct relevant testing and planning for an eventual 5G rollout.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department,  with  the  support  of  the  USAID  Digital  Connectivity  and  Cybersecurity 
<br/>Partnership  (DCCP)  is  developing  a  5G  readiness  and  spectrum  assessment.    A  draft  assessment 
<br/>report has been provided and is currently being finalised in collaboration with the Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst the assessment has been in progress, the Department has been in close collaboration 
<br/>with  the  ITU  –  the  United  Nations  specialised  agency  for  information  and  communication 
<br/>technologies and which sets the global 5G standards.  The ITU has been providing guidance through 
<br/>its extensive knowledge in telecommunications.  Additionally, through Fiji’s active membership in 
<br/>the  Asia  Pacific  Telecommunity  (APT),  the  Department  recently  attended  a  comprehensive  5G 
<br/>implementation  training  programme  hosted  by  the  Malaysian  Government  and  the  Malaysian 
<br/>Communications  and  Media  Commission.    This  training  has  enabled  the  Department  to  build  its 
<br/>capacity and better understand the opportunities for Fiji in implementing 5G, which extends beyond 
<br/>internet  speed  or  gaming  to  various  verticals.  These  verticals  include  sectors  such  as  healthcare, 
<br/>education,  agriculture,  manufacturing  and  many  more.    5G  also  enables  Fixed  Wireless  Access 
<br/>(FWA)  services,  providing  high-speed  fixed-broadband  to  households  and  businesses,  in  areas 
<br/>without traditional fibre infrastructure as access to Fixed-Broadband for people in SIDS is half when 
<br/>compared to the rest of the world.  These verticals together with the widespread availability of reliable 
<br/>internet connectivity will drive innovations and efficiencies, transforming MSMEs, Industries and 
<br/>boosting the Fijian Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Timeline: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  demand  for  cutting-edge  technology  is  significant,  the  Government  is  taking  a 
<br/>pragmatic  approach  to  ensure  the  maximum  positive  impact  on  the  people  and  the  economy.  
<br/>Following the recommendations in the draft assessment report, the Department is working on a few 
<br/>key  activities  before  5G  can  be  made  publicly  available.    These  include  the  formulation  of  a  5G 
<br/>Spectrum Plan and a Spectrum Valuation and Pricing Model.  These activities will be carried out 
<br/>with the assistance of international partners to ensure that 5G is licensed for rollout with the best 
<br/>possible outcome for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final  assessment report is  expected to  be completed this year, with  the recommended 
<br/>activities  set  to  follow.    The  Ministry  aims  to  complete  the  necessary  preparatory  work  and 
<br/>successfully launch 5G no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025.
