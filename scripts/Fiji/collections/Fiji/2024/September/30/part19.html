<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI AIRPORTS 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was tabled on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Airports  is  a  fully  owned  Government 
<br/>Commercial Company that was established on 12th April, 1999.  Fiji Airports has an obligation to 
<br/>deliver the 10 percent return on shareholders fund to Government.  The company has a dual reporting 
<br/>system where it reports to the Minister for  Public Enterprises for its commercial performance and to 
<br/></span><span>the Minister for Civil Aviation on policies relating to the aviation industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airports has the ability to rebound from the setback of successive lockdown during the 
<br/>second  wave  of  pandemic  in  Fiji  which  demonstrates  the  organisation’s  resilience  in  the  face  of 
<br/>extreme challenges ahead.  Fiji Airports might have to complete major runway maintenance works 
<br/>in half the usual time due to the longer working windows caused by the absence of international and 
<br/>domestic flights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  was  informed  of  the  extension  of  the  Nausori  Airport 
<br/></span><span>Runway.  The $60 million project will allow the opportunity for increased flights, on both domestic 
<br/></span><span>and international routes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends Fiji Airports on its commitment to 
<br/>the SDG on the Great Airport Initiative attaining Level 3 Airport Carbon Accreditation in having 
<br/></span><span>their solar farms and the introduction of their electronic vehicles.

<div><span>1978             Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee’s recommendation, the Committee had highlighted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Airports to continue to improve their flights to achieve their strategic objectives and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>maintain business continuity; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>That whilst Fiji Airports is reviewing its Master Plan 2018 – 2043, proper feasibility studies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Nadi and Nausori Airports land sites is to be carried out; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  Fiji  Airports  to  consider  increasing  its  contingency/reserve  fund  to  meet  future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>challenges; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Fiji Airports to work in collaboration with the relevant agencies to produce a cyber-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>security framework as required by ICAO; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>That Fiji Airports maintain and improve the standards that is required for the next level of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accreditation for the Great Airport Initiative; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>That  further  consultation  be  done  between  Fiji  Airports  and  Fiji  Airways  for  Nausori 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airport to be used for more international flights; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>That Fiji Airports explore avenues to make the non-profitable airports more commercially 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>viable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends the support of Fiji Airports for its commitment to the Sustainable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development Goal (SDGs) and anticipate positive outcomes in the forthcoming reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  acknowledges  the  significant  record  and 
<br/>achievement  of  Fiji  Airports  and  the  challenges  posed  by  the  pandemic.  The  recommendations 
<br/>provide the aim to further enhance the strategic objectives, operational resilience and sustainability 
<br/>of Fiji Airports.  By continuing to improve business continuity plans conducting through feasibility 
<br/>studies and creating contingency fund, developing a robust cyber-security framework, at the same 
<br/>time maintain high standards for green initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Airports  can  ensure  its  readiness  in  future  challenges.    Additionally,  fostering 
<br/>collaboration with relevant agencies and exploring financial viability for non-profitable airport will 
<br/>contribute to the overall growth and success of the organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  looks  forward  to  seeing  these  recommendations 
<br/>implemented and the positive impact that they will have on Fiji Airports’ operation and the broader 
<br/>aviation sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also have a list before me now and the order is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable K.K. Lal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  actually  be  quite  brief.    I  want  to  thank  the 
<br/>Committee also for the Report, this Report comes out of 2021.  This would be a Report coming out 
<br/>of, just on the back of COVID.  So, there are a lot of things that may have hindered Fiji Airports’ 
<br/>progress in that particular period prior to 2021.  I understand also that Fiji Airports always had a 
<br/></span><span>master plan and this was a plan that went from 2018 to 2043, but the pandemic had hindered a lot of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1979 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things that Fiji Airports needed to do.  So, I think there is a revised plan that is actually being done 
<br/>or already done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> One of the good things that the Report spelt out, and it shows us the power of having a good 
<br/>organisation, or an institution, is that Fiji Airports actually maintained a contingency fund in that 
<br/>particular time of around $85 million.  This was kept in order to address unexpected events, and that 
<br/>included pandemic.  So, it is a testament to all these institutions that survived right throughout.  There 
<br/>were certain projects that were held back.  I think the Nausori Airport Runway also.  The upgrade of 
<br/>that was approximately $60 million project actually was going to face financial losses due to Fiji 
<br/>Airways halting all its international flights in and around 2022.  The decision to cease the operation 
<br/>was based on commercial viability concerns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is great to see that Fiji Airports is actually compliant and committed to 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goals, and actively tracks its progress in those particular areas.  We have 
<br/>an academy that provides air traffic control training.  Again, this is another place where we need to 
<br/>make sure that we keep them in Fiji rather than losing them to other countries round the region and 
<br/>the  world.    I  see  they  also  are  a  big  champion  in  terms  of  climate  change,  accreditation,  and 
<br/>decarbonisation issues that surround all of that.  Fiji Airways is an active component in all of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they operate 15 airports, which is no small feat.  Their significant focus is 
<br/>on  safety,  maintenance,  data  capture,  et  cetera.    I  also  understand  that  they  have  now  gone  into 
<br/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with respect to improving its monitoring and efficiency.  There 
<br/>always is a need for us to balance our technological advancements with needs of similar island states 
<br/>in the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the recommendations came out, and it said that they would have to consider future 
<br/>developments  with  the  integration  of  our  local  capabilities  with  international  standards.    I  also 
<br/>understand that the Nadi Airport masterplan is under review with respect to future development and 
<br/>tourism-based things.  All of these things can only bode well for an institution that actually hands 
<br/>over a considerable amount of money to the State.  I think on average they have given back about 
<br/>$20 million in terms of profit to the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Airport itself has implemented strict protocols with respect to COVID whilst it was on 
<br/>and I think they continued to monitor all of those things.  One of the other things also is that there is 
<br/>an energy conservation exercise that the Airports Fiji Limited actually went through.  They reduced 
<br/>their bills to quite a considerable less amount that they would have to fork out on a monthly basis.  
<br/>We understand now that Fiji Airways is able to operate its 737 out of Nausori Airport which means 
<br/>better service capabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  one  of  the  most  important  things  is  the  green  initiative  that  was 
<br/>undertaken with plans for a different level of accreditation by 2024.  I think the necessary upgrades 
<br/>that actually need to happen at Fiji Airports Limited is being looked at which is an important issue.  
<br/>The employment contract issue, I think also was changed. The airport has modernised its plans with 
<br/>respect to the arrivals, et cetera. Arrivals area and the overall passenger experience is actually being 
<br/>looked at and with the numbers being bended about by the honourable Minister for Tourism of a 
<br/>million people, we need to ensure that our airport is one of the best in the region, if not in the entire 
<br/>Southern hemisphere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Traffic Management Systems had actually been looked at, the upgrade 
<br/>of all of that, I think one of the other  important things is just as the stuff that we talk about with 
<br/></span><span>CAAF, Fiji Airports are actually leads ICAO meetings in terms of its commitment, et cetera.  So you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>1980 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can see that Fiji is in a different space when it comes in. We looked at it very differently and we are 
<br/>held in very high regard with respect to even Fiji Airports Limited, not just CAAF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  an  energy  perspective,  as  I  said  earlier  on,  we  are  using  less  power,  using  more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>renewable energy, et cetera, and I think it is important that we continue on that same vein. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we must also look at how we can it more profitable. I think there are other issues 
<br/>that some other speakers will talk about, but we must always continuously look at how Fiji Airports 
<br/>Limited can actually be more and more profitable wherein their handing  out bigger checks to the 
<br/>Government. With those few words, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support motion before the House as the 
<br/>Minister  for Public Enterprises. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Mr. Mark Halabe, a 
<br/>member of the Board of Fiji Airports and the CEO of Fiji Airports, Mr. Mesake Nawari. I thank the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for allowing them to come, in fact telling them that we are going to be debating 
<br/>this Report from the Standing Committee on Social Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Koya has mentioned most of the things that I have prepared. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I will not, unlike him in his previous contribution, say I did this, I did that, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the company came into being in 1999 when I was Prime Minister, but it 
<br/>was  not  something  I  did.  We  were  moving  along  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  we  were  going  into 
<br/>corporatisation and then privatisation of various government departments. We were very glad and 
<br/>very  proud  that  what  we  had  formed  then,  it  now  becomes  a  very,  very  important  entity  in  the 
<br/>corporate world in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights that there was a slight loss because of COVID but the 
<br/>entity made a big comeback with a $49 million profit.  I must congratulate them, and I request Mr. 
<br/>Halabe and Mr. Nawari convey our appreciation to the board, the management and the workers in 
<br/>Fiji Airports.  We have heard, as the honourable Koya had mentioned, they have had a corporate plan 
<br/>and they are well on their way into complying with the various things that they have put into that 
<br/>plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will now like to go straight into the recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  that  Fiji  Airports  continue  to  improve  their  plans  to  achieve 
<br/>strategic objectives and maintain business continuity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Master Plan and the carrying out of the plan, the various things they are 
<br/>doing  are  in  line  with  the  recommendations  and  in  fact  they  have  already  been  adopting  the 
<br/>recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In January 2024 (this year), they embarked on the 10-Year Strategic Plan Initiative and the 
<br/>plan is expected to be finalised the month beginning tomorrow. So, they are really moving as they 
<br/>have said in their report to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/>That  Fiji  Airport  is  reviewing  its  master  plan  with  proper  feasibility  studies  for  Nadi  and 
<br/>Nausori Airport landsite to be carried out. It is noted that the plan to initiate feasibility studies for the 
<br/></span><span>land sites for Nadi and Nausori are already in process, in fact Fiji Airports is currently progressing 
<br/></span><span>with engaging a consultant for the development of the Nadi and Nausori landsite masterplan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1981 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/>To  consider  increasing  its  contingency;  reserve  funds  to  meet  future  challenges.  The  Fiji 
<br/>Airport  is  currently  hazardous  of  $85  million  as  contingency  as  recommended.  In  fact,  they  had 
<br/>already been on to that recommendation before the report of May. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Airports  Fiji  to  work  in  collaboration  with  the  relevant  agencies  to 
<br/>produce  a cybersecurity framework as required by ICAO. I am glad to say that honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister is responsible for that area, has been working very closely 
<br/>with Fiji Airports to upgrade our capabilities in policing, cybercrime interference with our operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 5 
<br/>Fiji  Airports  maintained  and  improved  the  standard  that  is  required  for  the  next  level  of 
<br/>accreditation for the Green Airport Initiative. The recommendation is  noted, the airport  had level 
<br/>three Carbon Accreditation by Airport Councils International (ACI) and they are continuing on that 
<br/>programme and hope to achieve Level four, Optimisation Airport Carbon Accreditation as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 6 
<br/></span><span>The Committee further recommends that further consultation be done between Fiji Airport 
<br/></span><span>and  Fiji  Airways  for  Nausori  Airport  to  be  used  for  more  international  flights.  The  Committee 
<br/>recommendation is noted.  Fiji Airport has already put in the infrastructure at the Nausori Airport to 
<br/>support international movement out of Nausori. They are also aware that it is a commercial decision 
<br/>for Fiji Airways regarding any future plans for flying international flights from Nausori. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last recommendation Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that Fiji Airport explore avenues to make non-
<br/>profitable airport more commercially viable. The Committee’s recommendation is noted, and Fiji 
<br/>Airports  is  going  to  be  engaging  a  consultant  this  month  to  develop  a  comprehensive  landside 
<br/>masterplan as I mention for Nausori Airport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I as the honourable Minister responsible for Public Enterprises, I am very 
<br/>proud of what  Fiji  Airport is  doing.  In  closing, I would like to  congratulate Fiji  Airport for their 
<br/>vision and leadership in establishing and improving its services and revamping its airport to world 
<br/>class facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This has been a source of pride for our nation and a clear indication of the potential that lies 
<br/>within our people. I urge all of us to continue to work together to build a brighter future for Fiji, 
<br/>where  opportunities  are  abundant,  and  our  people  can  thrive  in  a  rapidly  changing  world.  The 
<br/>Government is to continue to pursue partnerships and collaborate with international and development 
<br/>partners to improve  Fiji’s aviation  sector and to  further strengthen  Fiji’s  position as the Pacific’s 
<br/>regional aviation hub. I am sure my honourable Deputy Prime Minister and colleague will agree with 
<br/>that and one of his missions is very, very, much committed to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to concludes, again, I thank the Standing Committee, the Chairman and all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those involved. I thank the Board, Management and staff of Fiji Airport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  rise to  discuss  the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/>Affairs presentation on the Fiji Airport 2021 Annual Report. This report provides a comprehensive 
<br/>overview  of  the  operations  and  performance  of  Fiji  Airports,  particularly  in  the  context  of  the 
<br/>challenges faced during the pandemic. However, as we reflect on the past, it is crucial to identify the 
<br/>weaknesses in our current strategies and to look forward to the newly launched Masterplan for 2024 
<br/></span><span>- 2033.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>1982 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the significant weaknesses highlighted in the 2021 Annual Report is 
<br/>the impact of COVID-19 on passenger traffic and revenue. The pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities 
<br/>in our airport operations, leading to a sharp decline in the international travel. This decline not only 
<br/>affected  our  financial  performance,  but  also  highlighted  the  need  for  a  more  resilient  operational 
<br/>framework.  To  address  this,  we  must  prioritise  development  of  contingency  plans  that  can  be 
<br/>activated during future crisis, ensuring that our airports remain operational and capable of meeting 
<br/>the needs of travellers and cargo transporters alike. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we transition to the new Masterplan, it was lost in June 2024, we must 
<br/>acknowledge  the  ambitious  projects  outlined  within  it.    The  plan  includes  18  projects  aimed  at 
<br/>upgrading existing facilities and infrastructure, such as new gates, a domestic terminal, and improved 
<br/>firefighting  services.  While  these  developments  are  commendable,  we  must  ensure  that  they  are 
<br/>implemented efficiently and within the proposed timelines. Delays in project execution could hinder 
<br/>our ability to accommodate future growth in passenger and cargo traffic, which is essential for our 
<br/>goal of becoming the regional leading aviation hub. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another area of concern is  the  implementation  of the Fleet  Replacement 
<br/>Plan which includes the delivery of electric vehicles to Nadi Airport. While this initiative is a step 
<br/></span><span>towards  sustainability,  we  must  ensure  that  the  transition  to  electric  vehicles  is  supported  by  the 
<br/></span><span>adequate charging infrastructure and maintenance facilities. Without these essential components, the 
<br/>effectiveness of the Fleet Replacement Plan may be compromised. Therefore, I urge management to 
<br/>prioritise the establishment of a robust support system for these electric vehicles to maximise their 
<br/>potential benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Masterplan  also  emphasises  the  need  for  improve  communication, 
<br/>navigation  and  surveillance  systems.  While  these  upgrades  are  vital  for  enhancing  operational 
<br/>efficiency  and  safety,  we  must  also  consider  the  training  and  development  of  our  personnel  to 
<br/>effectively  utilise  these  new  technologies.  The  establishment  of  Fiji  Airports  Aviation  Training 
<br/>Academy is a positive step in this direction, but we must ensure that this is adequately funded and 
<br/>equipped to provide comprehensive training programmes for our staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look at the ambitious projects outlined in the Masterplan, such as the 
<br/>construction  of  a  transit  hotel  and  a  commercial  retail  building,  we  must  also  be  mindful  of  the 
<br/>environmental  impact  of  these  developments.  The  inclusion  of  the  Photovoltaic  Solar  Farm  is    a 
<br/>commendable initiative,  but  we must ensure that  all new projects  adhere to  sustainable practices. 
<br/>This  includes  conducting  thorough  environmental  assessment  and  engaging  with  the  local 
<br/>communities to address any concerns they may have regarding the impact of these developments on 
<br/>the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, while the Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report provides valuable 
<br/>insights in their operations, it is essential that we learn from the weaknesses identified and embrace 
<br/>the  opportunities  presented  by  the  new  Masterplan.  By  addressing  the  challenges  of  the  past  and 
<br/>implementing the propose with diligence and foresight, we can position Fiji Airports for a successful 
<br/>and sustainable future. Let us work together to ensure that our airports not only meet the demands of 
<br/>today but are also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committee on Social Affairs, on the Review of Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1983 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Steering Committee in reviewing 
<br/>the Annual Report. As kindly being appreciated Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2021 was a very difficult year for 
<br/>Fiji Airports and indeed Fiji. I commend the Board, the management and staff of Fiji Airports for 
<br/>their dedication and resilience in 2021, despite the risks of COVID-19, Fiji Airports staff worked 
<br/>tirelessly with Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Fiji Airways, Airport Stakeholders and the 
<br/>Tourism  Industry  to  facilitate  repatriation  flights,  medical  evacuations,  essential  cargo  including 
<br/>supplies such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and vaccines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all remember these days Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole world was closing down and we 
<br/>were proud of our aviation people, Fiji Airports and Fiji Airways. During the year, Fiji was working 
<br/>behind the scenes with Fiji Airways, other airlines, airport partners, essential service providers, and 
<br/>ground operators, dealing with international borders whilst most parts of the world was crippled with 
<br/>the pandemic. There is always this belief by the other side of the Parliament that they are the ones 
<br/>who discovered Airports Fiji and Fiji Airways and all that.  No, no, they have been doing very well 
<br/>all these years, before their sorry law came into picture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Microwave, it is microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I could highlight some of the stuff, reopening 
<br/>the international borders in 2021, Fiji Airways reopened its borders at the Nadi International Airport 
<br/>to  travel  partners  from  Australia,  Canada,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  Qatar,  Republic  of  Korea, 
<br/>Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, United Kingdom, USA, and most of the Pacific Islands. This 
<br/>was more than after 600 days of lockdown and made possible with the decisive decision and extensive 
<br/>planning, people were re-employed and our people returned home and reunited with their loved ones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  shows  the  significance  role  of  Fiji  Airports  played  in  the  aviation  sector  and  Fiji’s 
<br/>economy.  I think the honourable Prime Minister just said, during his administration, Fiji Airports 
<br/>was created, so can we not lose sight of that please. That is how it was created. You were fortunate 
<br/>there was this very vibrant organisation that was there during COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  not  the  work  of  FijiFirst  Government,  please,  and  then  the  reaccreditation  of  the 
<br/>Airports Council International (ACI), so Fiji’s now international airport was accredited in both 2020 
<br/>and  2021under  ACI  Health  Accreditation  Programme  for  providing  safe  airport  experience  for 
<br/>travellers. This meant that Nadi International Airport is the first airport in the Pacific region to receive 
<br/>this accreditation is a test of Fiji Airport’s commitment to service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am highlighting this, because it gives us the confidence, as I am the Minister for Tourism. 
<br/>It gives me confidence of the potential for tourism going forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am like the 
<br/>strength  of  the  organisation  here!  The  upgrading  of  the  Air  Traffic  Management  System, 
<br/>commissioning of the new Aurora Air Traffic Management (ATM), honourable Koya was referring 
<br/>to this based in Nadi. The new system integrates, oceanic approach and tower control capabilities 
<br/>and  includes  a  new  traffic  control  simulator  to  train  air  traffic  controllers  in  an  Automatic 
<br/>Dependence Surveillance Broadcast (ADSB).  Today, Fiji uses the latest ADSB technology in the 
<br/>domestic airspace and is the first in the world to transition from procedural cost control to surveillance 
<br/>control without radar experience. This is truly phenomenal and a game changer for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airports attained level three airport carbon accreditation and remains the only airport in 
<br/>the Pacific to  have attained this certification. The EFL bills  were reduced by 70 percent  with  the 
<br/></span><span>Committee noting that Fiji Airports used to pay $0.5 million monthly on electricity bills and has been 
<br/></span><span>reduced  to  approximately  $150,000  a  month.  Fiji  Airports  remain  committed  to  managing

<div><span>environmental impacts, even during the difficult times. Of course, the upgrade to the extension of 
<br/>Nausori International Airport is a $60 million project, ensuring that improvements in safety, and all-
<br/>weather operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  like  any  business  that 
<br/>suffered during the pandemic, Fiji Airports was not spared. Fiji Airports key indicators fell, that is, 
<br/>passenger movements declined by 80 percent and aircraft movement declined by 31 percent. The 
<br/>decline in these two factors resulted in the decline in the total revenue by $24 million with a net loss 
<br/>of $4.3 million in 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has a vision to make Fiji a thriving international 
<br/>gateway, not just for tourists coming in, but for investors and businessmen and women. We want to 
<br/>be an entry point to the region, to the Pacific Islands and a transit point for Australian, New Zealand 
<br/>and  the  US  travellers.  In  this  regard,  the  partnership  with  our  national  airline,  Fiji  Airways  is 
<br/>important, as they carry 70 percent of our visitors and passengers. We want more international flights. 
<br/>In order to make this happen, we need to continuously invest in our airports, both above the average 
<br/>and below, where non-glamorous work takes place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airport, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue keeping its finances and revenue in check in order 
<br/></span><span>to invest back in the core functions and infrastructure. The Fiji Government will provide support in 
<br/>this endeavour. In closing, I once again thank Fiji Airports management and staff for their continued 
<br/>hard work and dedication. I support the Report of this Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to voice my deep concern regarding the 
<br/>operational decision of Fiji Airports and the impacts on the people in the Northern Division and other 
<br/>airports.  It  is  commendable  that  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  has  recommended  that  Fiji 
<br/>Airports  explore  avenues  to  make  non-profitable  airports  more  commercially  viable.  However,  I 
<br/>question the approach being taken and its implication on the livelihoods of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most pressing issues is the steep car park charges imposed under 
<br/>the park and fly option. These additional costs has affected those travelling to our Northern Division 
<br/>and  the  surrounding  islands,  especially  our  families  who  already  face  high  airfare  costs  by  Fiji 
<br/>Airways  or  Fiji  Link.    For  many  Fijians,  these  charges  make  travelling  not  just  inconvenient  but 
<br/>unaffordable. I ask the Government and the Fiji Airports, where is the consideration for our ordinary 
<br/>Fijians? The people who are the backbone of our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the excessive car park charges are not just a financial burden, but a testament 
<br/>to the disconnect between the management decision and the lived realities of our people. For Fijians, 
<br/>from Vanua Levu and our outer islands, every dollar counts. These charges, instead of making travel 
<br/>smoother,  have  created  yet  another  hurdle  for  our  people.  I  urge  the  Government  to  revisit  these 
<br/>charges and find a solution that works for our people and not against them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  also  highlight  the  state  of  our  airports  in  the  Northern  Division, 
<br/>specifically Labasa, Savusavu and not forgetting our Garden Island of Fiji, Taveuni.  Since, the new 
<br/>Government came into power we have yet to see any intangible improvement in the maintenance of 
<br/>infrastructure of these critical facilities. How can you talk about regional development, particularly 
<br/>the Northern Development Programme and the Look North Policy if we continue to ignore the very 
<br/>infrastructure that connects our people and our tourism sector in the Northern Division?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we speak so often about the Northern Development Programme, the Look 
<br/></span><span>North Policy, yet where is the action? Where is the commitment to upgrade and maintain the very 
<br/></span><span>airports that serve as lifelines for our poor people in the Northern Division. If we are serious, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>             Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1985 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, about promoting the development of Vanua Levu and our surrounding islands, then we 
<br/>must prioritise making these airports operationally efficient while maintained an accessible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I thank my kai Savusavu and the </span><span>Turaga na</span><span> Prime Minister for pushing for the National 
<br/>Development Plan (NDP) which will benefit our people of Vanua Levu and the surrounding islands. 
<br/>But honourable Prime Minister, tai Savusavu, all I ask you, and the people ask you and they demand, 
<br/>if you push harder so that we can achieve this before the new Government comes in 2026. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our words must be followed by action. We cannot be repeating the same 
<br/>rhetoric  of  development  for  the  Northern  Division  without  actually  implementing  the  necessary 
<br/>changes. The people of  Labasa, Savusavu  and the surrounding communities deserve better. They 
<br/>deserve airports that reflect the same standards as those in Suva and Nadi. They deserve fair and 
<br/>reasonable carpark charges that do not add to their financial woes. And they deserve a government 
<br/>that listens and acts in their best interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  same  time,  I  urge  the  Government  to  revisit  the  Airport  Plan  for  Nasarawaqa  in 
<br/>Seaqaqa. It is time to change the narrative that they promised, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is time to show 
<br/>their real commitment to the Northern Development Programme, not just words but in action that 
<br/></span><span>transforms the region and uplifts our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe a lot has been done in deliberation of 
<br/>this Fiji Airports Report. There is a lot of constructive and destructive issues we hear this afternoon, 
<br/>and  we  leave  the  onus  on  the  Government  to  actually  implement  the  positive  aspect  path  of  Fiji 
<br/>Airports. On that note, Sir, we thank the Fiji Airport Board, CEO and the team for the well-articulated 
<br/>reports that was presented to the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no further comment on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
