<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - NADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Nadi Town Council Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report for the year 2016 which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the review report of the Nadi 
<br/>Town Council Annual Report for the year 2016. The Nadi Township was established in 1947. The 
<br/>electoral system was introduced in 1967 by Dr. A.H. Sahu Khan, who was the first elected Chairman 
<br/>of the Nadi Township Board.  With the introduction of the Local Government Act in 1972, the Board 
<br/>Chair, the status of the Council was H.M. Lodhia, who became the first Mayor of Nadi Town Council 
<br/>in 1972, and remained Mayor until December 1973.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nadi Town Council being one of the oldest municipalities, and known 
<br/>for actively contributing to the tourism sector in Fiji. The potential for investment has been optimistic 
<br/>and this foreign investment has led to an increase in development and in population as well. The Nadi 
<br/>Town Council is therefore, embarking on a proposal for an extension of its own boundaries to cater 
<br/>for the increasing population, and to continue with the necessary processes of declaring Nadi as a 
<br/>city.

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024               Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1945 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the year 2016 was the year that affected most people in Fiji, and Nadi was 
<br/>no  exception  with  a  widespread  diversification  and  loss  of  life,  all  the  infrastructure  and  the 
<br/>environment. The Committee noted concerns raised by the Council in its key findings, particularly, 
<br/>the constant flooding of Nadi Town. As part of the Committee's recommendation, the Committee 
<br/>had highlighted the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The new design of Prince Charles Park to be in line with international standards so that it 
<br/>can attract international events and tournaments; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Prince Charles Park to be renamed King Charles Park;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Council to work closely with the local Government’s Committee and key stakeholders 
<br/>in the process of extension of its own boundaries to be included in the Nadi Municipality 
<br/>for better service delivery;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry of  Waterways is to  reinstate  annual  grants to maintain  an  open drain  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>manhole within the municipalities; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Council to continue working closely with the general Government and other donor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partners in terms of the Nadi Flood Alleviation Projects; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The Nadi Town Council is to seriously identify a suitable dumpsite for the ratepayers of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadi and to save costs in terms of transportation to Lautoka;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>The reintroduction of Challenges Fund to the municipality to assist in the identifying of 
<br/></span><span>capital  projects,  such  as  a  leisure  park,  multipurpose  court  and  the  development  of 
<br/>Wailoaloa picnic spot;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>All efforts to be made by the Council to collect outstanding rates in terms of house-to-house 
<br/>visits, face to face meeting with ratepayers, Small Claims Tribunal, and the last resort, to 
<br/>take defaulters to court; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)</span><span> </span><span>The Council needs to work closely with all relevant stakeholders to declare Nadi Town a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>city; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)</span><span> </span><span>The Council to replace all the old lollipop metres in the pay and display parking metres to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generate additional revenue for the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, the Committee would like to thank the Ministry of Local Government for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>timely submission in response to the Committee's recommendation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee’s recommendation is aimed to enhance the 
<br/>infrastructure,  Government  and  service  delivery  of  Nadi  by  aligning  Prince  Charles  Park  with 
<br/>international standards and renaming it to King Charles Park. The Council can attract global events 
<br/>and elevate the Town's profile.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Collaborating  with  key  stakeholders  to  extend  the  Town  boundaries  and  improve  service 
<br/>delivery,  reinstating  the  annual  grants  for  drainage  maintenance  and  work  on  the  Nadi  Flood 
<br/>Alleviation  Project,  are  crucial  steps  towards  sustainable  development.  Identifying  a  suitable 
<br/>dumpsite, introducing the Challenge Fund for capital projects and implementing effective strategies 
<br/>to collect outstanding rates will further strengthen the Town's operation efficiency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  declaring  the  Town  as  a  city  and  upgrading  parking  metres  will  generate 
<br/>additional revenue and improve urban management.  The Committee looks forward to the successful 
<br/>implementation  of  these  recommendations  which  will  significantly  contribute  to  the  growth  and 
<br/>prosperity of Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I 
<br/>have  also  got  a  list  of  speakers  that  have  been  sent  by  the  respective  Whips.  There  will  be  three 
<br/></span><span>speakers from the Leader of the Opposition and his designate and there will be none from the G-9 
<br/></span><span>Bloc, and there will be three speakers from the Government as well.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  batting  will  be  led  off  by  honourable  Koya,  followed  by  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Local  Government,  honourable  Hem  Chand,  honourable  Minister  for  Justice,  honourable  Joseph 
<br/>Nand and then it will be rounded off by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member and also the Committee 
<br/>for the Report. I think, Sir, Nadi is a very important part of the whole of Fiji’s tourism industry. It is 
<br/>a Report that needs to be thoroughly discussed and there are some very pertinent issues that have 
<br/>been raised in the Report which need to be highlighted, and I am hoping that the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>is actually listening so they can assist Nadi Town Council in getting things done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest problems that is actually faced by the Nadi Town Council, it 
<br/>has been an ongoing issue for many, many years and apart from the one that we all know about, 
<br/>which is flooding. It is the one that we forget. Every single town or municipal place in Fiji pretty 
<br/>much has its own place where there is refuse collection and the rubbish, et cetera that gets dumped 
<br/>in proper places, Nadi Town does not. It has not done so for many years, and I see within the Report 
<br/>it says that they are actually actively pursuing them to find a place where they can actually build one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must look at this as an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is an opportunity where we can 
<br/></span><span>talk about recycling. We talk about proper refuse being looked after and done properly so that we are 
<br/>not actually harming the environment. But this is an issue that has been at the forefront of literally 
<br/>every government since the 1970s and it still has not been resolved with respect to the rubbish that 
<br/>actually comes out of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will give you a case in points and examples of how bad it used to get and I am hoping that 
<br/>it  is  not  the  case  at  the  moment.  Nadi  Town  also  houses  particular  villages  right  next  to  it. 
<br/>Unfortunately, previously the Councils would never use to pick up rubbish from the villages so it 
<br/>actually used to end up in the river. That kind of stuff should not happen in any city or town that we 
<br/>have. So, I am hoping that these things are actually addressed. It is quite commendable also, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that within the Report, Nadi Town has actually collected 92 percent of its town rates. 
<br/>They only have 8 percent remaining in arrears for that particular year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, it is a growing municipality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You can see with the development that 
<br/>has occurred from the airport right through to Denarau, and it is a different kettle of fish from any 
<br/>other town or city in Fiji.  And I think that needs to be capitalised on, because what happens now, 
<br/>there  is  a  separation.  If  you  look  at  the  road  that  actually  comes  from  the  airport  all  the  way  to 
<br/>Denarau, then you go to the left when you come pass McDonalds and come towards town, there is 
<br/>chalk and cheese difference. We have left the other part that leads into town in complete disarray.  
<br/>So, it is things like that, that the Council needs to look at, the Ministry of Finance also needs to look 
<br/>at, FRA needs to look at, to ensure that we do the right thing, as it is the first point of contact, hoping 
<br/>for a million tourists who actually come through Nadi Airport to move to other parts of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also look forward to the day that Nadi Town becomes a city, and I am 
<br/>sure that is not far off, but if you want to become a city, the necessary infrastructure needs to be right 
<br/>also. I know there are serious problems with respect to sewerage, with respect to water, I know there 
<br/>are serious problems with respect to flooding etcetera which we are about to go into hurricane season 
<br/>and that is something that needs to be accelerated, so that we can actually deal with this problem. 
<br/>Nadi Town residents are very resilient people but at the end of the day, it is the problem that they 
<br/>face on a yearly scale. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  garbage  as  I  said,  is  an  important  issue  that  they  needs  to  be  looked  at. 
<br/></span><span>Sewerage also, it is a growing city and there are many large companies that are actually housed there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024               Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1947 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plus we have a whole lot of tourist workers that are housed there. And it is now, as of a couple of 
<br/>weeks ago, we see it as a destination where you are going to have huge concerts etcetera that will 
<br/>happen and we need to have the necessary services available so that, that particular place can be one 
<br/>of the highlights of being in Fiji. The hospital itself also needs to be upgraded. We need to look at 
<br/>Nadi as we do Suva, as we do Lautoka – it is actually a port, but we do not, we seem to be riding 
<br/>rough short of all of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Flood Alleviation Project, I know the Japanese Government has been 
<br/>very actively involved in it, I am not sure how far its actually progressed, but I am hoping that it is 
<br/>done at a better speed than it is up until now. With the Fiji Roads Authority, honourable Minister for 
<br/>Public Works and Transport, and I hope you will pay more attention to it also, and one of the most 
<br/>important  things  for  tourism  towns  is  to  ensure  the  cleanliness  of  the  town.    I  see  in  today’s 
<br/>newspapers, the Nadi Chamber of Commerce President, reporting about Touters, et cetera, who are 
<br/>harassing tourists.  All of these things need to be addressed. The re-establishment of the Nadi Tourist 
<br/>Police, I am not sure if that still exists, maybe it was a good thing, it is a good thing, maybe that needs 
<br/>to be looked at and I see that the honourable Minister is not here but that is something that needs to 
<br/>be looked at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to the re-naming of Prince Charles Park, now its King Charles Park, there is one 
<br/></span><span>thing that is forgotten, and I hope I am not wrong, Sir, but I am hoping if I am corrected, this names 
<br/>not forgotten within Prince Charles Park, the actual stadium was named A.D. Patel Stadium.  In my 
<br/>travels within and out of Nadi, I have not seen that name, it has actually been removed.  It would not 
<br/>be an honourable thing if we removed the name and did not put the name back on to the Stadium 
<br/>because it is for someone who was part of our history and has done a lot for this particular country 
<br/>and that name should remain on that particular stadium.  I am hoping that they put it back on but I 
<br/>know it was removed and I see the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance looking at me 
<br/>like that.  Please, have a look and check it and I hope that that actually and still remains as A.D. Patel 
<br/>Stadium, as it has been there from many, many years. He is an important part of Fiji’s history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know there are several weaknesses that are within the Council in terms of 
<br/>rate collections, they are facing delays now and also within the staff, but I think with the upcoming 
<br/>project of elections or local elections, that some of the problems that can be solved after the elections, 
<br/>but that is something that needs to be looked at urgently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing is, we must also turn that city or town into a town that is 
<br/>compliant with all the sustainable development goals, as I have said, it sits at the forefront of our 
<br/>tourism industry which earns us the most amount of dollars. We need to make sure that all councils 
<br/>update their policies and procedures, so we are actually lean and mean at the end of the day but we 
<br/>are clean. Traffic is a huge problem  which still has not been resolved. I think also what needs to 
<br/>happen is that in terms of the council and auditing, regular audits and performance evaluations, they 
<br/>really need to happen within Nadi Town Council. I think these are issues that have been raised by 
<br/>the Committee and these are the issues that need to  be at  the  forefront, and I  am  hoping  that the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government will look at Nadi Town in a different light, because it is one of the 
<br/>first ports that anyone sees when they visit Fiji. It is our tourism town, it is our next best city about 
<br/>to become, we look at Namaka, Sir, it is phenomenally good and all of that area, but it is the town 
<br/>area that needs to be seriously looked at.  I support the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  I  grant  you  the  time  to  speak  honourable  Minister,  just  let  me 
<br/>acknowledge honourable Members, those present in the gallery now.  On the right are familiar faces, 
<br/>renowned personalities in our Government  - Mr. Parmesh Chand, Mr. Mesake Nawari, Mr. Mark 
<br/></span><span>Halabe.  I am sorry I have missed out the lady.  On the right are our visitors from abroad, even though 
<br/></span><span>we do not have the factual details of your presence here ladies and gentlemen, but we do acknowledge

<div><span>Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your presence in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  before  the 
<br/>House.  Firstly, I would like to thank the Committee Chairman and its Members for doing a thorough 
<br/>review of the 2016 Nadi Town Council Report.  Even though it is an old Report, it is something that 
<br/>we are trying tell the Ministry to make sure that all the financial accounts and reports are forwarded 
<br/>to the Office of the Auditor-General for audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the past 25 months has been spent in my Ministry by instilling good 
<br/>governance in all the 13 Councils around our country.  The first task that I assigned to the team of 
<br/>new Special Administrators in January this year was to get the Act of the Councils in order and this 
<br/>should be achieved by first bringing all annual reports and accounts in order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  inform  Parliament  that  all  the  13  Councils  have  committed  to 
<br/>completing the pending financials and have their accounts ready for audit by the end of this year.  As 
<br/>of today, approximately 37 accounts have been submitted to the Office of the Auditor-General, whilst 
<br/>50 financials are being prepared and ready for submission to the Office of the Auditor-General.  That 
<br/>is something that I had said earlier, something that is lacking in most of our Municipal Councils, 
<br/></span><span>except for one, which is Rakiraki Town Council is the time they are taking to prepare their financial 
<br/></span><span>accounts as well as get their accounts audited by the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based  on  the  Report  submitted  by  the  Chairman  this  afternoon,  there  are  about  10 
<br/>recommendations, and these are very important in terms of development at the Nadi Town Council 
<br/>as well as Nadi Town in addressing some of the very pertinent features of the Council.  It is a tourist 
<br/>town, and we want to maintain the standard to ensure that we keep Nadi as one of the tourist centres, 
<br/>as also was a tourist town in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  design  of  Prince  Charles  Park,  which  the  Committee  has 
<br/>highlighted the need to re-design the park to ensure that it can attract overseas teams and also up to 
<br/>international standard.  I remember a year ago when there was a trial game done by the Super Rugby 
<br/>where the Drua played against the Rebels.  It was a good turnout, even though it was a trial game.  
<br/>The Council is working on trying to upgrade, uplift and also design the current Prince Charles Park.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also alluded to by the Chairman is the need to also change the name to King Charles Park 
<br/>because of the change in the monarchy. That is something that the Council has also written to the 
<br/>British High Commission as far as protocol is concerned, to give them some confirmation on the 
<br/>changing of Prince Charles Park to King Charles Park.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another very important recommendation is for the Council to work closely with the Local 
<br/>Government Committee and key stakeholders in the process of extension of its town boundary and 
<br/>to be included in the Nadi Municipality for better service delivery. I think that was done in 2018 
<br/>where  the  town  boundary  was  extended,  and  the  Council  must  now  focus  on  providing  adequate 
<br/>services to the newly included area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also worth noting, Mr. Speaker, that any further extension to the boundary will be done 
<br/>after the upcoming Local Government Elections.  The Ministry is committed to ensuring that future 
<br/>expansions serve the best interest of the Council and its residents in enhancing service delivery and 
<br/>ensuring equitable development across Nadi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council to work closely with the Government as well as donor partners in terms of the 
<br/></span><span>Nadi Flood Alleviation Project. I think this is a very important exercise and a very important activity 
<br/></span><span>for Nadi. For so many years now, Nadi has been under water due to flooding caused by heavy rain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024               Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1949 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>downpour.   There is also a plan in place, in collaboration with JICA on further engineering works 
<br/>that need to be done to alleviate the problems Nadi Town is facing, that is from the effects of flooding 
<br/>and even heavy downpour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue is the relocation or identification of a suitable rubbish dump. At the moment 
<br/>there is none for the Nadi area. In July this year, Cabinet has reviewed and endorsed a proposal for a 
<br/>new landfill project in the Western Division. Something we need to seriously reconsider right now 
<br/>because  there  is  a  need  to  have  a  good  wasteland  system  in  place  to  look  after  the  waste  that  is 
<br/>produced by all those municipalities within the Western Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The importance of the re-introduction of the challenge fund, the municipalities to assist with 
<br/>the identification of capital projects such as leisure park, multipurpose court and the development of 
<br/>Wailoaloa picnic spot. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the quality in introducing a challenge fund is one matter that 
<br/>we take very seriously. This fund previously supported the Municipal Councils in delivering capital 
<br/>projects  such  as  leisure  parks,  multipurpose  courts  and  also  some  smaller  sports  like  the  one  at 
<br/>Wailoaloa.  While the challenge fund will not create new processes for personal identification, it will 
<br/>centralize funding allocations, providing a streamlined approach to support these initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry encourages councils to continue submitting their project proposals for the public 
<br/></span><span>sector  investment  project  process  to  ensure  capital  needs  are  met  and  the  requirements,  heavy 
<br/>infrastructure as deemed necessary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another key area that was also highlighted is the need for the Council to review or to relook 
<br/>at the collection strategy to collect outstanding town rates. Town rates is one of the key drivers.  It is 
<br/>one of the very important income drivers for the Council.  It is very important that they have practical 
<br/>as well as a good strategy in place to collect more rates from all the outstanding rates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Various collection methods have been suggested such as house-to-house visits, face-to-face 
<br/>mediums  as  well  as  even  encouraging  wage  earners  who  have  fixed  employment  to  do  direct 
<br/>deduction so that payments are made weekly to the town council and also to avoid arrears.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, those accounts that are hard for the Council to collect or exhausting, 
<br/>they will be exploring legal avenues to try and collect these hardcore arrears. And also, the Ministry 
<br/>has also amended the Local Government Act to help arrears from 11 percent to 5 percent as well as 
<br/>changing the interest methodology from compound interest to simply interest.  This is solely to assist 
<br/>ratepayers who are facing financial hardship to pay up their rates at the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of the Council to work closely with all the relevant stakeholders to declare Nadi 
<br/>Town a city, I think we all aspire for that but before Nadi can be declared a city, there are some 
<br/>important  elements  of  development  that  needs  to  be  complied  with.    That  is  something  that  the 
<br/>Ministry is also exploring with the Council on the way forward for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly on the lollipop metres, something that the Council had just changed recently. They 
<br/>also acquired display parking meters.  If you have been to Nadi Town recently, you will some newly 
<br/>installed digital parking metres.  This is one of the strategies the council has undertaken to try and 
<br/>improve the income stream of the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  collaboration  of  planning  and  unwavering 
<br/>commitment to the people.  Those recommendations highlighted by the Committee highlight some 
<br/>of the critical areas of focus and assure the august House as well as the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/></span><span>will continue to work tirelessly to support Nadi Town Council, and all stakeholders involved. Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, I fully support the motion before the House.
