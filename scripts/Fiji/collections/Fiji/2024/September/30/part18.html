<br/>CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF FIJI 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Civil Aviation 
<br/>Authority of Fiji 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports which was tabled on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 
<br/>2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Civil  Authority  of  Fiji  (CAAF)  is  an 
<br/>independent statutory authority established under the  CAAF Act 1979. The main objective of the 
<br/></span><span>Act is to establish a CAAF with functions related to civil aviation and matter incidental thereto. It 
<br/></span><span>provides for the establishment of a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting 
<br/>the  safety  and  security  of  civil  aviation  in  Fiji,  with  particular  emphasis  on  preventing  aviation 
<br/>accidents as well as incidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the operations learned posed by COVID-19 pandemic, the 
<br/>Civil  Aviation Authority of  Fiji  has implemented several  measures to  comply with  the pandemic 
<br/>related to restriction while ensuring the continuity of its operation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The former Committee had undertaken a site visit to CAAF office and had public consultation 
<br/>with senior CAAF officials.  Furthermore, the Committee noted the concerns raised and identified 
<br/>recommendations to better address its funding. The Committee recommends the establishment of the 
<br/>International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Office for the Pacific Small Island Development 
<br/>State in Nadi and for being awarded the ICAO Council President Certificate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee's recommendation, the Committee has highlighted

<div><span>the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to expedite the Civil Aviation Bill to amalgamate the 
<br/>Civil  Aviation  Act  1976,  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  Act  1979  and  the  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Reform 1999. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to fulfil the current vacant specialised position at the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>earliest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to strengthen its skills framework, policies to enable 
<br/>them to recruit suitable, specialised personnel with suitable positions and benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Government to urgently rectify the three International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
<br/>Aviation  Security  International  Convention  to  better  address  aviation  security  issues 
<br/>namely:  
<br/>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Beijing Convention,  
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Beijing Protocol and the  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Montreal Convention  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to set aside emergency funding to cater for the future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unexpected pandemic such as COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The timely submission of CAAF’s Annual Reports to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  commends  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  for  the 
<br/>measures implemented during the pandemic and acknowledge the other achievements attained. The 
<br/>Committee  anticipates  the  successful  implementation  of  the  recommendations  provided  in  this 
<br/>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate and I have a list with me.  As usual it will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>alternate between the Opposition and the Government. The batting will be led by; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J. Usamate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  the 
<br/>Consolidated Review Report of Civil Aviation of Fiji (CAAF) for the years 2021 and 2022. As we 
<br/>dwell into the findings of this Report, it is crucial to emphasise the recommendations made by the 
<br/>Committee.    These  recommendations  are  not  mere  suggestions,  they  are  vital  steps  towards 
<br/>enhancing  the  operational  effectiveness  and  strategic  direction  of  our  aviation  sector.  While  we 
<br/></span><span>acknowledge the hard work of CAAF, we must also be candid about the short comings that remain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  has  rightly  highlighted  that  while  CAAF  is  dedicated  to 
<br/>supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, there is an urgent need for more substantial action, 
<br/>initiatives  like  the  use  of  remotely  piloted  aircraft  systems  for  medical  supply  deliveries  are 
<br/>commendable.  However,  they  must  not  be  seen  as  isolated  success,  but  as  part  of  a  broader 
<br/>commitment to improving health access and connectivity for all Fijians, particularly in remote areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1969 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  underscores  CAAF’s  role  in  promoting  quality 
<br/>education through safe air transportation. This is a crucial area where we must improve, especially 
<br/>regarding increasing female representation in aviation roles. We must take concrete steps to create 
<br/>pathways for women in our aviation sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  report  also  raises  concern  about  the  sustainability  of  our  aviation  practices.    While 
<br/>Airports  Fiji  Limited  has  plans  for  photovoltaic  solar  initiatives  in  their  master  plan  recently 
<br/>launched, we must push for further enhancements.  I urge them to consider the installation of solar 
<br/>power, pilot activated lights and runway lights are essential for airports and airstrips like Savusavu, 
<br/>Taveuni,  Kadavu  and  Lakeba.    These  initiatives  would  not  only  ensure  safe  operations,  but  also 
<br/>increase  night-time  accessibility  significantly  benefitting  our  remote  communities.  Importantly, 
<br/>while  the  operations  of  these  airports  fall  under  Airports  Fiji  Limited,  it  is  through  CAAF  that 
<br/>approvals and regulations are made. By adopting this enhancement, we can elevate safety standards 
<br/>across our airports and strengthen the overall civil aviation industry in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the operational challenges, the Report indicates while the Job 
<br/>Evaluation  Exercise  (JEE)  has  had  some  positive  outcomes,  competitive  salaries  from  airlines 
<br/></span><span>continue to be a significant issue for staff retention. We cannot ignore this challenge. The JEE has 
<br/></span><span>improved job satisfaction, but unless we address the salary gaps that lure skilled personnel away from 
<br/>CAAF, we will face ongoing staffing shortages that jeopardise our aviation standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report reveals a pressing need to expedite the modernisation 
<br/>of our aviation legislation. The draft Civil Aviation Bill must be prioritised, delays in this area could 
<br/>hinder our compliance with international safety and security standards, putting our aviation sector at 
<br/>risk. We need robust regulations that reflect global best practices and CAAF must lead the charge in 
<br/>this endeavour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  commend  CAAF  for  the  successful  outcome  of  the  Universal 
<br/>Security Audit Programme. This reflects positively on our security measures, however, we must not 
<br/>become complacent. The aviation sector face ever evolving threats and ongoing collaboration with 
<br/>relevant agencies is essential to maintain our security post. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we examine the Corporate Plan for 2021 to 2023, it is clear that CAAF 
<br/>aims to be a model aviation regulator. However, we need to ensure that this vision translates into 
<br/>actionable outcomes. The plan emphasises stakeholder engagement and continuous improvement in 
<br/></span><span>safety  and  security,  yet  these  initiatives  must  be  rigorously  followed  through  to  ensure  tangible 
<br/></span><span>results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also like to reference the Nadi International Airport Master Plan 2024 - 
<br/>2033 which outlines 18 projects aimed at accommodating future growth.  While upgrading facilities 
<br/>is crucial, we must ensure that these plans are integrated with the operational needs highlighted in 
<br/>the Committee's recommendations. For example, the proposed photovoltaic solar initiative and must 
<br/>not only enhance energy efficiency but also align with our commitment to sustainability.  With those 
<br/>words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speak, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committee on Social Affairs Review of the CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, CAAF is making significant strides in addressing the Standing Committee’s 
<br/></span><span>recommendations.  Ongoing  legislative  reviews,  recruitment  drive  efforts,  policy  updates  and 
<br/></span><span>international convention ratifications are enhancing Fiji’s aviation sector. These measures ensures 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that Fiji complies with the International Aviation Standards fostering safety and security within the 
<br/>civil aviation operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  key  legislative  framework  guiding  CAAF  include  the  Civil  Aviation  Act  1976,  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Authority of Fiji Act 1979, Civil Aviation Security Act 1994 and Civil Aviation Reform 
<br/>Act 1999. These laws empower CAAF as Fiji's aviation safety oversight organisation responsible for 
<br/>fulfilling  international  aviation  obligations,  especially  in  line  with  ICAO  standards.    Effective 
<br/>oversight  of  aviation  in  Fiji  strengthens  the  nation's  ability  to  maintain  and  expand  its  flight 
<br/>information region and international air routes.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently Fiji boasts an ICAO audit of 76.3 percent, well above the Asia-
<br/>Pacific region's average of 65.5 percent and the global average of 69.4 percent.  So, we are tracking 
<br/>well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  If I can highlight some of the responses to the recommendations tabled by 
<br/>the Parliamentary Standing Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/>The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to expedite the Civil Aviation Bill to amalgamate the 
<br/></span><span>Civil Aviation Act 1976 and Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Act 1979 and the Civil Aviation 
<br/></span><span>(Reform) 1999.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response from CAAF is this, Mr. Speaker, the Civil Aviation Bill 2024 Draft Three is 
<br/>currently under review by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.  Following this review, the 
<br/>Bill will progress to the Solicitor General's Office for further legal assessment and refinement, and 
<br/>we aim to bring it to Parliament in the first quarter of 2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/>Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to fill the current vacant specialised positions at the earliest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, CAAF has been actively recruiting to fill vacant positions.  Out of the 77 
<br/>established roles within CAAF’s structure, 70 positions have already been successfully filled. The 
<br/>remaining  seven  are  expected  to  be  filled  with  the  next  six  months.  Meanwhile,  to  ensure 
<br/>uninterrupted service delivery, CAAF has contracted overseas consultants. As I have highlighted in 
<br/>this House many times, finding and keeping these highly specialised people is a continuing challenge 
<br/>in aviation, but we have had some measure of success.  As highlighted here in the meantime we use 
<br/>overseas consultants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/>Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji strengthens its Scarce Skills Framework policies to enable 
<br/>them to recruit suitable specialised personnel with suitable positions and benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is CAAF is currently working on enhancing its scarce skills 
<br/>framework  policies.  These  updated  policies  aim  to  attract  and  recruit  specialised  personnel,  by 
<br/>offering suitable positions and competitive benefits. Now, this is a tough call, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as 
<br/>you know, as soon as they are qualified and experienced, our neighbours grab them, so it is quite a 
<br/>challenge.  The improved process are projected to be implemented by the fourth quarter of 2024. We 
<br/>are investing in continuous training and development and leveraging the Pacific Liaison Office by 
<br/>ICAO to help in growing the capacity HR. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span><span>Government to urgently ratify the three ICAO Aviation Security International Conventions, 
<br/></span><span>to better address regional security issues namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1971 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Beijing Convention; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Beijing Protocol; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Montreal Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response, CAAF is advancing the necessary processes for the Government’s ratification of 
<br/>the three ICAO Aviation Security Conventions.  This will enhance Fiji’s ability to address aviation 
<br/>security concerns in line with international standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in short, CAAF is doing very well and is highly respected in the Asia-Pacific 
<br/>Region.    Twice  now,  Fiji  has  been  asked  to  Chair  or  Vice-Chair  of  some  high-profile  aviation 
<br/>conferences.    As  you  know,  I  chaired  the  one  in  Dubai  on  CAAF/3  which  is  the  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Alternative  Fuel,  and  two  weeks  ago  in  Delhi,  I  was  Vice-Chair  on  the  Asia-Pacific  Ministerial 
<br/>Conference.  The Chair was Ram Mohan Naidu, the Minister for Civil Aviation in India, I was the 
<br/>Vice- Chair.  There is a recognition of Fiji’s position in aviation in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  were  fortunate  that  day  at  the  closing,  honourable  Narendra  Modi  came  to  close  the 
<br/>Conference.  Tourism is flourishing.  As highlighted by our honourable Minister for Finance, the 
<br/></span><span>forecast  of  growth  had  been  increased  upwards  to  43.6  percent,  and  being  driven  by  tourism.  
<br/></span><span>Aviation is very critical to tourism.  I assure the House, the Coalition Government is committed to 
<br/>supporting civil aviation by extension, supporting our tourism industry.  I support the findings of the 
<br/>Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  with  respect  to  the 
<br/>motion before the House on the Report of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2021 and 2022.  The 
<br/>Civil  Aviation  Authority  is  a  hugely  critical  component  of  our  nation’s  infrastructure.    The 
<br/>importance of ensuring that Fiji is actually compliant with international standards, particularly those 
<br/>that have been set by ICAO sits at the forefront.  Civil Aviation, we must realise that it is not just the 
<br/>means of transportation, it is actually one of the pillars of our national development.  It is a driver of 
<br/>our tourism industry, it is a lifeline for connecting our communities, and also connecting our global 
<br/>communities. The strength of that sector has actually got far reaching implications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Report is timely, and I think it is important that there are some sections that have already 
<br/>been dealt with.  Honourable Gavoka is correct, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji has moved on in 
<br/>leaps and bounds and done a fantastic job.  I think it is a testament to the actual leadership, and the 
<br/>current CEO also, Mrs. Levestam, who is actually doing a fantastic job with it, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recommendations  that  have  been  given  by  the  Committee  are  there  to  enhance  the 
<br/>effectiveness in the strategic direction of CAAF.  What we must realise, Sir also, is that with civil 
<br/>aviation, we have to continuously look at our compliance with respect to the standards that have been 
<br/>audited by ICAO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Critical elements required by ICAO for Aviation Authority is to achieve compliance is what 
<br/>we need to look at.  I think that also comes out in the Report.  We have had successful audits that 
<br/>have been carried out, as the honourable Minister for Tourism actually spelt out now, we are about 
<br/>70 percent with a tick off.  We must remember that that is great, but the rest of the 30 percent that 
<br/>we have not, we will need to ensure that we do.  It is critical because it is significantly to do with 
<br/>security and concerns identified within the aviation industry that need to be looked at and the positive 
<br/>outcome reflects the effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the successful audit also indicates a healthy position with respect to the security posture 
<br/></span><span>for Fiji and it enhances our reputation in the aviation industry. That is why we continuously get asked 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to chair meetings and honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is now, I think he has done 
<br/>it twice, one which I attended with him, Mr. Speaker, Sir.    So, Fiji has a very, very high place in the 
<br/>space with respect to civil aviation. But we must continue to ensure that we keep that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, to do that also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are recommendations in the Committee's Report 
<br/>which  are  quite  valid.  It  is  important  also  that  we  now  have  an  International  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Organization (ICAO) office, a liaison office based in Nadi which was recently opened, that enhances 
<br/>our Fiji's access to ICAO expertise and it is actually tailored for our regional needs. We also need to 
<br/>ensure that we look at the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) exercise that has happened, we have an 
<br/>issue with respect to staffing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I mentioned earlier on, it's not just one industry. This is another industry where our staff 
<br/>are extremely good. They get headhunted, we lose them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is not good. So, 
<br/>we  need  to  ensure  that  we  are  competitive.  We  need  to  ensure  that  we  do  capacity  building, 
<br/>competitive in terms of salaries, et cetera, all that kind of stuff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  upgrades  need  to  also  be  at  this 
<br/></span><span>particular level, because you are talking about civil aviation. But the most critical component now, 
<br/></span><span>and something that the Office of the Attorney-General, and I know he very short staffed, but this is 
<br/>something that needs to be looked at, is the legislation. It really needs to be brought up to speed and 
<br/>up-to-date, and I think if it requires us to get assistance even from offshore to ensure that we get our 
<br/>legislation  right  with  all  of  the  Acts  that  have  been  spelt  out  by  the  honourable  Minister,  it  is 
<br/>important that we do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think there is a Review of the Civil Aviation Bill. I think three different Acts that are actually 
<br/>being  looked at.  I know  CAAF is  also  working  towards rectifying some ICAO Conventions. Mr, 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I think that also needs to be looked at. What it really does it only enhances our aviation 
<br/>security and compliance with international standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure, but correct me if I am wrong Honourable Minister, the 
<br/>implementation of ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan means that we must invest. We must invest 
<br/>in modernising our Traffic Management Systems, it is critically important that we do so. Otherwise, 
<br/>what it does effectively it then affects our compliance standards, our airspace which we actually do 
<br/>considerably well out of, that also needs to be managed with modern technology. Also, the other 
<br/>thing is we have such great development partners, and these are the areas that we need to look at with 
<br/></span><span>respect to us making sure that we never lose that status, that we have around the world. We must 
<br/></span><span>ensure the highest level of security, safety and efficiency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also, I think we must take our hats off to how CAAF has operated COVID 
<br/>and post-COVID, we have kept ourselves afloat and done a fantastic job, so hats off to all those that 
<br/>are actually part of CAAF. It is imperative that the Government acts urgently to do these things that 
<br/>I have mentioned. There are some gaps in the compliance issues that have been recognised, and the 
<br/>Honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation has recognised those things, and I think it needs 
<br/>to be addressed and I think these increased investments in aviation security and safety. We need to 
<br/>also see if we can allocate more resources to CAAF to ensure that it can actually recruit, train and 
<br/>retain the specialise personnel that the Honourable Minister just spoke about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  said  earlier,  our  Air  Traffic  Management  and  Navigation  Systems 
<br/>ensure safe and efficient management of our airspace using the satellite-based systems and our radar 
<br/></span><span>coverage that we have. But I cannot say this enough, the regulatory framework and the strengthening 
<br/></span><span>of our legislation is required and the amendments that are required with respect to the existing laws 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>

<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1973 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and new legislation has to be done on a very urgent basis. One of the other things that we must realise 
<br/>is that regionally, the region looks up at us and therefore we also have great regional partnerships 
<br/>and we must leverage with ICAO to ensure that these partnership is successful and other aviation 
<br/>bodies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all that is in place, and I am actually confident that we can achieve. It 
<br/>will be fantastic to do so, we can achieve ICAO full compliance as the Report has spelt out, what is 
<br/>needed and what is not. There are other issues that needs to be dealt with, and just on a quick note 
<br/>before I finish off. We have a booming voice on the other side who continues to come out and I think 
<br/>something he said about 16 years, I just want to remind him, and I have a list here and I could go on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Small  and  Medium  Entrepreneurs  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk about 
<br/>civil aviation, between me and the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, we share a 
<br/>passion for civil aviation and tourism because we did spend a bit of time working in that industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But before I go there, I think the other side of the Parliament is getting too sensitive. The 
<br/>reality,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  whilst  they  did  a  lot  of  good  things,  and  you  have  heard  me 
<br/>acknowledge them here for doing the good things, but there are a lot of things they did not do well 
<br/>too. So, there is no need to be so sensitive, the fact is, there are certain things that were not done well, 
<br/>and we are going to fix them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to start off, when honourable Gavoka took over the position of Minister 
<br/>for Tourism and Civil Aviation, two of the great things he did immediately. One, for the first time 
<br/>the board of CAAF has now become a very professional board. It was led by, and I would also like 
<br/>to acknowledge the late Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya, who was the first Chairman of the Civil Aviation 
<br/>Board, this is upper echelon when it comes to Civil Aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In their Government, the Board was not of high-calibre, and we did that because we knew 
<br/></span><span>how serious civil aviation was for Fiji. The second thing we did, and complements to the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister,  we  confirmed  the  acting  appointment  for  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority,  Mrs.  Theresa 
<br/>Levestam. She was acting whilst she was operating from the other side and the honourable Minister 
<br/>within a few months confirmed her as the first woman CEO of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji.  
<br/>Again, someone who is very capable, and so right now, in terms of white board governance, the Civil 
<br/>Aviation stands as a beacon, I think to the Pacific. In terms of the quality of Board, in terms of the 
<br/>quality of CEO and the quality of management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just coming back to the Report that is before us in terms of the 2021-2022 
<br/>Annual Reports. Firstly, I acknowledge the work of the Standing Committee in reviewing the Annual 
<br/>Report. Of course, we do have to commend the Board and management of CAAF for their tireless 
<br/>efforts in progressing the civil aviation sector. As directly pointed out over the COVID pandemic 
<br/>period, which was a challenging period for us all and particularly aviation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The civil aviation sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir does play a critical role in our country which is 
<br/>obvious and the fact that we now have a very high calibre Board and a high calibre CEO talks to how 
<br/>this side of the Parliament views the civil aviation sector and how we will ensure that we continue to 
<br/>support them in the years ahead.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  key  highlights  in  terms  of  the  Report  in  2022,  they  started 
<br/>earning a profit again up to about $5.9 million. Alot of that came from the departure tax, but again a 
<br/>positive development, which means we have an organization that is self-sustaining, that can actually 
<br/>run on its own two feet and can invest into the regulatory body as appropriate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in 2022, CAAF was awarded the International Aviation Organization Council (IAOC) 
<br/>President  Certificate,  acknowledging  the  oversight  in  terms  of  safety.  There  was  a  successful 
<br/>completion of universal security audit. There were no significant concerns identified, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, and something the honourable Minister worked on was the establishment of the International 
<br/>Civil Aviation Organization Pacific Small Developing States Liaison Office which was opened in 
<br/>Nadi  quite  recently.  Again,  this  strengthens  our  position  in  the  Pacific  and  strengthens  our  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Authority in the years ahead.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, like any other organisation there are some key challenges, there is continued 
<br/></span><span>shortages  in  technical  staff,  and  I certainly agree wholeheartedly  with  the Committee that CAAF 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1975 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs to continue to strengthen its scan-skills framework and recruit suitable personnel as required. 
<br/>Also pleased to see they have recently completed their job evaluation exercise. Of course, this is a 
<br/>step closer towards attracting better skilled personnel on attractive packages. I am told that they are 
<br/>advertising for the relevant expertise that we cannot locate locally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  also pleasing  to  note, that CAAF continues  to  invest in  its  capacity 
<br/>building and training for its staff and we support that wholeheartedly in terms of its importance to 
<br/>maintain a high level of safety and security in terms of aviation. In fact, prior to 2022, Fiji had only 
<br/>one  ICAO  certified  auditor but  now CAAF has four certified officers by  ICAO, the international 
<br/>body. Which again, attaches to how this organisation continues to develop and again I would like to 
<br/>congratulate  the  CEO  and  her  management  Board  for  their  contributions  today.    On  that  note,  I 
<br/>support the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.  USAMATE.–  Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank  you for giving me the time to  talk on this 
<br/>particular Report. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Committee for the work that is being 
<br/>done and putting it together on an organisation that has been very critical for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The importance of CAAF is something that we know about, the importance of aviation safety 
<br/></span><span>in  the globalised world that we live in  today,  aviation  is  very important.  And as the Minister for 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation had said during post COVID, tourism was our saving grace and behind 
<br/>that fact, was not only due to that Government but also to the things that we did before they got there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over and above that, I noticed, that when the Minister for Tourism had said that CAAF  is 
<br/>now well respected globally, that did not happen overnight. To get that kind of respect takes time. 
<br/>So, it is not only this Government, but it is the people that were there before, they put in the processes, 
<br/>they put the systems in place and as a result you get the performance that you, and as I have always 
<br/>said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you stand on our shoulders, we did the ground work for you, now you have 
<br/>to fly. So, stop complaining, stop talking about 16 years, get on with the job!  So, great airports and 
<br/>aviation is absolutely critical. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to share my comments about Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya.  He is a person that I 
<br/>have  met  over  time  as  an  aircraft  engineer,  a  quality  management  person,  a  person  that  is  very 
<br/>involved in human resources development also at ATS and CAAF. And I think if you look at some 
<br/>of the things that CAAF has been able to do in terms of processes and so forth, I think it links back 
<br/>to  the  kind  of  people  like  Mr.  Eliki  Kaumaitotoya.  People  who  are  well  versed  with  process 
<br/></span><span>engineering, with quality management, people who are expertise in this area.  I think we have one 
<br/></span><span>sitting here, our industrial engineer, Mr. Mark Halabe, who is also a well-known exponent of fixing 
<br/>systems and processes, so they work well. It comes back to this point that I have said often again, fit 
<br/>for purpose, you have the right people in place they will move the bus in the right direction to get the 
<br/>kind of results that you need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I congratulate CAAF on some of its achievements, this council president certificate, I was 
<br/>reading about it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it shows that they have been successfully implementing the civil 
<br/>aviation organization regulations which is quite good because it has an impact on the recognition of 
<br/>our own Nadi flight information and also with this certification, it gives us some influence with the 
<br/>ICAO. Also, that we have this office in the pacific for the P-SIDS countries that we have here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed that they had a very successful safety audit and one of the things 
<br/>that I wanted to say, one of the good things about organisations like this they do not depend on their 
<br/></span><span>own audit they go for third party audits, so they do not compare themselves with their own standards 
<br/></span><span>but against international standards. If you look at organisations that have done well, this is what they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Consolidated Review Report – 
<br/>CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do,  they  look  at  their  performance,  they  benchmark  against  others  and  they  benchmark  against 
<br/>international standards, that is one of the important reasons why CAAF has been able to do well and 
<br/>other organisations in Fiji can learn from this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, over the past few years we have things like ISO 9000, we have things like ISO 22,000 
<br/>about Food Safety, and so I think this is a general overset of how we can improve performance, this 
<br/>is  something  we  need  to  pick  up  across  Government,  across  our  SOE’s,  across  Government 
<br/>departments,  how  we  benchmark  ourselves  against  the  best  in  the  world.  And  as  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister mentioned, CAAF has now got four ICAO international civil aviation auditors. That is good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has happened now for CAAF, for international organisations they will get CAAF to 
<br/>audit, I think that is a process we can also use in Fiji for other sectors. We get organisations in Fiji to 
<br/>audit other sectors at the international standard and that will help us lift the performance that we need 
<br/>in this country. The challenges that have been faced by the organisation, CAAF faces continuous 
<br/>shortage of skilled and technical specialised workers as they seek opportunities abroad. I also, read 
<br/>the verbatim report and I noticed that even though they had job evaluations, the management said 
<br/>they did not really stem the loss of people.  So, I am thinking that this is something that we really 
<br/></span><span>need to  look  at  in  terms  of how to  make sure we get  the right technical, well, specialised skilled 
<br/></span><span>people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think perhaps it is not something that we can do an organisation by organisation basis, but 
<br/>more on a sector basis. The aviation sector to look at the kinds of needs that we have in place to be 
<br/>able to continue to provide people with specialised skills. One of the things when you have skilled 
<br/>workers  like  this,  you  cannot  learn  it  in  an  institution.    There  is  part  of  it  that  is  learned  in  an 
<br/>institution, the other part is to learn with people in an organisation or know how to do it. If you do 
<br/>not have that, then you are not going to get the development, the kind of people that you need. So, 
<br/>the shortages need to be filled, I think there is an issue here for the appropriateness of our training 
<br/>and development methodologies, not only within that particular sector, but across Government in the 
<br/>Higher Education Commission of Fiji, et cetera, to see how all of these things gel together.  Perhaps 
<br/>the Government will need to look at how we incentivise people that can go into these particular fields, 
<br/>not just at an organisational level but also sectoral.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  mention  there  about  strengthening  the  skills  framework  to  be  able  to  recruit 
<br/>personnel with positions and benefits. I think one of the things that we have talked about in Parliament 
<br/>for some time, we also need to look at how we can attract people from other countries to come here. 
<br/></span><span>We need to have some sort of incentivization scheme because it will take a long time to be able to 
<br/></span><span>develop  internally  the  kind  of  people  that  we  need.  So,  hopefully  the  Ministry  of  Education  and 
<br/>Higher Education Commission will start looking at that, how do we do that incentivisation so we can 
<br/>get people to fill up the skill gaps that we need across the country.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  congratulate  CAAF,  one  of  the  things  that  we  have  in  any  country,  when  you  start 
<br/>looking at your policies and laws, you tend to do it in a sort of a hotchpotch basis; you do something 
<br/>here and you fix it and over time you see you have all these little bits of legislation. I am glad to see 
<br/>that now CAAF is trying put all these into one legislation. This was something that was done in the 
<br/>Ministry of Employment a few years ago. We aligned about five, six, seven different laws to become 
<br/>one Bill and it becomes coherent, and it is in line with what is happening in international practice. 
<br/>One of the challenges I noticed in CAAF, when they started changing their Bills, by the time it went 
<br/>to the Solicitor-General’s Office and came back, ICAO had already changed some extra provisions. 
<br/>So, they were always one step behind. I think in all of these things in making sure that our Bills are 
<br/></span><span>up to-date, we have to also look at the Solicitor-General. We have seven drafters there, how can we 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>             Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1977 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fix that problem so that as entities begin to change their Bills, they are not delayed by the problems 
<br/>that exist in the lack of drafters within the Solicitor-General’s Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is part of the process of making sure that we can continue to 
<br/>improve. Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to thank the Committee and congratulate CAAF for 
<br/>the excellent work that they have done over the years, what they have been able to achieve so far, it 
<br/>has been long way from 1976, from the time that they started and we hope that they continue to do 
<br/>well because they are absolutely critical for this country, not only for tourism but also for the country 
<br/>as a whole. I wish the organisation well and I endorse the recommendations of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S.  VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a lot of deliberation on this issue 
<br/>in this august House  and also on civil aviation for the implementation of our recommendations in 
<br/>moving  forward.    Sir,  the  Committee  wishes  to  thank  CAAF  for  anticipating  and  the  successful 
<br/>implementation of the recommendations provided at an early stage which they are currently working 
<br/>on. On that note, Sir, I have no other comments on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.
