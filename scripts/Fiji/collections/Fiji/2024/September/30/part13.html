<div><span>Plans to Address Flooding in Rakiraki Town 
<br/>(Question No. 217/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Housing  and  Local  Government  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the plans to address flooding in Rakiraki Town? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, flooding in Rakiraki is a persistent problem, 
<br/>primarily caused by its geographical setting and climate. Located in the Naqoro Flat, with a backroad 
<br/>of Nakauvadra Range, Rakiraki is prone to flash floods during periods of heavy rainfall, especially 
<br/>during the wet season and during tropical cyclones. Floodwaters usually affect homes, businesses 
<br/>and agricultural lands causing significant disruptions to livelihoods and the local economy. The low-
<br/>lying  areas  of  Rakiraki  Town  and  nearby  villages  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  these  floods  or 
<br/>flooding events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 27 floods were recorded from 2018 with an average of four floods expected 
<br/>yearly in Rakiraki. That is really a big number. The Town is usually closed due to floods and the 
<br/>main  public  roads  and  businesses  normally  take  two  days  to  three  days  to  clear  and  clean  up. 
<br/>According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  the  Rakiraki  Town  Council  in  2022,  loss  to  businesses  was 
<br/>approximately $200,000 to $300,000. For a small Town, that is a major dent on their livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is anticipated that after any flood, diseases such as leptospirosis, typhoid 
<br/>and dengue can arise due to contaminated water, poor sanitation and the rapid increase of vectors 
<br/>like mosquitoes. In mitigating these risks, the Council has prepared a Disaster Management Policy 
<br/>that  includes  the  Disaster  Management  Operation.  This  is  usually  activated  in  November  and 
<br/>deactivated in April the following year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The processes include areas liable to Town operations, such as awareness and visitation by 
<br/></span><span>the Health Team to all residences and business houses in Town. The purpose of site visit is to raise 
<br/></span><span>awareness on the effects of floods and to remove or reduce mosquito breeding places, proper boiling 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of drinking water and proper WASH processes, which is water, sanitation and hygiene.  The Disaster 
<br/>Management  Operation  is  a  success  for  Rakiraki  Town  as  there  was  no  record  of  leptospirosis, 
<br/>typhoid and dengue in the area since 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  most  critical  strategies  to  address  flooding  in  Rakiraki  is 
<br/>improving the Town’s drainage system. Unfortunately, Rakiraki Town Council or the Ministry of 
<br/>Local Government cannot work alone in resolving this matter. This requires effective inter-agency 
<br/>collaboration, as tackling flooding in a small town such as Rakiraki requires appropriate resources.  
<br/>Flooding worsens by the inability of existing drainage infrastructure to cope with the volume of water 
<br/>during heavy rain. The Council has upgraded most of its stormwater drains and even removed big 
<br/>rocks or boulders to divert the flow of water. This provides immediate relief as it directs water away 
<br/>from the Town more efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dredging of rivers around Rakiraki is crucial. Over time, the 
<br/>build-up of sediment in rivers reduces their capacity to carry water, increasing the risk of overflow. 
<br/>Dredging  involves  removing  the  sediment  to  deepen  the  river  channels  and  allowing  them  to 
<br/>accommodate high water levels during storms with extended periods of rainfall. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the Council has submitted a request to the Ministry of Water ways for dredging of Penang River, as 
<br/></span><span>well as the Nakauvadra River. The Ministry of Waterways has advised they will move the dredging 
<br/></span><span>machines towards Rakiraki once the main rivers are dredged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also important to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Waterways has started desilting 
<br/>farm  drains  near  Rakiraki,  which  will  reduce  the  effect  of  flooding  in  the  future.  We  have  also 
<br/>received confirmation from the Ministry of Waterways, that they will start desilting works of Penang 
<br/>River by December 2024. Another significant effort made by the Council is the development of early 
<br/>warning systems. This is done in preparation with the Ministry of Meteorological Services and the 
<br/>National Disaster Management Office (NDMO). The Council actively notifies residents living in low 
<br/>lying areas when rivers reach dangerous levels. This allows people to take precautionary measures, 
<br/>such as moving to high grounds or securing their homes, as well as other necessary materials before 
<br/>the floodwaters arrive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government and local authorities are focussed on resilient infrastructure 
<br/>development. Future construction projects in Rakiraki are being designed with a focus towards flood 
<br/>resilience. This includes elevating buildings, as well as constructing flood areas or land in strategic 
<br/>areas.    The  structural  changes  aim  to  limit  the  damage  caused  by  floodwaters  and  allow  quick 
<br/>recovery after flood events. Plans are also on the way to retrofit existing infrastructure such as homes 
<br/>and bridges to withstand the impact of floods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally there is an increased focus on community engagement and disaster 
<br/>preparedness. The Council is working closely with the Chamber of Commerce, local communities 
<br/>and ratepayers to improve awareness on flood risks and to develop response plans. Regular trainings 
<br/>and  simulations  are  conducted  to  help  residents  better  understand  evacuation  procedures,  prepare 
<br/>emergency supplies and protect their assets during floods. Reinforcement culture preparedness and 
<br/>resilience, Rakiraki aims to reduce human economic costs of future flooding events.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  a  combination  of  infrastructure  upgrades,  natural  resource 
<br/>management,  early  warning  systems  and  community  preparedness,  Rakiraki  is  taking  significant 
<br/>steps  to  address  the  ongoing  challenge  of  flooding.  These  efforts,  supported  by  Government  and 
<br/>through  partnership,  aim  to  minimise  damage  caused  by  future  floods  and  help  the  community 
<br/>recover more quickly when floods reoccur. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond 
<br/></span><span>to the question.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1923 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  a  detailed 
<br/>response. My question is from a Rakiraki resident. His name is Fazeel, and he has stated the things 
<br/>that the honourable Minister has stated, that dredging has not been done in two years. Branches of 
<br/>all sizes are lying there, overgrown grass, no clean-up campaign. The honourable Minister spoken 
<br/>about the efforts to mitigate this. So, I am asking a simple question, by when? Is there a timeline, is 
<br/>it going to be done next week, next month, next year or after the election? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-    Thank  you,  honourable  Member,  for  asking  a  very  important 
<br/>question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only for Rakiraki, I think for the towns in the Western Division that 
<br/>are prone to flooding. One thing that we have emphasised to the Administrators of the Councils is to 
<br/>start preparing before the wet season or the cyclone season starts. So, what they have done now, they 
<br/>have also got the Council in a small way, they are cleaning and clearing up drains. I have also said 
<br/>in my response, they are also clearing some of the big boulders and rocks that are stuck in some of 
<br/>the major drains to stop the diversion of the flow of water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have also mentioned that the desilting by the Ministry of Waterways was going to happen 
<br/>by December 2024. But the Councils, not only in Rakiraki, they have also gone into clearing the 
<br/>drains as well as other areas that affect the flow of water when floods do happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on average of four floods in a year, I think it is too 
<br/>much  for  a  small  town  like  Rakiraki.  I  know  at  some  stage  there  has  been  some  talks  about  the 
<br/>realignment of the river. My question to the honourable Minister is, how far has these talks have 
<br/>progressed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also one of the ideas and strategies that 
<br/>came up during one of the consultations that I had with the residents, as well as the people around 
<br/>Rakiraki,  the  idea  of  diverting  the  Nakauvadra  River.  I  think  it  is  a  good  idea  but  it  needs  more 
<br/>detailed  planning,  even  something  similar  to  the  works  in  progress  at  the  Nadi  River  where  the 
<br/>engineers  have  also  come  on  board  to  start  coming  up  with  more  economical  and  more  resilient 
<br/>strategies, instead of river diversion we can put some water retention near to the river source so that 
<br/>when water flows downstream, at least there is a minimal flow of water during a heavy down pour 
<br/>during  flooding.  So,  talks  are  ongoing,  and  we  are  also  engaging  with  other  NGOs  to  help  the 
<br/>Ministry come up with a very practical solution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  look  at  dredging,  dredging  alone  is  a  very  expensive  exercise.  If  you  do  dredge 
<br/>annually, you are going to a dry up our resources. So, we need to come up with a very practical, a 
<br/>long-term solution that can not only addresses the issue of flooding in Rakiraki, but also the other 
<br/>towns around our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Honourable  Minister,  one  of  the  major  problems,  not  only  in 
<br/>Rakiraki  Town  is  about  the  development  being  conducted  within  the  municipal  boundaries.  The 
<br/>unfortunate thing is, there is no risk assessment done on pre and during developments and this is one 
<br/>of the major contributing factors. What is the Ministry considering to address this issue?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you honourable Leader of the Opposition for asking that 
<br/>question.  I think it is a very important question. Maybe I will just a good example of a project that I 
<br/>have just issued a stop construction order, that is the development done by Grace Road in Yalalevu, 
<br/>Ba.  I must thank honourable Bala for flagging that to my notice.  These are some of the things in the 
<br/>area of development, some of the very important process like having a good assessment done on EIA 
<br/>report, even during one of the meetings with the Chamber of Commerce in Ba, they also highlighted 
<br/></span><span>some of the places in Ba that have been prone to flooding for more than 40 years.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Ministry does the assessment on the application for any development,  we also take 
<br/>that into consideration - the flow of water, the connectivity of the drains that leads to the major rivers 
<br/>and these are some of the infrastructural challenges that we also take on board especially when the 
<br/>Town and Country Planning and the Council does its assessments.  I think it is very important that 
<br/>all  these  are  done  and  maintained  to  ensure  that  any  developments  done  without  proper  vetting, 
<br/>proper checking of all these infrastructural improvements will lead to more disasters, more problems 
<br/>when we have flooding issues in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for his response.  I will just make a comment before I will come to my question. In terms of 
<br/>river dredging, we have seen past governments doing river dredging, but we have noted that it is not 
<br/>really working in Ra, flood continues. I am asking if the Ministry can consider other options.  I am 
<br/>thankful that the torch is going on in rediverting the Nakauvadra River to follow the Naqoro River. 
<br/>My  question  is  on  the  market  vendors  in  terms  of  flooding,  especially  when  they  come  from  the 
<br/>interior and the coastal areas.  Is the Council looking for a solution to solve their problems during the 
<br/>rainy season because what I have heard is just focusing on big businesses?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one of the challenges faced by the market 
<br/></span><span>vendors with water seeping into the market during a heavy rainfall.  I am also happy to say that this 
<br/></span><span>year,  we  will  be  doing  some  improvements  to  the  adjacent  market  because  there  were  some 
<br/>engineering shortfalls that we had noticed even before flooding.  When there is a heavy downpour, 
<br/>the water seeps down to the ground floor and affects the place where our market vendors are selling 
<br/>at the moment.  But in this financial year, honourable Member, we had allocated close to $300,000 
<br/>to upgrade the roofing as well as the structure that is going to stop the seeping water flowing down 
<br/>to the level where the market vendors are selling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019 a Dutch Disaster Risk Management Report 
<br/>came out  and it clearly stated that there is  a building  in Rakiraki  that is actually  the cause of the 
<br/>trouble.  It also highlighted that dredging is a solution and it suggested that eco-based solutions should 
<br/>be  used  in  the  upper  catchment  area  so  that  siltation  is  less.    How  much  of  that  report  has  been 
<br/>implemented or have you considered eco-based solution as a way of solving the current problem?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the dredging issue is not only focussed 
<br/>on Rakiraki, we are also taking the lead from the work that is required to upgrade and resolve the 
<br/>issue at the Nadi River.  We have also been having consultations amongst the Ministry on the best 
<br/>way forward because even things like dredging, if we do that every year, it is also very costly.  We 
<br/>need  to  come  up  with  ideas  where  we  can  actually  manage  the  flow  of  water  downwards  to  the 
<br/>riverbank or downstream.  That has been one of the things that has also been raised by one of the 
<br/>engineers to do some of these strategies near the river source up the catchment area so that we can 
<br/>maintain or reduce the overflow of water downstream.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Member is still not satisfied with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Waterways used to give a small grant to 
<br/>the small  municipalities to  clear their drains,  et  cetera  and this grant  is  no longer there.  Can the 
<br/>honourable Minister talk to the Ministry of Waterways and have this grant reinstated?  I think it will 
<br/>help the small municipalities (they do not have much revenue there) look after the drains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- They have reinstated the Drainage Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1925 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Now the Drainage Board is not responsible for drains. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is within the town boundaries.  The Drainage Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looks after the drains outside the town boundaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think some of the basic services that used to 
<br/>be carried out by the Council were removed by the previous administration.  This is something that 
<br/>we are trying to bring back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- For repairs in the Councils, if there is an issue regarding their 
<br/>drains, they do not go to the Ministry of Waterways or if there is an issue with streetlights,  they do 
<br/>not  run  to  the  FRA,  they  report  their  complaints  to  the  Councils.    This  is  something  that  we  are 
<br/>reviewing right now and hopefully before the end of this month, something should be confirmed on 
<br/>reverting of some of these basic services to the municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Remember, most of these drainage within the municipalities, they still have 
<br/></span><span>not  been handed over to  the Ministry of Waterways.  They have only  been deemed to  have been 
<br/></span><span>transferred  and  come  under  their  responsibility.    In  that,  there  is  a  breakdown  in  who  will  be 
<br/>responsible for all these drainage. Once we iron that out, then we fully understand where we should 
<br/>be focussing on and who should be the one doing the focussing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- I think it should be given back to the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, like you have in Lautoka.  When there is a deluging and all of a sudden 
<br/>it is flooded, but the Waterways people are not responsible, and the Local Government are not fully 
<br/>responsible as well.  In the meantime, that part of the city is flooded, that is near the Coronation 
<br/>Church, down to Morris Hedstrom (MH).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreign Workers’ Working Conditions in Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 218/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Workplace 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relations Update Parliament on the working conditions of foreign workers in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  All 
<br/>employment related legislations which include the Employment Relations Act 2007 and Health &amp; 
<br/>Safety  at Work Act  1996 apply  equally to  both  foreign  and local  workers, thereby protecting the 
<br/>rights and welfare of all individuals in the workforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  Ministry  is  tasked  to  ensure  that  all  employers  comply  with  the  minimum  standards.  
<br/>Awareness sessions are conducted together with workplace inspections nationwide.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, since 2021, the Ministry has received a total of 165 labour complaints from migrant workers. Of 
<br/>these  cases,  159  have  been  resolved  while  four  are  still  pending  with  the  Employment  Relations 
<br/>Tribunal and two are under investigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst these 165 migrant workers, 46 were employed in the wholesale 
<br/></span><span>and retail industry, 121 in building, construction and civil engineering, nine in the informal sector, 
<br/></span><span>seven in the manufacturing industry and two in the hotel and catering industry.  The Ministry has

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recovered a total of $54,337.34 as arrears of wages for these migrant workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To enhance the welfare of migrant workers working and contributing to the Fijian economy, 
<br/>the Coalition Government is currently undertaking a review of legislation.  This review includes the 
<br/>extension  of  coverage  of  foreign  or  migrant  workers,  particularly  seafarers,  who  are  not  covered 
<br/>under the current legislation.  The Government is also reviewing the Immigration Act to strengthen 
<br/>the work permit process and the development of the Fiji National Labour Mobility Policy Framework 
<br/>and Strategy in collaboration with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government  through my  Ministry is dedicated to  ensuring 
<br/>decent,  sustainable  and  fair  labour  practices  promoting  a  safe,  healthy  and  supportive  work 
<br/>environment for everyone which enhances overall productivity and wellbeing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, this question relates to exactly what you have just 
<br/>spelt out and also to a statement that you made this morning in the news with respect to the standard 
<br/>of workers that are entering the country.  It is relative in terms of the employers being compliant.  
<br/>Are we ensuring that our missions are being used, are we setting in train some kind of standard when 
<br/>we actually bring these workers into our country because we must remember that our workers have 
<br/></span><span>set high standards, and this is why they are in high demand in other countries off-shore.  Are we 
<br/></span><span>actually setting standards and our missions being used to ensure that we get the right people that can 
<br/>cover the standards in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been occasions where we have received 
<br/>complaints from employers that the skills level do not match the certificates that have been forwarded 
<br/>to them by the agents before recruitment and these creates a number of problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, the employers are very unhappy because the skills that they were expecting are 
<br/>not there, not possessed by the worker and then they redeploy them and when they are redeployed, 
<br/>the workers complain about the reduced wages that they are paid.   Some have ended up with the 
<br/>Human Rights Commission that have been referred to us and we are now dealing with the agents to 
<br/>ensure that the certificates that they come with are actually genuine.  Some of these labour-sending 
<br/>countries  actually  have  Government  agencies  that  deal  with  labour  mobility  from  their  country, 
<br/>export of labour and we are encouraging employers to deal directly with those agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently it was in the news that some of our workers 
<br/>were  mistreated and abused.  What sort of support has your Ministry given to those workers, and 
<br/>how will this be addressed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just explained that we receive complaints and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we attend to them immediately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Monitoring and Controlling Schools Fundraising 
<br/>(Question No. 219/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on how the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monitors and controls fundraising in schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just get a clarification from the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member, is this fundraising related to school or any fundraising? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1927 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I am talking about fundraising that is done in school? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- For school purposes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Yes, by the schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Still not clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because as we note that a lot of 
<br/>fundraising  have  been  held  in  schools.    That  is  why  I  wanted  to  ask  and  clarify  whether  the 
<br/>fundraisings are for school activities or for the school or any other purpose? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is about fundraising that is done in school, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the school, for the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the simple answer to that as he might be fully 
<br/>aware that the conduct of fundraising by schools, in schools, for the schools are clearly documented 
<br/>in the School Management Handbook regarding the purpose, approval process and post-fundraising 
<br/>activities.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think my question was not answered.  The reason 
<br/></span><span>why I have raised this question is because it is very important for the Ministry to monitor fundraising, 
<br/>which is done by schools, so that the parents and students are not forced to raise funds, or they are 
<br/>not levied.  That is the very reason why I asked that question. My supplementary question is, are 
<br/>there any limitations on the number of fundraising that schools can do in one year?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that not covered in the Handbook, honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It is there, Sir.  He is fully aware, but I will just read it out for 
<br/>the benefit of the honourable Members of this House.  Fundraising is only permitted for very special 
<br/>circumstances as per Ministry's regulation, and only one fundraising per school per year is allowed 
<br/>in the school premises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  are  you  aware  of  any  incidents  where  school 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fundraising is being done to supplement teachers’ wages?  Carefully answer that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just ask the honourable Member to clarify 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which particular year is he referring to? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This year, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Sir, for the year 2024, 83 schools from the 916 schools  - 178 
<br/>secondary  and  738  primary,  within  the  nine  education  districts,  have  been  granted  approval  to 
<br/>organise fundraising.  The purpose of fundraising is for:

<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to present A case study before I can present 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question to the honourable Minister. There is a school in Lautoka in the Western Division….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, this is question time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Sir, I will come back to the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you go straight to your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>is,  is  the  Ministry  aware  that  these  fundraising  activities  are  placing  additional  financial  and 
<br/>emotional pressure on parents and students, especially in rural and low income communities? What 
<br/>steps will the Ministry take to ensure that no child or parent is put in such a position in future?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  enlighten  this  House,  again,  on  the 
<br/>process of request for fundraising and, hopefully, will be able to answer his question.  The request to 
<br/>conduct  fundraising  is  on  voluntary  basis  or  scenario,  and  fundraising  must  be  approved  and  co-
<br/>signed by the Head of School and the school manager, and this is directed to the Divisional Education 
<br/>Office, who verifies the requests before sending them to the Ministry of Education Head Office for 
<br/>the approval.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The documentation to request fundraising, Mr. Speaker, should include the objective of the 
<br/>fundraising,  the  project  for  which  the  funds  are  being  raised  and  the  projected  amount,  and  an 
<br/>explanation as to why the Free Education Grant is unable to accommodate the project, the date of the 
<br/>proposed  fundraising,  the  safety  and  medical  provisions  on  site,  the  type  of  fundraising  and 
<br/>confirmation that any fundraising will be on a voluntary basis or voluntary contributions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Minister is aware and the 
<br/></span><span>whole of Fiji is, in fact, aware, that grants have not been given to the schools in a timely manner.  
<br/>Government says, “</span><span>paisa nahi hai</span><span>”, and fundraising has been used now to basically be a form of 
<br/>income for the schools. Students who cannot contribute to the fundraising, there has been cases of 
<br/>teachers neglecting them and they feel left out.  My question is, how is the Ministry addressing that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Sir, I would like to invite the honourable Member, if he is free, 
<br/>to come and visit our office to shed some light.  As I have said in the last point that I had raised, the 
<br/>confirmation of any fundraising will be on voluntary basis, so that should answer your question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I think the honourable Minister is not aware, 
<br/>but there is a circular given to one of these primary schools and it says, “Each family will be given a 
<br/>$2 a vote card to raise funds for the school.  After completing each card, the family can volunteer for 
<br/>more cards from the office”. I can pass this to the honourable Minister, Sir, but maybe he could get 
<br/></span><span>his facts correct as well.

<div><span>Update on the Northern Development Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 220/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small  and Medium  Enterprises  and Communications update Parliament on the 
<br/>Northern Development Programme and its impact on stimulating economic activities in 
<br/>Vanua Levu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Northern Development Programme 
<br/>(NDP)  is  probably  one  of  the  most  successful  programmes  that  was  launched  by  the  previous 
<br/>Government, and we are continuing it.  Since its inception, there has been an investment of over $13 
<br/></span><span>million since 2008, covering 2,755 business ventures across sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, 
<br/></span><span>forestry, tourism and the manufacturing sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, it focusses on the North, Sir, but one of the things is that the grant is unique because 
<br/>it actually provides for a 45 percent loan funding on the grant - allows for a loan grant of 45 percent 
<br/>and 10 percent contribution from the applicant.  Perhaps, the reason why it is so successful is because 
<br/>similar to the Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRPP) grant, because of the 
<br/>accountability and the contributions made by the recipient, it seems to have gained a lot of attraction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most influential lending partners has been the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), Sir, 
<br/>and which has allowed contributions to the North over the last three years.  In fact, we have invested 
<br/>about $1.5 million in grants and securing loans of about $2.4 million.  We see the value in supporting 
<br/>MSMEs in the North, and let me just to share some interesting facts, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on recent visitations, there is about 95 percent success rate recorded in the NDP.  Our 
<br/>Monitoring and Evaluation tells us that every MSME we support in the Programme creates about 
<br/>three jobs.  Essentially, our investment, if you look at it in total since 2008, has created up to 8,200 
<br/>jobs  and  contributing  to  about  39,000  livelihoods.    On  average,  one  recipient  can  earn  close  to 
<br/>$13,000, which varies by sector, and we have also noted the shift from informal business ventures to 
<br/>a more formalised compliant  entrepreneurial  real ventures  in  agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing 
<br/>and tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to share one successful story from the grants and this is the case of Ms. 
<br/>Meena  Gounder,  who  started  with  only  100  layer  birds  with  the  assistance  of  NDP  and  has  now 
<br/>grown her business to be one of the key suppliers of eggs in the North.  Of course, her example has 
<br/>broken all gender stereotypes, triumphing the course for women but business in general. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you can see, Sir, the grant, at this point, I think certainly from the Government side with 
<br/>the renewed resurgence, I think economically in the North, this grant is actually proving more and 
<br/>more popular and more and more sustainable.  It is no secret that Damodar investment in the North 
<br/>is close to completion, there is also Parmod Enterprises, Vinod Patel and Namena Plantations, that 
<br/>are investing in the North.  In our estimation, there are about eight investments,  earning about $44.5 
<br/></span><span>million that are under construction at the moment in the </span><span>Vualiku</span><span> and,  of course, there is the much 
<br/></span><span>anticipated opening of the Ramada Encore by  Wyndham,  which is  significant  because it actually

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>signals the first branded property in the North, which will actually mean, as the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Tourism and Civil Aviation knows, when  the Sofitel was launched, it created a momentum of 
<br/>branded resorts as a catalyst in those areas, and we are expecting similar momentum in the North, 
<br/>Sir.  In fact, there is already one big name sniffing around in Taveuni as we speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the Grand Eastern Hotel too is expanding, which is positive.  In the North, at the 
<br/>moment, at concept stage, there is about $142 million worth of investment that is, sort of, already in 
<br/>the  pipeline  and  this  covers  real  estate,  tourism,  construction  and  commercial  buildings.  So,  in  a 
<br/>nutshell, the grant, as I have mentioned, has been quite positive in its contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  continues  to  exhaust  all  funding  that  is  allocated  to  this  grant,  and  we  will 
<br/>continue  to  seek  more  as  we  move  along.  But,  overall,  Sir,  as  you  can  see,  not  only  is  the  grant 
<br/>popular but from this side of the House, the North is starting to boom, and we will see significant 
<br/>growth in the next three to four years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in answer to the North booming, do not forget the West 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>started it all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that the NDP is so successful and, especially, there 
<br/></span><span>is a lot that can be done with respect to agriculture, are we doing the handle-hold exercise with respect 
<br/>to exports to the markets that we know we can supply to?  I know for a fact that a lot of pathways 
<br/>that were opened with  Biosecurity Authority of Fiji  (BAF), we still have not  utilised.  So, are we 
<br/>getting new people to do these things in the North because they seem to be a lot harder working than 
<br/>some of the other ones in the mainland?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Member is aware, we 
<br/>do teams that do assist in terms of facilitation of pathways for export, and that still continues.  At the 
<br/>moment, there is a bit of a focus on the kava industry for the obvious reasons that I have mentioned 
<br/>in this Parliament.  In fact, what I can see is, with a growing economy, there will be demand for more 
<br/>manpower in terms of supporting some of these initiatives and that is something, I guess, we will 
<br/>have to cross at the next Budget. But, yes, the support that we continue to give to kava and other 
<br/>agricultural  products  continues,  and  that  is  also  overlaid  by  business  training  and  other  types  of 
<br/>training that is required, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to see that the NDP is moving forward. Thank 
<br/>you, honourable Prime Minister and honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  Can you clarify how the 
<br/>NDP  has  addressed  infrastructure  and  logistical  issues  that  could  potentially  hinder  economic 
<br/>activities and also noting the high fares of Fiji Airways? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Lal makes a very good 
<br/>point. In my view and certainly the view of this side of Parliament, the North is the next economic 
<br/>frontier of Fiji.  And you will have seen something that was initiated by the previous government 
<br/>which was the World Bank funding of US$200 million.  What will happen, Sir, is that a lot of that 
<br/>funding will go towards infrastructure and actually assist the concerns of honourable Lal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has negotiated with China on some additional roading.  At 
<br/>the  moment,  I  am  in  deep  discussion  with  a  certain  potential  hydro  operator,  Sir,  in  Taveuni,  to 
<br/>electrify Taveuni fully on hydro and then maybe, look at supplying Vanua Levu. So, these are the 
<br/>type of exciting opportunities, Sir, that exist and if we set the right base, Vanua Levu can be as big 
<br/>as Viti Levu in terms of economy and land size and, obviously, the quality of the food and fish is 
<br/></span><span>second  to  none.    To  answer  honourable  Lal’s  question,  yes,  the  Government  is  focussing  on 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure because as we all know, without infrastructure economic development is futile.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1931 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister,  the infrastructure,  I think, is a 
<br/>good answer, so thank you.  But in terms of making sure that all of the businesses in the North, are 
<br/>they also being assisted in terms of digital enhancement and upgrading so that they can be the next 
<br/>supplier of what we need around the world?  I know that necessary digital infrastructure have been 
<br/>set up but are they also getting the training to make sure that they are digitally-savvy?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will put that in the work-in-progress 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>category.  Firstly, at the moment, as you may be aware, Telecom Fiji Limited is building fibre from 
<br/>Seaqaqa down to Savusavu and then eventually from Seaqaqa to Nabouwalu so that will open up 
<br/>the ability to communicate in terms of digitally. That is one priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is always challenges with digitisation in the North, so there is still a bit of hand holding 
<br/>at the moment that happens from our Ministry in terms of request, but hopefully over time, once the 
<br/>infrastructure gets built, Starlink is now starting to get available as well Sir.  These are tools that 
<br/>might help with the digitisation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  two main  contributing 
<br/>factors  to  the  success  of  the  Northern  Development  Programme  are  training  and  monitoring  and 
<br/></span><span>evaluation, because applicants undergo eight days basic training, monitored, and then they do another 
<br/></span><span>package, considering the growth to take them to the next level. So, how is this being considered in 
<br/>the Ministry particularly with the other SMEs that you are doing?  How effective is your training and 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation so that the success from the Northern Division can also be replicated in 
<br/>other divisions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  The  recent  statistics  that  I  have  seen  shows  that  the 
<br/>effectiveness is not too bad and by that, I think from recollection the success rate was around 83  to 
<br/>85 percent in a nationwide polling, but Vanua Levu seems to be high. We have quite an extensive 
<br/>Monitoring and Evaluation team that does work on the ground to monitor closely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we also do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which I think helps with these projects, 
<br/>is  that  there  is  a  lot  of  initial  training  before  even  a  grant  or  assistance  is  brought  into  play.  For 
<br/>example, there is a desire to form a co-operative, there is a series of trainings that happens before, 
<br/>and  that  is  done  specifically  to  ensure  that  when  the  grant  funding  comes,  that  there  is  an 
<br/>understanding of what it means.  In a broad sense, Sir, the funding is quite effective and we will just 
<br/>continue to monitor it to ensure that we continue to get the best results from the money that is coming 
<br/>from our taxpayers.

<div><span>Reduction of Soil Erosion and Coral Reef Rehabilitation 
<br/>(Question No. 221/2024)

<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament if the 
<br/>initiative to replant trees on riverbanks to reduce soil erosion and use mangroves aimed 
<br/>at contributing to coral reef rehabilitation, is still being pursued? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.-  I can confirm  that  these initiatives are, indeed, still being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pursued by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  One  of  the 
<br/></span><span>initiatives  that  we  used  to  carry  out  is  litter  collection  around  urban  areas,  we  use  to  hold  it  on 
<br/></span><span>Wednesday afternoons at 2 o’clock which used to be physical training also for Ministry of Fisheries

<br/>honourable Minister if that is something that he plans to do in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  the  Ministry  is  undertaking  a 
<br/>programme to assist in addressing a question that was raised by the honourable Member, we will 
<br/>make time to allow for that initiative to be integrated with the current programme that the Ministry 
<br/>is undertaking now.

<div><span>Pathways to Pursue Rugby as a Career 
<br/>(Question No. 222/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports update Parliament if there are 
<br/>pathways  in  place  for  students  who  wish  to  pursue  rugby  as  a  career  after  having 
<br/>participated in the Fiji Secondary Schools Rugby Deans Competition? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  before  I  answer  that  question,  allow  me  to 
<br/></span><span>congratulate  the  Fiji  School  Boys  under  18  that  made  history  in  the  weekend  by  defeating  the 
<br/>Australian Schoolboys by 26 points to 14. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank Professor Broughton, 
<br/>who is in the public gallery with Mr. Rajesh Singh this morning and Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Ltd 
<br/>for putting together Fiji's bid for the NRL franchise.  Last but not the least, I congratulate all our 
<br/>weightlifters who participated in the recent 2024 Commonwealth Championship here at home. They 
<br/>made us all proud and we wish you well in your future endeavours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reference  to  the  question  raised  by  the  honourable  Member,  I  wish  to 
<br/>highlight  that  there  are  a  few  pathways  in  place  that  allows  or  gives  opportunities  for  secondary 
<br/>school players. The most prominent pathway is through the Fijian Drua set up. Due to its elite nature 
<br/>as a franchise team. The pathways into Drua involves the following path: Drua under 16 Academy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year in August, the Fiji Rugby High Performance Unit established under 
<br/>16 Boys Academy. There are 30 spots for Drua Under 16 Academy with all players selected from 
<br/>the  Dean's  competition  from  all  over  Fiji  through  talent  identification,  talent  taking  and  talent 
<br/>processing. There is also a $2000 support allowance per annum for each player. In this structure, 
<br/>players will go through a two-year processing phase where the best at the age of 18 years, will then 
<br/>be  chosen  to  be  part  of  the  Drua  Development  Programme  with  a  starting  salary  of  $10,000  to 
<br/>$15,000  per  annum.    Progressing  from  the  Drua  Development  Programme  will  be  the  players 
<br/>selection into the Drua professional contract, starts at a base salary of $40,000 per annum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High Performance Unit  Academy  for men and  women. Mr. Speaker, the Fiji  Rugby High 
<br/>Performance  Unit  Academy  for  men  and  women  players  also  select  players  from  the  provincial 
<br/>competition with ages ranging from 17 years to 23 years. Most of the selections for these cohorts are 
<br/>from the schools throughout the competition using our long-term athlete development plan.  Under 
<br/>this plan, there are 60 contracted players for men and 30 contracted sports for women. The players 
<br/>selected  from  schools  under  these  programmes  Under  16  academy  and  the  LTADP  have 
<br/>opportunities to progress further into men’s Fiji Under 20, Fiji Warriors, Fiji Men’s Sevens Team, 
<br/>Fijian Drua and the Flying Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For women they have the opportunity to progress further to the Fijiana 7s, Fijiana 15s and the 
<br/></span><span>Fijiana Drua. This pathway model has been a successful factor in the establishment of the Fijiana 
<br/></span><span>Drua Programme in 2021 with 80 percent of players in the initial Drua setup coming through the

<div><span>pathway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Flying Fijians Rugby World Cup Team of 2023 had 60 percent of players that have come 
<br/>through  the  school’s  pathway.  Overseas  Schools  Scholarships,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  above  setup  or 
<br/>pathway in the Fiji Rugby System also focusses on lead talents from our domestic schools. It does 
<br/>not restrict or control the best talents in all schools being offered rugby scholarships in New Zealand, 
<br/>Australia  and  Japan.  Some  of  our  best  talented  players  through  secondary  schools  that  go  across 
<br/>progressed  further  to  universities  and  to  the  different  franchises  of  the  countries  that  offer 
<br/>scholarships of this nature.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same concepts apply for players from schools that offer academy contracts with premier 
<br/>clubs  all  over  the  world.  The  same  process  for  professional  franchise  applies.  Semi-professional 
<br/>pathways,  Mr.  Speaker,  under  the  semi-professional  pathways,  school  players  are  offered 
<br/>engagements with clubs, mainly in Australia and New Zealand where they are playing part-time with 
<br/>work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the above are the current pathways for secondary school students 
<br/>looking to  use rugby as  a career opportunity.  However,  further to  the above, a review of the  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>National Sports Commission is approved by Cabinet earlier this year will be conducted soon. This 
<br/></span><span>review will ensure that  a clear sports development  pathway is established for  all sports, not  only 
<br/>rugby,  in  the  country  and  more  importantly  the  establishment  of  the  Fiji  Institute  of  Sports  to 
<br/>coordinate such developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response 
<br/>talking about development in Fiji. One of the key problems is perhaps the governance. Milo Kaji has 
<br/>its own organisation. Fiji Secondary School Rugby Union has its own organisation, and Fiji Rugby 
<br/>Union, there is no connection.  This is something that hinders development in the country for rugby. 
<br/>What is the Ministry considering together with the stakeholders in order to sort out this issue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for 
<br/>pointing that out, that is something that we have noted and that is why we are doing a review of the 
<br/>Fiji  National  Sports Commission  to  try  and line-up  all  the  structures  that  we  currently  have  with 
<br/>rugby being sort of distributed and not focussing as one effort.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that you will accept this question because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister talked about Fiji Rugby League and he raised the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- New question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- No, no, he mentioned it in his response so this is why I am asking 
<br/>this question. There are a lot of issues, Sir, concerning Kaiviti Silktails. There is money given by the 
<br/>Australian Government to developing rugby league in Fiji, but it has been alleged that this funding 
<br/>has  been  abused  or  misused.    What  is  the  Ministry's  plans  on  looking  at  this  so  that  it  can  work 
<br/>together with the Fiji Rugby League?  So, that it can also develop the sports Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Thank you honourable Leader of the Opposition for highlighting that.  
<br/>At the moment the Fiji Government has supported NRL for its bid for the NRL franchise, which I 
<br/>have mentioned in my speech, it has been documented by the Broughton and we are so thankful that 
<br/>they have done that. It  will create pathways for our local talents to be showcased overseas in the 
<br/>international arena, something that Fiji will need.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, for your question regarding Kaiviti Silktails, it is something that is beyond our hands. It 
<br/>is  something  that  Mr. Petero  Civoniceva  approached  the  NRL,  and  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  our 
<br/>Government but we are our trying our best to talk to both parties on how they can work together Fiji 
<br/>NRL and Kaiviti Silktails because they are looking after the same course and talents we have locally, 
<br/>and how they can channel that to be showcased at the international level. I thank you for your note 
<br/>on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  be  a  Member  of  Parliament,  to  be  behind  a 
<br/>uniform  or  to  play,  to  wear  the  national  jersey,  it  is  a  matter  of  national  pride.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>currently the youth have reached out to me, youth that play rugby who aspire to play for the Fiji team 
<br/>have spoken about what has been happening with FRU and the honourable Minister for Youth and 
<br/>Sports has not said anything much about it as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youths are discouraged to see what is happening with FRU in terms of 
<br/>the payments and the allegations that have come up. What is the Ministry doing to mitigate this sense 
<br/>of discouragement among the youths in order for them to actually have national pride and play for 
<br/>the country?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 29th June, there was a  Special General Meeting. 
<br/></span><span>The Fiji Rugby Union has removed the Prime Minister's nominee from the Board of Trustees of Fiji 
<br/>Rugby Union. At the moment, the Government  does not have a say in  running of the Fiji Rugby 
<br/>Union, but we believe that with the trustees that are in place, a current board of trustees, which was 
<br/>appointed by our government, are doing their work. They are professional people. They will be able 
<br/>to work out something for the future of rugby in Fiji. And on top of that, the AGM is already planned 
<br/>for November, where unions can voice their concerns, members of the Fiji Rugby Union can voice 
<br/>concerns at the Annual General Meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  I  tend  to  agree  with  what  was  raised  by  the 
<br/>Opposition.  There  seems  to  be  a  disconnect  in  the  role  of  FRU  and  the  role  of  the  Government, 
<br/>especially  your  office,  honourable  Minister.  When  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  same  as  the 
<br/>previous Prime Minister stepped in to make statements that are kind of challenging, as well from the 
<br/>Government’s perspective, they offered to build someone’s house, the Captain of the Sevens Team. 
<br/>It was not really fulfilled by the then honourable Bainimarama, but it was fulfilled by the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister  Rabuka  when  he  offered  to  pay  $20,000.  There  is  disconnection  from  your  good 
<br/>office, Sir.  We are not paying for that! You mentioned here that you are not paying for the $20,000 
<br/>that will be given to the Seven-a-Side.  Here, there is a bit of disconnection that is causing all these. 
<br/>I will give you the floor to make your reply because rugby is part of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You remember the days when we used to play in Lautoka, it is part of us, but when there is 
<br/>an initiative being done or undertaken by the Government and to say we are not going to be paying 
<br/>for that, you are speaking from your own Ministry of Sports, Sir, allocation of funds according to 
<br/>your budget.  But this is coming from the honourable Prime Minister when he has mentioned that we 
<br/>will  pay  $20,000  per  player,  that  has  been  done.  That  is  the  only  concern,  I  fully  agree  with  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition. There is some kind of disconnection, then all of a sudden, we 
<br/>do not know where to pin the thing to FRU or the Government or Ministry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, may I clarify the money that was promised to the Fiji Sevens Team 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been paid, the $20,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That statement was made by the honourable Prime Minster and you refuted 
<br/></span><span>it here, saying we are not going to be paying for that. We do not know where the $20,000 is coming 
<br/></span><span>from. I am trying to get back on what I stated earlier on, and the honourable Prime Minister sent me

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to present the jerseys to the Seven-a-Side Team in Dubai.  That is the disconnection that is being 
<br/>highlighted here, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, I take note of the issues raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, this is definitely an interesting discussion that we are 
<br/>having. So much of skills are around and we are very proud of our sports, but the only challenge that 
<br/>I see, often the decisions are made by adults – how the sports, which direction it should take?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in the review exercise which the honourable Minister just mentioned, it is extremely 
<br/>important that consultations should take place with the players who are already complaining about 
<br/>so many things.  That will only entice our young ones to take rugby as a career, because they do see 
<br/>rugby as a career, it can generate a lot of money, but the other side of the coin is, when the career is 
<br/>over, money is over. How are we going to manage the financial aspects? When the going is good, 
<br/>how do they do the investment so that when they are not in rugby, they can still lead a proper life? 
<br/>My question was that - review! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  responding  to  honourable Premila  Kumar’s 
<br/>statement, we are about to call for expression of interest for the setting up of that review team.  That 
<br/>is where young people from all walks of life can come in and participate, have a say in how we want 
<br/>to build sports in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact that the IRB issues directions with respect 
<br/>to interference with Fiji Rugby Union. What will you be proposing in terms of how to handle the 
<br/>current situation because it will require some kind of government investigation, et cetera into it to 
<br/>see what has actually happened without treading on IRB’s toes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, just to respond to that question, World Rugby has made it very 
<br/>clear they do not want Government to interfere in Fiji Rugby Union’s business. But yes, of course, 
<br/>the Fiji Government has been pouring a lot of funds into rugby house in supporting rugby as our 
<br/>flagship, sort of marketing our small Pacific Island to other parts of the world.  They have been doing 
<br/>successfully. Yes, we will talk to them when it is right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, the plate is quite hot, because the players are showing and coming out with 
<br/>their frustrations and the trustees are trying to come to terms with that.  But we will surely talk to 
<br/>them when the time is right.  As I have said, we are really concerned about the position of World 
<br/>Rugby and we would like to be watchful of that situation at the moment, but we will certainly come 
<br/>in when the time is right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that calls for a suspension of our proceedings now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so that we may have lunch and then we will return when the bell is sounded at 2.30 p.m.

<div><span>Maintaining and Repairing the Railway Network System 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 223/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry update 
<br/>Parliament on the progress of maintaining and repairing the railway network system that 
<br/>was damaged and is no longer in use? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can hear my voice is not right. So, I do not expect 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any supplementary questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Can you leave that for me to decide? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I came into the Chamber, someone asked me, 
<br/>“are you sick?” There are two versions of being sick.  One is sick then I am a Sikh.  I do not know 
<br/>which one to answer?  But having my wife as a doctor, she knows that I am very sick, so she gave 
<br/>me this medicine today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Pillay asked a very pertinent question about the railway system.  
<br/>But before I answer him proper, I will tell you one thing, as I was having lunch at home (I normally 
<br/>have lunch at home) …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What are you doing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I had a nice lamb curry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker is talking about lunch. I had a nice lamb curry cooked by my wife with chutney. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The railway system in this country has been there for 140 years under the CSR government.  
<br/>What happened in 2019, the FijiFirst Government signed an agreement with a company called Farer 
<br/>Group Pte. Limited to run the tramline between Nadi and Vuda and they were leasing the tramline 
<br/>for only $10,000 a year.  Then in 2019, they also re-signed another agreement from Nadi to Cuvu for 
<br/>$20,000.  That system never worked, today, that company Farer has sued FSC for $31 million and 
<br/>that case is before the Court.  Here FSC is struggling to survive, how can this type of agreement be 
<br/>signed under the last government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT  MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Fix it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Fix it, no! Who will fix it but you have to pay for it.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1937 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I tell you one thing, this is the biggest litigation in the history of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What was the question raised?  The railway? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am simply saying, Sir, where are we heading now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will answer, take your time.  What has happened?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  address  the  question  raised  by  honourable  Pillay  regarding  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>progress of maintaining and repairing the railway network.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time he has said that.  I can also say 
<br/>to him that he </span><span>choro </span><span>everything from his family.  If he wants to continue that, I can also say that, but 
<br/>I want to say that stop saying all those nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are not the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  First  and  foremost,  I  appreciate  that  inquiry  as  it  demonstrates  the 
<br/>concerns of the  sugar industry.  However, I must highlight that my time in Government has been 
<br/>significantly  shorter  than  the  16  years  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  if  they  had  addressed  those 
<br/>pressing issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me take a moment to consider the current state of the tramline network, 
<br/>a total of 482 kilometres of railway across our mills, only 384 kilometres remain operational. Let me 
<br/>explain the breakdown: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Lautoka Mill has 225 kilometres, 135 kilometres operational 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Rarawai Mill has 130 kilometres, 125 kilometres operational. 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Labasa Mill has 127 kilometres, 24 kilometres in use. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While these numbers indicate that any pursuit of our rails are functioning, we cannot overlook 
<br/>the  fact  that  the  substantial  portion  remains  damaged  and  non-operational.    Additionally,  we  are 
<br/>challenged by the outdated locomotives which are barely operational, along with the shortage of rail 
<br/>carts, all of which require significant funding to address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the good old days, dating back to 20 years to 30 years when you were not born, delivery 
<br/>by rail were over 90 percent and this declined steadily over the intervening years.  Even looking at 
<br/>the recent data from nine years, one can see the trend of how fast rail to trucks ratio is changing.  In 
<br/>2015, rail accounted for 21 percent of deliveries while trucks delivered 79 percent of the crops.  The 
<br/>ratio has continued to shift dramatically in favour of the trucks with 7 percent of sugarcane being 
<br/>transferred by rail.  This decline is not merely a statistic, it represents missed opportunities from the 
<br/>previous regime to bring back the rail system by investing in the rail network. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under 
<br/>this Government, it is investing in railways infrastructure known to be cheaper and more efficient.

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- </span><span>Suno yaar.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.-  This is the problem when we have juveniles in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Australia, the cost of transportation, as we speak today, is $4 per tonne as compared to ours 
<br/>where  the  cost  ranges  from  $25  per  tonne  to  $35  per  tonne.    This  is  due  to  neglect  and  the  bad 
<br/>management  decision  by  FSC  in  2000,  particularly  under  the  leadership  of  the  former  CEO,  Mr. 
<br/>Abdul Khan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Hogwash, honourable Usamate.  You guys were sleeping on the job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Consultations with farmers was a waste and that they were told to move.  
<br/>Abdul Khan told them to move from railway to trucks.  Your boss!  Indeed, it is a costly and a bad 
<br/>decision.  </span><span>Areh</span><span>, I am a farmer, I know what is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Administration has taken the necessary steps when they were in power.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we may not be in a position today where the sugar industry requires a bailout from the 
<br/>Coalition Government.  That being the fact and a history now, we have now recognised the urgent 
<br/>need for the restoration of the railway network.  We are currently in discussion…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. R.R. Sharma interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen man! Listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are currently in discussion with a reputable company from India to conduct the feasibility 
<br/>study on the railway system, while we will await a report from the Food Agricultural Organization 
<br/>as well.  This is a very crucial step in our commitment to revitalise this essential transport network.  
<br/>However, our Government is very clear, that we will not make a hollow promise.  No more hollow 
<br/>promise.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Our  mission  will  be  based  on  the  findings  of  the  study,  and  most 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importantly, of the needs and the desire of the farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, while I appreciate the concerns raised by honourable Pillay, it is essential to 
<br/>reflect  on  the  history  of  inactions  that  has  been  brought  here  by  us  and  by  you  people.    We  are 
<br/>committed to restoring the railway network and supporting our farmers, but this journey requires a 
<br/>thoughtful planning, collaboration, and without being directly impacted.  No more supplementary 
<br/>questions, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Hear, about the planning.

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>1939 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Minister,  in 
<br/>talking about hollow promises, the farmers in Daku, Wainikoro and Seaqaqa are still waiting for the 
<br/>promise that you gave them.  When will that be fixed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  was  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissioner Northern too for so many years.  What have you done to help the farmers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am answering.  You were there.  It has only taken us two years.  So, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have patience, it will happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Rinesh Sharma? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You are not the Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No lecture!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Sugar is daydreaming 
<br/>with his eyes open in broad daylight.  He has promised 1.8 million tonnes of sugar being generated 
<br/>and 2.5 million tonnes for future.  The farmers are asking, when will the honourable Minister deliver 
<br/>and  fix  the  network  system  for  the  railroads  so  that  they  can  transport  their  sugarcane  at  a  cost-
<br/>effective price?   When, is the answer, next week, one month or the next election promise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has the habit of asking the same question for every 
<br/>Minister here.  When?  For 16 years, you were there, we never question you.  We are only here for 
<br/>two years.  Hold on, make it happen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will take that as the last supplementary question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think because he is sick, his temperature has gone up, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I mean, unwell.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, I am not sure if we were able to gather the answer that you gave with 
<br/>respect to the repair to the rail network system, but my question is, has there been a proper assessment 
<br/>done in terms of costing?  Is that within your budget to be able to do that within this parliamentary 
<br/>term?  Most decent Members from that side will ask, apart from others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know why, because, yes, the costing needs to be done. We are getting the people from India. 
<br/>They will come and assess the railway system on what is not operating and what is operating. And I 
<br/>tell you one thing, I was told that the railway system, this concrete with gravel, that has to be done 
<br/>and because it has sunk in  so  many places, that is  why the trucks  tilt over. So, there is  a costing

<div><span>Update on the Rural and Outer Island Programme 
<br/>(Question No.  224/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUINABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  With the revival of the Rural and Outer Island Programme, can the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  how  the  Ministry  will  implement  this  Programme  to  ensure  maximum 
<br/>return on this investment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for the launching 
<br/>of  the  new  National  Development  Plan  2025-2030  of  the  Coalition  Government,  which  sets  the 
<br/>direction and platform for us, as we progress in building our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most, if not all of us, in this august House, would have spent time 
<br/></span><span>already in perusing the document. I am pleased that a chapter is specifically dedicated for the Rural 
<br/>and Outer Island Development, which stipulates Government’s planned strategic focus areas in the 
<br/>coming years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  at  hand  is  with  regards  to  one  of  the  many  programmes 
<br/>administered by the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, which 
<br/>is the Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  all  aware,  the  Coalition  Government  decided  to  revive  the  ROI 
<br/>Programme  through  the  Ministry  from  January  2023.    This  revamped  ROI  Programme  already 
<br/>undertook  a  thorough  consultation  with  our  key  stakeholders,  including  key  private  sector 
<br/>components of society, during the formulation stage in order to understand the strengths, weaknesses 
<br/>and  opportunities  that  exists  in  the  agriculture,  fisheries  and  forestry  value  chain  system  before 
<br/>mapping the pathway for the revamped ROI Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Understanding that value chain system is crucial, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that the revived 
<br/>ROI Programme is focused, targeted and based on statistical evidence that can holistically address 
<br/>the development issues faced by our rural communities for more than a decade now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  some  of  the  key  rural  development  issues  that  were  identified  during  its 
<br/>consultation  with  key  stakeholders  includes  farm  access  road,  market  access,  communication 
<br/>network, transportation, water supply and the issues of climate change in terms of sea level rise and 
<br/>riverbanks erosion.  The above development issues are also common in all </span><span>Bose ni Tikina</span><span> and </span><span>Bose 
<br/>ni Yasana</span><span> development forums.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, high rural poverty rate (36.5 percent), particularly 
<br/>with those associated with our subsistence farmers and rural-urban drift are the two major issues that 
<br/>the Ministry is currently working on closely with our key stakeholders to systematically address these 
<br/>issues through their various development programmes.  At the same time, Sir, the Ministry is also 
<br/>mindful of those rural population that are living near the poverty line and are most likely to fall below 
<br/>the poverty line when faced with economic shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1941 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the increasing demand and broad inter-related issues facing our rural 
<br/>communities,  the  revamped  ROI  Programme  needs  to  focus  on  complementing  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture  and  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry  programmes,  particularly  on  improving  farm 
<br/>access roads, land preparation, market access, value-adding, and network connectivity.  The above 
<br/>interventions from the overall objectives of the revamped ROI Programme and to ensure that our 
<br/>ROI budgetary allocation is focussed and addressing the real needs on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  Rate  of  Return  on  ROI  investments,  one  of  the  expected 
<br/>outcomes of this ROI Programme is on improving productivity and increasing production, mostly 
<br/>targeting our subsistence farmers. This is crucial, given that expected increase in productivity will 
<br/>lead to increase in agricultural production and increase in income which, in turn, contribute towards 
<br/>addressing rural poverty due to the expected increase in the purchasing power of our rural subsistence 
<br/>households.  The  same  principle  applies  with  the  Fisheries  and  Forestry  Sector,  targeting  income 
<br/>generating projects. This ROI Programme also ensures that it contributes towards addressing food 
<br/>security and nutrition, which is a very important component of measuring poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure increased production and contribution from our rural farmers are 
<br/>realised, the Ministry is currently finalising its production and farming plan and will proceed soon 
<br/></span><span>with our ROI Community Awareness and Training Programme regarding their monthly targets and 
<br/></span><span>expected post-harvest annual returns. Helping our ROI farmers understand the dollar value of their 
<br/>post-harvest  annual  returns  may  provide  that  necessary  motivation  and  drive  towards  increase  in 
<br/>productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  our  ROI  communities'  production  and  farming  plans  will  be  closely 
<br/>monitored  by  our  Divisional  Technical  Working  Group  (TWG),  chaired  by  our  Divisional 
<br/>Commissioners. This TWG is  expected to  closely monitor our ROI communities’ production and 
<br/>farming plan and address any technical issues that may arise. An Advisory Committee comprise of 
<br/>key government  stakeholders and Permanent  Secretaries will also  be  established to  address  those 
<br/>value-chain issues that may arise from the TWG discussions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has noted the importance of the Programme sustainability, thus 
<br/>all our ROI farming communities will be incubated for the next three to five years, to ensure their 
<br/>targets  materialised  as  planned,  whilst  there  is  expected  results  achieved  in  terms  of  improved 
<br/>standard of living and reducing poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to measure these results, the Ministry will proceed with the profiling 
<br/>of these ROI farming communities in order to have some baseline statistics on their current living 
<br/>standards, income levels, and their goal for the next three to five years. The above baseline data is 
<br/>also crucial for the evaluation of the Programme’s effectiveness in the next three to five years.  The 
<br/>above are the new initiatives that this revamped ROI Programme introduces to ensure sustainability, 
<br/>scalability, and with the future expectation of being self-sufficient and reduce their over-dependence 
<br/>towards Government assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2023-2024 financial year, the ROI Programme, in consultation with 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture, has constructed a total of 22 rural farm roads at a cost of $2 million.  
<br/>This includes the construction of 75.5 kilometres in the Northern Division, 16.9 kilometres in the 
<br/>Western Division, 5.9 kilometres in the Central Division and 5 kilometres in the Eastern Division. 
<br/>These  rural  farm  roads  when  strategically  constructed,  does  not  only  give  access  to  farmers,  but 
<br/>enables women to reach markets as vendors, children now travelling on proper roads, infrastructure 
<br/>to school, and the elderly are able to reach the nearest postal agency to access their social welfare 
<br/></span><span>benefits.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  intention  of  the  Ministry  is  to  ensure  that  all  rural  communities  are 
<br/>connected to road infrastructure through the strategic construction of rural farm roads. We understand 
<br/>the limited budget constraints of Government and the limited machineries available with the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture, to ensure all farmers receive a fair share of infrastructure access.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  coordination  Ministry  for  rural  development,  a  total  of  22  contractors  with  road 
<br/>infrastructure  machineries  were  approved  by  the  Government  Tender  Board.  Having  more 
<br/>contractors accelerate the construction of rural farm roads, this indirectly increases competition for 
<br/>the private sector, strengthening Private Public Partnership and in return, a source of revenue for the 
<br/>Government  in  terms  of  generating  tax,  which  is  the  multiplier  effect  of  the  ROI  Programme 
<br/>investment in rural farm roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all rural communities have much expectation for the Coalition Government 
<br/>to facilitate improvement in livelihoods. In this context, the ROI Programme, in consultation with 
<br/>the Ministry of Forestry, procured four portable sawmills for each of the four Divisions to facilitate 
<br/>Scheme 3 of our Rural Housing Programme. This is a one-third and two-third contribution between 
<br/>the Government and communities that have available forests as their one-third contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that all in this august Parliament have realised the growing kava 
<br/></span><span>or </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, ginger and turmeric production in our rural economy.  As we continue to explore 
<br/>markets globally, the ROI Programme has focussed internally by procuring food processing units to 
<br/>make possible the growth of niche markets  through rural  processing hubs. This  directly  connects 
<br/>farmers to locally created markets and generates economic activity widely, and employment creation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are already existing farmers that are driving the agriculture sector in 
<br/>all areas, heavily reliant on manual labour. Our coordination role with the Ministry of Agriculture at 
<br/>the divisional level through established technical working group highlighted earlier, has guided the 
<br/>ROI Programme to procure and supply farming implements, such as ploughs and harrows, to these 
<br/>farmers.  One  may  argue  that  we  are  duplicating  implementation,  however,  the  objective  is  to 
<br/>complement and supplement technological and machinery support to farmers wherever possible, to 
<br/>improve agricultural  production and its contribution  to  GDP which was  once a driving economic 
<br/>sector of the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  rural  communities  have  evolved  globally  due  to  the  growing  rural 
<br/>subsistence  sector,  and  Fiji  was  once  a  leading  economy  in  the  Pacific  region  -  we  have  lost  the 
<br/>prestige. The ROI Programme and in communities that are beneficiaries of the project, will be formed 
<br/>into cooperatives to drive economic activity. The pilot initiatives are undertaken in Vatulele and two 
<br/>communities in the Bua Province, with technical support from the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
<br/>and Department of Cooperatives. The key objective is to strengthen savings for the members with 
<br/>controlled loan based on clearly defined bylaws.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is thankful to 
<br/>the increase in the budgetary allocation for the ROI Programme from $2.5 million in 2023- 2024 
<br/>financial year to $3 million in the current financial year.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is determined 
<br/>to achieve the objectives of the revamped ROI Programme which is an important component of the 
<br/>Coalition’s National Development Plan, as well as the Ministry’s vision of inclusive development 
<br/>for production in resilience communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, it is good to see the  ROI Programme in action.  
<br/>But with respect to the outer islands, one of the most critical components in it would be Government 
<br/></span><span>shipping and our shipping that is able to get those new vegetables, et cetera, all the things that our 
<br/></span><span>outer islands can do. So, with that particular programme, has there been, or will there be some more

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultations for the transport and Government Shipping Services (GSS), et cetera, with respect to 
<br/>being able to bring those goods into the mainland or for export, et cetera? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for the question.  At the 
<br/>moment, our focus is  on trying to unlock the potential in assisting market access and where we are 
<br/>able to assist with transportation, we will certainly discuss that, in co-operation with the line Ministry 
<br/>which is the Ministry of Transport, so we can consider that. I believe there is a review of GSS which 
<br/>is currently being undertaken at the moment under franchise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.  What  is  the 
<br/>difference between the ROI Programme that the Ministry is currently undertaking, compared to the 
<br/>one that used to be offered by the Ministry of Agriculture? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past when the ROI Programme was  held by 
<br/>or offered by the Ministry of Agriculture, they focussed mostly on the commercial farmers. But the 
<br/>focus of the ROI Programme now is working with those having traditional ownership of land which 
<br/>is  54 percent  of agricultural  land, and we are leaving  the Ministry of Agriculture to  focus on the 
<br/>commercial  side,  while  we  work  with  those  who  operate  other  traditional  ownership  which  is  54 
<br/></span><span>percent and which is, at the moment needs to be unlocked in order to have contribution to the GDP 
<br/></span><span>as I mentioned.
