<div><span>Town and City Rates for Municipalities in Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 177/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Housing  and  Local  Government  update 
<br/>Parliament on what  measures are in  place to  recover the outstanding  Town and City 
<br/>rates in all the Municipalities in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the question. It is, indeed, a pertinent issue for Municipalities around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, rates are a significant source of funding for Municipal Councils. 
<br/>Municipal  Councils  can  make  investments  in  their  communities  and  improve  the  service  they 
<br/>provide to ratepayers if they are able to collect the rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in Fiji, the number of ratepayers in towns and  cities is around 
<br/>44,749, with residential ratepayers making up 85 percent of that total. The Local Government Act 
<br/>1972 makes it mandatory for residents living on rateable properties in towns and cities to pay their 
<br/>rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal Councils rely on the rates to fund a variety of services including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>waste management; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>maintenance and beautification of public spaces; 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>planning national events; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sanitation control; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carrying out regulatory enforcement duties related to buildings, transportation and

<div><span>littering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The money received by Municipal Councils can be used to create and improve services, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well as foster an atmosphere that will attract investment, and stimulate the local economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Suva  City  Council  has  the  largest  ratepayer  base,  comprising  of 
<br/>11,468 ratepayers, of which 83 percent or 9,441 are residential ratepayers. Nasinu Town Council has 
<br/>11,377 ratepayers, of which 10,953 are residential ratepayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, with 8,169 ratepayers, 91 of whom are residential ratepayers for Lautoka City 
<br/>Council which has the third highest ratepayers in our country, whilst the 10 Municipalities make up 
<br/>the remaining 13,735 ratepayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Municipal  Councils,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  have  the  ability  to  supply  services  in 
<br/>carrying  out  its  major  projects  have  been  seriously  hampered  by  the  delay  in  payment  of  rates.  I 
<br/>would like to reiterate that for cities and towns to be able to provide greater services and to have 
<br/>strong infrastructure, the ratepayers have a responsibility to contribute to those expenditures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as of 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024, the interest on rates on arrears has reduced 
<br/>from 5 percent to 11 percent, and will now be charged on simple interest on arrears rather than the 
<br/>compound interest that was being charged. This will bring some relief to ratepayers who are not able 
<br/>to pay their rates in a timely manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Municipal  Councils  in  consultation  with  the  Ministry,  have 
<br/>prepared  their  Rates  Collection  Plan  and  that  will  assist  ratepayers  who  are  facing  financial 
<br/>difficulties.  We  have  witnessed  job  losses  in  our  country  due  to  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, hence the Plan will accommodate those financially affected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the way forward, ratepayers will liaise with the relevant Councils on how they will settle 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or pay up their rates, as well as outstanding rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, with the problem of rate arrears, the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/>has provided a rates amnesty period.  One was given in 2018, two in 2019 and two in 2023. This was 
<br/>done to encourage the ratepayers to pay up their arrears, without having to pay the interest on the 
<br/>arrears. Every compound interest on arrears was eliminated during the amnesty period, provided that 
<br/>residential  ratepayers  paid  their  full  principal  amount  within  the  allocated  time.  In  addition,  this 
<br/>allowed Municipal Councils to tidy up their books.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Councils  have  been  making  arrangements  with  struggling 
<br/>ratepayers  -  those  ratepayers  who  have  been  facing  financial  hardships,  to  pay  their  rates  in 
<br/>instalments or in small payments.  Besides, the discount period for the current rates were extended 
<br/>by most of the Councils to encourage ratepayers to come forward and pay up their rates at reduced 
<br/>amounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, together with the 13 Municipalities around the country, 
<br/></span><span>have also conducted rate profiling exercises to ascertain the total outstanding, as well as aging rates, 
<br/></span><span>and identify the challenges in the rate recovery processes by the Councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While these rate profiling exercises was done, one of the objectives also is to identify some 
<br/>of the things that are lacking. If you go to some of the Municipalities around the country, they do not 
<br/>even have the right postal addresses, phone contacts and emails of most of the ratepayers. So, this 
<br/>was one of the objectives of why the rate profiling exercise was carried out by most Municipalities 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, after going through these profiling exercises, Municipal Councils 
<br/>should be able to identify the right strategies that they are going to take to improve rates recovery, as 
<br/>well as how to enforce those who are defaulting on their rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy Speaker, as of 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024, there is  approximately  $67.2 million  in 
<br/>town rates arrears in all Municipalities and approximately 27 percent or $30.9 million of rates are in 
<br/>arrears for the past one to five years. Also note that 2,850 ratepayers are facing genuine financial 
<br/>hardships, whilst 10,869 can pay rates but are not paying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  working  hand  in  hand  with  Municipal  Councils  to  ensure  that  the  focus  is  placed 
<br/>where it belongs. On those who have the capacity to pay but have chosen not to do so, the Councils 
<br/>are committed to recovering every dollar owed so that they can reinvest into the communities that 
<br/>need it most.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the strategy of this Government is to allow the Councils to improve 
<br/>rate collection, hence it is critical for the Councils to focus on those ratepayers who are in arrears for 
<br/>more than five years and those who are capable of paying their rates. This will also provide high 
<br/>returns on the efforts made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  our  strategy  is  clear  and  uncompromised.  We  have  advised  the 
<br/>Councils of the full extent of their regulatory powers under the Local Government Act and they are 
<br/>implementing a range of strategies to recover these outstanding funds. These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extended discount periods; 
<br/>allowing payment by instalments; 
<br/>engaging with major landlords like Ministry of Lands, Housing Authority, as well as TLTB; 
<br/>enabling online payments like M-PAiSA and payments through banks; 
<br/>taking this up with the Small Claims Tribunal for all rates that are more than $5,000 and 
<br/>pursuing legal action where necessary to try and recover some of these rates that have been 
<br/>outstanding for quite some time; or  
<br/>even placing caveat on properties that have been there for some time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, one thing that I have been reminding my team is that in any collection exercise, it is 
<br/>always important that you start with the low hanging fruits - those that are less than 12 months and 
<br/></span><span>less than two years. Those are the ones that are easily collected, and we must focus on those rates.  
<br/></span><span>Then we focus on those that are more than two to five years, as well as aging or rates that have been 
<br/>extending for quite some time. This would have come about after rate profiling exercises are done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to respond to the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, I am looking at the time and I figure we have 
<br/>time for more than one supplementary question. I ask that we make the questions concise and keep 
<br/>within our times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.– Madam Deputy Speaker, I was on the verge of standing up to ask a 
<br/>supplementary  question  and  to  inform  your  esteemed  position  that  we  would  not  be  asking 
<br/>supplementary questions as we thought it was extremely unfair and not in the spirit of this Parliament 
<br/>to limit the opportunities for Members of the Opposition to ask supplementary questions because we 
<br/></span><span>are representatives of the people.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Order, order! We will allow honourable Usamate to continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. - This has never been done before and I thank you for giving us that 
<br/>time. We have been having our speaking times reduced, the number of weeks in a year that we meet, 
<br/>reduced, everything has been reduced and now, remove that opportunity for us to ask questions. I am 
<br/>thankful for your decision, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. - The so-called democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. - I was given the right by the Deputy Speaker to speak and I withdraw 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that statement that I was about to make. Thank you for your ruling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  mentioned  by  the  honourable  Minister, 
<br/>recently, there has been the revision of interest rates, from compound to simple. My question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister is, what are the many advantages and benefits to this change? How much town 
<br/>rate arrears has been written off? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA. - Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for that 
<br/>question.  I  think  I  had  mentioned  in  one  of  my  responses  in  Parliament  the  reason  why  we  are 
<br/>reducing the interest rate, from 11 percent to 5 percent, as well as the changes in methodology. I think 
<br/>he was absent during that Sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, if you look  at the history of the town rates, one of the reasons why the interest  rate 
<br/>compounds  is  the  interest  is  being  charged  on  these  arrears  because  when  you  apply  compound 
<br/>interest, then you are charging interest on the interest of that late payment. So, that adds more burden 
<br/>to the ratepayers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the main objective of why the Coalition Government is reducing or changing the way 
<br/>the interest rate is charged is to assist the ratepayers in the repayment of their debt. I have been to 
<br/>some of these communities in Suva and Nabua, they have rates of more than $11,000, $12,000 and 
<br/>$15,000, because they have been accumulating rates for the past 10 to 15 years. So, this exercise was 
<br/>done to assist the ratepayers in repaying their debt, to give them some incentive to come forward to 
<br/>pay their rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND. - Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Government is really interested in helping 
<br/>the ratepayers and recover all the rates, instead of reducing the interest rate, why not just do away 
<br/>with the interest and get the principal only, so it makes it easier for the ratepayers to pay the principal 
<br/>only? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, when I took office, one of the things I 
<br/></span><span>did was challenge the Councils to change the way they do business. They have been heavily reliant 
<br/>on Government to give them funds, especially the medium and smaller sized Councils, in order to 
<br/>fund projects and their basic services to ratepayers.  If you look at the business aspects of things, 
<br/>someone in any institution, there is one way of enticing and encouraging people to come and pay 
<br/>their rates, like for them to avoid paying interest so they can pay their rates on time. That is one way 
<br/>of deterring the people from paying their rates late.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For repaying their rates, we have provisions in place in the Local Government Act, for all 
<br/>those  that  are  facing  financial  hardships,  the  Minister  has  the  power  upon  justification  and 
<br/>verification of all the documents to nullify their position to pay their rates, the Minister has the full 
<br/>powers to waive the interest on those outstanding rates.

<div><span>Fiji National Labour Mobility Framework and Strategy 
<br/>(Question No. 178/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Workplace 
<br/>Relations inform  Parliament on the Memorandum  of Understanding  (MOU) regarding 
<br/>the development of the Fiji National Labour Mobility Framework and Strategy with the 
<br/>International Organisation for Migration? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for asking the 
<br/>question.  It is my pleasure to update Parliament on the MOU that my Ministry signed on 9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 
<br/>2024, with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Coalition  Government  is  committed  to  reviewing  and 
<br/>modernising  critical  national  legislations  and  policies  related  to  employment,  including  labour 
<br/>mobility.  These  reviews  include,  the  Employment  Relations  Act,  our  OHS  Regulations,  and  the 
<br/>National Employment Policy 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the context of these high level policy processes, labour mobility 
<br/>is unique, in the sense that it requires specific technical attention. As such, it is proposed to leverage 
<br/>the existing processes to develop a National Labour Mobility Policy, which would complement the 
<br/>National Employment Policy and other employment policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed Policy would outline the three key priority approaches, from the governance of 
<br/>labour mobility, both incoming and outgoing. The policy is to ensure that Fiji has a well-managed 
<br/>labour  mobility  governance  framework  that  forces  the  socio-economic  benefits  of  migration  for 
<br/>individuals and communities and aligns with international standards and best practises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  signing  of  this  MOU  between  our  Ministry  and  IOM  is  a 
<br/>testament of our commitment to collaborative efforts in addressing labour mobility challenges and 
<br/>turning them into opportunities.  It will enable us to benefit from technical assistance provided by 
<br/>the IOM towards the protection of migrant workers’ rights, conduct research and build capacity on 
<br/>gathering labour migration data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, with funding from the Migration Partnership Trust Fund, IOM is 
<br/>already  collaborating  closely  with  the  Ministry  on  the  project:  Labour  Mobility  for  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  and  Climate  Resilience  in  the  Pacific.  This  initiative  is  being  carried  out  in 
<br/>collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as part of this project, IOM will help Fiji build its National Labour 
<br/></span><span>Mobility Policy and Strategy. I wish to thank the IOM for their assistance and dedication towards the 
<br/>Fiji  Government  in  sharing  their  experiences  and  resources  to  improve  Fiji’s  Labour  Mobility 
<br/>Programmes and efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this collaborative approach for having an MOU was also discussed 
<br/>during  our  stakeholders  meeting.  These  stakeholders  are  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finance, Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Solicitor-General, during the consultation 
<br/>process for Cabinet endorsement to develop the Fiji National Labour Mobility Policy Framework 
<br/>and Strategy for Sustainable Development and Climate Resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that if you are navigating labour 
<br/>mobility, it is quite a difficult task. Can you please tell Parliament that in terms of the collaboration 
<br/>with the UN based organisation, has the country’s needs assessment being done already, and if it has 
<br/>been done, will we be seeing the outcome of that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  honourable  Koya  for  the  question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is part of the exercise, Madam Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  a  quick  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister,   we are hearing mixed messages about the benefits and, of course, the challenges we face 
<br/>as  well.  Will  the  work  undertaken  by  IOM  include  the  benefits  to  the  economy  of  the  receiving 
<br/>countries as against ours, because in some sectors, it would have been better if people remain here in 
<br/>Fiji,  rather than go abroad? So, the benefits  to  the economy  of the receiving  countries versus the 
<br/>benefit it brings to us and the individual workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition for that question. It is part of the statistics, the data that we are collecting and the strategies 
<br/>will be drawn up thereafter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will move on now to the third of our 14 Oral Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today. I now call upon the honourable Assistant Minister for Education to ask Question No. 179. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Thank  you,  Madam  Speaker,  I  believe  this  question  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdrawn.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 179/2024 withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- That question has been withdrawn, and I understand there might be a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement that will follow later on this week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Velovelo Foreshore Land 
<br/>(Question No. 180/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament 
<br/>on the Velovelo foreshore land at Lautoka which was under development for industrial 
<br/>purposes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.V. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank honourable Ketan Lal for the 
<br/>question this morning.  I, perhaps wish to begin by addressing a point of clarity that there is no such 
<br/></span><span>development  that  was  undertaken  by  Government  known  as  Velovelo  Foreshore  Development  in 
<br/></span><span>Lautoka. What was undertaken by Government was an adjacent parcel of real estate which is called 
<br/>the Wairabetia Economic Zone Development.  It is right next to each other, but they share the same 
<br/>parcel of foreshore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  way  of  an  update,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  that  development  that  was  undertaken  by 
<br/>Government  in  Wairabetia  of  which  the  Approval  to  Lease  was  issued  in  2017,  has  now  been 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completed. The peripheral survey has been approved, and the dry part of the leased land had been 
<br/>approved in  January 2024.  We continue to  liaise with  the Ministry of Trade, who are ultimately 
<br/>going to be the organiser of the development around that piece  of land. What may have been the 
<br/>cause of delay from this development, which was first hatched between then and now, was the time 
<br/>taken between Government and iTLTB negotiations with the iTaukei landowners, who are owners 
<br/>of the parcels of land needed to be acquired. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A portion of the money that was set aside for this development, perhaps to the tune of a little 
<br/>over $640,000 was paid to iTLTB for the lease. With the preliminary work, such as the acquisition 
<br/>and the periphery survey of the land completed, we will soon  be handing over to the Ministry of 
<br/>Trade the leases from iTLTB through the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, and once the 
<br/>leases have been registered, the Ministry of Trade will have their own plans on how to roll out that 
<br/>programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in terms of this Wairabetia lot, I know that FNPF 
<br/>was actually involved in this and they had moved that special economic zone to Navutu also. But this 
<br/>spot, will it also entail getting a foreshore lease done for that particular part, specifically because, 
<br/>from  what  I  understand,  it  has  one  of  the  deepest  seaports  in  that  particular  area  for  future 
<br/>development? Once it is all complete, will it include some foreshore with respect to that particular 
<br/>development, whether it is industrial or commercial?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think ideally when we are looking 
<br/>at that real estate in Lautoka, we are looking at expanding to real estate well beyond the dry land. It 
<br/>has  always  been  the  ideal,  that  at  some  point,  we  are  going  to  acquire  or  move  the  development 
<br/>beyond the high-water mark because that is where the real development would be. There is a huge 
<br/>amount of State foreshore beyond that, so I think that is going to be the real prime estate in this whole 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-Honourable Minister, one of the sensitive and controversial issues 
<br/>as well when it comes to foreshore development is the risk assessment, particularly, considering the 
<br/>value of the properties. This is particularly from a risk reduction perspective.  There has been a lot 
<br/>of discussions on this issue previously from the real estates and from Municipal Councils that the 
<br/>price  of  properties  are  affected  because  of  the  risk  assessments  that  are  done  on  foreshore 
<br/>developments and existing properties. My question to the honourable Minister is, how is this being 
<br/>taken care of or progressed, given the plan that has already been undertaken? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Is this in relation only to Wairabetia or generally as a question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Wairebetia  as  foreshore  development  and  for  other  foreshore 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>developments as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- At the moment, Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have clarified, 
<br/>Wairabetia is not a foreshore development, it is a dry land lease development.  It can progress to a 
<br/>foreshore development, but that part is not yet confirmed.

<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the outcomes of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 2021 Pacific Literacy and Numeracy Assessment?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, just by way of information, the Pacific 
<br/>Islands  Literacy  and  Numeracy  Assessment  (PILNA),  is  a  three-year  cycle,  which  was  first 
<br/>administered in 2012 and subsequently in 2015, 2018 and 2021. The next assessment is due in 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the question, the findings of the PILNA Report for the 2021 cycle highlights 
<br/>that Year 4 and Year 6 students in Fiji perform above the regional level in reading.  However, less 
<br/>than half of the Year 4 students reached the expected proficiency level.  In numeracy, more than half 
<br/>of the students in both, Year 4 and Year 6, meet or exceeded the minimum proficiency level.  Data 
<br/>from this assessment also revealed that girls out-perform boys in numeracy, reading and writing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  had  shared  the  data  from  this  Report  with  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>Curriculum Advisory Services and the District Office of the Ministry, so intervention programmes 
<br/>are  implemented  which,  in  turn,  are  monitored  from  the  school  and  at  district  level.    One  of  the 
<br/>strategies  is  the  improvement  of  reading  and  numeracy  progress  trackers  in  the  Fiji  Education 
<br/>Management Information System (FEMIS) dashboard. Currently, a coordinator for LANA phonics 
<br/>is working on these reading and numeracy progress trackers for the follow-up and feedback, which 
<br/>is an ongoing activity, with continuous monitoring done at the school and divisional level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is important that Fiji continues with this programme, since this is 
<br/>initiated by the regional Ministers of Education.  So, PILNA addresses the targets identified in the 
<br/>Pacific Regional Education Framework (PacREF) in Sustainable Development Goal 4 by analysing 
<br/>and measuring results that provide the evidence of education quality for national governments and 
<br/>regional organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure the Ministry has analysed the 2021 
<br/>Pacific Literacy and Numeracy Assessment. I am interested in the performance of students schooling 
<br/>in remote areas. How did the rural remote and maritime students do compare to students in urban 
<br/>schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have said, the next cycle is due in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024 and we can provide the information when the assessment is done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education  for  his  response  to  the  question.  The  PILNA  findings  also  showed  that  teachers  have 
<br/>insufficient  time for slow learners.  I just read recently in  Australia, they  need about  20,000 ECE 
<br/>teachers, so there is a high demand for ECE teachers. We know that at that initial stage, if children 
<br/>are taught well in primary, they will do well in Years 4 and above, which has been tested.  So, my 
<br/>question to you, honourable Minister for Education is, how are you going to address this particular 
<br/>finding from the Report? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  an  ongoing  problem  that  has 
<br/>continuously been  faced by Governments.  In the Denarau Declaration documents, this has also been 
<br/>highlighted as part of the thematic areas that needed to be reviewed by the Ministry of Education and 
<br/>we are currently working on the implementation of the Declaration, addressing issues that you have 
<br/>highlighted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Members.  It is 10.27 a.m. and we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will take a tea break. The second bell will ring at 11.00 a.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.00 a.m.

<div><span>Measures to Address the Litter Act 2008 
<br/>(Question No. 185/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs 
<br/>inform  Parliament  on  measures  being  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  to 
<br/>enforce the Litter Act 2008? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  Protecting  our  environment  from  pollutants  and  waste  is  in  the  interest  of  everyone. 
<br/>However, we unfortunately continue to see the disregard for this important requirement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our island and its unique biodiversity and ecosystems are our inheritance. But before I go on, 
<br/>I would like to just comment on the question answered by the honourable Minister for Education 
<br/>about  education  and  what  we  do  when  we  grow  up.    It  is  exactly  the  same  as  our  educating  the 
<br/>populace on litter and the evils of littering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I came back from Tonga, I came back with a video recording of the trip we made to 
<br/>watch whales. I showed it to my great grandson who is in kindergarten, and he said, “What’s that 
<br/>papa?”  I said, “It’s a whale.”  He looked at it and said, “That’s not a whale.”  I said, “What is it?”  
<br/>He said, “Orca.”  And then went on to say, “That’s a killer whale.”  Boy, kindergarten! What are we 
<br/>not doing right? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our island’s a unique ecosystem must be protected, unfortunately many of us have bad habits. 
<br/>In my trips to China and Japan and experiences of clean roads and roadsides, et cetera, I do not know 
<br/>whether I was driven through the VIP route which was clean before we drove through, but generally 
<br/>it  is  all  clean.  When  we  tried  to  enforce  the  Act,  but  the  enforcement  is  not  really  discouraging 
<br/>enough, the fine is $40; whether you dump a car, dump a fridge or plastic bag and get prosecuted, it 
<br/>is $40.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Litter Decree or Act and its amendment is now being reviewed, including the container 
<br/>deposits for bottlers and those that use plastic containers. As I have said, the fines are only $40 and 
<br/>if you do not pay that within 30 days, you would be prosecuted. The Ministry had been diligently 
<br/>working  on  strengthening  enforcement,  which  is  really  the  issue,  not  the  Act  itself,  it  is  the 
<br/>enforcement of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been 18 training workshops for public and non-public authorities in Fiji, a total 
<br/>of  598  Litter  Prevention  Officers  have  been  trained  and  appointed.  In  2019  during  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, all 14 Provinces sent Provincial Conservation Officers and Litter Enforcement Officers 
<br/>to be trained under the Act of 2008.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been a training plan for new Litter Prevention Officers that has been developed for 
<br/></span><span>this fiscal year but despite the progress, we recognise that the Litter Act is now outdated.  It lacks the 
<br/>definitions  and  differentiations  that  is  needed  in  many  cases  to  enable  effective  policing  and 
<br/>enforcement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  an  immediate  need  to  introduce  regulations  to  further  enable  the  Enforcement 
<br/>Officers  for  the  enforcement  of  this  Act.    However,  introducing  the  regulations  under  the  Act,  it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>1768 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presents its own problematic issues due to the nature of the meaning of the provisions of that Act.  
<br/>For  example,  the  Act  does  not  create  sufficient  differentiation  within  its definitions  to  reflect  the 
<br/>difference in scale, as I mentioned earlier, and the implications of the different offences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fixed penalties, as I have said, is $40, whether it is a used refrigerator that is no longer 
<br/>serviceable or in use and dropping paper wrappers on the side of the road or on parks.  Instead, the 
<br/>Act  only  differentiates  between  litter  and  dangerous  litter.    The  definition  of  dangerous  litter  is 
<br/>focussed mostly on the immediate danger to people.  It does not include consideration of long-term 
<br/>dangers to the environment, as it continues to rust and pollute the environment they are in, whether 
<br/>its water, sea or on hard ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, irrespective of those problematic definitions, there is no difference in the fines 
<br/>as I said earlier. Madam Deputy Speaker, the fixed penalty is $40, it is not a deterrent. It is important 
<br/>to note that the penalty for corporate bodies that commits an offence is $2,000, irrespective of the 
<br/>type  and  volume  of  litter  that  they  deposit.  It  is  wholly  insufficient  in  the  case  of  significant 
<br/>environmental offenses and the Litter Act only  applies to lose definition of public places and the 
<br/>demarcation of boundaries for litter enforcement is not really clearly defined. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act is being reviewed and consultation is now in progress to bring the reviewed Act to 
<br/>Cabinet. But the Ministry acknowledges the existing gaps in the Litter Act of 2008 and its amendment 
<br/>in  2010  and  the  need  to  strengthen  the  enforcement  and  implementation  of  the  Act  through  the 
<br/>thorough review which is on-going right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, and I also like to thank the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister for his response. I do understand the problems associated with the Litter Decree and he has 
<br/>rightly pointed it out, but I find that there is a disconnect between what students are taught in the 
<br/>schools and what they practice at home.  In rural areas there is no disposal waste collection services, 
<br/>so the parents usually say, “take this rubbish and dump it.”  That habit continues when they come out 
<br/>in cities and towns and we need to also look at this issue rather seriously as to how we can roll out 
<br/>this waste collection service across the country, that might help in educating our young minds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  my  other  question  related  to  this  particular  topic  is  the 
<br/>enforcement.  There is no money allocated for the enforcement of the Litter Decree.  Do you think 
<br/>when you will be reviewing this legislation you are going to come to Parliament with a law and can 
<br/>you put a dollar value on it as well for the implementation of the Act?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  yes,  that  will  be  done.    I  would  like  to 
<br/>comment on your remark on rural areas, maybe some rural areas, many of the villages have very 
<br/>strict litter laws according to the traditional leadership of the land.  So, the answer basically is yes, 
<br/>that  will  be  included  in  the  review  and  the  provincial  councils  enforce  the  </span><span>benu  ca</span><span>  rules  in  the 
<br/>villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Prime Minister every year 
<br/>we  do  the  Leptospirosis,  Typhoid,  Dengue  and  Diarrhoea  (LTDD)  campaign  for  almost  all  the 
<br/>agencies of government.  You have highlighted about the household litter but one of the big issues 
<br/></span><span>we have now, Sir, is old automobiles, cars including tyres as well.  Tyres is a big threat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  question,  Sir,  is  on  recycling,  part  of  the  review,  probably  if  I  may  ask,  if  it  can  be 
<br/>considered that we make advantage of some of these wastes, to convert it again into better use.  The 
<br/>question is, has there been consideration on this in terms of the review that is being undertaken? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, that is also being taken into account 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and there are already recyclers of rubber tyres who break them down into almost dust and that is 
<br/>shipped away to recycling factories overseas.  However, we break them down and then send them 
<br/>overseas.  Yes, that is part of the review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the things that I have noticed when 
<br/>you go overseas and people walk their dogs, they have little plastic bags.  When the dogs do their 
<br/>business, it is their responsibility to clean it.  As a person that does not own dogs in Nakasi, I noticed 
<br/>that people there when the dogs have to do their business, they open the gates, let the dogs around, 
<br/>do their business and come back in. So, honourable Prime Minister, would you put in the law that 
<br/>makes it mandatory for people when their dogs do business outside, it is their responsibility to go 
<br/>and pick it up or if not for them to be fined? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, would you like to answer that question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Madam Speaker, Sir, the point is taken.

<div><span>Replacement of Hanging Bridge - Bua Lomanikoro 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 186/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport update Parliament as to when the damaged hanging bridge in Bua Lomanikoro 
<br/>which was severely damaged in 2015 will be replaced? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Assistant Minister, for that question.  
<br/>I  was  just  thinking  about  the  questions  relating  to  specific  locations.  I  remember  that  in  the  last 
<br/>Parliament, we were barred from asking such questions on specific locations.  I am not sure whether 
<br/>it was the previous government or the previous government working with the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been a proliferation of questions specific to locations... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  ...  but  what  I  wanted  to  say  the  difference  is  that  we  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accepting it in this Government ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- …and in the last government, it was strongly opposed and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disallowed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  That  is  the  feature  of  the  new  Government,  we  accept 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>questions on specific locations and even operational matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Now the thing is here, right? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A feature of good, open government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  For  this  one,  it  is  quite  an  interesting  one  because  we  had 
<br/>originally planned for a modular bridge (vehicle bridge).  A scope had been done but the </span><span>Bose Vanua</span><span>
<br/>had a meeting with the </span><span>Turaga Tui Bua</span><span> and did not agree with the vehicle.  If you go there, it crosses 
<br/>directly into the village.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suppose when you construct a road, and I had mentioned yesterday the framework for land 
<br/>acquisition and the need to look at social, economic and the various implications, it is commendable 
<br/>that they look at those implications, given the social issues we face today and the access of vehicles 
<br/>into  our  villages.    Yes,  we  have  noticed  access  of  vehicles,  it  is  good  for  the  village  in  terms  of 
<br/>transporting whatever is needed for the village for positive developments, but it can also give access 
<br/>for transport of illegal items such as drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The framework in terms of looking at before you construct a road, what you need to comply 
<br/>with, that needs to be strengthened as we move forward in terms of the challenging environment we 
<br/>face and what the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, the community or the village would see as what is good for them.  For this 
<br/>particular one, that was the feedback.  We are looking at instead of that, a walkway and the Ministry, 
<br/>towards the end of last year, had worked on the design and scope so it is a longstanding request.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have not specifically budgeted for it, but I have asked the Ministry for us to relook at that 
<br/>and also see what we can do in terms of the current budget.  There are various stakeholders including 
<br/>our development partners who have expressed interest in funding walkways and bridges in terms of 
<br/>difficult areas such as this. In fact, there was a proposal I was reading regarding modular walkways 
<br/>and bridges which was done, but it is specified the various areas in Fiji, I think the former Minister 
<br/>is  aware  of  it  and  that  is  something  we  also  taking  up  in  our  discussions  with  our  development 
<br/>partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask to withdraw this Oral Question that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is under my name.  </span><span>Vinaka.

<div><span>Fiji Aviation Academy’s Strategy in Saving Fiji Airways 
<br/>(Question No. 188/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on what strategy was in place by the Fiji Aviation Academy in 
<br/>saving Fiji Airways over $US10 million (FJD22.7 million) in training bills annually? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to provide an update on the strategic 
<br/>initiatives undertaken by the Fiji Airways particularly through the establishment of the Fiji Airways 
<br/>Aviation Academy.  This Academy is not only an infrastructure investment, it is a testament to our 
<br/>national  airlines  commitment  to  self-reliance,  operational  excellence  and  sustainable  financial 
<br/>management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1771 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  an  increasingly  competitive  global  aviation  market,  the  ability  to  manage  costs  while 
<br/>maintaining high standards of training and safety is paramount.  The Fiji Airways Aviation Academy 
<br/>embodies  this  vision  by  providing  a  robust  solution  to  the  airlines  pilot  training  needs,  yielding 
<br/>significant financial and operational benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  heart  of  the  Fiji  Airways  Aviation  Academy’s  success  lies  a  meticulously  crafted 
<br/>strategy aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in pilot training.  This approach has enabled the airline 
<br/>to realise substantial cost savings amounting to US$10 million of FJ$22.7 million annually.  Allow 
<br/>me to elaborate more on the matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most significant advantages of the Academy is its ability to conduct all necessary 
<br/>training  internally.    This  includes  initial  type  ratings,  common  type  ratings,  recurrent  training, 
<br/>remedial  training  and  licence  conversion.    By  eliminating  the  need  to  outsource  these  training 
<br/>activities to third-party providers, Fiji Airways has avoided substantial fees that would otherwise be 
<br/>paid to external training centres.  This move ensures that every dollar invested in training remains 
<br/>within the company, contributing directly to its financial stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Traditionally,  pilots  were  required  to  travel  to  international  training  locations  such  as 
<br/>Singapore, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Brisbane, Seattle and Bangkok.  These not only incur training fees 
<br/>but also significant costs related to accommodation and subsistence. With the establishment of the 
<br/>Fiji Airways Aviation Academy, these costs have been entirely eliminated. Pilots can now undergo 
<br/>all  necessary  training  within  the  country,  reducing  the  financial  burden  associated  with  overseas 
<br/>travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond accommodation and subsistence, the costs with onward travel to these international 
<br/>locations were also considerable.  The Academy has effectively eradicated these expenses, further 
<br/>contributing to the impressive annual savings achieved by Fiji Airways. While the financial savings 
<br/>achieved through the Fiji Airways are significant, the benefits extend far beyond cost reduction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Academy  has  also  introduced  a  range  of  operational  efficiencies  that  are  driving  the 
<br/>airline’s  success  on  multiple  fronts.    The  Academy  has  also  had  a  profound  impact  on  pilot 
<br/>productivity.  Previously, pilots were required to travel long distances to attend simulator training, 
<br/>which resulted in the loss of duty days and additional rest periods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy represents a bold and forward-thinking 
<br/>investment in the future of our national airline.  The financial savings and operational efficiencies 
<br/>realised through this initiative are a testament to the strategic vision and leadership that guide Fiji 
<br/>Airways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, beyond the numbers, the Academy symbolises something greater, it embodies our 
<br/>collective  commitment  to  building  a  resilient  and  self-sufficient  airline  that  can  weather  the 
<br/>challenges of a dynamic industry. It underscores the importance of innovation, not just as a means of 
<br/>survival, but as a driver of progress and excellence.  Let this be a reminder to us all that that with the 
<br/>right strategy, we can transform challenges into opportunities, and pave the way for a brighter, more 
<br/>prosperous future for Fiji Airways and the nation as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I think at last count, we had about 120-odd local 
<br/>pilots engaged with Fiji Airways and some of them actually coming out of the Academy.  In light of 
<br/>the fact that we have extended our fleet in terms of the A350-900s that we have, the Academy itself 
<br/>has flight simulators that are A330 and below the 787, I think it is, and then the smaller planes. Will 
<br/>the  Academy  be  investing  in  A350  simulators,  if  there  is  a  need  to  do  so  in  terms  of  part  of  its 
<br/>expansion programme because I understand also that there is going to be accommodation, et cetera,

<div><span>           HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you honourable Koya. The simulators at the airport represent 
<br/>the entire fleet of the airline right now, and A350 is also part of it now, honourable Koya. I think in 
<br/>about two weeks’ time, there will be two more that will be launched at the Academy in Nadi. Fiji 
<br/>Airways has about 2,200 staff and the number of pilots has also increased quite significantly and the 
<br/>vast majority, more than 90 percent are locals.  Just to add, the Academy is also hosting pilots from 
<br/>other countries to come and train in Nadi. So that is quite a significant accomplishment on part of 
<br/>Fiji Airways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, this is again one of the great initiatives of the 
<br/>Bainimarama  Government  and  as  you  have  mentioned  that  the  training  is  also  provided  to 
<br/>international  and  regional  airlines.  My  question  to  you  is,  how  much  revenue  has  Fiji  Airways 
<br/>generated from providing this training to regional and international airlines?  We know how much it 
<br/>has saved but how much money has it generated?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Good question, Madam Deputy Speaker.  I am afraid I cannot give 
<br/>an  exact  number  right  now  but  I  can  assure  you,  it  is  quite  significant  because  some  of  these 
<br/>simulators are fully booked throughout the year as an indication of the revenue potential of these 
<br/>simulators.  I can provide that later, Madam Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is what these Ministers say, they do not provide the answers.

<div><span>Commercial Agriculture Development Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 189/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament 
<br/>on  which  sectors  were  assisted  under  the  $2  million  Commercial  Agriculture 
<br/>Development Programme in the 2023-2024 financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>the  question.  In  response  the  Commercial  Agricultural  Development  Programme  was  created  in 
<br/>September  2021  to  address  the  establishment  and  improvement  of  commercial  agriculture  as 
<br/>highlighted in the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways’ Strategic Priority 4 under the Five-Year 
<br/>Strategic Development Plan. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1773 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the 2023-2024 Financial Year, a total of $2 million was allocated 
<br/>which  supported  nine  exporters  and  eleven  food  processors.  This  support  focused  on  expanding, 
<br/>processing  and  storage  capacities  through  improving  electricity  supply  with  the  purchase  of 
<br/>generators, value adding machines, cooler rooms, upgrading of infrastructure and the purchase of 
<br/>solar machines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the supported exporters Kaiming Agro Processing Ltd has 
<br/>managed  to  increase  its  storage  capacity  from  300  tonnes  to  450  tonnes  of  matured  ginger.    The 
<br/>exporter was able to purchase an additional 150 tonnes of matured ginger from farmers in November 
<br/>2023, and early this year, 2024.  This has provided much needed market to accommodate the high 
<br/>volume of ginger crops on the ground, as I highlighted in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  discussions  with  the  Fiji  Trade  Commission  in  the  United  States  of  America, 
<br/>Kaiming Agro Processing Ltd has reached an agreement with the US importers to purchase matured 
<br/>ginger.    This  ginger  undergoes  value  addition  at  their  processing  plants  before  export  to  the  US 
<br/>market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, through the CADP programme, also supported Juice 
<br/>Fiji Pte Limited with three ginger processing machines to increase the intake of ginger from farmers 
<br/>in  Colo-i-Suva, Qiolevu, Lomaivuna and Tailevu areas.  The  company was  producing  1,000 litre 
<br/>bottles of juice a week before the support, and it is producing up to 4,000 litre bottles a week to-date.  
<br/>They have increased their volume of ginger purchased from 200 kilogrammes a week to one tonne a 
<br/>week for processing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The New Valley Processors (Fiji) Pvt Ltd in Sabeto, Nadi has been supported with the three-
<br/>phase power electricity unit to help the company process cassava, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, chillies and vegetables to 
<br/>meet the local demand, as well as for exports to New Zealand and Australia.  The exporter has been 
<br/>working  together  with  partners  in  community  development  and  2,000  ladies  from  eight  districts 
<br/>covering Keiyasi to Nadarivatu in the highlands of Nadroga/Navosa to plant 200,000 bongo chillie 
<br/>plants. With the support provided to New Valley Processors, they will now be able to process weekly 
<br/>340 tonnes of cassava, 100 tonnes of </span><span>dalo,</span><span> 10 tonnes of chillies and 10 tonnes of vegetables for the 
<br/>export market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  support  was  also  provided  to  Tavioka  Organic  Pty  Ltd  with  the 
<br/>three-phase electricity power unit supplied to the factory to run the production of cassava flour using 
<br/>the cassava flour machines.  With the support provided, the company is able to produce up to six 
<br/>tonnes to eight tonnes of cassava flour per day, as compared to two tonnes per day before the support 
<br/>was provided.  As part of our ongoing commitment to help farmers access markets, the Ministry will 
<br/>continue to expand the support directed to food processors and exporters on agriculture export related 
<br/>produce  that  achieves  sustainable  economic  growth  and  export  competitiveness  and  boost  value 
<br/>addition and diversification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  remains  dedicated  to  decreasing  the  importation  of 
<br/>dairy  products,  which  was  valued  at  around  $90  million  in  the  last  fiscal  year.    On  this  end,  the 
<br/>Ministry  has  allocated  $110,000  to  assist  in  the  commercialisation  of  dairy  farming  operations.  
<br/></span><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, 21 dairy farmers have been assisted with fencing materials and dairy sheds 
<br/></span><span>to expand their farms to a commercial level and supply milk to the formal market.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the value of wheat imports was around $140.8 million in 2023, and 
<br/>the Ministry has supported Women’s Groups to the sum of $100,000 to purchase 30 machines for 
<br/>the  production  of  cassava  flour  as  a  substitute  to  imported  wheat  flour.  Support  to  the  Women’s 
<br/>Groups  have  also  been  provided  in  the  form  of  capacity  building,  training  on  the  harvesting  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processing  of  cassava  to  produce  flour.    The  broader  objective  is  for  the  Women’s  Groups  to  be 
<br/>formed into co-operatives and combine their flour production firstly to meet domestic needs then to 
<br/>commercialise their operations to supply cassava floor to the formal market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the $150,000 was allocated to support the commercialisation of high 
<br/>value  crops.    These  include  green  pearl  guava,  dragon  fruit,  mango,  avocado,  bananas,  coconut 
<br/>breadfruit and citrus which includes oranges, lime and lemon.  Through their support, 420 farmers 
<br/>have been trained in fruit tree propagation techniques to rapidly increase the numbers of trees and 
<br/>yield.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The support also include the establishment of nurseries and its associated capacity building 
<br/>trainings for farmers to improve their fruit orchards.  There is a huge potential for these high-value 
<br/>crops to meet the hotel sector demands, however, the volume of production, consistency and quality 
<br/>of these high-value crops needs to be improved before the hotel markets can be accessed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, $100,000 was allocated to support 10 youth farming clusters to raise 
<br/>their farm operations to a commercial level. This include the provision of infrastructure materials to 
<br/>construct farm sheds, water tanks for  rainwater harvesting. The farm sheds and water supply was 
<br/>provided to assist with the harvesting, processing and storage of farm produce for the formal markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  considering  the  characteristics  and  nature  of  agriculture,  it  is 
<br/>anticipated that the result of these interventions will become evident in the not too distant future. This 
<br/>is an opportunity to shape the future of our rural dwellers in a new era of prosperity and progress for 
<br/>our beloved nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We have a supplementary question from honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  from  the  $2  million  that  was  part  of  the 
<br/>development  programme,  I  only  heard  you  speak  about  one  organic  farmer  that  was  assisted.  
<br/>Because it such a huge value-add to us in terms of getting more money to our farmers, was that $2 
<br/>million or did part of that $2 million have a dedicated portion to our organic farmers or looking at 
<br/>creating more organic farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Yes, I agree with the honourable Member that organic farming 
<br/>is a high value method of farming in terms of the demand for organic products worldwide and the 
<br/>Ministry has dedicated personnel working on organic farming.  In fact, years ago we have already 
<br/>developed the organic standards through been farming with the help of Pacific Community (SPC), 
<br/>but I do agree with the honourable Member that there should be more done by the Ministry in terms 
<br/>of developing the organic production even though it is a niche market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I must thank the honourable Minister for a very 
<br/>comprehensive reply. Listening to him, I see a large chunk of the assistance has gone to the exporters 
<br/>and the processors of the agriculture product. Can the honourable Minister explain why a significant 
<br/>check  was  not  used  to  assist  the  commercial  farmers  in  leveraging  their  production  so  they  can 
<br/>increase their production and then it goes to the processors?  Development should be on the farm first 
<br/></span><span>and then to the processors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>that question. It is really chicken and egg and egg and chicken; hen and egg, egg and hen situation.   
<br/>I  had  already  informed  the  House  previously,  that  we  are  facing  problems  in  the  export  of  fresh 
<br/>agriculture products to our traditional export markets.  I had already stated also that this is the way 
<br/>we want to go. We want to develop agro-processing and value addition locally, so that, first of all, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1775 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we get our people to get used to consuming locally produce products first before we even think of 
<br/>exports.  When we assist the agro processors going into value addition, the moment their capacity 
<br/>increases like I have made known this morning, it is the farmers that benefit directly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In commercial farming you have to produce for a market, it is either you produce for a market 
<br/>and you have a ready-made contract done or you will lose out and all your production will  go to 
<br/>waste and it has happened.  We are learning from history and trying to do something about it.  In this 
<br/>case,  as  we  have  heard  this  morning,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  agro  processors  that  we  have 
<br/>assisted  have  increased  their  capacity  to  buy  local  agriculture  produce  and  that  in  itself  is  a  big 
<br/>positive.  I do understand where my colleague is coming from, but we have other programmes that 
<br/>assist production directly within the Ministry’s budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of Standing Tree Compensation  
<br/>(Question No. 190/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament 
<br/>of the current  status  of Standing Tree Compensation for landowning  units  whose land 
<br/>were leased to the State for water catchment purposes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.VOSAROGO.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  honourable  Vanawalu  this 
<br/>morning. Perhaps, may I be permitted within the time available just to explain this, rather interesting, 
<br/>but quite often misread and not a lot of accurate information is out in the public domain about this 
<br/>important topic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  are  all  aware,  standing  trees  are  important,  and  play  a  very  critical  role  in  water 
<br/>catchment areas as they stabilise the soil and reduce erosion.  Secondly, they regulate water flow to 
<br/>mitigate floods and droughts.  Thirdly, more importantly, is they purify water thus improving the 
<br/>water quality that we uptake in our tanks everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By way of a legal framework, Madam Deputy Speaker, section 5 of the State Lands Act 1945, 
<br/>provides that any land taken on lease by the State shall be made out to the Director of Lands. Water 
<br/>catchment leases are currently leased under this provision as it is a lease for public purpose in the 
<br/>provision of water to all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Government, the Director of Lands negotiates with the landowning units as 
<br/>well as with iTLTB, whilst rivers and streams themselves, the ground upon which water flows from 
<br/>hills  to  river  belongs  to  the  State  for  public  use.    The  catchment  dry  areas  around  the  rivers  and 
<br/>streams belongs to mostly all of these catchment areas that belong to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Fiji  has  no  existing  policy  on  Standing  Trees  Compensation.  
<br/>Currently, compensation for Standing Trees is being guided by a Cabinet Decision of 1987 which 
<br/>provides that should any merchantable timber be removed, royalty is to be paid. I emphasise that the 
<br/>payment is upon removal of the tree.  But since water catchment leases condition that lessee, that is, 
<br/></span><span>the Director of Lands, is leasing the catchment area shall not dispose or by sale take or injure any 
<br/></span><span>forest,  trees  or  otherwise  any  forest  produce  growing  upon  the  demised  land  without  the  written 
<br/>consent of iTLTB, and such conditions as to the payment of royalty or otherwise prescribed by the 
<br/>Forest Regulations as the lessor may direct, consequently compensation is only applied to trees or 
<br/>forest which have been fell or removed. But because the primary purpose of the catchment area is to 
<br/>maintain the quality  of water therefore,  all standing trees  around it are not  fell and therefore, not 
<br/>compensatable. At the moment, as I had mentioned before, there are no policies on Standing Trees 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on catchment areas and as usual, as one would expect that payments can and will only be made if 
<br/>there is a Cabinet directive or, of course, if there is a change in law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, recently, in a Cabinet decision in 2024, we have approved a paper 
<br/>on  Standing  Trees  Compensation  for  Water  Catchment  Leases.  The  review  will  also  include  the 
<br/>development of a policy which is yet to be brought back to Cabinet and in the formulation of that 
<br/>policy, there is going to be strong consultations with the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, of course, 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance, the Lands Valuation Chief Valuer and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. After 
<br/>the formulation of this policy, we should be able to have a very clear pathway and an executable 
<br/>document on how to deal with Standing Trees that exist on water catchment areas.

<div><span>Curbing Drug-Related Offences and HIV Cases  
<br/>(Question No. 191/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament 
<br/>on  what  measures  have  been  taken  to  curb  the  surge  in  drug-related  offences  among 
<br/>young people and the doubling of HIV cases among our youths in recent years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable 
<br/>Member for his question.  The global picture of HIV is decreasing, in comparison to the last decade, 
<br/>and Fiji’s story is a bit different.  Fiji is showing to be the second fastest-growing nation with new 
<br/>HIV cases in the Asia-Pacific region, and we are second only to the Philippines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  HIV  cases  have  significantly  increased  over  the  years,  in  2023,  the  Government 
<br/>has exposed the issue of Injectable Drug Use (IDU) as a significant issue in Fiji.  In 2024 alone, Fiji 
<br/>has seen in the first six months of</span><span> </span><span>the year, we have had seen 552 new HIV cases in Fiji of which 15 
<br/>percent were secondary to Injectable Drug Use and this is the first time Fiji has noted this increase.  
<br/>The question is asking what measures have been taken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to highlight that the Ministry is committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of our 
<br/>youths  by  combining  awareness,  prevention and  community  engagement. In  light  of  these 
<br/>challenges, the Ministry has taken steps to strengthen its HIV response and drug use through: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  development  of  national  strategic  plans,  partnership  with  civil  society 
<br/>organisations,  and implementation  of  prevention,  diagnostics,  treatment  and  care 
<br/>programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Leading  the  Harm  Reduction  and  Rehabilitation sub-committee  of  the  Counter 
<br/>Narcotics Committee in managing the activities of the Committee's action plans.  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Efforts  made  to  increase  access  to  HIV testing  and  treatment  services  across  the 
<br/>nation in  a  decentralised  manner,  promoting  harm reduction  initiatives  and  reducing 
<br/>stigma and discrimination against individuals affected by HIV and drug use.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Finalising the Fiji National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027 which will be submitted to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  strategy  has  five  key  priority  areas  and support  the  development  of  the  strategic 
<br/>plan which addresses the need to  reduce HIV transmissions and expedite public health, treatment 
<br/>care, human right and social justice for HIV and drug use.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this financial year, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government has allocated a budget of 
<br/>$200,000  for  the  HIV/AIDS Prevention  and  Control  Programmes  and  the Ministry  will  explore

<div><span>additional funding option through donors and other relevant stakeholders who will contribute to the 
<br/>implementing strategic framework.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had mentioned, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is an issue for Fiji, and it is something not 
<br/>only the Ministry of Health is responsible for taking care of it.  It is a whole of Government and 
<br/>whole of society approach and what the Ministry is currently doing right now, and we are grateful 
<br/>with the development partners for assisting us in this space.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Madam  Deputy  Speaker, with  70 percent  spike in newly reported 
<br/>HIV cases from 2022 to 2023 is really alarming for our beloved nation.  Will the Ministry of Health 
<br/>consider boosting funding to provide a range of testing options at community-based testing and early 
<br/>antenatal care tests for all pregnant women? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Testing for antenatal care has been there for some 
<br/>time  now,  in  terms  of  testing  for  certain  number  of  diseases,  that  is  part  of  antenatal  care.    But 
<br/>nevertheless, as rightly mentioned, the point of care testing, that is something  that the Ministry is 
<br/>trying to enhance or improve on when it is decentralising the point of care testing right down to the 
<br/>sub-divisional hospital and health centre, if it may be.  What we are seeing with the rise in numbers 
<br/>now is mostly attributed to the increase in the number of testing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Minister, given that a lot of HIVs have been attributed to 
<br/>injectable drugs, is there any consideration of programmes around controlling the sale of syringes or 
<br/>Safe Syringe Programmes? Is there any consideration of things around that area?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Usamate.    There  are 
<br/>programmes through which the surge strategy will try and incorporate but it has to be contextualised 
<br/>in our setting.  One is, as you had mentioned, the Safe Syringe Programme. It has to be seen to be 
<br/>not only reducing the transmission from injectable drug use but also from the perspective of, are we 
<br/>advocating for more drug use.  So, it has to be done in the right context and it is also included in the 
<br/>surge strategy that will be a discussion that has to be done, with not only the Ministry or Government 
<br/>but with the relevant stakeholders.

<div><span>MOU Between Suva City Council and Pacific Polytech 
<br/>(Question No. 192/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the Memorandum of Understanding that was signed between the Suva City Council 
<br/>and Pacific Polytech? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. The engagement 
<br/>with  Pacific  Polytech  is  a  strategic  initiative  that  marks  a  significant  milestone  with  ongoing 
<br/>institutional  reforms  at  the  Suva  City  Council.    This  partnership  is  not  just  about  immediate 
<br/>improvements,  it  is  a  forward-looking  collaboration  aimed  at  positioning  Suva  City  Council  as  a 
<br/></span><span>leader in municipal governance, climate resilience and sustainable development in the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  initial  engagement  with  Pacific  Polytech  was  a  result  of 
<br/>proactive efforts by the Suva Council’s Special Administrator who recognised the critical need for 
<br/>institutional strengthening to meet the demands of modern urban governance.  This MOU which was 
<br/>signed on 12</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024, is a product of thorough planning, consultations and a shared vision for

<br/>those in waste management and related services will receive upskilling opportunities that 
<br/>are aligned with international best practices. This will not only improve service delivery 
<br/>but also empower a workforce to contribute more effectively to the Council’s objectives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Climate  change  mitigation,  the  partnership  includes  the  development  of  innovative 
<br/>strategies to address climate related challenges particularly in waste management.  This is 
<br/>aligned to the Coalition Government’s commitment on environmental sustainability and 
<br/>climate resilience, ensuring that Suva City is better prepared to face challenges of the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (3)   Operational excellence, the first implementation of the MOU ensures that training is 
<br/>timely, relevant and aligned with the immediate and long-term needs of the Council.  
<br/>Each phase will be followed by a review and evaluation to ensure that we are meeting 
<br/>the goals and continuously improving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the benefits of partnership are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Formal  qualification  -  SCC  employees  will  have  an  opportunity  to  gain  recognised 
<br/>qualifications,  enhancing  their  career  prospects  and  contributing  to  a  more  skilled  and 
<br/>motivated workforce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Enhanced service delivery - With the improved skills and knowledge, staff performance 
<br/>will see a marked improvement, leading to a more efficient, and more effective service 
<br/>delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>More strategic and social issue - by outsourcing training to experts such as Pacific Polytech, 
<br/>SCC staff can focus on their core responsibilities ensuring that resources are used where 
<br/>they are most needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  initiative,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  is  a  testament  to  our  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>commitment to building a stronger and more resilient Suva City Council.  It reflects a broader vision 
<br/>on municipal councils across Fiji, a vision of modern government cities that are equipped to meet the 
<br/>challenges of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  financial  investment  in  this  engagement  has  been  carefully 
<br/>calculated to ensure that it delivers its value for money.  The courses are within the allocated budget 
<br/>for SCC’s institutional strengthening initiatives that are supported by a combination of operational 
<br/>funds, grant funding and contributions from development partners.  It is not just an expenditure, it is 
<br/></span><span>a strategic investment to the future of Suva City.  Moreover, the Suva City Council is committed to 
<br/></span><span>sharing the knowledge and best practices gained from this engagement with other municipal councils 
<br/>across  Fiji.    We  are  actively  planning  workshops,  seminars,  distribution  of  operational  reports  to 
<br/>ensure the benefits of this initiative are felt beyond Suva City. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  partnership  with  Pacific  Polytech  is  complemented  to  the 
<br/>ongoing work by the Local Government in New Zealand, particularly in areas of waste management 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>and climate resilience.  Aligned with aligned with Local Government in New Zealand standards, we 
<br/>are  ensuring  that  Suva  City’s  cultural  strategies  are  not  only  locally  relevant  but  also  meet 
<br/>international  best  practices.    This  is  a  clear  indication  of  our  commitment  to  Government’s 
<br/>excellence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking to the future, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Suva City Council’s long-term plan is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>built on three pillars: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Continuous improvement will ensure that staff receive ongoing professional development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunities to keep pace with the evolving demands of open governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening of governance, enhancing internal controls and governance framework to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure transparency, accountability and efficiency in all operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Strategic  partnerships  will continue to  build  and maintain  partnerships  with  educational 
<br/>institutions,  local  governments  and  international  bodies  to  remain  at  the  forefront  of 
<br/>innovation and best practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  while  we  acknowledge  the  challenges  we  face  including  staff 
<br/>availability, change management and financial constraints that tackle these issues at home, through 
<br/>careful planning, active stakeholder engagement and continuous monitoring, we are confident that 
<br/>the objectives of this MOU will be met and the future of Suva City Council will be brighter than 
<br/>ever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I have two questions  - part (a) and part (b).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  advise  us  if  there  is  any  monitoring  involvement  in  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partnership or MOU between Pacific Polytech and the Suva City Council? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Is that the first of your two follow-up questions?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Madam.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I think I had also shared in my response one of the  key focus of 
<br/>this MOU, which is operational excellence where, in each phase, there will be a review as well as an 
<br/>evaluation, to ensure that the training meets the goals as well as the objectives of the MOU.  If there 
<br/>is  continuous  improvement,  that  can  also  be  reviewed  by  the  Ministry,  as  well  as  the  Suva  City 
<br/>Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Your second follow-up question, honourable Lal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  my  first  question  was  basically  if  Suva  City 
<br/>Council is paying Polytech for certain trainings, and if so, we normally have FNU levy that employers 
<br/>pay to NTPC. If I am correct, it is a one percent levy.  If Suva City Council is paying that levy to 
<br/>NTPC, should not Suva City Council first give the chance to NTPC and utilise that levy?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I think the question raised by the honourable Member is a valid 
<br/></span><span>one, but that levy is not only used by the city council, it is also used by ACCF as well as LTA.  The 
<br/></span><span>objective of having this initiative is to encourage and facilitate the upskilling and capacity building 
<br/>within Suva City Council because there is an urgent need right now to upskill the workers, especially 
<br/>those who look after garbage collection, even waste management as well as other related services.  
<br/>Suva City Council sees the need for it and that is the reason why we have engaged Polytech to provide 
<br/>training to Suva City Council.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I can see him getting very angsty, thank you honourable Ketan, I will 
<br/>allow this one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. K.K. LAL.- My concern here, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that the Prime Minister, the 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers raised concerns in terms of saving money for the Government and here we 
<br/>have Suva City Council going to Polytech and paying another set of funding for training purposes 
<br/>when they can utilise the same funding with NTPC and our other established universities like FNU.  I 
<br/>hope the honourable Minister can reassure us that in future they will utilise that FNU levy that they 
<br/>have been paying or employees have been paying and upskill and train their workers and officers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I do not think that was a question, that was a 
<br/>statement. Thank you, I am sure the honourable Minister has taken note of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Criteria for Appointment of District Advisory Councillors 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 193/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  inform  Parliament,  if  the  criteria  for  the  appointment  of  District  Advisory 
<br/>Councillors have been strictly adhered to in all appointments since January 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the question was originally supposed to be 
<br/>asked by honourable Nath but I suppose his gone abroad, on a visit somewhere.  The nature of the 
<br/>question has also changed a bit. The original question simply asked the criteria for the selection of 
<br/>the District Advisory Councillors which I had prepared for, but I will also answer the other question 
<br/>that has been asked by the honourable Member.  I thank the honourable Member for the question, I 
<br/>think it is a topic that we are all familiar with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main purpose of the District Advisory Council was to provide a forum for multi-ethnic 
<br/>and  minority  communities  to  participate  in  the  discussion  and  decision-making  on  development 
<br/>issues in their respective settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The District Advisory Council is a crucial component of the rural development framework.  It 
<br/>plays  an  important  role  in  the  identification  of  development  needs,  as  well  as  providing  support 
<br/>during response to natural disasters by the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/>Management  for  communities  outside  of  registered  village  boundaries  in  the  rural  and  maritime 
<br/>areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 302 constituencies in the 16 District Advisory Councils across the country.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>number of Councils and constituencies by Division are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Central Division – four Councils with 71 constituencies; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Eastern Division – one Council with eight constituencies; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division – five Councils with 81 constituencies; and  
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Western Division – six Councils with 142 constituencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the number of members in each Council varies with the lowest for 
<br/>the  Eastern  Division  comprising  only  of  eight  members,  and  the  highest  number  being  for  the 
<br/>Nadroga/ Navosa comprising of 30 members.  The term of District Advisory Council members is 
<br/>two years, and the current appointments will lapse on 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2025.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1781 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  criteria  for  appointment,  there  is  a  guideline  for  administration  of  District  Advisory 
<br/>Councils which clearly stipulates the criteria for appointment of District Advisory Council members.  
<br/>In summary, a Council should have members whose skills, experience and attributes together reflect 
<br/>balance, cohesion,  and ability to contribute effectively to the district.  It  should also reflect a fair 
<br/>representation in terms of area, gender and ethnicity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  per  the  guidelines,  the  criteria  for  appointment  includes  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Educational  requirement:  The  candidate  must  have  completed  Year  12  education  or  an 
<br/>equivalent qualification to ensure they can effectively read, write and provide support on 
<br/>all Government policies and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Professional and ethical standards: The candidate must uphold high professional and ethical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>standards reflected in their conduct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Character and legal standing: The candidate must possess good character, be sober minded 
<br/>and  maintain  a  clean  police  record  for  the  past  10  years.    However,  Divisional 
<br/>Commissioners may recommend individuals based on their good character and extensive 
<br/>community work after rehabilitation period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Medical fitness: The candidate must be medically fit and of sound health as certified by a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>medical doctor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Preference is given to candidates under the age of 60 years. 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Service record: The candidate must have a proven record of service and commitment to the 
<br/>district  or  at  the  community  level  supported  by  a  resume  and  character  reference  from 
<br/>credible community figure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Residency requirement: The candidate must be a permanent resident of the constituency 
<br/>they represent.  They must have resided in the community for at least 12 months prior to 
<br/>the consideration.  This must be confirmed with a letter from the District Officer.   
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Employment status: The  candidate may hold other employment  except for  civil  service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>positions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Political  neutrality:  The  candidate  must  be  apolitical  and  not  actively  involved  in  party 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>politics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Financial Standing: The candidate must not be declared bankrupt.  
<br/>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Tax compliant: The candidate must be compliant with tax obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, these are the criteria for appointments to District Advisory Councils.  
<br/>I  just  like  to  note  that  the  Coalition  Government  does  not  agree  with  having  Ministerial  Vetting 
<br/>Committee  to  review  recommendations  that  are  submitted  from  the  Divisional  Commissioners 
<br/>Offices in its efforts to ensure that it appoints members that are apolitical.  There are some discussions 
<br/>that will be going on after this.  In answer to the question regarding the criteria, yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I just wanted to assure the honourable 
<br/>Minister that the change in the question was because of the protest from Members of the Business 
<br/>Committee who probably went beyond the guideline to appoint some.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question to the honourable Minister is, in 2022 during the Opening of Parliament, the 
<br/></span><span>Government made a commitment, and that was part of His Excellency’s Address that Government 
<br/></span><span>will hold elections for Municipal Councils, Sugar Cane Growers Council and the Advisory Councils 
<br/>as well. Is that still under consideration and will Government ensure that that is done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker, yes, that is  still part of the consideration. 
<br/>There is quite some work to do because of the constituency boundaries that we have to draw up. We 
<br/>believe the lines of the constituencies that we have at the moment are quite outdated and they do not 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reflect the communities that are there at the moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of movement and in some places the representation that has been represented 
<br/>by  the  District  Advisory  Councillors  does  not  represent  the  numbers  of  the  communities  that  are 
<br/>there. We believe that there needs to be a thorough study done and that is what we are doing at the 
<br/>moment to make sure that the constituency boundaries for District Advisory Council is done properly 
<br/>before we go into the elections which we had promised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what my good friend had just said is totally 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>different on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- </span><span>Are yaar!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- God is watching!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Let us remember that. I want to make it very clear that all those Advisory 
<br/>Councillors that have been appointed are all political appointments. I can get a list, you will find most 
<br/>of them were the campaign managers of different political parties. That is alright, it all water under 
<br/>the bridge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, my real concern is… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Sir, I am sorry to interrupt, do you actually have a question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, the bell has just gone, please ask your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The Councillors that have been appointed are not from that respective 
<br/>areas. They reside in different areas and it becomes very difficult for the community to reach out to 
<br/>their Advisory Councillors. Can I suggest to the honourable Minister if they can find someone from 
<br/>that respective area to serve the community in those districts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the concerns raised by my honourable friend 
<br/>is duly noted and we will surely take it on board. Just before I take my seat, I just like to remind our 
<br/>honourable Members on the other side that when we came in, we inherited a situation that is not 
<br/>ideal. In one particular municipality which I will not name, there was a representative of a political 
<br/>party who was also Chair of the District Advisory Council over there. He was issued a Government 
<br/>mobile phone and had use of Government facilities as well. According to the civil servants over there, 
<br/></span><span>they were quite afraid for their jobs because some civil servants in the past, because of the reports of 
<br/></span><span>that particular District Advisory Councillor had lost their jobs.  I will leave it at that and I believe 
<br/>what we want to do is rectify that, so that will never ever get back to that kind of situation again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members,  I  am  aware that there  are  a few honourable 
<br/>Members who are having a lunch appointment with the delegation from Japan and I would like to 
<br/>keep us on time.
