<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs  hereby  submits  to  Parliament  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Fiji  Meat  Industry 
<br/>Board 2018-2022 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB) was established under the Fiji Meat Industry Act</span><span> </span><span>237 
<br/>of 1970.    In 1976, the Suva Abattoir was  established at  9 Miles, Nasinu,  to  provide  slaughtering 
<br/>services  in  the  Central  Division.    In  the  same  year,  a  rendering  plant  was  established  next  to  the 
<br/>Abattoir to make high-quality leather. The company ventured out into animal feed by using the by-
<br/>products from the Abattoir and fish processing facilities.  The Suva property sits on 35.4 hectares of 
<br/>State land. The land has a 75-year Crown lease granted on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, 1976.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Vuda  abattoir  was  established  later  at  Vuda  Point  in  1983.  It  caters  for  the  slaughter 
<br/>services in the Western Division. The Vuda property sits on 6.35 hectares of Native land. The land 
<br/>tenure is a 75-year Native lease granted on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 1982. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The core function of FMIB is to provide slaughtering services for butchers in Fiji. It has now 
<br/>ventured  into  a  </span><span>magiti</span><span>  concept  where  it  also  provides  services  for  social  obligations  to  meet  our 
<br/>diverse markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIB is committed to providing slaughtering and processing services in facilities that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are of international standard to meet safety, hygiene and quality standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIB has also ventured into implementing a food safety programme that complies with 
<br/>the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles and conforms to guidance issued by 
<br/>the Food Safety Act 2003, Food Safety Regulations 2009 and Meat Industry Act 1993. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pertinent issues identified by the Committee are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)  The FMIB incurred losses from 2018 to 2021, except in 2022, when it recorded a small 
<br/>profit  of  $108,134.  This  profit  is  largely  attributed  to  a  reduction  in  the  number  of 
<br/>employees.  The ongoing losses have been driven by low throughput and the rising cost 
<br/>of operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)  From 2018-2022, FMIB received an average of 8,542 cattle; 14,533 pigs; 347 sheep; 
<br/>and  1,548  goats,  for  slaughter  annually.  To  break  even,  FMIB  needs  approximately 
<br/>20,000 cattle per year and 30,000 pigs per year. Currently, the Abattoir is not working 
<br/>at  full  capacity  due  to  a  decline  in  livestock  numbers,  resulting  in  low  number  of 
<br/>livestock going through the Abattoir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)  The  livestock  numbers  have  steadily  declined  over  the  years  due  to  prevalence  of 
<br/>diseases  such  as  Tuberculosis  and  Brucellosis,  and  the  decline  in  sugarcane  farmers 
<br/>engaging  in  rearing  livestock  which  has  significantly  impacted  livestock  population. 
<br/>Additionally,  poor  pasture  management  and  the  rising  cost  of  feed,  have  further 
<br/>contributed to the reduction in livestock numbers and the lack of interest by farmers. 
<br/>This decline poses a broader threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (4)   There are several challenges affecting FMIB, such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)   Needed investment to modernise facilities to meet new requirements for food 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>handling, hygiene and security; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)   A review of the Meat Industry Act 1969 is urgently needed to address the current 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issues facing the meat industry;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)   Bush slaughter needs to be curbed for health and commercial purposes; 
<br/>(d)   Meat grading needs to be introduced to protect consumers and farmers; 
<br/>(e)   Farmers are short changed where only carcass is weighed and paid and not the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offal; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(f)   Sharp increase in production cost; and  
<br/>(g)   Low livestock numbers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (5)  Poor coordination and collaboration between FMIB and the Animal Health Division of 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is one of the problems that we have also 
<br/>identified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (6)  The incentives, particularly the grant of around $717,000(fencing kit support for beef, 
<br/>goat and sheep, beef stockyard, goat and sheep shed, goat rearing, pig farrowing crates 
<br/>and  piggery  pan  development)  provided  to  livestock  farmers  have  not  led  to  any 
<br/>noticeable increase in livestock production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)  Committee  also  noted  that  the  FMIB  and  Yaqara  Pastoral  Company  Pte  Limited 
<br/>(YPCL) are not collaborating effectively to boost livestock production and move Fiji 
<br/>towards self-sufficiency. (8) In addition, FMIB still relies on external service providers 
<br/>to develop 5-year Strategic Plan and to prepare accounts at a cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, FMIB still relies on external service providers to develop 5-year Strategic 
<br/>Plan and to prepare accounts at a cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)   FMIB  has  $31.9  million  worth  of  investment  property,  primarily  consisting  of  land, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is yielding no returns for the company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)  FMIB’s plans to improve profitability by setting up a restaurant, venturing into sausage 
<br/>production, and exporting pork and beef to the regional market raises concern. These 
<br/>initiatives are not the core business of FMIB, particularly when livestock production is 
<br/>declining.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (11)   The  annual  reports  did  not  contain  any  performance  matrix  aligned  with  the  Key 
<br/>Performance  Indicators  (KPIs),  making  it  difficult  to  assess  the  performance  of  the 
<br/>FMIB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(12)  The  Committee  also  noted  that  FMIB  did  not  report  on  relevant  Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals (SDGs), which is a mandatory requirement of all Annual Reports 
<br/>presented to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (13)  The Committee also noted that although FMIB depends on animals as its primary input, 
<br/>the  Company  has  not  considered  the  option  of  utilising  land  for  animal  rearing  or 
<br/>producing young calves, kids, lamb and piglets for distribution to interested farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  extend  my  gratitude  to  the  Chairperson  of  the  FMIB  Board,  Dr.  Kenneth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cokanasiga, and his staff, for their timely assistance in this inquiry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that produced this report, the:

<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report on the Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to present the Report of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Review of the Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mandated under Standing  Order 109 (2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Nadi  Town  Council,  being  one  of  the  oldest  municipalities  and  known  for  actively 
<br/>contributing to the tourism sector in Fiji, the potential for investment has been optimistic and these 
<br/>foreign investments have led to an increase in development and population as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Nadi Town Council is the, therefore, embarking on a  proposal  for an extension of its 
<br/>town boundaries to cater for the increasing population and to continue with the necessary processes 
<br/>of declaring Nadi as a city. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The year 2016 was a great year that affected most people in Fiji, and Nadi was no exception, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with widespread devastation and loss of life, on the infrastructure and the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  concerns  raised  by  the  Council  in  its  key  findings,  particularly  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>constant flooding of Nadi Town.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I extend my gratitude and appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer and Management of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadi Town Council for their contribution in this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  former  Chairperson  of  the  Committee,  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry,  for  her  leadership  and  guidance;  the  former 
<br/>Committee Members, honourable Parveen Bala, and Alternate Members, honourable Ketan Lal and
