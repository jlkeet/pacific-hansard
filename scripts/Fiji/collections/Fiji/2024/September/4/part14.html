<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Activities  funded  under  the  Dalo  Farming  Programme  included  the  procurement  of 
<br/>planting  materials,  agro-input,  infrastructure  development,  land  clearing,  land 
<br/>preparation, technical advisory services, and implementation and support services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Dalo Farming Programme is a crucial program implemented by the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways where it supported the roles of men and women in the </span><span>dalo</span><span>
<br/>farming.    Through  the  Programme,  it  could  was  observed  that  </span><span>dalo</span><span>  farming  is  a 
<br/>collective  household  member  activity  where  men,  women,  girls  and  boys  are  all 
<br/>involved in the farming process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The process is that women and girls are involved in </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers’ sorting, selection, 
<br/>and  making  bundles  during  harvesting.  The  </span><span>dalo</span><span>  land  preparation,  land  cultivation, 
<br/>harvesting, and transporting are done by men and boys. The </span><span>dalo </span><span>planting and weeding 
<br/>are often carried out collectively, that is, men, women, girls, and boys all participate.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic benefits include an increase in income received by farmers. 
<br/>Environment benefits through best farming practices  adopted via intercropping and 
<br/>integrated farming systems with agro forestry systems has been practiced. 
<br/>Social benefits for farmers </span><span>include infrastructural</span><span> development - house improvements 
<br/>(renovations),  footpath,  improvements  on  water  systems,  purchase  of  vehicle,  et 
<br/>cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the projected Return of Investment for this Programme indicates that for

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Environmental benefits through best farming practices adopted via intercropping and
