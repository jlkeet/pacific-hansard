<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and those watching proceedings on the 
<br/>television and internet.  I particularly extend a warm welcome to those of you in the public gallery 
<br/>and our friends in the media.  Thank you for taking the time to join us today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Official Event Invitation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, with due consideration to the official event later this evening, you will 
<br/>receive your invitations too, I assure you that right now.  But if you have not received it yet, I will 
<br/>make sure that you receive those invitations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amended Order Paper 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that items  on yesterday’s  Order Paper  -  five Oral  Questions, a Motion and Written 
<br/>Questions, have been moved to today’s Order Paper, I will allow only one supplementary question 
<br/>from the Opposition side during question time, and this is only for today.  I thank you, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Members, for your understanding.  We will proceed to the next item.   
<br/></span></div>
