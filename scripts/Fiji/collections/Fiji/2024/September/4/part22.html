<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Background 2022 
<br/>Fiji became a member of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) in June 2022. As 
<br/>part of its membership requirements, Fiji needed to form a Local Education Group which 
<br/>includes  Education  Sector  stakeholders.  As  such,  the  Education  Partner  Group  (EPG) 
<br/></span><span>was  established  in  2022,  co chaired  by  the  MOE  (PSE)  and  the  Australian  High 
<br/></span><span>Commission (First Secretary AHC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With GPE membership, Fiji received a System Capacity Grant (SCG) allocation of 
<br/>USD1.5 million with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as Grant Agent, and 
<br/>DFAT is the Coordinating Agent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An Enabling Factors Analysis (EFA) was produced by a core technical team, with 
<br/>active engagement across the Ministry, and, at key points, contributions from education 
<br/>stakeholders  and  partners  to  identify  key  priority  areas  for  the  Ministry  that  needs 
<br/>support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Enabling Factor Analysis (EFA) identified the following priorities: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Education Sector Analysis (ESA) which is an  in-depth and holistic analysis 
<br/>of our education system. The objective is to ascertain and understand how the 
<br/>education system is  currently working and  how it can be improved. The ESA 
<br/>provides  the  evidence  base  for  decision-making  in  preparing  the  Education 
<br/></span><span>Sector Plan. 
<br/></span><span>The drafting and development of the ten-year Education Sector Plan (ESP 2024-
<br/>2034),  as  well  as  the  extensive  planning  and  consultation  process  for  the  Fiji 
<br/>National Education Summit (FNES).  The FNES was convened in September 
<br/>2023. 
<br/>An MOE ESP consultant was engaged to start work on the MOE ESP in 2022, 
<br/>followed  by  a  series  of  workshop  conducted  for  MOE  officials  and  its 
<br/>stakeholders.

<div><span>The work of the consultant involved field work, consultations, research with MOE 
<br/>stakeholders  and  partners:  Donor  partners,  faith-based  organizations,  teachers, 
<br/>Heads  of  Schools,</span><span> </span><span>students,  community  members,  Teacher  Unions,  Teacher 
<br/>Training Institutions (TTIs), tertiary  students. 
<br/>The  ESA  will  provide  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the  current  status  of  the  Education 
<br/>S ector.

<div><span>Article III.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Compact Document</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The compact document is the roadmap to transformation. It articulates how a GPE 
<br/>partner country intends to work with others around a priority reform with the potential 
<br/>to catalyse systemwide change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The partner country leads and develops its compact with the support of an inclusive local 
<br/>education group. The compact document is shared with the GPE Board, which uses it as 
<br/>a basis for decision-making for GPE funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  develop  the  partnership  Compact,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Fiji  planning  unit 
<br/></span><span>convened  a  broad  technical  group  involving  all  its  departments,  ministerial  advisors, 
<br/>partners, and pre-summit consultation workshops in Fiji's four geographical Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  compact  document  aims  to  strengthen  system-wide  collaboration  to  enhance 
<br/>teaching quality, thereby, improve learning outcomes. The compact document has since 
<br/>been  submitted  to  the  GPE  for  which  approval  has  been  granted.  The  release  of  the 
<br/>compact funding is dependent on the receipt of the Programme Development  document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A consultant has been engaged to develop the Programme Development document from 
<br/>the  Compact  Priority  Areas  as  identified  by  MOE.  This  document  is  currently  being 
<br/>drafted by the consultant and submission is due in the last quarter of 2024.
