<div><span>Update on the Review of the iTaukei Affairs Act 
<br/>(Question No. 172/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts inform 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the status of the review of the iTaukei Affairs Act? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Niudamu for the question.  The 
<br/>overarching  objective  of  the  review  of  the  iTaukei  Affairs  Act  is  twofold  -  the  economic 
<br/>empowerment of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and the strengthening of </span><span>vanua</span><span> governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs undertook the review of the iTaukei Affairs Act, not only to 
<br/>improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its service delivery but to improve the overall wellbeing 
<br/>of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The request for the Expression of Interest was published on 9</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2023, and it was 
<br/>closed  on  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  December,  2023.  At  its  closing,  seven  applications  were  received  and  four  were 
<br/>shortlisted for the interview.  After going through the relevant process, one was selected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The team signed a four-month contract on 6</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024. The work commenced immediately 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and will be completed on 17</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024, in two weeks’ time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review team’s work is guided by the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG). 
<br/>The  review  is  divided  into  five  phases  where  in  each  phase,  the  team  presents  an  update  to  the 
<br/>Strategic Advisory Group.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review team has met with the following groups: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>religious groups; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tertiary and university students; 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei </span><span>institutions; 
<br/>iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs stakeholders; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs); 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>women’s Group; 
<br/>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>statutory bodies; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>provincial councils; and the 
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>public at large. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review team has covered sufficient ground in its work.  It has consulted and obtained the 
<br/></span><span>views of credible cross-sections of the community. During the consultation, Fijians have expressed 
<br/>their support for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> administration to continue but there must be a fundamental shift in how 
<br/>it does its business.  It must take into account emerging issues that are shaping the development of 
<br/>today’s  agenda.    More  will  be  revealed  when  the  review  team  completes  its  work.    The  team  is 
<br/>expected to wrap up its work and submit its report by the middle of this month.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages 
<br/>(Question No. 173/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the National Policy on Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages and its Standard 
<br/>Operating Procedures? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for his question.  The National Policy on Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages at all 
<br/>Government ministries and institutions and its SOPs and Guidelines were launched on Wednesday, 
<br/>14</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2024 by the honourable Prime Minister. Cabinet has also endorsed the adoption and 
<br/>implementation of this National Policy at all Government ministries and institutions.  The new policy 
<br/>supersedes its predecessor, the Healthy Catering Guideline which was endorsed in Cabinet of 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this policy is a bold step in tackling NCDs in Fiji and mainly the ultimate 
<br/>goal of the policy is to reduce the number of people in Fiji developing NCDs and succumbing to any 
<br/>complications of diabetes, heart disease which are the most common causes of sickness and death in 
<br/>Fiji.  For some clarity, in the last 12 months, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services together 
<br/>with our Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) partners conducted screening activities at 
<br/>107 workplaces where 3,456 participants were assessed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The result showed that 50 percent of participating workers were obese, 32 percent have  high 
<br/>blood  pressure,  with  5  percent  had  severe  hypertension    category.    In  addition,  60  percent  of  the 
<br/>workers in the age group 20 years to 25 years who have high risk of developing an NCD while 41 
<br/>percent had a high risk of suffering from heart diseases in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these findings are consistent with our national disease burden with heart 
<br/>attack as our number one killer and coupled with the risk of obesity and high blood pressure, as well 
<br/>as the reports from 2021 Food System and Nutrition Survey and Multi Indicator Cluster Survey of 
<br/>2021.  Therefore, in summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a policy has been adopted and it is mainly to  try 
<br/>and reduce the effects of NCD in the workplace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular policy, I understand actually comes on 
<br/>the back of two things that were conducted in 2021.   One was the food systems and nutrition study 
<br/></span><span>and there was a cluster survey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in it there are quite a number of recommendations. Currently, I understand what the 
<br/>policy says is with respect to Government workplaces, et cetera. When will the Government be taking 
<br/>this out to the general public in terms of that particular policy for the public at large because these 
<br/>two surveys indicated how much there is a need for us to keep a tab on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for his 
<br/>supplementary question.  As I had mentioned, it was launched earlier this year, it has been adopted 
<br/></span><span>by Cabinet and right now it is a policy within the Government institutions.  We, as the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Health have taken the lead in most of our catering, healthy food choices have been put on the table.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, based on the findings of the cluster study, and the surveys that was done 
<br/>and also the recent one with the workplace survey, it has indicated that the workplace area within the 
<br/>government institutions especially the workforce are at risk of developing NCDs especially at the 
<br/>younger age.  So, with this policy being brought in and its SOP, will allow Government to take the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lead in trying to combat NCDs. It has taken into consideration also the data from the previous studies 
<br/>in 2021 as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  In terms of the Government 
<br/>institutions, et cetera, does the SOP have a programme whereby if there are functions, et cetera taking 
<br/>place within Government institutions, is there some monitoring that is done with respect to the food 
<br/>that is being dished out to these particular institutions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, part of the policy is the training.  
<br/>The Ministry  takes  the lead in  doing  the training to  the various other ministries.   So, Training of 
<br/>Trainers (ToT), that is currently being conducted and we will do more training in the future.  But 
<br/>nevertheless, it is trying to standardise the catering services throughout the ministries and that will 
<br/>involve training as well and that is included in the SOP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  Once implemented, will the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Policy affect those vendors who sell food on the roadsides? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, similar to the catering within the 
<br/>school, so it is within the vicinity of the workplace.  Outside of the workplace, that is beyond the 
<br/>relevant Ministry’s control.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for coming 
<br/>up with an excellent policy  to guide the catering within government services. My question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister is, we are talking about healthy food choices and beverages.  Does your policy 
<br/>include serving of liquor at government functions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will have to come back to you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with a response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please join me in welcoming a delegation from the 
<br/>House  of  Representatives  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia.    It  is  headed  by  honourable  Mohammed 
<br/>Muraz and the Ambassador of Indonesia, His Excellency Dupito D. Simamora.  Welcome to Fiji and 
<br/>to the Parliament of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  information  of  honourable  Members,  Fiji  and  Indonesia  established  diplomatic 
<br/></span><span>relations  in  1974  and  since  then,  our  two  countries  have  progressively  developed  various  sectors 
<br/>including people to people exchanges, technical training, human resource development, defence and 
<br/>policing, agriculture, disaster management, forestry and fisheries.  Our enduring friendship through 
<br/>our two Governments and Parliaments continue to strengthen, fostering mutual understanding and 
<br/>shared achievements.  Again, I welcome you all, Your Excellency and honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, just a little bit more, before we attended a meeting in Indonesia known 
<br/>as Indonesia-Pacific Parliamentary Partnership, there was a huge protest, it was being carried out in 
<br/></span><span>front of Parliament showcasing how people were not responding or taking into account the great task 
<br/></span><span>that the Government of Indonesia was doing in West Papua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon this visit of ours, in exchange this huge delegation is here, we heard directly from the 
<br/>honourable  Members  in  the  House  of  Representatives  in  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  how  they 
<br/>constructed  huge  roads,  wharves  and  jetties,  airfields,  et  cetera  in  the  very  areas  that  they  were 
<br/>protesting for outside here.  That was straight from the honourable Members to us who are visiting 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1747 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their country for that particular meeting and here they are, and as the honourable Prime Minister had 
<br/>sounded in the PIFS meeting in Tonga, he is trying all his best to promote his Blue Ocean bounded 
<br/>by the Pacific Ocean, and of which the great Government of Indonesia shares with the rest of us that 
<br/>shares our border in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  a huge task that is now being  undertaken and endorsed by PIFS in Tonga, but  it is a 
<br/>matter of how best we can support each other.  They are well known for MMSE, they are so far ahead 
<br/>in that particular area and there are so many things to learn from Indonesia as well.  Being a huge 
<br/>country with this massive population of almost 300 million, they are a market to themselves, and we 
<br/>wonder as to how best they have progressed both in all areas of development including the military 
<br/>and police as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are so grateful for them to be here, and we will be having a private luncheon with them 
<br/>when we rise midday today, in the hope that we continue to foster this relationship and see how best 
<br/>we can work on areas that will benefit both, including the region as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of Crossings – Nakawaga Village and Viani Village 
<br/>(Question No. 174/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on the construction of crossings for Nakawaga Village in 
<br/>Koroalau and Viani Village in Navatu, Cakaudrove? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question in terms of 
<br/>these two crossings.  We as a Government are very open to discussions on these crossings, especially 
<br/>I have impressed upon FRA and also within my Ministry the need to really look at those communities 
<br/>which have issues in terms of crossings, especially where school children, women and the general 
<br/>public are involved and which we can solve quickly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Just looking at this one, the Viani Crossing in the </span><span>Tikina o Navatu</span><span>, we have not specifically 
<br/>budgeted for it but we are considering this too within the Ministry and also FRA in terms of inclusion. 
<br/>It is not really a wide crossing, it is approximately about 10 meters, we can cater for that and that is 
<br/>something we are considering at the moment.  Just looking at the location, it is near the coast, so it is 
<br/>affected sometimes by excessive high tides and such events.  That is something which we will also 
<br/></span><span>need to be considered as the team is looking into that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one, Nakawaga Crossing in  the  </span><span>Tikina o</span><span>  Koroalau, the first  one in  the  </span><span>Tikina o</span><span>
<br/>Navatu, this is in the </span><span>Tikina o</span><span> Koroalau, again this is planned in the next financial year as part of our 
<br/>broader strategy in terms of infrastructure in the North.  It is also part of the broader Nukubuno to 
<br/>Navakuru Rural Rroads Programme from the Savusavu side to the Labasa side.  That will provide an 
<br/>alternative route connecting Labasa to Savusavu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          So just looking at the sketch again of the area, it is quite a wide river, it is 30 meters and when 
<br/></span><span>there is a sea-level rise, it is quite wide.  There are locations along that which are not as wide as where 
<br/></span><span>the road is. So, again, that is something we need to relook at in terms of the location.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, when it comes to Cakaudrove, I always stand and speak for 
<br/>those people. Apparently, there has been a few instances where the road has been turned into gravel 
<br/>and still the FRA has not tarsealed that, for example, the road near the Savusavu Airport.  It is our  
<br/>tourist hotspot. I hope the FRA and the Minister will look into this matter and tarseal those roads.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just a statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           MR. SPEAKER.- We thank you for that statement of yours, honourable Ketan Lal.

<div><span>Health &amp; Safety at Work (General Workplace Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 
<br/>(Question No. 175/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations 
<br/>update  Parliament  on  the  justification  to  amend  the  Health  and  Safety  at  Work  (General 
<br/>Workplace Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2024? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Kiran for asking the question.  In 
<br/>line with the Whole of Government Review on Ease of Doing Business, spearheaded by the Ministry 
<br/>of Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communication, the Ministry of 
<br/>Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations has reviewed the effectiveness of the general 
<br/>workplace inspections and audits conducted by the National OHS Inspectorate at workplaces in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Bank through the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small 
<br/>and Medium Enterprises and Communications reported on 25</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023, the following issues:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry of Employment through the National OHS Services does not have a full list 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of businesses and workplaces to be inspected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Updated  data  is  available  at  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service  and  the  Registrar  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Companies, but this is not shared with the agencies or made publicly available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Ony a small percentage of businesses and workplaces in Fiji are inspected. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Publicly  available  information  from  2018  indicates  that  FRCS  had  28,984  SMEs  and 
<br/>workplaces registered in its database.  This number would have grown significantly since 
<br/></span><span>Fiji’s reopening after the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OHS inspectors spend significant amount of time inspecting workplaces 
<br/>and businesses which are already compliant, and this time could be better spent visiting and advising 
<br/>non-compliant workplaces and SMEs.  In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, it is essential 
<br/>to  strike  a  balance  between  ensuring  the  health  and  safety  of  workers  while  also  supporting 
<br/>businesses,  growth  and  employment  creation.    As  such,  there  is  a  growing  need  to  review  and 
<br/>potentially adapt existing health and safety regulations to better align with the needs of businesses 
<br/>and facilitate job creation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amendment  to  the  regulations  introduces  a  new  clause  in  Part  26, 
<br/>Regulation 66(1) and (2)(a) and (b) of the general workplace conditions.  Regulation 24 outlines a 
<br/>risk-based inspection and audit provision with a proposed schedule.  The provisions and schedules 
<br/>outline  the  workplaces  based  on  high  and  low  risk,  and  corresponding  inspection  and  audit 
<br/>frequencies.  Low risk workplaces to be inspected and audited at least once every three years.  These 
<br/>workplaces present minimal safety hazards.  High risk workplaces to be inspected and audited at least 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>annually and based on the elevated level of risk, which has the potential to cause accidents, injuries 
<br/>or even death.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also an inclusion in Regulation 66 is a new Regulation 4, which requires 
<br/>that in the case of non-compliance on the part of an employer rated as low risk workplace, the Chief 
<br/>Health and Safety Inspector has the power to classify the workplace as high risk. Sir, OHS is one of 
<br/>the critical areas for businesses anywhere in the world, because of any non-compliance in this area, 
<br/>there will be significant impacts on human lives and work environment.  Ensuring compliance with 
<br/>OHS laws is a priority for this Government, and hence, the need to review these regulations was very 
<br/>critical for ease of doing business for both public and private sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  as  you  have  mentioned  the  new  regulations 
<br/>actually create a high risk and a low risk factory, premises, et cetera that you look at.  As you also 
<br/>mentioned, the Chief Health and Safety Inspector is the one that is given the authority for compliance 
<br/>and non-compliance.  Will the honourable Minister be able to further amend it in terms of checks 
<br/>and balances to ensure that it is not a singular person that signs off on this, purely because it could 
<br/>be  an  area  where  they  may  be  some  corruption,  et  cetera  that  may  arise?    For  example,  if  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary was to co-sign, or the Minister himself, would the honourable Minister be  doing 
<br/>that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Koya for the suggestion and we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>definitely discuss it with our senior staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response 
<br/>about the amendments.  My question is about the general  workplace conditions because there is  a 
<br/>question raised by the general public about the health and safety concerns around amusement ride 
<br/>operators. Fairly the points that have been raised is, are these amusement rides safe for our children 
<br/>and are they OHS certified?  I do thank the honourable Minister for Local Government for his early 
<br/>intervention into the investigation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious matter because a lady has 
<br/>died  from  a  ferries  wheel  incident  and  yet  justice  is  not  being  served.    So,  in  terms  of  OHS 
<br/>compliance, this very morning the honourable Minister has stated that the caused had been identified 
<br/>and operations  has been  ceased.  What  is  this cause in  terms  of the failure of the amusement  ride 
<br/>operation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Would you like to answer that?  I have just been informed that it is now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before the courts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Sir ,I would just like to partly answer that question; the first one.  I just 
<br/>wish to say that I had given a full explanation to this House in the last sitting and it was your directive 
<br/>that because it is a triable case and it is with the DPP, it is not wise to discuss this any further.  I find 
<br/>it very strange that the honourable Member has brought it up again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- People are asking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- People are asking and we have made the statement very clearly, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, we will leave it at that, because a ruling has already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been done on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, it is not a question but a statement.  I have passed a message 
<br/>to  the  honourable  Minister.    There  are  some  workers  in  workplace  who  deliberately  try  to  cause 
<br/>accidents or sabotage things and today I saw a video where a pallet trolley was rolled in Raojibhai 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Patel Street and someone was waving and taking a video while sitting on the pallet trolley and rolling 
<br/>down.  That  is  a  deliberate  attempt  to  cause  an  accident,  people  can  get  hurt,  properties  can  get 
<br/>damaged,  people’s  lives  are  at  risk.  Pallet  trolley  is  not  supposed  to  ridden  on  the  main  road.  
<br/>Raojibhai Patel Street is a very busy road. I hope the honourable Minister can put measures in place 
<br/>that culprits as such needs to be taken care of.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is just a statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question to the honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are there any changes to the OHS legislation for climate change adaptation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I can get an answer to that new question for the Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  the  review  of  this 
<br/>regulation.  I have always been concerned about OHS particularly on the health aspect.  It is about 
<br/>occupation  health  and  safety  and  unfortunately  in  Fiji,  we  neglect  the  health  component  of  that 
<br/>regulation.  What  is  the  honourable  Minister  going  to  do  about  it,  because  we  need  a  healthy 
<br/>workforce in order to boost production. This is one of our major issues in Fiji; the health aspect of 
<br/>the regulation. What is the Ministry considering and what are the plans we have to deal with this 
<br/>issue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Wellness Programme and all that going?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Yes,  Sir.    I  just  wanted  to  advice  that  PPE’s  are  compulsory  in  all 
<br/>workplaces and there is awareness provided by the Ministry at workplaces, at floor level, as well as 
<br/>inspections done at all workplaces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We have to appoint officers who will do these inspections. With 
<br/>this Parliament, the food that is served here, nice food but is it healthy? Is it contributing to improve 
<br/>the health of the workers?  That is what OHS, the health aspect is all about.  Training facilities, you 
<br/>have the gymnasium, it should be part of the regulation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before the honourable Minister replies, I would like to make an attempt to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answer the question because you pointed a finger at the food that is being prepared here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, with due respect to you, this is your demand that we provide lunch. 
<br/>We have gone out of our way to ensure that it is the best lunch that can be provided to each and 
<br/>everyone. There is a variety that we have dished out in front of you. On that, I think the Secretariat 
<br/>is doing a great job in ensuring that we provide good food to you honourable Members and secondly, 
<br/>since it is free of charge.

<div><span>Update on Replanting Indigenous Trees 
<br/>(Question No. 176/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1751 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament how has the 
<br/>emphasis on replanting indigenous trees progressed considering that Fiji has concentrated on 
<br/>the introduction of high-value species in our country?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the honourable Koroilavesau for his 
<br/>question.  I first want to highlight the difference between indigenous tree species and high-value tree 
<br/>species. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Indigenous tree species or native tree species are those which have been growing naturally in 
<br/>our country. This will include </span><span>dakua</span><span>, </span><span>makadre</span><span>, </span><span>damanu</span><span> and </span><span>kauvula</span><span>.  As a direct comparison, both 
<br/>pine  and  mahogany,  our  main  plantation  species  are  termed  as  “exotics”  meaning  that  they  were 
<br/>introduced into our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High-value tree species on the other hand are those which can be either native or exotic but 
<br/>of  high  value  in  terms  of  their  wood  product  prices  in  the  market.    Most  of  our  native  species 
<br/>especially </span><span>dakua</span><span>, </span><span>vesi</span><span>, </span><span>yaka</span><span> and </span><span>sacau</span><span> are considered high-value species. In terms of our plantation 
<br/>species, mahogany is considered to be higher value when compared to pine.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sandalwood, both our local species and the introduced ones are much more valuable than any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other tree species that we have both natives and exotics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  from  2012  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  embarked  on  a  number  of  tree  planting 
<br/>initiatives which included the Million Trees, Reforestation of Degraded Forests and the Four Million 
<br/>Trees  in  four  years  which  expanded  to  30  million  trees  in  15  years,  an  initiative  in  response  to 
<br/>commitments made at the UN Heads of States Climate Change Summit in New York in September 
<br/>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, tree species that were planted included native tree species of different types, 
<br/>both timber and non-timber, tree species, food trees, exotic timber trees, coastal species including 
<br/>mangroves  and  non-timber  forest  product  including  high-value  species  like  sandalwood  and 
<br/>agarwood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, according to the Ministry’s planting records, the total number of trees planted 
<br/>so far is around 19.2 million trees. Out of this total, 14.9 million or about 78 percent are pine seedlings 
<br/>majority of which are under the management of Fiji Pine Limited.  The remainder comprising of 
<br/>mahogany at 776,081, mangrove 930,920 seedlings, sandalwood 17,114 and mixed species including 
<br/></span><span>all indigenous tree species amounting to around 2.5 million seedlings.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  budget  for  our  Reforestation  Programme  for  this  financial  year  in 
<br/>supporting the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years is $2.5 million. A major focus of our programme will be 
<br/>the maintenance of beat-up activities, replacing all the dead seedlings in all the planted areas in the 
<br/>three operational Divisions. The target has, therefore, been reduced from 1,800 hectares in the last 
<br/>financial year to 600 hectares for this financial year, to allow our teams to carry out their maintenance 
<br/>activities and to also conduct their monitoring. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  our  reforestation  efforts,  we  have  been  working  on  the 
<br/></span><span>protection and conservation of our native tree species, mainly because of their significant importance 
<br/>in maintaining our rich biodiversity and also, because of their social and cultural importance to our 
<br/>people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The question was on indigenous species.  In your reply, you stated that pine 
<br/>has been one of the ones that you have been replanting.  So, on the question of indigenous species, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>1752 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our friends from Indonesia are here.  Teak wood is one of their popular trees species, or shall I say, 
<br/>hardwood. They do a lot in ensuring that they get the maximum benefit out of value -adding from 
<br/>those teak wood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your Million Trees  that began by the FijiFirst  Government,  I do not  know how far it has 
<br/>gone.  How many trees have we planted?  These are the kind of issues that we would like to hear, 
<br/>honourable Minister. You do not have to make an effort to reply now, I am just raising this because 
<br/>the crux of the question was on the indigenous species.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A supplementary question, Sir.  I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  her  elaboration  on  the  number  of  trees  that  they  have  planted,  in  particular  the  19.1 
<br/>million  that  we  have  managed  to  plant  for  that  30  Million target.    I  think  you  mentioned  around 
<br/>2.5million, was it 2.5 million?      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Budget of $2.5 million for reforestation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- For indigenous trees or plants? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, for the Reforestation Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My question is, and this is the question that I asked the other day, how 
<br/>do we calculate success?  Is it the planting, or is there monitoring on the percentage of success of the 
<br/>growth of those particular trees?  Do we have that in process, or do we count it as a success when 
<br/>you have just planted one?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was the issue that was brought up in the Copra Millers Report when they were counting 
<br/>the number of coconuts they planted, but there was no monitoring of the real success in terms of 
<br/>making sure the plants grow. So, is that part of the process when you look at these indigenous trees 
<br/>that we are planting?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question. I mentioned there have been 19.2 million trees that have been planted so far.  Depending 
<br/>on  whether  these  trees  are  planted  around  Fiji,  the  various  Divisions,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  is 
<br/>responsible  for  the  monitoring  of  the  survival  rate  of  these  plants.  That  is  how  they  monitor  the 
<br/>progress of the of the programme, and that is by looking at the survival rate of the plants that are 
<br/>planted in the various Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A follow-up question on the indigenous species, in particular, what is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the survival rate of the plants been planted?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.-  I can provide that information to you later on this week, but 
<br/>based on the survival rate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the officers at the Ministry do, they change the way 
<br/>or the method of planting that they have undertaken in order to improve the survival rate. So, in the 
<br/>case of honourable Usamate’s question, I will get the answer later on this week, Sir. </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  A  supplementary  question  from  me,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  We  are 
<br/></span><span>dealing  with  an  extractive  industry  and  we  have  always  talked  about  sustainable  development. 
<br/>Honourable Minister, is it possible to put it as part of your law or regulation too, particularly in terms 
<br/>of replacement? I know that developed countries have this. You log one tree, and you replace it with 
<br/>three trees. This is about sustainability.  What are we going to leave for our children in the future, 
<br/>particularly when it comes to indigenous species? So, that is the question that I want to put before 
<br/>you. Thank you.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1753 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU- I think the current practice or the initiatives that have been 
<br/>carried out by the Ministry now, is to encourage the landowners to undertake that activity.  For every 
<br/>mahogany plant they cut down, they plant three or four more in place of that. That is one initiative 
<br/>that the Ministry is currently undertaking now. Currently, we are also reviewing the Forest Act, so 
<br/>all these will be incorporated into the Act once the review is finalised. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  intend  to  adjourn  the  House  for  lunch, 
<br/>especially when we are having a meeting and lunch as well with the delegation from the Republic of 
<br/>Indonesia.  We will now adjourn and resume at about 2.30 p.m.
