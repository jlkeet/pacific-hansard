<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby 
<br/>submits to Parliament the Review Report on Assets Fiji Limited Annual Report 2016 to 2019.  Assets 
<br/>Fiji Limited (AFL) is a private limited company, fully owned by the Fijian Government, established 
<br/>and incorporated under the Companies Act 2015.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  AFL  manages  all  interests  in  assets  previously  owned  by  Fiji  Ports 
<br/>Corporation  Limited  (FPCL),  Fiji  Ships  and  Heavy  Industry  Limited  (FSHIL)  and  Government 
<br/>Printery and Stationery Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key responsibilities of AFL include effective management, valuation and accounting of 
<br/>non-financial assets that are being divested.  It plays a crucial role in maintaining and optimising the 
<br/>use of these assets to yield maximum returns to Government.  The pertinent issues identified by the 
<br/>Committee are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee commends AFL for the effective handling of its assets during the period 
<br/>under review.  AFL recorded an accumulated net profit after tax of $3.39 million for the 
<br/>years  2016  to  2019.  The  company’s  strategic  priorities  and  assets  were  valued  at 
<br/>approximately $57.38 million.  In addition, the company had no external borrowings and 
<br/>maintained a liquidity ratio of 2.9 at the end of Financial Year 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  Committee  expressed  concern  about  the  low  rental  lead  generated  from  the  asset 
<br/>portfolio valued at over $57 million is disproportionately low, however, this is compensated 
<br/>by higher dividend given by FPCL except GPSD. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee acknowledges the successful vesting of 35 land titles which is strategically 
<br/>located near Lautoka, Levuka, and Suva Port areas, and the independent valuation of assets 
<br/>underscores AFL’s ability to manage its real estate portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee noted that an independent external valuer conducted a valuation for all land 
<br/>vested into the company on 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2017.  The valuation was based on market value 
<br/>and the land’s highest and best use. However, land titles pending vesting were not included 
<br/>in the fair value assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee expressed concern that a total of nine pending land titles from FPCL and 
<br/>one from FSHIL are yet to be vested into AFL, which is necessary to establish a complete 
<br/>financial and equity position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee noted that Government grants were continuously issued to AFL from 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 2019 to support AFL’s operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Members who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were part of the team that produced this Report: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Ravunawa. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF), in trying to adjust to the changes in its operation 
<br/>because of COVID-19, had undertaken certain measures to adhere to the restrictions of the pandemic 
<br/>and, simultaneously, allow the operations of the Authority to continue.  The former Committee had 
<br/>undertaken a site visit to the CAAF Office and held its public submission with senior CAAF officials.    
<br/>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  noted  the  concerns  raised  and  identified   
<br/>recommendations to better address its findings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended the establishment of International Civil Aviation Organization 
<br/>(ICAO) Office for the Pacific Small  Island Developing States  in Nadi and for being  awarded the 
<br/>ICAO  Council  President  Certificate.    I  thank  the  Chief  Executive  and  Management  of  the  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Authority of Fiji for the assistance rendered during this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  finally,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  former  Chairperson  of  the 
<br/>Committee, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for her leadership and guidance; the 
<br/>former Committee Member, honourable Parveen Bala and Alternate Member, honourable Ketan Lal, 
<br/>for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork; and the current Committee Members for the 
<br/>finalisation of this Committee Report.

<div><span>Review Report - Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Report  of  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report.  As mandated under 
<br/>Standing  Order  109(2)(b),  the  Committee  looks  into  issues  related  to  health,  education,  social 
<br/>services, labour, aviation, culture and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports’ ability to rebound from the setbacks of successive lockdowns 
<br/>as the second wave of the pandemic hit Fiji, is evidence of the organisation’s resilience in a time of 
<br/>extreme challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airports managed to complete major runaway maintenance work in half the usual time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>due to a longer working window caused by the absence of international and domestic flights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was informed of the upgrade and extension of the Nausori Airport runaway. 
<br/>This  $60  million  project  will  allow  opportunities  for  increased  flights  on  both,  domestic  and 
<br/>international routes.  Furthermore, the Committee commends Fiji Airports in its commitment to the 
<br/>SDGs on the Green Airports Initiatives, attaining a Level 3: Airport Carbon Accreditation in having 
<br/>their solar farms and the introduction of electronic vehicles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to convey my gratitude and sincere appreciation to the CEO of Fiji Airports and his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>team for their valuable contribution to this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  former  Chairperson  of  the 
<br/>Committee, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for her leadership and guidance; the 
<br/>former Committee Member, honourable Parveen Bala; and Alternate Members, honourable Ketan 
<br/>Lal and honourable Penioni Ravunawa, for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork; and 
<br/>the current Committee Members for the finalisation of this Committee Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU.-  Mr. Speaker Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  A motion without notice that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
