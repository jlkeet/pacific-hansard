<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, in the gallery this afternoon, we have the students and teachers from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moce Secondary School. Welcome to your Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adjournment - Unplanned Power Shutdown 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  please  be  advised  that  I  will  have  to  adjourn  Parliament  now  due  to  the 
<br/>unplanned  power  shutdown.  The  automatic  recording  through  the  ITC  infrastructure  has  been 
<br/>affected. As a result, we cannot broadcast live and the FTR cannot record as well. That is how the 
<br/>Hansard Team records all that is said and done for our future records. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope you will bear with us on this effect  of the sudden unplanned power shutdown that 
<br/>occurred just after 2.00 p.m. Therefore, honourable Members, I will now adjourn the House until 
<br/>tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 3.03 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
