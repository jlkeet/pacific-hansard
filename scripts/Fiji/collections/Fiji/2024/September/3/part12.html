<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There 
<br/>will also be a response from the leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to also speak for five minutes. 
<br/>There will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  now  call  on  the  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  to  deliver  his 
<br/>Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report on the 53</span><span>rd</span><span> Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and  
<br/>I also greet those who may be watching us on livestream or listening in on the radio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week, Pacific Leaders gathered in Nuku’alofa in Kingdom of Tonga for 
<br/>the 53</span><span>rd</span><span> Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting 2024.  The Forum brought together Heads of States, 
<br/>Heads of Government and Ministers from across the Pacific region. The theme for the Forum Leaders 
<br/>Meeting was “A Transformative and Resilient Pasifiki: Build Better Now”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Thursday, 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024, Sir, I joined other Forum Leaders in the beautiful island of 
<br/>Vava’u for the Leaders Retreat. The retreat provided an opportunity for Pacific Leaders to consult 
<br/>and hold honest discussions on matters of priority, challenges and opportunities facing our region.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  retreat  also  provided  an opportunity to  discuss the  concept  of the  Ocean of 
<br/>Peace which I had presented in this August Parliament not so long ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaders reflected on the concept and welcomed its alignment with the 2050 Strategy for a 
<br/>Blue  Pacific  Continent,  the  2018  Boe  Declaration  on  Regional  Security  and  the  2000  Biketawa 
<br/>Declaration.  Forum Leaders acknowledged the importance of the principles presented through the 
<br/>concept for the Ocean of Peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Leaders have tasked the Forum Secretariat, 
<br/>in  cooperation  with  Fiji,  to  develop  a  draft  Ocean  of  Peace  Declaration  for  consideration  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Leaders at the 54</span><span>th</span><span> Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in Honiara, Solomon Islands, in 2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  fellow  Leaders  and  I  were  especially  encouraged  by  the  very  positive  remarks  of  the 
<br/>representatives of the United States (US) and Chinese Governments at the Meeting.  The US Deputy 
<br/>Secretary of State, Dr.  Kurt  Campbell,  and China’s Special Envoy to  the Pacific, His Excellency 
<br/>Qian Bo, in their remarks, embraced the concept of the Ocean of Peace, and demonstrated in a very 
<br/>clear language the intention of China and the United States to cooperate in the Pacific with Pacific 
<br/>Islands countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to quote Dr. Kurt Campbell, the Deputy Secretary of State, who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had this to say, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I had a very good meeting just now with the excellent representative from the 
<br/>People's Republic of China…  We have agreed that in the weeks and months ahead, the 
<br/>United States and China in the Pacific will work together to find programmes of action 
<br/>where  we, together,  can  work  to  develop  habits  of cooperation  between  the  United 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>1730 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>States and China, in the Pacific, to address issues of climate change, rural development, 
<br/>or other areas which are critical to the peoples of the Pacific." 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dr. Campbell continued, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I will say he was enthusiastic about it, he believed it was important. I think it is 
<br/>critical  for  our friends  around  the  table  here  that  we, together  the  United  States  and 
<br/>China,  are  committed.    Next  year  when we  meet,  we  will  be  underway  with 
<br/>those projects of cooperation."  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response, Special Envoy Qian Bo said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…what  Deputy  Secretary,  Mr.  Campbell,  has proposed,  in  my  view,  is 
<br/>encouraging and constructive. It is not only in line with the consensus reached by the 
<br/>leaders of our two countries, but also in the best interest of the Pacific Island countries 
<br/>and the Region. We wish to keep in close contact with the US side to discuss specific 
<br/>projects on climate change on which we can work."  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the words of these two distinguished representatives of their great nations are 
<br/>the  very  demonstration  of  what  is possible  when  we  go  for  peace.  When  we  believe  in  peace, 
<br/>advocate for peace, stand for and uphold peace, it resonates and removes fear.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  this  happens,  it  empowers  one  to  cross the  line,  to  reach  out  to  the  other  side  and 
<br/>offer, "peace  be  with  you".    Those  were  the  same  words  that  our  Lord  Jesus  uttered  after  his 
<br/>resurrection and his victory over death and Hades.  He said those to his disciples who were paralysed 
<br/>by fear.  In my  discussions in  London and in  New York,  I had mentioned that peace is  really the 
<br/>absence of fear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Peace moves people to dare again, to rediscover themselves and eventually, offer the  same 
<br/>peace.  I am very encouraged that at this time, we are also having our own truth and reconciliation 
<br/>processes  here  in  Fiji,  and  I  believe  that  is  going  well,  according  to  the  report  from  the  Minister 
<br/>responsible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Policing Initiative,  another  significant  milestone,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the 
<br/>endorsement of the Pacific Policing Initiative on the heels of the Leaders decision on the Ocean of 
<br/>Peace.  This  is  a  major  regional  initiative  to  strengthen collective  peace  and  security  throughout 
<br/></span><span>the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Pacific  Policing  Initiative  can be  said  to  be  a  practical  expression  of 
<br/>the Ocean of Peace. If the Blue Pacific wants to make a leading contribution to global peace, we need 
<br/>practical means to support peace here at home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the principles of the Ocean of Peace calls for the introduction of a code 
<br/>of conduct. No  one  needs  reminding  of  the  scourge  of  drugs  and  related  crimes  that  befall  our 
<br/>nation and others around the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Policing  Initiative  is  central  to the  Ocean  of  Peace. Peace  needs  to  lead  to  a 
<br/>change  of  behaviour.  The  Pacific  Policing  Initiative  provides  for  the  establishment  of  regional 
<br/>training centres of excellence and a standing multi-national deployable force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, this Initiative came to life through Fiji's Chairmanship of the Pacific Islands 
<br/>Chiefs of Police Conference chaired by the Acting Commissioner, Mr. Juki Fong Chew. The region 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1731 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has  seen  the  benefits  of  regional peacekeeping  and  humanitarian  training through  Fiji's  facilities  at 
<br/>Blackrock Camp.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,</span><span> </span><span>on  discussions  surrounding  climate  change  and  resilience,  the  Forum 
<br/>Leaders provided  support  to  the  Pacific  Resilience Facility. This  is  the  first  Pacific-led,  member-
<br/>owned and managed, and people-centred climate and disaster resilience financing</span><span> </span><span>facility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaders  agreed  that  the  Facility  will  be domiciled  in  Tonga.  Development partners have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>made commitments to the Facility, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Australia (AUD100 million); 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Saudi Arabia (USD50 million); 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>People's Republic of China (USD500,000); 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>United States of America (USD25 million); and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>United Kingdom has pledged the provision of technical support valued at £1.3 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, in addition to this, Forum Leaders were provided an update on the situation 
<br/>in  New  Caledonia  by  the  President  of the  Government  of  New  Caledonia,  the honourable  Louis 
<br/>Mapou. Fiji, along with other Forum Leaders, reaffirmed our continued call for order and stability 
<br/>to prevail. I also reiterated Fiji's commitment to the deployment of the high-level Forum Troika Plus 
<br/>Observer Mission to New Caledonia, as discussions continue on a date for the Mission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other highlights from the Forum Leaders Meeting, Sir, are reflected in the Forum Leaders 
<br/>Communique developed as an Outcome of the Leaders Plenary and Retreat. Although I did not want 
<br/>to interfere with Troika, there was a personal invitation from the President of France for me to be 
<br/>present.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  in  parallel  to  the  Forum Leaders  Programme,  the  Fiji  delegation  held 
<br/>22 bilateral  meetings  throughout  the  week. The  Annual  Forum  Leaders  Meeting  provides an 
<br/>opportunity for Fiji to meet bilateral and multilateral development partners to progress development 
<br/>cooperation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had the privilege of meeting and holding discussions with the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)   United  Nations  Secretary-General, Antonio  Guterres,  who  continue  to  express  his 
<br/>admiration and respect for Fiji because of the work done by our peacekeepers; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)   Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Honourable James Marape; 
<br/></span><span>(3)   Prime Minister of Cook Islands, Honourable Mark Brown;  
<br/>(4)   Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, Honourable Jeremiah Manele;  
<br/>(5)   Prime Minister of Tonga, Honourable Sovaleni Hu'akavameiliku;  
<br/>(6)   Governor of American Samoa, Honourable Lemanu Mauga; and  
<br/>(7)   United States Deputy Secretary of State, Dr. Kurt Campbell.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I am pleased to report to this August Parliament and the Nation, that Fiji's 
<br/>first official  Air  Transport  Agreement  for  "open skies</span><span>"  </span><span>was  signed  with  the  United  States 
<br/></span><span>on Wednesday, 28th August, 2024, in the margins of the meeting after our Cabinet approved the day 
<br/></span><span>before under the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Agreement will advance our countries' bilateral aviation cooperation and bring the civil 
<br/>aviation  transportation  relationship  between  the  United  States  and  Fiji  to  the highest  modern 
<br/>standard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Agreement will expand our economic and commercial partnership, promote people-to-
<br/>people  ties,  and  create  new  opportunities  for customers,  airlines  and  travel  companies. Under  the 
<br/>Agreement, air carriers will be able to provide more affordable, convenient and efficient air services 
<br/>to travellers and shippers, promoting tourism and commerce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Agreement includes unrestricted capacity and frequency of services for both passenger 
<br/>and all-cargo carriers, open route rights, an open charter regime, self-handling provisions and open 
<br/>code-sharing opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am confident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this will foster increased investments, maintain trade 
<br/>and increase visitor arrivals for Fiji’s tourism industry, and also contribute to our continuing growth. 
<br/>Fiji Airways’ new Nadi to Dallas flight route will commence on 10</span><span>th</span><span> December this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  take  this  time  to  acknowledge  other  bilateral  engagements  by 
<br/>Ministers and Senior Officials from our delegation. These included the honourable Minister for Rural 
<br/>and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management,  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and 
<br/>Forestry,  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services,  honourable  Minister  for  Home 
<br/>Affairs  and  Immigration,  Permanent  Secretaries,  our  Permanent  Representative  to  the  United 
<br/>Nations,  High  Commissioner  and  Special  Envoy,  supported  by  Technical  Officials.    Fiji  actively 
<br/>participated  in  various  side  events  and  meetings  that  were  held  on  the  margins  of  the  Leaders’ 
<br/>Meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the meeting has concluded, the next stage for work to start. All in 
<br/>all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the meeting in Tonga was a timely reminder of the resilience of our Pacific 
<br/>region when we work in solidarity and unity. This was evident when meeting proceedings were barely 
<br/>affected by the 6.6 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks occurred after heavy rain in Tongatapu on 
<br/>Monday, 26</span><span>th</span><span> August. It was a stark reminder to all that were present of the challenges that we face 
<br/>on this side of the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to His Majesty the 
<br/>King Tupou VI, the Prime Minister, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, their Royal Highness 
<br/>Prince Tupouto’a ‘Ulukalala and Princess Sinaitakala who were at the meeting throughout the five 
<br/>days occupying Tonga’s Chair in the conference. The people of Tonga made excellent arrangements 
<br/>in hosting the 2024 Pacific Leaders’ Meeting and for the warm hospitality extended to all delegations 
<br/>during our stay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonga’s rich culture and tradition, vibrant dances and exuberant </span><span>mafana, </span><span>uplifting sounds of 
<br/></span><span>choir and harmonious community spirit of the Friendly Isles was on full display, a most remarkable 
<br/>experience and wonderful showcase of our “Pacific Way”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministerial Statements are great opportunities for the Government to keep 
<br/>the Opposition Members abreast with what we are doing.  It is where we also benefitted while we 
<br/>were on that side.   When they made Ministerial Statements, we knew where to take over from when 
<br/>sides change, so please do not try and crowd out our many Ministerial Statements.  It is our way of 
<br/>informing the Opposition and the people of what Government is doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  the  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement that prepares us for coming across, come 2027. But honourable Prime Minister, you made 
<br/>a mistake by not taking the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways with you 
<br/>to Tonga. I also stated this to the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services.  If you want 
<br/>a  reliable  guide  in  Tonga  with  local  knowledge,  you  should  have  taken  the  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. The honourable Speaker knows that.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1733 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Malo lelei. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- But on a serious note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister for his Statement this morning. I did pick a few things, honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>from  your  statement  that  you  made  during  the  plenary  session,  particularly  highlighting  that  the 
<br/>Pacific we are in now, is no longer the Pacific we were in 20 years ago, given the challenges that you 
<br/>have stated and, of course, the priorities and the opportunities too, although we do agree that we are 
<br/>in  a  very  challenging  environment  but  if  we  strategise  well,  we  will  always  benefit,  despite  the 
<br/>maneuverings that are happening, particularly in as far as geo-politics is concerned within the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some serious questions, there has been a lot of papers written about the future of 
<br/>regionalism  but,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  agree  with  the  sentiments  echoed  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, that our dignity  is in  our unity and that is  also  our strength,  and we will need to 
<br/>continue to build on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           However, on Ministerial Statements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I continue in the two minutes 
<br/>that I have left, I would also urge Government if we can also have a Ministerial Statement on the 
<br/>recent participation of Fiji in SIDS4 in Antigua and Barbuda.  This is very important when we want 
<br/>to  link  this  with  the  statement  that  you  made  in  Tonga,  that  today,  security  as  noted  by  the  </span><span>Boe 
<br/>Declaration</span><span> is not just understood in military terms but also in terms of human security, and we want 
<br/>to  link  that  with  the  SAMOA  Pathway  because  that  was  also  the  theme  of  the  Pacific  Islands 
<br/>Parliaments Group (PIPG) Meeting in Palau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is all linked and the continuation from the SAMOA Pathway into SIDS4, 
<br/>we would appreciate if we can also be furnished with the information because we are anticipating 
<br/>this National Development Plan, particularly on the areas of human development and human security 
<br/>because the Pacific Island countries (I want to stress this), due to its vulnerability and the special 
<br/>circumstances of SIDS, we have that advantage and, hopefully, we can use it to our best advantage 
<br/>because it will help us a lot in terms of our priorities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the PIPG Meeting in Tonga, the focus was on human security and the 
<br/>theme in PIPG in Palau was</span><span>, </span><span>“Human Development in Oceania: How Can Legislatures Strengthen 
<br/>People-Centred Security for the Pacific Islanders?” Mr. Speaker has said in the Business Committee 
<br/>that we will continue to provide information as well.  There is now a move in the legislative work of 
<br/>PIPG to link PIPG with PIFS and the Secretariat is working on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only key thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of time limitation, and I had briefed you on this 
<br/></span><span>and the honourable Prime Minister has just talked about some of the financial assistance that we are 
<br/>getting,  is  that it has already been identified that the special situation of  SIDS  –  their small  size, 
<br/>remoteness,  narrow  resource  export  base,  exposure  to  global  and  environmental  challenges  and 
<br/>external  shocks,  including  a  large  range  of  impacts  from  climate  change  and  potentially  more 
<br/>frequent and intense natural disasters, this drew attention to the special circumstances of SIDS and 
<br/>that is why, into the SAMOA Pathway and into SIDS4.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  may  just  end  by  saying  that  this  is  the  one  thing  that  was  strongly 
<br/></span><span>emphasised in the development of these documents regarding implementation, that we need genuine 
<br/></span><span>international co-operation and partnerships based upon the principles of national ownership.  This is 
<br/>something,  Sir,  that  I  want  to  stress  here  because  I  know  that  we  have  national  issues,  we  have 
<br/>regional issues, and we have our CROP agencies as well. This was one of the issues highlighted in 
<br/>one  of  the  Leaders’  Meeting  in  Tuvalu  and  I  have  briefed  Mr.  Speaker  on  that.  When  we  have 
<br/>funding,  the  important  thing  is,  what  are  our  national  issues?  What  are  our  national  priorities? 
<br/>Because some of the donor agencies have this tendency of dictating to us how these funds are going 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be utilised. That is why the link between SIDS4, National development Plan and the utilisation of 
<br/>funds,  we  need  to  use  it  to  the  best  of  our  advantage.  That  is  something  that  I  will  urge  the 
<br/>Government to keep an eye on because funds are being offered, but how is it positively impacting 
<br/>the lives of every Pacific Islander and every Fijian, given the context of human security and human 
<br/>development, people-centred development as emphasised in the </span><span>Boe Declaration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to start by thanking the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister  for  the  update  on  the  Pacific  Island  Development  Forum  (PIDF)  for  its  future 
<br/>functions and roles.  He  has termed, after the outcome of the review, PIDF will be the  Integrated 
<br/>Development Centre.  I think this will be an appropriate platform, not only to serve the best interest 
<br/>of the Island States, but  Fiji also.  Congratulations for the review of the PIDF into the Integrated 
<br/>Development Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on to PIF in Tonga, I concur with my colleague, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, on his remarks regarding the Statement by the honourable Prime Minister. I thank 
<br/>you honourable Prime Minister for a very clear and comprehensive overview of the results of your 
<br/>Leaders Retreat, bilateral and multilateral engagements, and likewise, the understanding of the efforts 
<br/>to try and bring peace and stability into New Caledonia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  special  congratulations  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  the 
<br/>endorsement of the Ocean of Peace. It resonates well with our nation, a nation that has stood on peace 
<br/>externally and in our efforts in trying to bring peace within Fiji. When this is driven and articulated 
<br/>well, it should be a model not only for the world, but in our region in the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  concur  with  the  Pacific  Policy  Initiative  and  thank  you,  Sir,  for  supporting  that  in  the 
<br/>meeting. With all the key outcomes that has now been reported by the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>our view from this side of Parliament is our ability to thread this together, how it is converged and 
<br/>threaded together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Sir,  I  look  forward  to  the  National  Development  Plan  and  how  this  will  be 
<br/>threaded together, bringing more meaning, and how the Government will take Fiji forward as a better, 
<br/>prosperous and stable Nation. On these initiatives, this side of Parliament and my group are in full 
<br/>support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On those key areas of how we shape our nation forward, I take this opportunity to talk about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>five key initiatives, and those are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>determination by the Government to amend and review our Constitution, and I commend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them for that; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Truth and Reconciliation Initiative;   
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>ongoing current developments on the review of the Security and Defence Review; 
<br/>(4)</span><span>

<div><span>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen; </span><span>ni sa yadra 
<br/>vinaka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I am pleased to deliver my Statement on the progress of the development of 
<br/>Sandalwood  in  Fiji.  We  have three  main  species  of  sandalwood  that  we  are  promoting,  and 
<br/>these include our native sandalwood - </span><span>Santalum yasi</span><span>, the Indian sandalwood - </span><span>Santalum album</span><span>, and 
<br/>a crossbreed between </span><span>Santalum yasi</span><span> and </span><span>Santalum album</span><span> known locally as the </span><span>Santalum hybrid</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  looking  back  in  history,  sandalwood  (</span><span>Santalum yasi</span><span>)  was  one  of  the 
<br/>commodities  that  put  Fiji’s  name  in  the  international trade  arena  in  the  18th  and  19th  century. 
<br/>Unfortunately,  the  resource  was over  exploited  and  the  local  </span><span>yasi</span><span>  almost  became  extinct.  Like  in 
<br/>other Pacific  Island  countries,  there  has  been  a  failure  in  properly  managing  the harvesting  of 
<br/>sandalwood due to strong market demand, coupled with the very low levels of replanting. This has 
<br/>resulted in the disappearance of much of the initial natural stands, causing concerns for the species' 
<br/>future survival.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, between  2010  to  2022,  we  exported  a  total  of  154,172  kilogrammes 
<br/>of sandalwood with a total value of FJD12.3 million. The average price over the period was around 
<br/>FJD71  per  kilogramme,  ranging  from  FJD35  to  FJD208  per  kilogramme,  with  the lower  values 
<br/>recorded from 2010 to 2011. From 2012 to 2016, the value went above FJD100 per kilogramme, and 
<br/>reaching more than FJD200 per kilogramme in 2015 to 2016.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the value declined to around FJD83 per kilogramme in 2017, the 
<br/>value, overall, was on an increasing trend over the nine-year period. Sandalwood trade was on hold 
<br/>in 2020 due to the global COVID pandemic.  However, trade re-commenced from 2021 with prices 
<br/>hovering below FJD100 per kilogramme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the buyers of Fiji's sandalwood include Dubai, Hong Kong, China, Australia 
<br/>and Taiwan. Current evidence suggests that market outlook and prices of sandalwood of high quality 
<br/>will remain very strong for, at least, the next five years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  high  demand  for 
<br/>sandalwood, especially  in  the  Asian  market,  began  investing  significant  number  of resources  in 
<br/>research to work out ways of improving natural standmanagement and to introduce sandalwood in 
<br/>agroforestry systems, as well as in plantations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Ministry  of  Forestry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in  realising 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Fiji  Government  has  continued  to  support  the development  of 
<br/></span><span>sandalwood under a capital project, investing FJD1 million over a decade now in the revitalisation 
<br/>of  sandalwood  development  nationally,  with  a  focus  on  enhancing  policy  and  regulatory 
<br/>requirements to support the sustainable management of sandalwood and to promote more re-planting 
<br/>towards the establishment of a long-term sustainable high value industry for the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, interest  in  planting  and  expanding  the  sandalwood  resource  has 
<br/>been increasing  over  the  last  10  years  or  so,  given  the  crop's  high  value  and  its good  long-term 
<br/>prospects in terms of both, price and demand in the international market. Under the initiative, over 
<br/></span><span>132  hectares  of  sandalwood  woodlots  have been  planted  with  over  58,000  sandalwood  trees.  In 
<br/></span><span>addition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  total  area of  31.4  hectares  was  planted  with  sandalwood  using  the 
<br/>agroforestry system, integrated with other timber and fruit trees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  sandalwood  can  now  be seen 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in  almost  any 
<br/>village/community  and  any  inhabited  island  in Fiji.  In  the  next  five  years,  we  have  forecasted  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  be  growing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>harvest  around 106,000  kilogramme  of  sandalwood  with  an  estimated  export  value  of  FJD10 
<br/>million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, FJD0.1 million was invested in the Sandalwood 
<br/>Development  Project.  The  fund  was  mainly  used  for  the sandalwood  grower's  consultation  in  the 
<br/>three  Divisions  (Central,  Western and  Northern),  with  the  main  objective  of  establishing  the 
<br/>Sandalwood Growers Association that will protect the interests of the farmers. Sandalwood inventory 
<br/>was  also  carried  out  and  also  established sandalwood  demonstration  plots  using  the  agroforestry 
<br/>approach.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project plans to continue the consultation process with the farmers in 
<br/>the three Divisions in this few financial year and also formalise the establishment of the Sandalwood 
<br/>Growers Association to promote sustainable planting practices using the agroforestry approach and 
<br/>the Sandalwood Industry Framework for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project also plans to continue the inventory of sandalwood woodlots in 
<br/>Fiji. The project will also carry out a farmer survey in this new financial year documenting the views 
<br/>and observations made by sandalwood farmers on the effects of climate change in the last 10 years 
<br/>on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  would  also  like  to  mention  here  that  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Forestry  in  2021  submitted  a  project  proposal  titled  ‘Promoting  the  Sustainable  Production  of 
<br/>Sandalwood  in  Fiji’  to  the  Asia  Pacific  Network  for  Sustainable  Forest  Management  and 
<br/>Rehabilitation  (APFNeT).  Sir,  APFNeT  is  an  organisation  constituted  by  its  members  which 
<br/>comprises 27 economies and five international organisations in the Asia-Pacific region. Fiji is also a 
<br/>member of this organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project was approved for funding by the APFNet Council in 2022 and 
<br/>will be implemented over a period of three years beginning this year, with a total grant of around 
<br/>US$0.9 million. The inception meeting is planned to take place in the first quarter of this financial 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aim of this project is to promote and expand sandalwood resources that 
<br/>will  improve  the  long-term  rural  socioeconomic  development  in  Fiji  through  the  promotion  of 
<br/>efficient plantations and sustainable management of sandalwood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two main objectives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To promote a substantial expansion and quality improvement of sandalwood resources 
<br/>through  development  and  demonstration  of  efficient  plantation  and  sustainable 
<br/>management of sandalwood; and 
<br/>Silviculture  technologies  and  experiences  on  sandalwood  are  to  be  enhanced  and 
<br/>knowledge  extended  in  the  Pacific  region  through  information  sharing  and  capacity 
<br/>building programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  end  of  the  three  years,  the  APFNet  Sandalwood  Project  aims  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>achieve the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction  of  a  3,500  square  metre  nursery  with  a  capacity  of  20,000  high  quality 
<br/>sandalwood seedlings; 
<br/>60 hectares efficient sandalwood plantation and sustainable management demonstration 
<br/>established;

<br/>best practice guidelines on the planting and management of sandalwood for landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the domestication of the sandalwood in Fiji in the last 40 years and the 
<br/>establishment of planted sandalwood woodlots, the Ministry of Forestry is confident that we are on 
<br/>track in reviving and revitalising the sandalwood industry. With the right policies and regulations in 
<br/>place, we will never repeat the mistake of the 19</span><span>th</span><span> century which almost led to the depletion of our 
<br/>natural stock which is mostly due to unsustainable harvest practice.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning and when we resume, the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate may make his response and after that the G-9

<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minster  for 
<br/>Fisheries and Forestry in deliberating on the subject of sandalwood this morning. I appreciate the fact 
<br/>that she has brought this up, especially on sandalwood, after the discussions on fisheries development 
<br/>in the coastal areas of Fiji yesterday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important, because this is one of the fundamental resources that the 
<br/>rural  isolated  communities  in  Fiji  can  depend  on.  She  has  covered  the  historical  aspect  of  the 
<br/>sandalwood  trade,  the  current  status,  sandalwood  development  plans  and  proposed  future 
<br/>developments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sandalwood in its historical aspect was one of the causes of wars in Fiji. As 
<br/>you may recollect Mr. Speaker, Sir, the war in Bua was the Sandalwood War, in Bua Bay, and this 
<br/>is where Charles Savage was finally put down on top of the hill in Naivaka where the Buan warriors 
<br/>were able to trap him, slaughter him and </span><span>lovo</span><span> him, as some might say in my normal dialect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, as it was one of the traditional commodities that was farmed and harvested in 
<br/>the early days. It was either sandalwood or bêche-de-mer, and the early impacts of overharvesting 
<br/>has caused the depletion status that we see today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  has  highlighted  the  development  aspect  of  what  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Forestry is trying to do, and I think the honourable Minister can be confident on the natural aspect 
<br/>that we enjoy in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just divert a little bit, about five years ago I went to Ogea and told 
<br/>them that they are quite fortunate because I can see a lot of sandalwood in your island. They said 
<br/></span><span>yanu</span><span>, this sandalwood is not planted by us, we are fortunate to have a lot of birds that pick on the 
<br/>sandalwood fruits and as they fly around, and they plant all the sandalwood for us.  So, in these small 
<br/>island communities, in the rural areas, where there are so meagre resources they can depend on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think that this one of the other resources that the Government and the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/></span><span>and Forestry can concentrate on. Replanting the natural aspect of it, the weather is good, the climatic 
<br/>conditions, it can grow almost anywhere and more so, closer to the beaches and the sandy parts of 
<br/>the islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I appreciate the fact that she has brought up the subject, because there are a lot of avenues 
<br/>that we can generate. What I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, if 
<br/>she could  look into value-adding.  If there is  a possibility of value-adding, then the returns to  the 
<br/>resource owners would be much higher with sending wood and then they value adding to overseas. I 
<br/></span><span>think  the  prospect  of  giving  a  maximum  return  to  the  resource  owners  is  not  to  the  level  that  is 
<br/></span><span>expected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Minister again for bringing up the subject of sandalwood, and I wish 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>her well in her endeavour to improve on this commodity. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you honourable Minister for Fisheries and 
<br/>Forestry for the statement this morning. Thank you, former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for 
<br/>that response. If we put a dollar sign or value to sandalwood, and I can just give an example from the 
<br/>Forestry website. In 2016, they auctioned a 40 year old sandalwood tree and it was bought at $300 a 
<br/>kilogramme. That one tree was worth $60,000, that is the worth of sandalwood, and the longer it 
<br/>stays, the more valuable it becomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the honourable Minister and the former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, 
<br/>it now grows almost anywhere. It never used to grow in Vatoa, but now sandalwood grows on my 
<br/>island. The key to replanting, I suppose is a nursery, and nurseries that are accessible. So, for those 
<br/>small islands it will be worth going over there and setting up nurseries where you want to replant 
<br/>sandalwood  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            I  mentioned  this  before  in  Parliament,  that  there  is  a  way  to  advertise  the  planting  of 
<br/>sandalwood, and that is to young families. When they have a child, when the child is born and if you 
<br/>plant 10 sandalwood trees, when that child is 21 years old, the trees are 21 years old also. If we half 
<br/>the value of that tree that I mentioned of $60,000, or let us say one tree is $10,000, if you planted 10 
<br/>trees then this child who is now 21 years old, there is a $100,000 there ready if you are sending him 
<br/>off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            It  is  also  a  worthwhile  investment  for  those  in  the  villages  when  you  build  houses.  For 
<br/>example, if you build a school in the rural area and at the same time plant 50 sandalwood trees, by 
<br/>the time that school needs repairs in 20 years, you do not have to fundraise, there you go! You just 
<br/>need  to  harvest  that  sandalwood,  and  it  will  go  towards  the  rehabilitation  of  that  building.  Also, 
<br/>another way of advertising the worth of these trees is, the longer you leave it, the more valuable it 
<br/>becomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just encourage the Ministry,  I think it is  a very worthwhile project to  get  this very easy 
<br/>commodity. If you look at the value of mahogany, it is a big tree and you have to weigh it. To harvest 
<br/>your mahogany you need all the machines et cetera. Except for sandalwood because it is not a very 
<br/>big tree and it is easy for those that have sandalwood plantations to harvest and take it to the market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with the former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, if you can get oil extraction here 
<br/>in Fiji, that will be worth more than the sandalwood now. We are exporting sandalwood oil rather 
<br/>than exporting the wood itself.  I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement, and I wish the 
<br/>Ministry well in this very worthwhile project that they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  You  might  recall  honourable  Members  that  I  mentioned  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament  that  a  house  belonging  to  the  present  </span><span>Turaga  Tui  Bua</span><span>  came  from  the  proceeds  of 
<br/>sandalwood.  A complete house was able to be funded and the construction took off, and that is where 
<br/>the present Tui Bua resides in Lomanikoro, Bua. The funny thing is sandalwood that was growing 
<br/>overnight had disappeared and some very strange things happened, not only in Bua, but even in my 
<br/>village in Somosomo. When the sandalwood is growing to this height, you will be lucky to see them 
<br/>around the garden of that particular household. And not in the too distant future, of course it will 
<br/>disappear.  So,  value-adding  is,  indeed,  a  great  thing,  because  I  remember  quite  vividly  that 
<br/></span><span>honourable Koroilavesau promoted this idea with nurseries in the village, and we learnt to intercrop 
<br/></span><span>with </span><span>dalo ni tana</span><span>, it grew very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And there is the white sandalwood in Lakeba, Lau. I do not know if it produces that same 
<br/>odour or smell which makes it attractive for people to buy. So again, value-adding is indeed a great 
<br/>area to ponder upon, honourable Minister for Forestry, if we would like to encourage villagers to 
<br/>grow more.

<div><span>Rehabilitation of Schools Around Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>fellow honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>bula vinaka </span><span>and good morning to 
<br/>you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  this  morning  to  inform  Parliament  on  the  progress  of  school 
<br/>rehabilitation works to date on the schools that have been affected by natural disasters or man-made 
<br/>disasters in the past years since </span><span>TC Winston.</span><span> Before I do that, I would like to acknowledge the work 
<br/>done by the former Government in rehabilitating all the 336 </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>damaged schools at a total 
<br/>cost  of  more  than  $230  million.    Out  of  this,  206  schools  were  managed  by  the  Construction 
<br/>Implementation Unit (CIU) and the balance by the Ministry of Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recovery work has been uneven at some stages and some of the most 
<br/>devastated  segments  of  our  population  in  the  rural,  remote  and  maritime  areas  continue  to  be 
<br/>disproportionately impacted.  For instance, the recovery efforts from 2018 to 2022 were halted in the 
<br/>rural and maritime zones and efforts were directed to the mainland of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  all  understand  Fiji’s  geographical  location,  which  falls  within  the 
<br/>cyclone paths that normally develop around the region. Fiji suffers from an extended cyclone seasons 
<br/>from  November to  April with  usually two to  three cyclones per year. These cyclones are usually 
<br/>associated with heavy rainfall, massive flooding and tidal surges.  The culmination of these can lead 
<br/>to massive destruction such as landslides, loss of vegetation, destruction to the physical environment, 
<br/>resulting in damages to school buildings, teachers quarters and dormitories. Once the work on the 
<br/></span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  rehabilitation  was  still  progressing,  Fiji  was  again  hit  by  several  other  tropical 
<br/>depressions and cyclones of varying intensities. A typical example was TD04 depression that affected 
<br/>the Fiji group from Monday, 12</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2016 to Sunday 25</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2016, causing multiple 
<br/>floodings, landslides and widespread damages to major infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           The extensive landslide affected the Laucala District School which totally destroyed a one by 
<br/>four classroom, Head Teacher’s quarters and the school water tanks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans for the 
<br/>one by three classrooms have been approved by the relevant Government Agencies and we are also 
<br/>thankful to the Taveuni Rotary Club for sponsoring the building materials. The Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister is still working on the tender for the barge to take the building materials to Qamea Island. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  TC  Gita  developed  from  Tonga  and  made  its  way  to  the  Lau  group.  It 
<br/></span><span>damaged  six  schools  in  Southern  Lau,  including  Ono  Levu  Primary  School,  Doi  Village  School, 
<br/>Vatoa  Village  School,  Matuatabu  Primary  School  in  Ogea,  Fulaga  District  School  and  Babasea 
<br/>Primary School in Matuku. To date, schools have been scoped by consultants and drawings are ready 
<br/>for tender process. There is a need to reassess the documents before they actually go on tender, as 
<br/>some value engineering may need to be done to match classroom sizes with current school rolls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Some minor repairs have been undertaken by school management to continue with everyday 
<br/>learning processes pending the upcoming major rehabilitation works. In April of 2018, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir,  36  schools  were  affected  by  the  two  cyclones,  including  three  stand-alone  ECE,  30  Primary 
<br/></span><span>Schools  with  attached  ECE  and  three  secondary  schools  in  Kadavu.  Additionally,  two  maritime 
<br/>Nadroga schools were negatively impacted. Lead consultants were engaged by the Government to 
<br/>carry out detailed assessments and manage the rehabilitation works for </span><span>TC Keni</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Before the tenders were called for TC Keni rehabilitation, TC Harold struck two years later 
<br/>leaving a trail of more destruction on Kadavu schools. The associated whirlwind that developed in

<br/>School in Korovou. Same number of schools in Kadavu, plus two additional schools in Tailevu were 
<br/>affected and lead consultants had to be engaged to redo scoping and  detailed drawings. The final 
<br/>documents are yet to be completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is contemplating on continuing with the same 
<br/>consultants or to opt for Public Works to continue with the program. In December 2020, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>
<br/>struck  mostly  affecting  schools  in  the  North  with  a  few  schools  in  Northern  Yasawa,  Lau  and 
<br/>Lomaiviti  also  suffering  damages.  A  total  of  59  schools  were  affected  with  38  seen  as  suffering 
<br/>damages. Some schools have been quickly fixed by RFMF engineers with oversight by the SMC. 
<br/>Sir, DFAT also came on board to start with the rehabilitation works for the </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> affected schools 
<br/>and  I  am  happy  to  say  that  seven  out  of  the  nine  adopted  schools  have  been  completed  and 
<br/>commissioned. The remaining two will be commissioned by the end of September 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Yadua  Island  school  was  also  badly  affected  by  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  and  to  date  there  has  been  no 
<br/>rehabilitation  awarded.  The  school  is  using  UNICEF  tents  as  classrooms.  Currently  the  Vanua  is 
<br/>constructing  a  temporary  one  by  two  wooden  classrooms,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Northern 
<br/>Education Office is also assisting in providing the materials for the classrooms. </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> and </span><span>TC Bina</span><span>
<br/>hit the country on 30</span><span>th</span><span> and 31</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2021 and brought with it heavy flooding which affected the 
<br/>two main islands and Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heavy  flooding  was  experienced  in  Labasa  and  also  in  Rakiraki  to  Nadi.  Fiji  was  also 
<br/>impacted with COVID-19.  There were a number of schools that were also being destroyed by fire.  
<br/>Ongoing  fire  rehabilitation  is  happening  at  the  Lelean  Memorial  School  and  Vanuakula  Catholic 
<br/>School in Waidina, Naitasiri.  Degei House in RKS is at a completion stage and should be handed 
<br/>over during the 100-year centennial celebration for the school next week.  Other burnt dormitories 
<br/>included Sukuna House in RKS and Verata House and Rewa House in QVS have also been included 
<br/>in this year’s budget and preliminary works have been undertaken, a tender to be called before the 
<br/>end  of  this  month.    There  are  also  other  schools  which  had  suffered  the  same  fate  through  fire 
<br/>incidents, which included Vatuwaqa Primary School, Ba Special School to name a few, and plans 
<br/>are in line to start in this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At present, the engineers of NRW Macallan (Fiji) Ltd have done a thorough inspection with 
<br/>the DFAT team on the burnt buildings of Vatuwaqa Primary School and a report is yet to be furnished 
<br/>to the Ministry of Education before further actions are taken.  The Ministry has set up a Rehabilitation 
<br/>Unit  within our Asset  and Infrastructure Section, and we have plans to  secure rehabilitation staff 
<br/></span><span>within the first quarter of this financial year.  Once the Unit is up and running, we will relook at all 
<br/></span><span>the scoping reports and drawings provided by the lead consultants that were engaged with the then 
<br/>CIU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the administrative works and review of the technical aspects of the 
<br/>rehabilitation works will be happening in the second and third quarter respectively.  The Ministry has 
<br/>been allocated a $6 million budget under Head 50 in this financial year to cater for the rehabilitation 
<br/>works.  We are hoping to also have access to the Climate Change Fund of US$22.5 million to cater 
<br/>for  all  the  pending  cyclone  rehabilitation,  as  most  of  the  schools  are  usually  used  as  evacuation 
<br/></span><span>centres during natural disasters.  The Ministry of Education is also challenged by having the right 
<br/></span><span>personnel with the right qualification, therefore, the Ministry has undertaken an interview process 
<br/>and should have the right people with cyclone rehabilitation experiences to fill up key positions to 
<br/>kick start the rehabilitation programme within this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during our school visitations across Fiji, it was also found that some schools 
<br/>did not have valid land leases, and the Ministry of Education is currently working with iTLTB and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other stakeholders to effect land leases for affected schools as part of the mandatory requirements for 
<br/>rehabilitation assistance.  Matuku Secondary School is one of the schools that has land lease issues.  
<br/>The school was part of the establishment of Junior Secondary School in 1967, however work on the 
<br/>project  was  incomplete.    The  forms  of  EA2  and  EA3  have  been  given  to  the  Interim  School 
<br/>Committee  for  their  furtherance  and  the  secondary  school  will  be  part  of  the  Ratu  Mocevakaca 
<br/>Primary School lease while working for having their own secondary school lease is underway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is so fortunate that over the years and through past major disasters, we 
<br/>have had assistance of our development partners, other humanitarian groups and financial institutions 
<br/>to come to our aid.  Their assistance cannot go unnoticed as they have contributed in speeding up our 
<br/>recovery and rehabilitation efforts.  The strengthening  of our Vuvale Partnership  has seen DFAT 
<br/>extending its support during </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.  We also acknowledge the Embassy of Japan, MFAT, UAE, 
<br/>Government  of  Indonesia,  UNICEF,  Save  the  Children  Fund  and  many  others  that  I  have  not 
<br/>mentioned here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry has started on its Fire Rehabilitation Programme.  
<br/>We are poised to start with the cyclone rehabilitation works given that we have an opportunity to 
<br/>access the Climate Change Funds for this programme.  All rehabilitation buildings will be seen to be 
<br/>in compliance with the new standard building codes and other regulatory requirements for stronger 
<br/>and resilient structure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the  honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>make their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education  for  his  Ministerial  Statement  on  a  very  important  subject,  that  is,  rehabilitation  of  the 
<br/>schools in Fiji.  Our aim is to improve the quality of education through the management of facilities 
<br/>and infrastructure so that our students are provided very good learning environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A school is a social institution whose existence is part of the nation’s social system which 
<br/>aims to produce capable, democratically faithful, physically and spiritually healthy individuals. The 
<br/>honourable  Minister  has  highlighted  a  number  of  good  plans  to  bring  about  improvements  and  I 
<br/>would like to thank him. The support of good facilities and infrastructure will help teachers teach 
<br/>effectively,  learning  activities  will  also  be  more  varied,  interesting  and  meaningful.  It  is  the 
<br/>responsibility of the schools to maintain the facilities and infrastructure that they have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted vast improvement in facilities and infrastructure in schools 
<br/></span><span>since  the  introduction  of  Free  Education  Grant.  The  Free  Education  grant  was  introduced  by  the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government, all the schools are given grants … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- … whether it be government schools or committee schools. If the grant 
<br/>is well managed and utilised properly, I am sure all schools in Fiji will have good teaching learning 
<br/>resources, good classrooms and will be able to maintain the buildings. There is an allocation of 20 
<br/></span><span>percent  for  buildings  and  maintenance  and  15  percent  for  teaching  and  learning  resources.  If  a 
<br/></span><span>primary school has a roll of 500 students, the school will receive a grant of about $100,000; $20,000 
<br/>can  be  used  for  building  and  maintenance  and  $15,000  can  be  used  for  teaching  and  learning 
<br/>resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. H. CHAND.- Secondary schools get more grant than primary schools.  There is also 
<br/>provision for virement if there is a need.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, teachers’ welfare is very important.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Education spent $4.4 million from 2015 to 2020 to upgrade teachers quarters for 187 
<br/>schools around the country through its building grant allocation. The improved facilities and better 
<br/>infrastructure  such  as  new  classrooms  and  other  school  resources  will  create  better  learning  and 
<br/>teaching environment for teachers and also for the students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2016 many schools were badly damaged by  </span><span>Cyclone Winston</span><span> and the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government, with the support of other development partners were very quick to rebuild and 
<br/>rehabilitate the schools and students were back in their classrooms within weeks and in some cases, 
<br/>it took a month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now the cost of everything has gone up and I urge the 
<br/>Government  to  consider  increasing  the  grants  to  schools,  so  that  schools  can  bring  about 
<br/>improvement in the teaching and learning facilities and infrastructure. The Government should be 
<br/>committed to providing quality education, not only in words, but also in action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  I  would  like  to  thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  for  the  opportunity,  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement  and plans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Group of Nine or their  designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to response briefly to the Ministerial Statement 
<br/>presented by the honourable Minister for Education on the rehabilitation of schools around Fiji. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  at  this  juncture,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  updating  this  august  House  on  the 
<br/>Ministry’s rehabilitation programme for schools around the country that are in dire need for repairs, 
<br/>maintenance  and  upgrade  and  also  thank  the  Coalition  Government  for  the  continuation  and 
<br/>completion of rehabilitation works started by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to commend all teachers and support 
<br/>staff  from  these  respective  schools  on  their  dedication,  commitment,  perseverance  and  efforts  to 
<br/>continue in imparting knowledge to our students, despite the conditions of the schools they serve in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with the completion of the rehabilitation programmes, it will indeed bring forth 
<br/>relief  and  hope  to  our  teachers  and  most  importantly,  our  children  in  having  to  now  dwell  in  an 
<br/>environment that will be conducive to learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  will  also  urge  the  Ministry  of  Education  to  consider  upgrading  school 
<br/>dormitories both, primary and secondary, teachers and staff quarters. Our teachers and staff should 
<br/>deserve better living conditions, and their welfare must be paramount.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I noted that Vatuwaqa Primary School is also one of the schools listed under the 
<br/></span><span>rehabilitation programme. The request has been brought to this august Parliament before and I thank 
<br/>the Coalition Government for considering our plea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with the reconstruction and upgrade phase, I urge the Ministry to ensure that it 
<br/>continues to fulfil Target 4.8 of SDG 4, that is, to build and upgrade education facilities that are child, 
<br/>disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning
