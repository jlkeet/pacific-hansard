<h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes, with 
<br/>a 10 minute response by the Minister or Ministers responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s 
<br/>speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will begin with honourable Aliki Bia, and then I will propose that we take a break for 
<br/>lunch, before we resume again  to  complete the rest  of the weekly  statements.  The floor is  yours, 
<br/>honourable Aliki Bia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Melanesian Community in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, the Leader of Opposition, fellow Members of Parliament. It is an honour for me to 
<br/>stand  and  be  given  an  opportunity  to  make  this  statement.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Business 
<br/>Committee who also allowed me to make an end of the week statement, about Melanesians in Fiji or 
<br/>those that are descendants of the blackbirders in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year is a very special year, for us descendants of black birders as we 
<br/>will commemorate the 160</span><span>th</span><span> year, since the arrival of our forefathers in Fiji. The question we ask 
<br/>ourselves  every  day,  have  we  finally  broken  the  shackles  of  our  slavery?  Once  again,  we  ask 
<br/>ourselves  every  day,  have  we  finally  broken  the  shackles  of  our  slavery?  With  that,  I  thank  the 
<br/>Government for approving a celebration later this year which we are very well looking forward to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our cry for justice is much more than just the celebration, but I 
<br/>am thankful that the celebration is a step towards the right direction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, much respect 
<br/>to the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, honourable Filimoni Vosarogo, for spearheading 
<br/>discussions about the formalisation of the Melanesian Settlement in Baba, Levuka in Ovalau, and the 
<br/>Assistant  Minister  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  for  the  ongoing  consultations  around  our 
<br/>Melanesian communities in Fiji.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1893 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I stand this morning echoing the same sentiments of those that have gone before 
<br/>me, that our painful era deserves recognition and understanding.  After 160 years as descendants of 
<br/>blackbirders, we do sometimes consider ourselves as the forgotten group of people who played a 
<br/>major role in the development of Fiji in the early days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  put  it  in  the  simplest  way  possible,  because  of  Fiji,  our  forefathers  lost  their  cultural 
<br/>connection,  and  they  were  not  able  to  see  their  families  ever  again.  We  paved  the  way  for 
<br/>development in Fiji, but 160 years down the line, we became victims of what we started. By saying 
<br/>this, some of our communities have become victims of development by having to be evicted to other 
<br/>areas.  Just  a  few  weeks  ago,  a  number  of  Melanesian  families  in  Namara  Settlement  have  to  be 
<br/>relocated, and currently close to 18 families at Nadawa Melanesian Settlement are on the verge to be 
<br/>evicted to make way for ongoing development. Our Melanesian Settlement in Wailoku, namely, Wai, 
<br/>Bali, Vateleka, Marata and Koio, have been told that they only have few years left on their leases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been relocated so many times during the past decades, and this has 
<br/>created a sense of uncertainty amongst the Melanesian community knowing that everywhere we go, 
<br/>we are just temporary.  This has generated fear and instability within our Melanesian communities 
<br/>around Fiji and at times, having sleepless nights thinking of what the future may hold. Please allow 
<br/>me to highlight some injustices that currently continues to derail the progress of some Melanesian 
<br/>communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some maritime islands communities of Wailailai, Baba, and Wainaloka in Levuka, Ovalau, 
<br/>their </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> (Headman) only received half the normal allowances given to the </span><span>Turaga ni 
<br/>Koro </span><span>(Headman) in every village. Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just share this experience in </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>E dau mosi vei ira na Turaga Ni Koro oqori ni dau tautauvata kece tu na veilesi ena vuku ni 
<br/>kena qaravi na i tavi se na veika e dau lavaki mai ena Vale ni Volavola ni Yasana ni dau vakayacori 
<br/>e dua na soqo ni vanua.  Ia, na gauna me ra dau saumi kina na Turaga Ni Koro, e dau musu tu ga 
<br/>vakaveimama na kedra i sau. Oqo, e sega walega ni qai leqa ‘qo, se leqa tu mai ena dua na gauna 
<br/>balavu mai na veimatanitu sa oti. Ia, sa tiko na veivakabauti ni na dua na gauna ena wali na leqa 
<br/>oqo</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[It is, indeed, a painful experience for our Village Headmen, who only receive half the 
<br/>normal  allowance given  to  their peers  in other villages, even though  the  various tasks 
<br/>allocated  by  the  Provincial  Office  are  the  same  as  to  their  obligations  to  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>
<br/>meetings.  The unfair payment of allowances was not of late experience, our Headmen 
<br/>have been unfairly treated over the years by past Governments.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  speak,  some  of  them  have  not  received  their  Turaga  ni  Koro 
<br/>allowances since last year to date. I will not be mortified to say this, I question the purpose of setting 
<br/>up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Is this a set up just to heal the political injustices of the 
<br/>past or also to bring justice to the painful era that our forefathers went through? Some of them even 
<br/>lost their lives while working as slaves in farms and building roads for development across Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have heard so many past and current politicians in this nation apologising for the political 
<br/></span><span>injustices of the past, and events that may cause inequality and bias to other ethnic groups, but never 
<br/></span><span>have even one bothered to apologise to the blackbirders descendants who are spread out across Fiji. 
<br/>Their forefathers who were whipped to death while working, some were starved and made to walk 
<br/>day and night, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some even had to witness their wives, mothers and sisters brutally 
<br/>assaulted during the black birding era.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 160 years, we continue to cry for justice, writers and philosophers who 
<br/>have wrote publications about our history have labelled us as the landless people of Fiji. Mr.  Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  we  have  no  choice  but  just  to  go  through  the  trauma  of  this  painful  memories  and  silently 
<br/>adjusting to the many injustices that confronts us in our daily lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, over the last 18 to 19 months, the people of Fiji have been 
<br/>observing and listening to all of us in this August Parliament trying to figure out the change that we 
<br/>may bring and how can we impact the daily lives of ordinary Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of us as 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, we are representatives of the people and it is very important that 
<br/>we listen before we speak out, and when we listen, we need to listen well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  knowledge  is  important  to  produce  informed  policy,  but  listening  and 
<br/>understanding  of the people of Fiji  is  vital  to ensure democracy. We, as leaders  and Members of 
<br/>Parliament, need to listen to people’s deepest concerns, fears and hope of a better Fiji. We need to 
<br/>listen to all sectors of society and not only elites and lobbyists. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot have 
<br/>democracy if we do not have the trust of the very people that we serve. Once again, we cannot have 
<br/>democracy if we do not have the trust of the very people that we serve. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, God bless 
<br/>the nation and God bless the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  L.  RABUKA.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  I  request  that  the  honourable  Assistant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister respond. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to what has been shared by 
<br/>honourable Aliki Bia. Firstly, I would like to thank honourable Aliki Bia for highlighting some of 
<br/>the issues and the injustices being done to the Melanesian people. Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>injustice that has  been done to  the Melanesian people stem from the implementation  of the 2013 
<br/>Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you look at the previous Government, a lot of support has been done to the Melanesian 
<br/>people from the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua 
<br/>(SDL). But when you look at the Constitution, when we are all labelled as Fijians, this is where the 
<br/>greatest injustice has been done to minority communities in Fiji. When there is no special assistance 
<br/>being targeted to the poor people of this country, particularly the Melanesians. When we came into 
<br/>power, we undertook a survey of all the Melanesian communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you look at all these communities, 100 percent of the people are living 
<br/>under  poverty.  This  is  when  there  was  no  targeted  assistance  in  the  last  10  years  of  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government. No assistance for these people to improve their standard of living to come up to the 
<br/>level that we want, Mr. Speaker Sir. When we are all labelled as Fijians. I was at one village, in 
<br/>Waidradra Community, and they said that the assistance was going to the Fijian village just next to 
<br/>them, and they did not receive any assistance. This is where another injustice has come, and I would 
<br/>like to thank the honourable Bia because last year in his maiden speech he said, providing everyone 
<br/>the same equal rights benefits the Melanesia communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know, and I totally disagree with that. It is not that when you provide equal 
<br/></span><span>rights to every community, that it will benefit the Melanesian people and of course this Government 
<br/></span><span>is committed to uplifting the life of the Melanesian people. During our term, we will see that all land 
<br/>that the people that are living on, has to be formalised. We are now committed to that. We will look 
<br/>at the injustices that has been done, so that we can try to provide a solution to their needs. No one 
<br/>else has done that, to go around to the communities and interview them. What do you need? What 
<br/>do you really need?  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1895 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are just going around and ensuring that equal attention is been done to all the communities 
<br/>is not going to solve the problem. We have to listen to them. When we came in, we provided some 
<br/>provisions  in  the  budget  where  we  went  down  to  all  communities  asking  them  what  are  your 
<br/>priorities? What are your needs? What do you need your Government to assist you with? And that is 
<br/>what we are looking at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government  is  going  to  address  all  the  issues  that  has  been  highlighted  by  Mr.  Bia, 
<br/>starting with this celebration that will be undertaken in November. No one has ever done that before! 
<br/>This is the Government that cares for the people! Looks after the needs of the people! And that is 
<br/>why we are doing that, because we care for the people. We look after their interests but at the same 
<br/>time this Government is committed to looking after the interests… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Honourable  Bia,  apologies,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  I  usually  go  up  to 
<br/>Newtown where honourable Aliki Bia lives. You know when you look around the communities, there 
<br/>is a lot of social problems. Some of the houses have no toilets and this is what we are trying to help 
<br/>in going down to those villages, to assist them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to say that your Government has never done anything for these people. 
<br/>Of  course,  we  are  totally  committed,  and  we  will  try  to  help  in  whatever  way  and  in  whatever 
<br/>assistance that we can provide to these communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I apologise, I cannot sit in silence and hear two honourable Members from 
<br/>the same community pitting against each other.  One honourable Member is saying there is a lot of 
<br/>discrimination, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Au kerea me qai qarauni ga na i vosavosa.  E dua na i wase levu era dabe tu vei keitou era 
<br/>sega ni sauma e dua na ka. Era kana, vakayagataki qele, ka kece. Eso era sa curu e na i Vola ni

<br/>tautau, honourable Aliki Bia, ni qai qarauna toka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister  established  the  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs.    That  took  care  the 
<br/>interest of the minority groups. Now, some of them are within my </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, Valewaqa in Vunilagi, 
<br/>Vatusoqosoqo  in  Qamea,  you  name  them,  they  are  there.  Some  are  registered  within  my  village, 
<br/>within my other clans, </span><span>Yavusa o Benau</span><span> but been bracketed, descendants of Solomon Islanders.  They 
<br/>are registered in the VKB and yet you still have the audacity to come and say you are being ill-treated 
<br/>and mistreated, but you are part of us already.  You are voting.  That is through the work of former 
<br/>Prime Ministers and administrators in trying to take care of the minority group within our society.  
<br/>So please all I want to raise is, please ensure that you understand what you are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You said you have been discriminated all this time and how come you are living amongst us?  
<br/>The Alliance Government ventured to pay for all the evacuation cost of removing the people from 
<br/>Vunilagi, the largest estate in Fiji back to Solomon Islands. They  came all the way to Suva from 
<br/>Vanua Levu and before we could put into effect their evacuation procedures, some of them returned 
<br/></span><span>to Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They could not leave without that place, that is our </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land. So, we had to come in and 
<br/>receive them because they have been there.  The way they live is different.  That is what honourable 
<br/>Tubuna is  saying.  Some they do not  have toilets, yes, Naviavia is  like that. Naviavia is  trying to 
<br/>integrate into the Tikina of Wailevu so they would be fully part of that district when they hold their 
<br/>annual meetings and that is the onward trend right throughout Fiji.  So, to say that you have been

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mistreated, honourable Bia, I take exception to that, and I do not fully agree with what you have said, 
<br/>because you have been offered seats in the House, the Parliament of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  in  the  Multiethnic  Affairs,  Mr.  Sanegar  and  then  you  have  Father  Sanegar  in  the 
<br/>Anglican Church who used to be a great leader for the Melanesian brothers and sisters.  So, I take 
<br/>exception to that, honourable Aliki Bia and honourable Tubuna.  Please, make up you twos’ mind 
<br/>whether you want to be Fijians or want to go back to the Solomons because I will not sit here and 
<br/>listen to all these diatribe going on that you all mistreated, et cetera, because I say, “no, it is totally 
<br/>different.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remember that case when the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) Government under 
<br/>the present Prime Minister, the Minister for Agriculture then was the late Militoni Leweniqila.  He 
<br/>was charged with the responsibility to evacuate all the descendants of Solomon Islanders in Vunilagi 
<br/>back to the Solomons, but they only came as far as Suva and then they went back again, they have 
<br/>been living there ever since.  They eat freely of our land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I hope you do not mind me uttering what I have stated because I am 
<br/>also wearing another traditional hat in this House, and I will not sit back and listen to all these kinds 
<br/>of, shall I say “hot air” without that being fully proven with facts that you have been ill-treated all 
<br/>these years.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I intend to adjourn the House now for lunch, and when we return at 2.30 p.m., we will resume 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the End of Week Statements.

<div><span>Benefits of Remittance to Fiji’s Economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka saka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my End of Week Statement on the Benefits of Remittance 
<br/>to Fiji’s Economy. Over the past five years, Fiji has witnessed a remarkable impact of remittances 
<br/>on our economy in Fiji.  Remittances have become a vital source of foreign exchange, bolstering our 
<br/>nation’s  financial  stability.    They  have  not  only  provided  a  lifeline  for  countless  Fijian  families, 
<br/>enhancing their purchasing power and improving living standards, but have also played a pivotal role 
<br/>in supporting local businesses and stimulating economic growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The inflow of funds from our citizens who have gone abroad through the Pacific Australia 
<br/>Labour  Mobility  (PALM)  Scheme,  migration,  peacekeeping  duties  and  other  overseas  work 
<br/>engagements  have  been  instrumental  in  financing  educational  obligations,  healthcare  needs  and 
<br/>small-scale entrepreneurship.  In essence, remittances have empowered individuals and communities 
<br/>to  seek  improvements  in  their  living  standards  and  explore  opportunities  for  growth  and 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In retrospect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that during challenging times, such as the 
<br/>global pandemic, remittances served as a buffer, helping our economy to stay resilient and supporting 
<br/>the  ordinary  Fijian.  The  June  2024  Report  from  the  World  Bank  on  the  latest  Migration  and 
<br/>Development  Brief  which  was  released  after  a  period  of  a  strong  growth  during  2021  to  2022, 
<br/>officially recorded that  remittance flows to  low and middle-income countries moderated in  2023, 
<br/>reaching an estimated $656 billion.  In 2023, remittances surpassed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
<br/>and Official Development  Assistance (ODA)  and like other developing  nations, remittances have 
<br/>been increasing steadily over the years, making it a substantial source of foreign exchange earner for 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Ministry of Labour data, the PALM Scheme in Australia 
<br/>and Regional Seasonal Employment (RSE) Scheme in New Zealand remittances from 2018 to-date 
<br/>is approximately FJD300 million. I am sure that all of us seated here in this august House have read 
<br/>on social and print media how this has helped many individuals and households here in Fiji. Personal 
<br/>remittances  have  helped  support  consumption  in  families,  which  include  purchase  of  household 
<br/>goods  and  motor  vehicles.  Moreover,  they  may  be  used  for  social  activities  such  as  weddings, 
<br/>funerals and other community projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, personal remittances has been the second largest foreign exchange earner 
<br/>for Fiji since 2004, next only to tourism and  outranking our traditional foreign exchange earners, 
<br/>such as sugar, timber, gold and garment. The significance of remittances to the Fijian economy has 
<br/>increased over the years, particularly as it supplements the household income, as well as a major and 
<br/>reliable source of foreign exchange here in our homeland.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The growth in remittance over the years is driven by many factors. Notably, there have been 
<br/>increases in the number of nurses, early childhood education teachers, peacekeepers, caregivers and 
<br/>sports  personnel  who  are  working  abroad  and  who  provide  the  utmost  fast  remittance  to  our 
<br/>homeland.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, the number of military personnel serving in the Middle East has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1898 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also increased. Many individuals and families rely on their wages and salaries as the primary source 
<br/>of income to meet the basic household needs of those who fall under this category.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on indicators such as the location and migrant  population  abroad, the major source 
<br/>countries of our inward personal remittances are Australia, United States of America, New Zealand, 
<br/>Canada, Europe and the Middle East.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward, it is crucial that we continue to recognise and maximise 
<br/>the  benefits  of  these  financial  contributions,  ensuring  that  they  are  directed  towards  sustainable 
<br/>development and long-term economic prosperity for all Fijians, to mitigate challenges and minimise 
<br/>dependency on remittances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/>for Education for his Statement.  He has quite rightly pointed out that remittances is ow the second 
<br/>largest foreign exchange earner for Fiji and it has been like that since 2004, next to only tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the last five years between 2019 and 2023, personal remittances have grown 
<br/>on average by a staggering 17 percent every year.  In 2019, it stood at around $606 million and have 
<br/>more than doubled to $1.25 billion by the end of 2023.  Sir, between 2019 and 2023 we have received 
<br/>a total of $4.5 billion in remittances alone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The adoption, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of Fiji’s mobile e-wallets for receiving remittances made a 
<br/>significant  difference  and  advancement  in  the  country’s  financial  ecosystem.  It  provided  a  more 
<br/>accessible, efficient and secure method of transferring funds and this shift, Sir, has somewhat reduced 
<br/>transaction cost, delays and also provided extensive accessibility to people in the rural areas.  So, by 
<br/>leveraging this mobile e-wallet technology, our people are now able to receive remittances directly 
<br/>on  their  mobile  devices,  reducing  their  dependency  on  physical  cash  and  enhancing  financial 
<br/>inclusion, particularly, for unbanked and underbanked populations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, received through mobile network operators - M-PAiSA 
<br/>and MyCash, were a meagre 3 percent in 2019, has now increased to about 38 percent in 2023.  In 
<br/>2023,  remittances  received  through  the  mobile  money  e-wallets  totalled  $476  million.    Sir,  20 
<br/>percent,  about  $252  million,  came  through  commercial  banks.    About  42  percent  -  $524  million, 
<br/>came through money transfer operators, the foreign exchange dealers around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not just an abstract economic concept.  As the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister quite rightly pointed out, it is a critical source for household income and it goes 
<br/>into consumption, but also  providing basic necessities such as food, education and healthcare.   It 
<br/>contributes to poverty alleviation and improves the overall quality of life for ordinary Fijians.  So, in 
<br/>2023,  the  total  remittances  amounted  to  about  10  percent  of  our  GDP  and  that  underscores  the 
<br/>significance in sustaining household consumption and driving local demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the remittances also have a multiplier effect on the economy, which means 
<br/>that every dollar that comes into the country has multiple effects - stimulates local businesses, create 
<br/>jobs, fosters economic activity and, particularly, is important in rural and remote areas.  Someone 
<br/></span><span>said to me that people in Labasa have a lot of money.  The consumption and new businesses opening 
<br/></span><span>up in Labasa are doing very well.  So, I said, “Yes, per capita, a lot more people from Vanua Levu 
<br/>are, perhaps, in Suva and also outside of Fiji, so remittances in Vanua Levu might be higher compared 
<br/>to some of the other areas.”  Also, remittances from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also recognise that remittances contribute to human capital development.  Many families 
<br/>use  remittance  income  to  invest  in  education  and  skills  training  for  their  children  which,  in  turn, 
<br/>enhances our national workforce and supports long term economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remittances,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  honourable  Vanawalu  pointed  out,  offer  a  stable  and 
<br/>predictable source of income that is, kind of, less vulnerable to economic cycles, compared to other 
<br/>revenue.  So, during periods of economic downturn and disaster, remittance inflows remain steady 
<br/>or even increased during those emergencies because Fijians abroad send additional support to their 
<br/>families.  So,  these  counter  cyclical  nature  of  remittances  provides  a  crucial  buffer  to  smooth 
<br/>consumption and stabilise our economy during challenging times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the effect of us receiving remittances is quite multifaceted.  
<br/>Sometimes  it  not  only  has  temporary  effect,  but  also  has  a  permanent  effect.    The  source  of  our 
<br/>remittances, 44 percent  of our remittances come from Australia;  US  is  second - 24 percent; New 
<br/>Zealand - 18 percent; UK -  6 percent; and the rest comes from the others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  conclusion,  on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister, Government 
<br/>and, indeed, all the honourable Members of this Parliament, all I want to do at this point is to thank 
<br/>our people - our diaspora, whether they are in employment there, whether they are playing rugby or 
<br/>in  peacekeeping  duties,  we  want  to  thank  them  for  sending  remittances,  for  looking  after  their 
<br/>families  and  friends  and,  in  particular,  for  supporting  their  families  and  friends  and  contributing 
<br/>generously to Non-Governmental Organisations to support activities in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to also point out that as part of that strategy to attract our diaspora 
<br/>back into the country, we want to gain their brain.  While we send people from this side, they go 
<br/>there, they work hard, get the experience, earn enough money, and some of them are coming back 
<br/>and  investing  in  the  country.    So,  it  is  not  just  remittances,  it  is  also  about  gaining  from  the 
<br/>experiences of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  initiated  changes  to  our  immigration  rules.  For 
<br/>example, we are now allowing all those people and their children registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula 
<br/>(Native Land Register), if they do not have a passport but have a passport for another country, if they 
<br/>want to come, live, reside and work in Fiji, they do not need to get a Fiji passport.  For others, all 
<br/>they  have  to  prove  is  that  their  grandparents  or  their  parents  were  citizens  of  Fiji  at  the  time  of 
<br/>Independence.  This is just one of the first steps that this Government has taken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are looking at other policies, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications was 
<br/>in Canada and he was telling me that the interest of our diaspora wanting to invest in Fiji is quite big.  
<br/>It is a happy story in some sense, Sir, when our people go out of the country, they go and work there, 
<br/>some of them live there, but their love for Fiji and they are constantly coming back to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not only just remittances, a lot of the tourist dollar that comes in, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is 
<br/>also part of our diaspora coming back and spending their time here with their families and friends 
<br/>and spending their money.  Again, we want to take this opportunity to thank all of them.

<div><span>Protecting Coastal Communities Against Sea Level Rise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity to 
<br/>make a Statement regarding the real challenges faced by our vulnerable coastal communities here in 
<br/>Fiji and other small Island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean region.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As many of you know, Fiji is confronting profound challenges due to climate change - rising 
<br/>sea  levels,  increased  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events,  changes  in  precipitation  patterns  and 
<br/>ocean acidification, pose significant threats to its coastal communities.  These populations, largely 
<br/>dependent on agriculture, fisheries and tourism, are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of 
<br/>climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Statement  highlights  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change  in  Fiji,  the  impact  on 
<br/>coastal populations, agriculture, waterways and floodplains, infrastructure and other critical issues, 
<br/>while proposing pathways for mitigation strategies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  rising  sea  levels  is  one  of  climate  change’s  most  direct  and  immediate 
<br/>consequences.  According to the IPCC 2021 Report, projections indicate that  the global sea level 
<br/>would rise from 0.3 metres to 0.8 metres by 2100.  In Fiji, numerous coastal areas are less than a 
<br/>metre above sea level,  making them exceptionally vulnerable.  The Fiji National Climate Change 
<br/>Policy indicates that rising sea levels can damage homes and coastal ecosystems, threatening food 
<br/>security and livelihoods.  This is in reference to the Government of Fiji 2018 Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to climate change, we also witness an increasing incidence of extreme 
<br/>weather events such as cyclones, floods and droughts.  The devastation caused by  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 
<br/>2016, which resulted in estimated damages exceeding $1 billion, serves as a stark reminder of the 
<br/>potential  impacts  of  climate  change,  according  to  the  World  Bank  2016  Report.    The  changing 
<br/>climate is likely to exacerbate such events, thus destabilising the socio-economic frameworks that 
<br/>coastal communities depend on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of this deadly combination of rising sea levels and severe weather 
<br/>events,  we  have  witnessed  significant  new  challenges  to  our  coastal  settlements  and  villages, 
<br/>properties and livelihoods.  The sea, which was once the very source of survival for our ancestors, is 
<br/>now  threatening  the  survival  of  these  communities.    Rising  seawater  is  washing  away  houses, 
<br/>villages, burial grounds and fertile agricultural land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  has  displaced  some  communities,  while  others  are  awaiting 
<br/>relocation.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving entire  communities is  not  an option any community  would 
<br/>willingly choose.  Leaving their ancestral homes implies abandoning their roots, cultural heritage, 
<br/>traditional grounds and way of living.  It is an option no family or community would prefer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  option  for  the  protection  of  vulnerable  coastal  communities  is 
<br/>constructing seawalls.  As stated by the former Minister for Waterways, Dr. Mahendra Reddy, in the 
<br/>last term of Parliament, 114 communities needed protection through seawall construction as of 2022.  
<br/>What is the progress on this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  former  Minister  came  up  with  a  brilliant  idea  of  constructing  nature-based  solution 
<br/>seawalls.  I note from his recent 2024 paper published in the </span><span>European Journal of Engineering and 
<br/>Technology Research,</span><span> </span><span>Vol. 9, Issue No.4</span><span>, he provides the detailed design of the nature-based solution 
<br/>seawalls and noted that as of 2022, Fiji needed to protect 142 villages by constructing 108 seawalls 
<br/>with  a  total  length  of  38.2  kilometres.  Over  the  period,  2018  to  2022,  12  nature-based  solution 
<br/></span><span>seawalls were constructed around Fiji. What is the progress since then? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announcement on 13</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>March, 2023, a picture of the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, shaking hands 
<br/>that KIWA awarded €326,077 (FJ$700,000) to  construct seawalls at  six sites: Nakawaga Village, 
<br/>Vesi  Village,  Ligaulevu  Village,  Somosomo  Village,  Navola  Village  and  Navolau  No.1  Village.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  projects  were  supposed  to  be  completed  by  December  this  year.    What  is  the  progress, 
<br/>honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change has also significantly affected the health of these vulnerable 
<br/>coastal populations.  Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns lead to outbreaks 
<br/>of  waterborne  diseases,  vector-borne  diseases  and  heat  related  illness.  The  World  Health 
<br/>Organization (WHO) warns that these health risks are exacerbated in low resource settings, affecting 
<br/>the most vulnerable populations, especially children and the elderly, according to the 2018 WHO 
<br/>Report.  I wish to ask the Government on what plans and strategies it has in place to educate and 
<br/>protect these vulnerable coastal communities from the negative effects of climate change on their 
<br/>health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  agriculture  is  the  cornerstone  of  Fiji’s  economy  and  a  principal  means  of 
<br/>subsistence  for  many  coastal  communities.    Climate  change,  however,  poses  severe  risks  to 
<br/>agriculture through the loss of arable land and decline in crop yields.  Good quality arable land in 
<br/>low-lying  areas  is  being  washed  away  or  inundated  by  saltwater,  rendering  it  unsuitable  for 
<br/>agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to ask the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, what 
<br/>strategies  do  you  have  to  prevent  saltwater  intrusion  and  loss  of  arable  coastal  land?  Increased 
<br/>temperatures and altered rainfall patterns significantly impact crop yields.  Studies by the Food and 
<br/>Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  indicate  that  climate  variability  can  lead  to  reduced  crop 
<br/>productivity,  particularly  for  staple  crops,  such  as  taro  and  cassava,  according  to  the  2020  FAO 
<br/>Report.  This decline threatens food security and livelihoods, pushing rural population further into 
<br/>poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  ask  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture  on  what  research 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programmes do they have to address this issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices can enhance 
<br/>food  security  and  resilience  against  climate  variability.  Agroecological  methods,  such  as  crop 
<br/>rotation,  intercropping,  and  organic  farming  can  help  maintain  productivity,  while  minimising 
<br/>environmental impact. What strategy has the Agriculture Ministry developed on this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rise in sea level also poses a threat to coastal communities regarding the 
<br/>availability of clean drinking water. This is further compounded by extreme weather patterns, such 
<br/>as  increased  variability  in  rainfall  and  prolonged  droughts,  therefore,  affecting  the  quantity  and 
<br/>quality  of  ground  and  surface  water.  What  plans  are  in  place  to  provide  these  communities  with 
<br/>alternative water sources so that we do not panic when we completely run out of water? It is not only 
<br/>households  that  will  be  affected,  but  also  schools,  health  centres  and  agriculture  located  in  these 
<br/>areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, empowering local communities through education and engagement is vital. 
<br/>Training programmes focused on climate adaptation strategies and sustainable practices can enhance 
<br/>community resilience and empower individuals to respond to climate challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our public infrastructure is also under threat. Coastal roads are being washed 
<br/>away, such as the road in front of Taveuni High College, which is subject to coastal erosion. The 
<br/>scouring of riverbanks is also threatening the collapse of critical bridges in coastal and rural areas. 
<br/>Some schools and health centres in the Northern Division are being threatened by riverbank erosion 
<br/>and coastal erosion.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  our  relevant  ministries  conducted  a  stock  take  of  these  issues  and 
<br/>developed a plan for adaptation and mitigation? Time is running out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Government 
<br/>should  enhance  policies  that  focus  on  climate  adaptation  strategies.  This  includes  investing  in 
<br/>resilient  infrastructure,  upgrading  drainage  systems,  and  developing  early  warning  systems  for 
<br/>extreme weather events to protect vulnerable communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  I  acknowledge  progress  in  some  drainage  work,  we  need  a  countrywide  plan. 
<br/>According to the Asian Development Bank 2019 Report, the cost of climate-proofing infrastructure 
<br/>in  Pacific  Island  countries  is  projected  to  be  substantial,  affecting  government  budgets  and 
<br/>development prospects. We must spread this cost over successive years rather than wait to spend it 
<br/>all at once, thereby facing budgetary problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  concluding,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  addressing  climate  change  requires  local,  regional  and 
<br/>international cooperation. Collaborating with organisations, such as the United Nations Framework 
<br/>Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), can enhance 
<br/>resource mobilization and bring in expertise for effective mitigation strategies.  We must act now; 
<br/>failure to do so will devastate vulnerable communities, our tourism and agriculture sectors, and our 
<br/>economy.  In  the  long  run,  it  will  affect  the  Government's  ability  to  engage  in  development  and 
<br/>distribution policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Kirpal for his End of Week 
<br/>Statement which covers a lot of ground on climate change, not only limited to the subject I was given 
<br/>to prepare on and, that is, protecting our vulnerable coastal community against sea level rise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  said  earlier  on  in  the  week,  it  would  be  good  to  review  our 
<br/>procedures as  the civil  servants  working  in  our  offices prepare detailed  answers to  the questions, 
<br/>particularly the questions that are relevant at this time in our development, in our history.  So, when 
<br/>we provide answers, we are conversational in our responses, while the prepared text have a lot of 
<br/>information on the subjects.  Perhaps, if we can, at the end, they come and collect our questions and 
<br/>responses, and if all those could be included in the official records for future generations.  They come, 
<br/>they talk about climate change, they will know, “Oh, honourable Sanjay Kirpal asked the question 
<br/>and the response came from the Prime Minister”.  They would probably just read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>
<br/>Reports and not get to the bottom or get to the heart of the responses which have the facts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this afternoon, even before I go deeply into the response to the very good 
<br/>question  asked,  I  would  like  to  pay  my  respects  to  a  former  Lord  Mayor  of  Suva,  the  late  Vijay 
<br/>Raghwan, who passed away earlier in the week - a very good friend of mine. He was one of those 
<br/>who was a bridge in my relationship with the Indo-Fijian community after 1987.  He was Lord Mayor 
<br/>in 1987 when the Fijian Nationalists in Suva were terrorising everyone. They threatened to go on site 
<br/>to those who were working in the market and the late Vijay Raghwan, as Mayor, called me and said, 
<br/>“See, these people want to burn the market”.  I asked, “Who?” He replied, “The Nationalists, they 
<br/>said they will march up to you.”  I said, “Tell them, who are you going to march to?” They told him, 
<br/>“To the Commander.” I said, “If they tell you that, ask them, ‘Who is the Commander?  I do not 
<br/>know the Commander, I am the Mayor of this city.’” That is exactly what happened.  They threatened 
<br/>him and he said, “I do not know the Commander, I am the Mayor of this city and his camp is within 
<br/></span><span>my city.”  They were baffled and stood down. He was a good man, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  my  Minister’s  defended  him  very  well  when  he  got  the  tender  to  build  the  Civic 
<br/>Towers.  I was asked by the former Leader of the Opposition, the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy, “Did 
<br/>you  give  it  to  Mr.  Raghwan  because  he  is  your  friend?”  The  Minister  for  Housing  and  Urban 
<br/>Development said, “Yes, I gave it to him because he is my friend.” Again, he asked, “Why?”  He 
<br/>responded, “Because I knew he would do a good job”, and that was the end of the questions.  I sent

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my condolences to his children and grandchildren.  To those of us who will continue to look after 
<br/>Suva, hopefully, we will look after the city that he loved very much, properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the late Mrs. Ema Bovoro who was the CEO of St. John 
<br/>Ambulance Fiji, the St. John Association of Fiji and recently decorated with the Officer of the Order 
<br/>of St John.  She has done a lot of work for the St John’s in Fiji and our condolences go out to her 
<br/>families and friends. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  coming back to  the  rise in  sea level, unfortunately,  as  abbreviated here, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“SLR” – Sea Level Rise, it says SLR is a hazard.  I am going to sack these civil servants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it is, sea level rise is a danger. I hope I will be able to table my response because it has the 
<br/>facts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conversationally, my house is the first one in my village next to the sea.  When it was built, 
<br/>when I came back from Lebanon, the steps out of the kitchen was stepping straight into the high tide.  
<br/>If you want to walk out that kitchen door, make sure it is low tide otherwise you walk out of the front 
<br/>door.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, that has been reclaimed by the Army at the time.  The first seawall was built by the 
<br/>village men who went to New Zealand to do fruit picking before the seasonal workers programme 
<br/>came  in.  We  collected  money,  and  we  are  very  grateful  to  the  FijiFirst  Government,  they  built  a 
<br/>replacement sea wall. A little further out, a little higher, but we will have to keep doing that with the 
<br/>rising sea levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  asked  about  what  we  are  doing  about  inundated  coastal  areas  and  you  directed  your 
<br/>comments to the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  I went to look at an area at Ba where they are 
<br/>anticipating a lot of that area which used to be under cane, being inundated with seawater, and there 
<br/>are researches going on about seawater resilient varieties of cane and rice and also the possibility of 
<br/>starting giant crabs, giant prawns or tiger prawns as they call it in parts of Asia.  I thought a cartoon 
<br/>artist would show a man perched on a tree eating big prawns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are living the reality of sea level rise all over Fiji. The Government has a programme 
<br/>which carried on from the previous Government on the relocation on some of these villages.  Some 
<br/>are still ongoing, we have heard so much about Nabavatu, very close to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance’s farm.  They all need to move very soon and also villages in Bua 
<br/>and Kadavu.  I must remind the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection that 
<br/>her grandmother’s village is almost under sea now, but they will also be moved up to Udu Point in 
<br/>Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is a very good one and I have some very good answers here, 
<br/>the  facts  and  names,  and  I  hope  I  can  table  the  response  so  that  future  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>historians and maybe, scientists will look back and say, “Ah100 years ago, they were talking about 
<br/></span><span>this, they were talking in a Parliament House in Suva. Where is that?”  “Down there”, they will be 
<br/></span><span>sitting up on the mountains of Naitasiri and pointing down at where we are today. So, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, as I said, it is a very good question and not only for Opposition and the Government to talk about, 
<br/>but it is also the whole nation, as I have said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also like to inform the House that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is coming 
<br/>up. The honourable Leader of the Opposition will be accompanying His Excellency the President

<div><span>and the honourable leader of the G-9 Bloc, to support the President as its leader of the delegation to 
<br/>the UNGA.  I hope they  have prepared.  On the side meetings on climate change, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition will be involved on security, the leader of G-9 Bloc will be involved and 
<br/>talking to G20 Leaders.  I hope they are ready to go, if not, they can always decline my invitation.

<div><span>          MR.  SPEAKER.-  For  the  information  of  honourable  Members,  the  Secretariat  has  run  up 
<br/>voluminous report of all these exchanges that we are doing, in the hope that we could have something 
<br/>like what the Prime Minister wants. It is in black and white.  The Australian Parliament and New 
<br/>Zealand  Parliament  have  it  as  well  and  these  are  all  the  exchanges  here.  We  have  them  in  big 
<br/>volumes, so it becomes a good reference book as well.  But the only thing now is we are looking 
<br/>around for sponsorship in order to get them bounded.  Madam Secretary-General is dealing directly 
<br/>with UNDP in the hope that we get some funding there, but that is the development we have so far, 
<br/>Sir.  We thank you so much for your kind thoughts.

<div><span>Stray Animal Campaign – Cattle and Horses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>miau sa bula re. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before you to address the House on matters related to stray animals, 
<br/>specifically  cattle  and  horses.    This  has  been  a  continous  problem  in  Fiji,  affecting  farming 
<br/>communities, with significant impacts on nutrition, health, economy and public safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ownership of animals entails a significant degree of responsibility.  It is 
<br/>often witnessed that due to negligence of their owners, these animals are frequently seen wandering 
<br/>unsupervised, especially in rural areas. This situation has resulted in considerable crop losses and 
<br/>damages to farming communities, increased risks of accidents to road users, losses of revenues for 
<br/>farmers and increase in NCDs from poor nutritious food. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are more than one Act that covers the subject of my address today and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Pound Act of 1877; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Brands Act of 1928; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Protection of Animal Act of 1954; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Trespasses of Animal Act of 1955; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Biosecurity Act 2008 which repealed the Quarantine law of 1964). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While these Acts (except Biosecurity Act 2008) are very old and they cannot address Fiji’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current situation and needs, a thorough review of these legislations is urgently required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pound Act defines the term “poundable animal” as any horse, cattle, 
<br/>goat, sheep and pig, young or old, male or female.  The Pound Act covers establishment of specific 
<br/>livestock pounds intended for the confinement of stray animals.  This legislation stipulates that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Any animals that are not confined on the owner’s property and are straying on roadsides or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other farms will be trapped, loaded and taken to animal pounds. 
<br/>If your animals are tied onto someone else’s property without the owner’s consent, the animal 
<br/>will be captured and taken to the pound as well.  Once the animals are loaded on to the truck, 
<br/>they  will  be  taken  straight  to  the  pound  and  will  only  be  released  to  their  owners  if  the 
<br/>requirements are met.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If your animals are tied near to the roadside and can reach up to six metres from the centre 
<br/>of the line, that animal will also be taken for pounding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, stray animal causes substantial destruction to agricultural fields, affecting 
<br/>crops such as sugarcane, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, cassava, vegetables, and limits our food security.  The destruction of 
<br/>these crops not only impact farmers’ livelihoods, but also have wider economic consequences. It had 
<br/>also been noted that stray animals had been a major cause of widespread tuberculosis and brucellosis 
<br/>infection in cattle and had also costed Government millions of dollars every year for disease control. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some factors contributing to the challenges associated with stray animals 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>include irresponsible ownership, economical status of farmers and  
<br/>outdated penalty charges that are implicated to owners or offenders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The primary cause of stray animal problems is the absence of responsible ownership. Owners 
<br/>fail to provide proper care, or containment of their animals, resulting in their unrestricted movements.  
<br/>In addition, economic factors including poverty and restricted access to resources play a significant 
<br/>role in the problem of stray animals.  It is also sad to note that some livestock owners are ignorant of 
<br/>animal’s welfare and will only attend to their animals when they need them.  The high fencing cost, 
<br/>low quality of fencing material and absence of quality control for farming equipment and inputs have 
<br/>been a major contributor to improper fencing and control of livestock movements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last three years, a total of 2,193 complaints had been lodged by 
<br/>farmers and members of the general public on issues related to stray animals.  Similarly, the Ministry 
<br/>had successfully captured more than 2,700 stray animals over the past three years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper procedures were implemented to guarantee that animals that had been branded were 
<br/>returned to their rightful owners who came to retrieve them.  These animals that remained unclaimed 
<br/>were auctioned off, following a period of 10 days’ notice.  We urge farmers to follow the guidance 
<br/>provided by our officers at the Animal Health and Production Division, and our officers are stationed 
<br/>throughout Fiji to perform this vital task.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our officers normally await requests and complaints from communities and 
<br/>the public before campaigns are carried out to capture stray animals.  There had been instances in the 
<br/>past where firearms and tranquilisers had been used to address stray animal control.  This used to be 
<br/>a very strict procedure, and it is only done when human lives are at risk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has acknowledged the seriousness of the problems concerning stray cattle 
<br/></span><span>and horses and has implemented several initiatives to address it.  For the 2024-2025 financial year, 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  has  allocated  a  budget  of  $530,000  for  stray  animal 
<br/>activities.  The Pound Act 1877 provides a structured framework for the law and orderly management 
<br/>of stray animals.   Across the nation, there are 27 pounds situated in strategic locations where stray 
<br/>animals are impounded after they are captured.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Brands Act 1928 requires cattle owners to brand animals.  According to 
<br/>the legislation, the sole method of identifying an animals’ owner is through the brand.  The brand 
<br/></span><span>should be visible, readable, and accompanied by a registered number issued in your name by the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways.  Owners can only obtain a brand registration certificate by 
<br/>applying at the Office of Ministry of Agriculture Fiji-wide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has conducted numerous public awareness campaigns designed 
<br/>to educate the public about the importance of responsible animal ownership.  These campaigns have 
<br/>emphasised the necessity of proper care and management of livestock to prevent potential nuisance

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and hazards.  For the past three years, a total of 267 awareness campaigns had been conducted and 
<br/>continue to take place throughout Fiji, especially in the Western Division, which is a red zone for 
<br/>stray cattle and horses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  Government  initiatives,  local  communities  have  also  been  proactive  in 
<br/>addressing the stray animal problem.   Initiatives such as organising cattle drives and establishing 
<br/>community  grazing  areas  has  also  been  undertaken  to  manage  and  reduce  the  number  of  stray 
<br/>animals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  although  progress  had  been  achieved  in  addressing  the 
<br/>problem of stray animals in Fiji, we will continue to encounter the challenges in the near future. Apart 
<br/>from the review of the old Acts, the Government will continue to intensify initiatives with individuals 
<br/>and communities, to alleviate the adverse effect of stray cattle and horses.  I finally want to assure 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I will be providing a statement in this House with regards to the use of 
<br/>antimicrobial and livestock production in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  response  to  the  Statement,  I  think  the 
<br/>problem  of  stray  animals  is  an  extensive  one.    Just  last  week,  I  received  pictures  of  sheep  being 
<br/>attacked in Nasarawaqa - 100 sheep perished by a pack of dogs.  I had already talked about this in 
<br/>this  august  Parliament.    In  fact,  the  problem  of  stray  animals  has  become  a  disincentive  to  our 
<br/>livestock farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have Acts that bind us in terms of what we can do in controlling stray animals.  But then, 
<br/>most of these legislations are very old, such as the Brands Act which is an Act from 1928. Then there 
<br/>is the Pound Act 1877, which is just as old as the Brands Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pound Act 1877 is a very rigid legislation. It does not even allow the Minister to use his 
<br/>discretion  to  release  an  animal,  should  a  farmer  request  the  release.  With  the  processes  that  are 
<br/>contained within the Pound Act 1877, an animal without the brand will surely end up in the abattoir 
<br/>and  given  the  diseases  that  we  have  now  (brucellosis  and  tuberculosis),  we  do  not  want  to  keep 
<br/>animals inside the pound, or bringing animals from somewhere else into the pound located in another 
<br/>geographical  area  because  under  the  Biosecurity  Regulations,  we  cannot  do  that.  So,  without  the 
<br/>brand, surely the animal will end up in the abattoir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to inform the House this afternoon that we are already into the process 
<br/>of reviewing the Pound Act 1877, simply because of the rigid nature of that legislation. It gives no 
<br/>flexibility to the Director or to the Minister or anyone to release the animal, once it is impounded.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ask for the support of Parliament. Sometimes, as a 
<br/>Ministry, we cop a lot of flak.  I was interviewed by the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> or one of the dailies, and I said, “I 
<br/>think these dogs should be shot.”  There were comments of cruelty, et cetera.  It is a catch 22 situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  one  hand,  you  have  farmers  who  want  to  breed  livestock  that  will  contribute  to  the 
<br/>economy and yet, on the other side, you have others who just keep breeding dogs and let them run 
<br/>loose, and then when there is a dog attack, hundreds of animals like that perish.  I have the pictures 
<br/></span><span>here if you want to see, honourable Member, I can show you.
