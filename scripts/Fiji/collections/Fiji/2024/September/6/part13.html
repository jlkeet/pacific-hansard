<div><span>Criteria on Cadet Training in Schools 
<br/>(Question No. 205/2024)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  inform  Parliament  on  the  criteria 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>used by the Ministry to approve Cadet training in schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question, given that it can be a great testament of this cadetship training at the school level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had requested that I be given a time to provide a Ministerial Statement on 
<br/>extra-curricular activities in schools, which includes cadetship training, rugby and athletics, that are 
<br/>currently involving students and school resources, to allow for a brief and better reflection of what is 
<br/>being carried out in schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the history of cadet training in schools at that time, there was only a limited number of 
<br/>schools  who  have  its  intended  purpose.  But  now,  there  are  about  30  schools  that  are  currently 
<br/>involved in cadet training.  In line with the SDG4, this is now part of the lifelong learning so I assure 
<br/>you, honourable Members, that I will make a Ministerial Statement in the next Parliament Sitting, to 
<br/>address  all  these  extra-curricular  activities  in  line  with  the  SDG4  and  also  part  of  the  Denarau 
<br/>Declaration 202. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Sir, for the schools that are engaged in cadet training, the criteria that is used is as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Written parental consent from the students. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Medical clearance that the child is physically fit and able to participate in the activity. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Religious  rights  of  the  child  is  also  taken  into  consideration  because  some  faiths  have 
<br/>reservations for their followers to be part of the cadet training, like the Jehovah’s Witness. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Commitment from teachers, teachers must be assigned to supervise and assist the military 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>personnel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Affordability for parents and consent for their child to participate and acknowledge that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there will be associated costs that will be shared with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the criteria that have been used, but like I said, I will be giving a 
<br/>Ministerial Statement covering these extra-curricular activities that are involving students in school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  First  of  all,  we  fully  appreciate  the  position  that  has  been  taken  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry and we look forward to that Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I have a supplementary question, honourable Minister for Education.  
<br/>I have a feeling that we have strayed off track, as far as the objectives of cadet training is concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, a review is very much needed. I know it digs into the pockets of parents to buy the 
<br/>uniform. Right now, it is just marching in uniform.  The objectives of discipline and teamwork, I 
<br/>think needs to be relooked at and turn this programme into a useful programme for schools and to 
<br/>keep them occupied, given the problems that we have on drugs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a great addition to cadet training, especially for 
<br/></span><span>boarding schools, is to get them to have a brass band. Get them occupied in music.  My supplementary 
<br/></span><span>question is, would you be willing to make a review of cadet training in schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we are trying to do an evaluation of the 
<br/>programme, to improve in terms of the current practice that is being done now, especially with the 
<br/>provision of brass bands to schools, like Queen Victoria School (QVS), which has a long history in 
<br/>terms of the provision of cadet training in schools.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think in the 1960s, Suva Methodist Boys School which I had attended, 
<br/>used to have a set of drums donated by the Military and that was how we learnt how to beat the drum 
<br/>and march to the beat of the drum as well.  That was in Toorak. Toorak was the only renown primary 
<br/>school that existed then in the Suva area, going right down to Qauia in Lami and right up to Tacirua 
<br/>and Tamavua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Soon, we had the set of drums.  I do not know who donated the drums, but we used it and we 
<br/>marched well to the beat of the drum, knowing how to beat the drum for slow march and quick march. 
<br/>I am just sharing that, whilst we await the statement from the honourable Minister for Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Marketing Initiatives for Destination Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 206/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on the marketing initiatives in place for Destination Fiji in 
<br/>support of Fiji Airways’ forthcoming services to Dallas, United States? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/>Just last week, on 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, the Air Service Agreement (ASA) for Open Skies was signed between 
<br/>the Government of the United States and the Government of Fiji, which has been heralded as a great 
<br/>achievement by the Coalition Government. We already knew that the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>together  with  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  State  of  the  US  had  signed  this  in  Tonga  last  week,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In preparation for this milestone, earlier this month, Fiji Airways proudly announced its first 
<br/>ever  non-stop  flight,  connecting  Nadi,  Fiji,  with  Dallas  Fort  Worth  International  Airport, 
<br/>commencing on 10</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024. The new route represents a significant leap, as Fiji Airways’ 
<br/>24</span><span>th</span><span> international direct flight and its fifth destination in North America, joining Los Angeles, San 
<br/>Francisco, Honolulu and Vancouver.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Dallas  itself,  what  we  have  there  is  the  partnership  with  American 
<br/>Airlines.  Fiji  Airways  has  linked  up  with  American  Airlines  and  the  AAdvantage  travel  rewards 
<br/>programme, which is for American Airlines, is a huge step forward for anyone flying Fiji Airways 
<br/>and American Airlines. American Airlines advantaged members can enjoy ticketing through services 
<br/>on Fiji Airways, with all the same benefits, like priority check-in, priority boarding, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, AAdvantage is the longest running loyalty programme in the world. Fiji 
<br/>Airways is now the 50</span><span>th</span><span> full member of Oneworld Alliance, beginning in 2025. There are 115 million 
<br/>members of the AAdvantage programme – the largest in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dallas Fort Worth has 193 domestic US ports that fly directly to Dallas, and 67 international 
<br/>non-stop destinations worldwide, across 26 countries.  So, what it means, for example, tourists will 
<br/>be able to fly non-stop from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, through Dallas to Fiji, or from London to Dallas 
<br/></span><span>and on to Fiji. So, just one stop into Dallas, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The airlines in the Oneworld Alliance  include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British 
<br/>Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, 
<br/>Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, Sri Lankan Airlines, Fiji Airways and soon, Oman Air.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dallas Fort Worth is the third busiest airport in the world and in 2023, served 82 million 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1871 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>passengers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, American Airlines has 850 outgoing flights from Dallas Fort Worth 
<br/>Airport every day. Dallas is considered one of the best and most efficient airports in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, their service to Fiji is non-stop, of 13 hours, and will operate three times a 
<br/>week - Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, utilising our state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a joint effort, Tourism Fiji has launched a series of collaborative marketing campaigns, 
<br/>aimed at maximising the visibility of the new Dallas route.  These campaigns span both, digital and 
<br/>traditional  media,  specifically  targeting  key  demographics  in  the  Dallas  Fort  Worth  area.  By 
<br/>showcasing Fiji’s unique attractions and experiences, through social media campaigns, search engine 
<br/>marketing  and  targeted  email  initiatives,  we  aim  to  capture  the  interest  of  the  vast  majority  of 
<br/>potential visitors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the direct marketing and advertising activities, the Fiji Airways Sales Team has 
<br/>also  been  actively  promoting  the  new  Dallas  service  through  its  trade  partners,  including  travel 
<br/>agents,  travel  wholesalers,  like  Flight  Centre,  and  online  travel  agents  such  as  Expedia.  These 
<br/>partnerships not  only  promote attractive travel packages featuring the new direct flights, but  also 
<br/>includes  some  special  incentive  programmes  to  further  boost  the  promotion  of  Fiji  as  a  travel 
<br/>destination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to generate buzz and excitement and public relations around the new route, 
<br/>a series of press releases and media engagements are ongoing. These efforts will be complemented 
<br/>by collaborations with prominent travel influencers and bloggers, who will create organic content 
<br/>that highlight the allure of Fiji and the convenience of our new services.  Additionally, during the US 
<br/>Roadshow  in  September,  there  will  be  targeted  PR  events,  including  the  engagement  of  travel 
<br/>journalists, influencers, industry stakeholders, further elevating Fiji’s profile.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tourism Fiji is also organising promotional events and roadshows in key 
<br/>US cities, including Dallas, New York, Toronto and Los Angeles, with 24 Fijian tourism businesses. 
<br/>Our participation in major travel trade shows and expos, including Virtuoso Travel Week and IMEX 
<br/>America, will allow us to directly engage with industry stakeholders and promote the new route.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  the  announcement  of  the  new  Dallas  service,  Fiji  Airways  has  been  proactive  in 
<br/>promoting it across key markets. Special offers were launched in the US, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand 
<br/>and the Pacific, leveraging Fiji Airways paid owned channels, including the website, social media 
<br/>and paid search. Furthermore, last week a promotional fare was launched through digital marketing 
<br/>in New York to drive travel to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  our  consumer  marketing  initiatives  will  span  key  markets  across  Texas, 
<br/>California,  New  York  and  Florida.  This  include  outdoor  advertising,  strategic  TV  spots  and 
<br/>contractual sponsorship opportunities with major Dallas-based brands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of our commitment to provide a unique Fijian experience from the moment travellers 
<br/>step into Dallas, we are collaborating with the airport to establish a temporary Fiji-themed lounge. 
<br/>This pop-up Fiji lounge will offer a taste of our renowned Fijian hospitality, cultural experiences and 
<br/></span><span>detailed information about the new direct flights. Additionally, prominent signage within the airport 
<br/></span><span>will further promote the upcoming services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  these  marketing  strategies  are  not  only  designed  to  elevate 
<br/>Fiji’s visibility as a premier travel destination, but also to ensure the success of our new direct flights 
<br/>to Dallas. By broadening our global connectivity, we are not just bolstering tourism, we are opening 
<br/>new  doors  for  Fijian  businesses,  creating  opportunities  for  export  products  and  establishing  vital

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partnerships with American companies. This initiative is a testament to our unwavering commitment 
<br/>to diversifying and strengthening our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the 
<br/>update on the marketing initiatives in place for Destination Fiji, especially in support of Fiji Airways. 
<br/>In light of the fact that the Open Skies Agreement has been signed, and I understand is now actually 
<br/>active, that particular Agreement includes unrestricted capacity and frequency of services for both, 
<br/>passenger and cargo, and open route rights. The question is, does that mean, physically, we will see 
<br/>more metal coming out of the US into Fiji, or is it really specifically just restricted to a few airlines 
<br/>that have partnered up?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, open skies is open skies. It is between the American 
<br/>carriers  and  Fijian  carriers.    Any  American  airline  operator  can  fly  into  Fiji  under  this  open  sky 
<br/>agreement. So, Fijian companies can fly into any US port and any American airline can fly into Fiji 
<br/>from anywhere in the United States. But the reality of the economics is always there, because the 
<br/>route here is thin, so we do not expect any competition that would compromise the survival of our 
<br/>airline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has actually been there, Mr. Speaker Sir.  The recent ASA gave the Americans freedom to 
<br/>fly into Fiji and beyond, free freedom and all that. It was already there. So, what we did, by signing 
<br/>this, is for us to also enjoy those rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I understand where the honourable Member is coming from. We have looked at the risks 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we do not think it is a risk that can affect our airline. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.  -  Honourable  Members,  we  will  move  on  to  the  third  Oral  Question  for 
<br/>today.  I am allowing honourable Usamate, and I would like to inform this august Parliament, that 
<br/>this will be the last time I am allowing this to happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  someone’s  absence,  the  mover  has  always  been  allowed  for  someone  else  to  raise  the 
<br/>question on his behalf or if he is still away. But the Standing Order is very clear, and I have allowed 
<br/>this to run for some time, but now I am making it a rule that this will be the last time we are allowing 
<br/>this, and I am allowing honourable Usamate to ask Questions No. 27.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Local Government Elections 
<br/>(Question No. 207/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on when the Local Government Elections will be held? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  K.  NALUMISA.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question, but I was expecting honourable Bala to be present to ask me this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to refer to a media article dated 25</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2014. 
<br/></span><span>A similar question was asked to honourable Bala “as to when the Municipal Council Elections will 
<br/>be held?” This was his response, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That is my immediate task and that is what I am going to do now and after that 
<br/>within two or three weeks, I am going to visit all Municipalities to brief them on what 
<br/>is expected out of them and to see how we can run our Municipal Council elections.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1873 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  in  2015,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  responding  to  questions  raised  by  Opposition 
<br/>Parliamentarian, Prem Singh on when the Municipal Council Elections will be held, he said, “The 
<br/>Act has not been reviewed since 1972”, and he termed it as Hurricane Bebe Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though the honourable Member is not here, I must ask the honourable 
<br/>Member he is not here, what action did he take during his tenure as Minister for Local Government 
<br/>to hold this election?  Did our residents and ratepayers see any election during his term in office? Did 
<br/>he even make an attempt to initiate the process? A simple answer, Sir, is clear, no action, </span><span>khali baat</span><span>, 
<br/>and only empty promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, let it be known that the Coalition Government did not sit idly by, within just 
<br/>one month of coming into office in January 2023, we put our words into action. In 11 months, that is 
<br/>by November 2023, we have achieved what the previous Government did not accomplish in eight 
<br/>years. We reviewed and amended the Local Government Act 1972, aligning it with the current policy 
<br/>and legal frameworks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  was  a  significant  accomplishment  achieved,  not  only  by  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government alone but with the invaluable support of the Fijian Elections Office (FEO), Office of the 
<br/>Solicitor-General, all Municipal Councils and key partners, such as the International Foundation for 
<br/>Electoral  System  (IFES)  and  the  International  Institute  for  Democracy  and  Electoral  Assistance 
<br/>(International IDEA), extensive consultations were held, something that honourable Bala seemed to 
<br/>disregard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  Minister  for  Local  Government,  I  believe  the  timing  of  Local 
<br/>Government elections in Fiji is a matter of significant public interest that will be topic of discussion 
<br/>among  Fijians  and  political  leaders  for  several  years.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  in 
<br/>consultation with the FEO, plays a critical role in this process, as we are responsible for ensuring that 
<br/>all necessary conditions are met for the elections to proceed.  The date of elections is certainly the 
<br/>responsibility of the Electoral Commission, as the Ministry of Local Government has complied with 
<br/>all the requirements and processes towards a successful Local Government elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Local  Government  elections is  vital  for ensuring that communities have 
<br/>direct representation, and that Municipal Elections reflect the will of the people.  Local Governments 
<br/>operate  city  or  town  councils,  responsible  for  municipal  services,  local  infrastructure  and  the 
<br/>communities’ welfare.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it is important to note that the last Local Government Elections in Fiji was held in 
<br/>2005 and since then, Municipal Councils have been managed by appointed Special Administrators 
<br/>rather  than  elected  Councillors.  This  situation  arose  in  2006,  after  which  the  former  Government 
<br/>decided  to  abolish  the  elected  Councillors  and  replaced  them  with  Special  Administrators.  The 
<br/>rationale  provided  for  this  decision  included  concerns  about  corruption,  inefficiency  and 
<br/>mismanagement in the Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reinstating  the  Local  Government  elections  is  part  of  the  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government’s commitment for promoting democracy, accountability and community representation. 
<br/>I would like to reiterate that in 2023, the Ministry commenced the work on the preparation of Local 
<br/>Government elections. This includes an action plan formulated by the assigned working group, which 
<br/>has  planned  activities  and  timelines  for  the  same.    Since  then,  our  team  has  been  vocal  about 
<br/>Government’s plan to hold this elections, emphasising the importance of local democracy and the 
<br/>need to empower communities through elected representation.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, running a Local Government election in Fiji is also challenging due to its 
<br/>complex social political landscape, diverse ethnic makeup and historical tensions.  The lack of regular 
<br/>local  elections  since  2006  adds  to  the  complexity,  requiring  substantial  efforts  to  educate  and 
<br/>mobilise voters, while ensuring compliance with the electoral laws and fostering a political stability 
<br/>in a fragile democratic environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the major issues that the Ministry has noted is discrepancies in the 
<br/>Municipal wards. The lack of proper documentation for transfer of wards in few Municipal Councils 
<br/>has also caused delays in the finalisation of wards. This imbalance can lead to unequal representation 
<br/>and resource allocation, affecting the effectiveness of local governance.  Sir, for the first time, the 
<br/>new policy guiding the representation in councils is where each resident’s vote within a Municipality 
<br/>carries the same weight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  commend  our key  agencies  -  IFES,  International  IDEA, 
<br/>Commonwealth  Local  Government  Forum  and  New  Zealand  Local  Government,  and  the 
<br/>Government Ministries for their assistance in the preparation of the Local Government Election thus 
<br/>far.  With the assistance provided by our key agencies, the Ministry has completed major processes, 
<br/>such  as  conducting  public  consultations,  revision  of  the  archaic  provisions  relating  to  Local 
<br/>Government  elections  in  the  Local  Government  Act  1972,  awareness  raising  concerns  and 
<br/>finalisation of Municipal wards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, the Ministry in the consultation with all Municipal Councils, 
<br/>is in the final stage of ironing out the logistical details for the upcoming elections. Our focus now is 
<br/>on establishing policies and procedures for the allocation of Councillors per Municipal ward. This is 
<br/>to ensure that the electoral process is transparent and fair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once  the  Ministry  finalises  all  the  technical  requirements,  the  next  phase  will  involve 
<br/>collaboration with the FEO and the Electoral Commission for the remaining process. In this case, we 
<br/>want to make sure that accurate information and proper processes are followed before handing over 
<br/>to the FEO.  Therefore, the Ministry is working very closely with the FEO with objective to have the 
<br/>elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the status  of local  elections reflects  Fiji’s Government’s commitment to 
<br/>restoring  local  democracy,  ensuring  that  communities  have  a  voice  in  their  own  governance. 
<br/>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, work is underway to allow villages within municipal boundaries and, 
<br/>at least, 2 kilometres outside of the boundaries, to be part of the elections. These are villages with 
<br/>landowners  of  towns  and  cities;  hence,  they  have  the  right  to  participate  in  the  process  to  elect 
<br/>councillors. These villages will be included through section 125 of the Local Government Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as per section 125 of the Local Government Act 1972, the inclusion of the 
<br/>iTaukei villages will require the approval of the iTaukei Affairs Board.  It is worth noting that the 
<br/>Board has been consulted and the Ministry is awaiting the confirmation of the above. In addition. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Solicitor-General has drafted appropriate regulations which is, 
<br/>again,  pending  at  the  iTaukei  Affairs  Board  for  comments  and  suggestions.  We  endeavour  to 
<br/>conclude this process as soon as practicably possible, to enable a smooth transition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I want to underscore that merely polling and elections 
<br/>are not enough, we must ensure that the foundation upon which the new Councils we appoint is robust 
<br/>and resilient. To this end, we have been diligently working to establish a comprehensive Code of 
<br/>Conduct and other essential guidelines through new regulations.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>ensuring that they align with our commitment to good governance.  With the valuable support of the 
<br/>New Zealand Local Government, we are putting in place new policies, rules and procedures that will 
<br/>be  firmly  in  place  by  the  time  the  new  councillors  take  office.  These  measures  are  designed  to 
<br/>guarantee that the Councils operate systematically and professionally with unwavering accountability 
<br/>and transparency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  is  not  just  preparing  for  elections,  they  are 
<br/>building a solid foundation for the future of local governance in Fiji. While there are challenges to 
<br/>overcome, the Government is making progress in its preparation, and there is clear intention to hold 
<br/>the elections in the financial year 2024-2025. The day of the election will be confirmed, following 
<br/>consultations with the FEO and the Electoral Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude 
<br/>with a call for continued support from all the political leaders, CSOs and the public, to ensure that 
<br/>the  Local  Government  elections  are  conducted  successfully,  which  will  contribute  to  the 
<br/>strengthening of democracy in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  17</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2023,  as  reported  by  Fiji 
<br/>Broadcasting  Corporation  (FBC),  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  made  some  comments 
<br/>where Fijians will be able to vote in Municipal Council elections in August 2024. The question is 
<br/>very clear, when? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the honourable Minister to provide definitive timeline as to 
<br/>when will the elections be held for the Municipal Councils? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already stated that it will be held in the 
<br/>next financial year. The response by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was that the possible 
<br/>timeline for it, but I want to assure the honourable Members as well as the members of the public 
<br/>that Local Government elections will be held.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question was already asked by honourable Ketan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- This question has triggered a lot of interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a statement and a question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- It is a very serious statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I formally 
<br/>write to the Ministers if issues are raised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a complaint about a Special 
<br/>Administrator, going into the shops and saying, “I am the King of this Town!” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I will be formally writing it to the honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- These kinds of people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should not be part of our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administration. It is a serious matter, take it in a serious way!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister is very effective, unlike others in responding to 
<br/>issues.  They have talked about the promises of Local Government election, but they are running on

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is up to you, honourable Minister for Local Government, to answer the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I need to respond to the comment made 
<br/>by  the  honourable  Member  regarding  one  of  the  comments  made  by  one  of  the  Special 
<br/>Administrators.  I am not really sure of the Special Administrator that he is referring to, but, all I can 
<br/>say to the members of public, whatever issues that have been raised by them regarding any of our 
<br/>Special Administrators, and even raised by some political parties, I have managed to resolve some 
<br/>of those issues.  That is something that I have done. so, if it was brought to my office, I would have 
<br/>responded to that question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based  on  the  funding,  that  is  something  that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is also going to 
<br/>consider before we actually hold the Municipal Election. Thank you.

<div><span>Functions and Composition - Fiji’s Human Rights Taskforce 
<br/>(Question No. 208/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  update  Parliament  on  the  functions  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>composition of the proposed Fiji’s Human Rights Task Force? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for i-Taukei 
<br/>Affairs  for  his  question.  As  of  2019,  Fiji  is  a  party  to  the  nine  core  International  Human  Rights 
<br/>Treaties  of the United Nations, as well as several  optional  protocols  that are part  of the Treaties. 
<br/>These include the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Convention on the Rights of People with Disability; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Convention  Against  Torture  and  other  Cruel,  Inhumane  or  Degrading  Treatment  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Punishment; and 
<br/>International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  ratifying  these  Instruments,  Fiji  has  assumed  responsibility  under 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>international law for implementing the obligations under the respective Treaties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every Treaty, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires Fiji to report periodically to each of the Treaty bodies 
<br/></span><span>that are part of the Conventions, and then participate in a public examination by the Treaty bodies 
<br/>which are typically situated in Geneva. The Treaty body then makes recommendations which, as a 
<br/>State’s party, Fiji must consider implementing, and then subsequently provide progress reports to 
<br/>those bodies on the state of those implementations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to Treaty obligations, Fiji as a States party and a member of the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1877 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United Nations, participates also in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) conducted by the Human 
<br/>Rights  Council  which,  again,  is  situated  in  Geneva.  This  is  a  Member  State  driven  peer-review 
<br/>process  under  which  every  country’s  human  rights  record  is  reviewed,  every  four  or  five  years.  
<br/>Recommendations received during the UPR process are either formally accepted or rejected by the 
<br/>State being reviewed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji completed its third UPR Review in November 2019, where the report 
<br/>showcased how the majority of the recommendations from the second cycle were implemented.  At 
<br/>the conclusion of the third UPR, Fiji had received a total of 242 recommendations made by 97 States 
<br/>or Countries that are part of the Human Rights Council.  Of those 200 plus recommendations, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, Fiji accepted 207 recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of the reviews and the recommendations, Fiji has reporting obligations which are 
<br/>outdated.  For  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reports  to  the  Committee  on  the  Elimination  of  Racial 
<br/>Discrimination  were  required  to  be  submitted  by  January  or  February  2016,  that  has  not  been 
<br/>reported.  The initial report by Fiji to the Committee Against Torture was required to be submitted 
<br/>by April 2017, that is outdated. Fiji’s initial reports to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
<br/>Disabilities was due in July 2019, again, we are in arrears. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just as a further 
<br/>example,  Fiji’s  sixth  report  to  the  Committee  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination 
<br/>Against Women (CEDAW), was due in March 2022, and we have not complied with our reporting 
<br/>obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Those delays, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are a matter of concern and they do highlight, at the national 
<br/>level,  the  need  for  a  robust  mechanism  to  ensure  that  we,  as  a  State  party  to  these  important 
<br/>international Instruments and Treaties, that we report on a timely and effective basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, of those outdated reports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations has advocated that 
<br/>we establish a National Mechanism for the Implementation, Reporting and Follow-up of the Treaties, 
<br/>in short, known as NMIRF. The mechanism envisioned will be a permanent Government structure, 
<br/>tasked with inter-agency or inter-ministerial coordination and engagement with international human 
<br/>rights mechanisms, to ensure that we, as a country, are able to comply with our reporting obligations 
<br/>and to not experience further delays.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following Cabinet's approval last month, the Fiji Human Rights Taskforce 
<br/>was launched on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> August this year.  The purpose of the Taskforce and its functions will 
<br/>include, for example, engaging and liaising with international human rights mechanisms, including 
<br/>the  UN  Human  Rights  Treaty  Body,  the  Universal  Periodic  Review  process  and  the  Special 
<br/>Procedures  of  the  Human  Rights  Council.  Organising  and  coordinating  the  preparation  of  Fiji’s 
<br/>National reports to these international human rights mechanisms, including initial reports, periodic 
<br/>reports,  the  common  core  document,  our  mid-term  reports  and  follow  ups,  responding  to 
<br/>communications and decisions, country visits by special rapporteurs, follow up questions, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the effectiveness of the Taskforce, it will comprise inter-agency 
<br/>representatives from different Government Ministries and agencies, including the Fiji Police force, 
<br/>the Corrections Service, the Fiji Military Forces, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics, et cetera. This wide 
<br/></span><span>composition will enable comprehensive and coordinated action on a range of human rights issues 
<br/></span><span>across all sectors of Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The establishment of Fiji’s Human Rights Taskforce will demonstrate Fiji’s commitment to 
<br/>implementing the 14 Universal Periodic Review recommendations that Fiji accepted in 2019.  This 
<br/>is a significant milestone in our journey towards a more transparent, accountable and rights respecting 
<br/>society.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  answer  the  question,  and  I  thank  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Assistant Minister for i-Taukei Affairs, for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The honourable Attorney-General,  we understand what the Taskforce 
<br/>has been set up for, basically, making sure that we are compliant with what we have signed in the 
<br/>previous years. I also just wanted to know whether the Taskforce will be engaging in providing more 
<br/>policy direction  and different  recommendations,  in  terms  of what  can be  bettered in terms  of the 
<br/>foundation that we already have on the human rights platform? Will we be looking at some bold new 
<br/>policies and recommendations that may come out of this particular Taskforce that has been set up? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G.E. LEUNG.- I thank the honourable Koya for his question.  I would simply say this, 
<br/>honourable Member, by way of response, the inter-agency inter-ministerial Taskforce will provide a 
<br/>vehicle for robust discussions between public officials in those respective agencies to engage in a 
<br/>critical analysis of Fiji’s obligations under those Treaties, and to provide recommendations to the 
<br/>Taskforce on how Fiji would be able to implement more effectively, its international human rights 
<br/>obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea and we 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Level Of Expansion - Outsource Industry 
<br/>(Question No. 209/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, inform Parliament on what 
<br/>level of expansion we have had in the outsource industry in the last 24 months and has 
<br/>the wage rise affected this expansion?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually a very good question, as it 
<br/>gives me an opportunity to talk a bit about an industry that has great potential for our country. I know 
<br/>I have talked about billion-dollar industries too much in this august Parliament, but this particular 
<br/>one  is  another  real  possibility.  Speaking  to  the  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  (RBF)  just 
<br/>recently, he advised that the foreign exchange earnings from outsourcing industry is around $200 
<br/>million, and about 8,000 employees, give or take, a couple of thousand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  trajectory,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  suspect  that  in  10  years,  it  should  be  half  a 
<br/>billion-dollar industry, and beyond that, the sky is the limit. It contributes to economic diversification 
<br/>in our country and is a great way for our young people to seek employment, particularly for those 
<br/>who, perhaps, have no visibility on a career path and are just wondering about what they would like 
<br/>to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is an excellent opportunity because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the type of training that these young 
<br/>men and women get, is basically world class training for work exposure because they are working 
<br/>for offshore companies and so the standards, the expectations,  the deadline setting, all these very 
<br/>important  items  when  it  comes  to  permanent  employment,  Sir,  our  young  children  are  actually 
<br/>working at an international level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are sitting in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but for all intents and purposes, they are offshore 
<br/>working  on behalf of very big  organisations. Just  as an aside, Sir, just recently, one of the larger 
<br/>outsourcing  companies  in  Fiji  actually  started  providing  services  to  the  UK  Hertz  in  the  United 
<br/>Kingdom, this is the car rental company. From that, they are now talking about a wider relationship, 
<br/>which  may  include  the  global  Hertz  brand.  This  is  the  type  of  opportunity  that  is  in  front  of  our 
<br/>country, and compliments to the previous Government for kick starting it. I was still in the private 
<br/>sector  then  and  tried  to  do  my  bit,  and  we  are  just  continuing  the  work.  This  industry  has  great 
<br/>potential and great benefits for our young men and women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past 24 months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s outsourcing industry has undergone another 
<br/>transformation. I would like to report that despite the minimum wage rate, the industry still remains 
<br/>competitive and resilient and has emerged as one of the critical sectors when it comes to our national 
<br/>economic development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last two years since August, there has been a record of about eight companies that have 
<br/></span><span>set up business outsource operations in Fiji, and that number continues to grow. Things that work in 
<br/>the industry’s favour is the fact that we are neutral speaking, we have a very good education and 
<br/>literacy level, proximity to some of the key economies of Australia, New Zealand and the US, even 
<br/>Europe and the UK are starting to consider Fiji as a real option. Of course there is a cultural similarity, 
<br/>everyone knows that when an Australian or New Zealander calls and they realise they are talking to 
<br/>someone from Fiji, it suddenly turns into a rugby conversation. These are the types of cultural  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>similarities that have created great benefits for the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we are seeing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is one particular outsourcing company 
<br/>which is a large operator, starting to consider operations outside the normal city location. Right now, 
<br/>they are operating in Drasa Vitogo, just outside Lautoka, they are operating in Navua, and these are 
<br/>a couple of a hundred young men and women, taking the work closer to the rural or their places of 
<br/>dwelling. There is potential, Sir, according to that company, to even move to Labasa, potentially, and 
<br/>may be Savusavu, and with the cable being installed from Labasa down to Savusavu by Telecom, 
<br/>that actually has a real opportunity as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, the knowledge process outsourcing had been asked here in this 
<br/>Parliament on occasions and that is also developing and evolving. We have one company, Sir, in Fiji 
<br/>that has already has 12 local staff being Artificial Intelligence in Fiji and that just crept up in the last 
<br/>12 months.  So, the potential, Sir, for this industry is very exciting and is very promising.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a government, we will continue to support this industry as best we can, to ensure that we 
<br/>realise some of the real benefits that are in this industry. And just to give you an example, Sir, </span><span>Google</span><span>, 
<br/>who  we  are  developing  a  partnership  with,  their  Philippines  Call  Centre  is  30,000  strong.  
<br/>Wonderfully, we can get, at least, 5,000 of that at some stage in the future, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the specific questions raised around wage rates, the outsourcing starting salary 
<br/>has been always above the basic minimum wage rate. According to my calculation, it is about 56 
<br/>percent more, and so in terms of the minimum wage rate adjustments, it does not quite play because 
<br/>it is already above the minimum wage.  However, that does not mean we should be complacent. We 
<br/>are competing with some very aggressive destinations.  This outsourcing industry has started to move 
<br/>into Latvia and some of these other European countries, into South-East Asia, so we just have to 
<br/>watch that we do not get too far ahead of ourselves in that regard.  However, certainly, Sir, when you 
<br/>look  at  the  closer  economies  of  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  the  United  States,  we  remain  quite 
<br/>competitive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  broader  issues,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  guess,  some  of  the  challenges  that  the 
<br/>industry  is  currently  facing  is  to  do  with  employment.  Currently,  according  to  the  outsourcing 
<br/>industry that is struggling to find workers which is a bit saddening, Sir, we are trying to work together 
<br/>with them to try and ensure that there is a good pipeline of workers coming through to allow the 
<br/>industry to continue to grow.  I hope, over the next 12 months, that is certainly going to be a focus 
<br/>for the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, the need to have data protection laws, that is already underway, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in terms of consultation with the donor partners.  We do have the EU stepping up to actually help 
<br/>us with that regard, so that will create more market readiness, if you like, to take on more larger 
<br/>operations, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, in terms of Artificial Intelligence, how does it look in the next few years against 
<br/>the  current  BPO  operations?    All  I  can  say  is  that,  obviously,  there  will  be  a  transition,  but  it 
<br/>demonstrates if you already have capability, if you already have 12 young men and women in our 
<br/></span><span>country, in the AI space, that augurs well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, certainly out of this industry, we are talking about  other things like, 
<br/>perhaps, Fiji being a cyber security hub, not only of the Pacific, but even at the global hub.  So, these 
<br/>are some of the opportunities, Sir, that in this very exciting space, it is an excellent opportunity for 
<br/>our young people, and we are looking forward to work with Government and also the other side in 
<br/>continuing to support this industry which will do wonderful things for Fiji.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1881 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a follow-up question. We had earlier on, just 
<br/>post-COVID, we found out that there was a tremendous amount of interest from Europe when Fiji 
<br/>actually opened up.  As you know, post-COVID, we actually went to Portugal to do all these things. 
<br/>It is great to see what is actually happening, we have set a platform and it is good to see the Ministry 
<br/>actually ensuring that the numbers may catch up to about10,000 people a year, which was looked at 
<br/>earlier on with a lot of support from our development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question that came out  of the fact  that there was a lot of risk diversification that was 
<br/>happening in this particular area because they found that out during the COVID-19.  One of the tools 
<br/>that we had, as you have rightfully said, is that we speak neutral English, and we have highly educated 
<br/>young workforce.  Will you also be looking at talking to the Ministry of Education where the schools 
<br/>can start teaching in their curriculum, languages like French and Spanish, et cetera, because that will 
<br/>also take us to another level? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The broader discussion around just education generally in 
<br/>outsourcing is something that we have been trying to push, as the honourable Minister knows, even 
<br/>from his time, in trying to develop courses that are focussed on BPO-type operations.  The discussion 
<br/>on languages has come up as well with some of the universities, so we are trying to discuss that as 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently,  I  think  the  Chinese  language  was  going  to  be  introduced  through  the  education 
<br/>system, so we are headed in that direction.  It may require some more cohesive effort in a not-too-
<br/>distant future but, certainly, we are fortunate that USP and FNU have a ready resource of French 
<br/>speaking undergraduates and other languages as well. So, the BPOs tend to use those for now but I 
<br/>suspect as we continue to grow, there may well be a need to look at the question of language a lot 
<br/>more closer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his elaboration 
<br/>and it is great to see the development and growth of this sector.  It has been a very useful sector in 
<br/>mopping up our graduates, the unemployed, or those who have not completed their degrees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that has occurred to me is that, at the beginning, a lot of the work has been 
<br/>pitting at the lower level - answering complaints, transferring complaints, and I am glad to see there 
<br/>has been some focus on cyber security which should be at a level a bit higher. I think we need to look 
<br/>at areas of writing code, instead of just doing basic accounting sort of thing, queries going into audits, 
<br/>et cetera.  In terms of the movement towards higher value adding jobs in the BPO sector, is there a 
<br/>concerted effort or a policy to try to generate that rather than just the BPO jobs at the lower level? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, honourable Usamate, for your very pertinent 
<br/>question.  Certainly, I mentioned briefly about Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) sector.  In 
<br/>terms of the posture of the Outsource Fiji organisation, certainly Government is to try and attract 
<br/>KPO type of operations into the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, you probably would not realise this, but a certain accounting firm in Fiji is already 
<br/>doing  quite  a  substantial  amount  of  KPO  work.    Apart  from  their  normal  chartered  accounting 
<br/></span><span>operations, they have a back office that is doing a lot of the technical work around accounts receivable 
<br/></span><span>- that kind of accounting work, including AI.  So, it is a growth area and as we know, there is about 
<br/>four international firms in Fiji.  Just imagine, one of them has already had 200 persons strong in Nadi 
<br/>and Suva.  Potentially, if the other accounting firms starts moving, we will have another 800 people 
<br/>gainfully employed in professional areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As correctly pointed out by honourable Usamate, the KPO industry, obviously, pays a lot

<div><span>more. Just to give you some feel, a basic cyber security analyst will get paid up to US$40,000 to 
<br/>US$50,000 in the United States.  It probably would not get paid but you can imagine what that means 
<br/>in terms of the potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The discussion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, around, how do we raise our  wages in Fiji  and get  to  a 
<br/>higher wage level, I know the hotel industry is already at around about $8 an hour and moving fast, 
<br/>but certainly the BPO sector and the ICT industry can really transition a lot of our young people to 
<br/>get into these higher paying roles and very exportable roles. My message always to the young people 
<br/>is, start doing IT jobs or study in IT, because there is a great potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to honourable Usamate’s question, yes, it is an area of interest, and we are 
<br/>working together with certain organisations that do have KPO content in their work. We will certainly 
<br/>try and ensure that with </span><span>Google</span><span> coming on board, with </span><span>Starlink</span><span> coming on board and communication 
<br/>becoming  more  accessible,  that  we  leverage  a  lot  of  these  and  turn  them  into  real  genuine 
<br/>opportunities.

<div><span>Sub-Recipient Agreement – Global Fund Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 210/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament 
<br/>on  the  Sub-Recipient  Agreement  between  the  Ministry  and  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Development  Programme  for  a  Global  Fund  Programme  to  fight  Acquired  Immune 
<br/>Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Tuberculosis and Malaria in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  for  his  question.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Sub-Recipient 
<br/>Agreement (SRA) between the Ministry and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
<br/>for a Global Fund Programme to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Tuberculosis 
<br/>(TB) and Malaria in Fiji has already been endorsed by Cabinet, and the Ministry is awaiting to sign 
<br/>the SRA with UNDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Global  Fund  contribution  to  UNDP  is  at  FJ$489,165,  which  will  be 
<br/>under the SRA, to carry out activities stated in their workplan for a period of three years from 2024 
<br/>to 2026.  In accordance with the Grant Agreement, UNDP is the principal recipient, that may provide 
<br/>funding to other entities to carry out activities, contemplated under the project as sub-recipients. In 
<br/>this case, the Ministry is referred to as sub-recipient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the workplan, the project intends to combat and control the increasing number of 
<br/>HIV  and  TB  cases  in  Fiji  through  a  design  workplan  that  looks  after  the  activities  such  as,  HIV 
<br/>Combination  Prevention  Programme,  stigma  and  discrimination,  online  courses  for  healthcare 
<br/>workers, capacity building for healthcare workers and transgender health, to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A grant award to carry out the project was initially US$460,000 plus, equivalent to more than 
<br/></span><span>a million Fiji dollars.  However, the Ministry had further consulted the World Health Organization 
<br/></span><span>(WHO) and together, they have revised the workplan by moving some of the activities to WHO to 
<br/>facilitate, as they have their expertise to undertake those activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, understanding the great situation of HIV and TB in Fiji, this funding has 
<br/>come at a much-needed time, to contribute to the development and strengthening of the public health 
<br/>and clinical response.  The Global Fund Grant workplan has been developed by a technical working

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  thank   the  UNDP  for  assisting  the 
<br/>Government to help with the procurement of these drugs.  My question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>does the Ministry have the capacity to combat this problem of HIV/AIDS, and we know that this $5.2 
<br/>million is only for three years, what preventive measures are in place to control the rise in HIV?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  thank  honourable 
<br/>Ravunawa for his supplementary question.  In terms of the capacity, we will always need help in that 
<br/>area in terms of human resources and other resources that need to be made available to the Ministry 
<br/>to combat HIV/AIDS.  Basically, we need the support not only from the whole of Government, whole 
<br/>of Parliament, but also throughout the nation.  As I have mentioned, this is a fight not only for the 
<br/>Ministry of Health, but for the nation as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  your  question  on  what  the  Ministry  is  doing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of 
<br/>budgetary  allocation,  yes,  there  is  budgetary  allocation,  and  we  are  grateful,  again,  to  our 
<br/>development partners, both multilateral and bilateral, for stepping in and assisting us in this space. 
<br/>This year, when I went to the World Health Assembly in Geneva, I was very fortunate to attend the 
<br/>handing  over  ceremony  between  DFAT  and  WHO,  and  that  money  is  specifically  to  combat 
<br/>HIV/AIDS here in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Again, we thank theGovernment for progressing these issues and also thank our development 
<br/>partners  for  coming  onboard  and  assisting  the  Ministry  in  its  time  of  need,  especially  combating 
<br/>HIV/AIDS.  As  I  have  mentioned,  the  capacity,  yes,  we  have  some  capacity  but  we  will  need  to 
<br/>improve and refocus our attempt on improving the capacity within the Ministry to tackle HIV much 
<br/>better. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<div><span>Progress of Termite Control Assistance Grant 
<br/>(Question No. 211/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the progress of the 
<br/>Termite  Control  Assistance  Grant  for  dwelling  and  structures  affected  by  the  Asian 
<br/>Subterranean Termites in both, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years there has been an increasing 
<br/></span><span>spread of the Asian Subterranean Termites (AST) in the Western Division, which resulted in a surge 
<br/>in notification and infrastructural damages received by the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF). So, 
<br/>given the significant increase in the spread of termites in the Western Division, the Government, for 
<br/>the first time, specifically in the 2023-2024 Budget allocated a sum of $3 million for the Termite 
<br/>Control Assistance Programme.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Under Head 50, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to assist affected households with relief packages and in 
<br/>addition to continue with the efforts to minimise the spread of AST, a sum of $2 million is provided 
<br/>in the 2024-2025 financial year programme.  As part of the implementation mechanism, the Termite 
<br/>Taskforce  was  established  to  help  foster  Government’s  effort  in  assisting  households  affected  by 
<br/>AST infestation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Taskforce, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is co-chaired by the honourable Assistant Minister in the 
<br/>Office of the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, 
<br/>with members comprising of staff from BAF, Lautoka City Council and Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Taskforce chose to use the first year to pilot the programme to evaluate the best approach 
<br/>to help control and eradicate AST in Fiji. The Termite Control Assistance Programme considered the 
<br/>Lautoka area under the pilot programme. The main activities of the Taskforce include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enhanced collaboration between BAF, Lautoka City Council and Ministry of Finance to 
<br/>improve termite operations; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>procurement  of  termite  baiting  services  and  establishment  of  the  Termite  Subsidy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme; and 
<br/>engagement of media organisation for awareness programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to provide relief to the people whose homes have suffered extensive damages due to 
<br/>termite  infestation,  Government  announced  a  Termite  Subsidy  Programme,  mainly  for  people  in 
<br/>Lautoka,  Ba,  Nadi  and  Rakiraki.  The  Termite  Subsidy  Programme  was  a  subsidy  of  $5,000  is 
<br/>provided for households with  combined household  income of less than $30,000 and a subsidy of 
<br/>$2,000  is  provided  for  households  with  combined  income  between  $30,000  and  $50,000.    The 
<br/>subsidy, Sir, intends to help residents repair their homes and ensure that they are structurally sound 
<br/>for people to live in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to give you some details, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,327 applications were received by 
<br/>the  Lautoka  City  Council,  the  staff  stationed  at  Commissioner  Western’s  Office  of  1,327 
<br/>applications,  448  applications  have  been  verified  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of  the 
<br/>programme and have been paid $5,000 and $2,000 subsidy with the total cost of $2.2 million.  Those 
<br/>below $30,000, the number of successful applicants were 439, that amounted to $2.195 million, and 
<br/>those between $30,000 to $50,000, only nine were successful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 327 applications have been verified and will be paid in the coming 
<br/>months,  while  160  applications  are  pending  verification.  Sir,  392  applications  await  information 
<br/>clarification, and 54 applicants were unsuccessful. So, in summary: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Approved and paid for – 148; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Verified to be paid in September – 327; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Pending verification – 160; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Pending information from applicant – 338; and 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Unsuccessful applicants – 54. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The unsuccessful applicants, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were due to:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1885 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, BAF and Lautoka City Council provided administrative support and verified all claims 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of AST and income category before payments are made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we just do not stop by providing the subsidy, I think in the long term, the 
<br/>idea is to eradicate AST and those household that have the subsidy will simultaneously receive the 
<br/>termite baiting system because I think that is the most effective way to deal with it. So, the termite 
<br/>baiting system is used to control termite infestation by deploying what they call “tasty baits” above 
<br/>or below ground to attract termite before they reach a home or business. The objective of the initiative 
<br/>is to ensure that baits are readily available.  The public and nest termite baiting services is promoted 
<br/>in places like Lautoka for properties that have been severely impacted by AST.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to help approximately 1,000 households, manage 
<br/>the spread of AST and, of course, meet the required criteria of the programme. The tender for the 
<br/>baiting  services  has  closed,  and  a  service  provider  has  been  selected  and  we  are  currently  in  the 
<br/>contract signing stages. We expect the baiting services to commence next month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, BAF has been strengthened. We have provided additional 12 officers, one 
<br/>vehicle  for  compliance,  and  to  protect  the  spread  of  AST,  a  grant  is  also  provided  for  the 
<br/>establishment of BAF Officers in Nadi, Ba and Nakasi, and we are also looking at Labasa, so the 
<br/>Taskforce is already on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to take this opportunity to thank both, the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister and the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, for their leadership 
<br/>and the ability, for the first time, to get a government programme to be able to address these issues.  
<br/>It is now also affecting houses in Nakasi, it has gone to Labasa, and it is causing significant problems 
<br/>for  low-income  households  and  the  houses  get  damaged  very  quickly.  This  is  the  Government’s 
<br/>programme in dealing with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Lautoka is the worst affected by termites. This is not a 
<br/>question but just a comment. Looking at the number of people who have been assisted, it is only 448, 
<br/>but there are many who have been affected. My suggestion is that proper awareness should be carried 
<br/>out so that people, especially living in the remote and rural areas, come to know or are made aware 
<br/>how to apply and what are the requirements.  That is my request. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have three points and one question to this. I thank 
<br/>the Government  for this initiative,  yet  there can always  be amendments.  One thing I experienced 
<br/>when building my farm, I bought treated pine, but at the end of the day, the termites had infested. 
<br/>Basically, I was sold untreated timber at a price of treated timber. It is something the Government 
<br/>can really look into, because it is how our Fijians are being cheated upon, and some businesses are 
<br/>making money in this way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government can also look into this.  When a recipient goes, for example, 
<br/>to a hardware store and say, your final quote is $4,900. The person, obviously, would say, “Can you 
<br/>reduce the price?”  What happens is, receiving the termite assistance and then going to the hardware 
<br/>store  and  purchasing  untreated  timber,  again,  and  building  your  house,  you  are,  sort  of,  setting 
<br/></span><span>yourself  up  for  another  infestation.  Can  the  Government  monitor  this  assistance  so  that  we  have 
<br/></span><span>permanent solutions on how we are helping households with our funds, and it is not gone to waste? 
<br/>One more thing, is there a biological solution to this matter? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first  point, as I have said,  one of the 
<br/>programmes  in  the  scheme  of  things  is  the  engagement  of  media  organisations  for  awareness 
<br/>programmes. Just to address honourable Sharma’s comment, I agree with him. I think a lot of  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cheating goes on in terms of treated versus untreated timber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the long run, as I have said, the big effort in this programme, and this is what the Taskforce 
<br/>that  honourable  Tubuna  and  honourable  Kiran  have  been  emphasising  with  BAF,  is  that  the 
<br/>biological approach based on baiting approach that have been tried in Australia and in other countries, 
<br/>has worked. So, what we intend to do is scale up these programmes.  Probably, by the time we come 
<br/>for the next budget and there are new areas that are opening up in Nakasi and Labasa, it could become 
<br/>a  big  national  problem  affecting  a  lot  of  people’s  houses  because  even  in  concrete  houses,  these 
<br/>termites eat away all the timber and it creates a mess in those houses. Yes, I think those are good 
<br/>points to take into account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Finance for his detailed explanation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to add on by sharing my experience with the kind of timber that is sold in our 
<br/>hardware stores. There are certain requirements by the Ministry of Forestry as to how they can fill 
<br/>up a sheet as certain information needs to be there when it goes to the hardware stores. But during 
<br/>my investigation when I was with Consumer Council of Fiji, we found that most of these hardware 
<br/>stores do not care. They just got the timber, they label it as treated and they will sell it at a higher 
<br/>price, as has been highlighted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the point that I want to raise here is, no matter how much bating we are going to do, no 
<br/>matter how much money we are going to spend, if you do not treat or really seriously take the issue 
<br/>of treating the timber right, we will have that problem. And I can tell you one thing, it is not just the 
<br/>hardware companies who would or rather like the system to be as loose as it is, but also the timber 
<br/>treatment companies. I recall that we had so many meetings with the Ministry of Forestry. We did 
<br/>awareness raising, but at the end of the day, we realised that it is really the consumer who has been 
<br/>cheated, because they cannot identify what is treated and what is not treated. So, I just wanted to alert 
<br/>the Taskforce that perhaps, that is where we need to dive deeper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, a purchaser should know what he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is buying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are issues that are real. 
<br/>I experienced that myself some years back. You buy treated timber, it is not treated, and then after 
<br/>two or three years, it gets bad. So, maybe, we need to look at that more carefully. So, I agree with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Lautoka was the first area to be infested by termites and 
<br/>then  starts  spreading  elsewhere.    It  has  gone  to  Vanua  Levu  and  areas  such  as  Vunivau  and 
<br/>Valebasoga are suffering. So, what the Government can do is, the lessons learnt from Lautoka can 
<br/>be quickly implemented there so that the spread of termites can be controlled so the damage is lesser. 
<br/>So, I request  the Government to  quickly look  at  these areas where the spread is  little and can be 
<br/>controlled, and quickly implement the lessons learnt from Lautoka into those areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other question is, I see that the programme budget has reduced from $3 million to $2 
<br/></span><span>million. Could the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance explain why it has 
<br/></span><span>been reduced? Is the uptake slow or we are unable to disperse the funds? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There are two reasons,  we looked at the usage in the previous 
<br/>budget and as I have said, the Taskforce is still getting a handle on what is happening  -  how the 
<br/>baiting system is going to work and also identifying the people who are actually affected and those 
<br/>in that income categories. So, when we look at subsidies, we look at those who need it most.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other part of the programme, which is baiting, as I have said, that requires a little more 
<br/>work and I think the Taskforce is on it. Obviously, the lessons learnt in Lautoka would be used in 
<br/>other areas, particularly in Labasa.  The Taskforce is already working on the Labasa issues, so if there 
<br/>is additional funding that is needed as a result of what the Taskforce will do, then we have options 
<br/>of deployment and virement, as we had discussed yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, once again, thank the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance for his explanation. I was going to talk about the issue of baiting, 
<br/>I am not too clear now whether that baiting is happening yet or not because my suggestion was going 
<br/>to be, in areas like Nakasi and Labasa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I declare my interest as I live in Nakasi. I realise the funding for the last year was not fully 
<br/>utilised. So, if that money can be directed to baiting as a preventative measure in these areas where 
<br/>it is about to explode in Nakasi for instances and Labasa, would that be one of the plans you need to 
<br/>do as preventative measure up front? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-I think the Taskforce is looking at that.  You are right, we need 
<br/>to look at all the areas to try and stop the spread. The focus is on baiting, otherwise we can provide 
<br/>subsidies.  People will go and buy timber, and they might not get the right timber, and you end up 
<br/>with this vicious cycle that will continue. So, we are trying to make sure that we break that, and the 
<br/>best way to do that is to use the baiting system that works in other countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. It takes care of that.  It is how you bait it, honourable Kiran and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Tubuna, to come to attend to your problem there, otherwise it will infest on its own.

<div><span>Blue Economy Cooperation and Sustainable Development 
<br/>(Question No. 212/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Co-operatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  Fiji  and  the  People’s 
<br/>Republic of China with respect to Deepening Blue Economy Cooperation and Sustainable 
<br/>Development? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Assistant Minister for 
<br/>Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management for the question. In keeping with the good 
<br/>work done by the previous Government, we will continue to deepen relationships across the board 
<br/>with our economic partners, and it is fair to say that China is actually one of those partners.  So, the 
<br/>question was about an update on the MOU between Fiji and China concerning the Blue Economy 
<br/>Cooperation and Sustainable Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this month, the honourable Prime Minister, on his official visit to 
<br/>China, signed an MOU with the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China. The MOU 
<br/></span><span>outlines a framework  for cooperation aimed at fostering  sustainable and inclusive blue  economy, 
<br/></span><span>aligning with our national objectives and the broader Pacific regional strategies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to understand that the MOU does not place any legal obligations on the parties. 
<br/>However,  it  creates  areas  for  renewed  and  deepened  strengthening  of  relationships.  Key  areas  of 
<br/>focus in fostering new economic drivers within the blue economy includes areas in environmental 
<br/>best practices, bilateral investment cooperation, good business practices and, of course, international

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>environment commitment support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  MOU  is  very  beneficial  for  Fiji  for  several  reasons,  particularly  in 
<br/>promoting and facilitating sustainable investment in the country. It directly supports Fiji’s national 
<br/>plans for sustainable economic growth and environmental conservation, particularly, those related to 
<br/>the blue economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all recall the initial Blue Town initiative that was initiated by previous Government which 
<br/>the current Government is also continuing, and this MOU will ensure that the Blue Town concept 
<br/>that initially was around Savusavu, Cabinet has now broadened it to be more national in nature, it 
<br/>starts getting executed and MOUs such as this will assist greatly, Sir, in furthering those objectives. 
<br/>It, of course, aligns to the broader goals of the 2050 Blue Pacific Continent Strategy, ensuring that 
<br/>our national efforts also contribute to regional prosperity and sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By fostering new growth drivers in the Blue Economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOU, looks at 
<br/>expansion sectors such as, fisheries, marine tourism and renewable ocean energy. This diversification 
<br/>is  crucial  for  creating  sustainable  revenue  streams  that  will  support  Fiji’s  long-term  economic 
<br/>resilience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU also aims to position Fiji as a hub for blue economy investments in the Pacific by 
<br/>creating attractive investment platforms, including marine economic cooperation parks. This will not 
<br/>only attract direct foreign investment, but also drive infrastructure development and business growth 
<br/>in key areas, contributing to job creation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU emphasises capacity building and the transfer of knowledge and technology, which 
<br/>are vital for enhancing the skills of our workforce and the competitiveness of our businesses in the 
<br/>global  market.  Collaboration  with  research  institutes  will  also  foster  innovation,  leading  to  more 
<br/>efficient and sustainable use of our marine resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This MOU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reaffirms Fiji’s commitment to global environmental standards 
<br/>by adhering to international obligations, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
<br/>Sea  (UNCLOS)  and  the  Paris  Agreement  on  climate  change.  In  addition,  the  focus  on  green 
<br/>investments  will  support  Fiji’s  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  preserving  our  marine 
<br/>biodiversity for future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to pick on some of the practical investment potentials as appearing from 
<br/>this MOU, quite recently, we had one investor from Hong Kong, expressing his interest in looking 
<br/>at oysters and giant prawns in Fiji.  So, there are some active discussions happening on that front 
<br/>now, Sir.  If they come to fruition or gain momentum, we will certainly share them in Parliament. 
<br/>But these are the early harvests from the MOU that we are discussing today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to  reiterate that this MOU is  not  just a bilateral 
<br/>cooperation initiative but a very much strategic partnership that reflects on our collective dedication 
<br/>to fostering sustainable development and deepening our engagement in the blue economy.  It opens 
<br/>new  avenues  for  investment,  capacity  building,  and  international  cooperation,  all  of  which  are 
<br/></span><span>essential for building a prosperous and resilient future for our beloved Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just before we allow supplementary questions to be raised, just a matter of 
<br/>housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders in respect to sitting times, I 
<br/>now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
