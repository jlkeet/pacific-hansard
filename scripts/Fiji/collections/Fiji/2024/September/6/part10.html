<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for this week. I also welcome all those 
<br/>joining us in the gallery and those watching proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you 
<br/>for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  please,  join  me  in  welcoming  the  students  and  teachers  of  Totoya 
<br/>District  School  from  Totoya.    Welcome  to  your  Parliament  and  I  hope  that  the  proceedings  this 
<br/>morning will give a clearer idea of how your Parliament works.

<div><span>5th Pacific Islands Parliamentary Group Conference (PIPG)

<br/>Parliamentary  Group  Conference  (PIPG)  from  25th  August,  2025  to  29th  August,  2025.    May  I 
<br/>request that you lock in those dates so that we can have as many honourable Members as possible

<div><span>Personal Explanation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1867 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>participate in the Conference. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific Blue Identity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  may  have  realised  that  we  have  been  having  a  lot  of  debate,  especially  from  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations and the group that he 
<br/>leads, and the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the group that he leads known as SIDS but, 
<br/>again, the honourable Prime Minister has been devoting his time a lot in trying to unite the whole of 
<br/>the Pacific under one common identity and, that is, the border that we have - the Pacific Blue.  There 
<br/>is only one identity, honourable Members, and we need to identify ourselves with that identity, that 
<br/>we hold dearly to us, because otherwise our voice will not be heard, as alluded to by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations, including myself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  if  you  go  out  to  these  international  meetings,  you  try  as  much  as 
<br/>possible to get the voice of the Pacific through.  There is only 13 island countries in the Pacific region, 
<br/>but if we bring in Indonesia, there is more.  Indonesia has 7,000 islands, so it will be great if we can 
<br/>rope them in under that one identify which we share.   
<br/></span></div>
