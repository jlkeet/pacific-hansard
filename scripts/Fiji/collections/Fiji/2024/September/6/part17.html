<h3>BILLS - FIRST READING</h3>
<div><span>BILLS - FIRST READING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 84, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Audit Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17/2024), be now read the first time.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adjournment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1907 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Please hand the four copies of the Bill to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- While it is the first time, the Government hasâ€¦ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- After a long time, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have not finished what I wanted to say.  You should count yourselves 
<br/>lucky because the Government has decided that this one here will take the full process of having the 
<br/>Bill scrutinised and debated in this august House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[A Bill for an Act to repeal the Audit Act 1969 and provide for the powers, duties and 
<br/>mandate of the Auditor-General  and for the  audit of the Public Accounts and Public 
<br/>Entities and related matters (Bill No. 17 of 2024)] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, in accordance with Standing Order 84(1), the Bill has now been read 
<br/>the first time.  The Bill will now be listed on the Order Paper and set down for Second Reading on a 
<br/>future sitting date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members until such time the honourable Deputy Prime Minister will give notice 
<br/>for the Second Reading, I encourage all honourable Members to utilise this time to peruse the Bill 
<br/>and prepare for debate which will primarily focus on the principals and merits of the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly,  there  should  be  a  clause  on  immunity,  I  hope,  because  we  are  trying  to 
<br/>immunise the Auditor-General as well in carrying out his duty.  We do not like the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General to go through that critical journey where he is not allowed to freely flex his wings, 
<br/>so  to  speak  in  carrying  out  his  duties.    The  Australian  Auditor-Geneal  has  that  protection  and, 
<br/>likewise, we were so happy that it is now part of Clause 9 of the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
