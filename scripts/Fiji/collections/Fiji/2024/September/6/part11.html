<h3>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</h3>
<div><span>PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to seek your leave to assure your honourable 
<br/>and respected Chair, and to allay the concerns you have raised yesterday about the various findings 
<br/>of the Committees, and you encouraged Government to carry out follow-up actions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier in the week, I had mentioned that it might 
<br/></span><span>be appropriate for Government, and I quote from what I mentioned in the last paragraph on Page 
<br/>1715 of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> on Monday, 2nd September, 2024: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I was just thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that, perhaps we can look at the procedures in 
<br/>our  parliamentary  processes,  particularly  with  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and  the 
<br/>various recommendations they make, particularly also in the case where we are looking at

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>almost generational reports that cover so many years and all the enterprises.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of it, we voted, “We will now vote to note the contents of the Report”.  We, at 
<br/>Parliament, could say that we have done our duty, who noted the Report. But you encouraged us 
<br/>yesterday, Sir, to carry out what needs to be done, particularly those that come close to omissions or 
<br/>commissions that are almost culpable, but beyond our power to determine whether they are or not, 
<br/>and that should be carried forward from just noting the Report. I just want to assure your honourable 
<br/>Office that the Government is serious about that, and we will follow up on those Committee Reports. 
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Prime Minister. I thank you so much 
<br/>for your response on that matter. Once again, the three Committees have raised their concerns in this 
<br/>august Parliament.  We, as Members, in listening to our colleagues as Members of those Committees, 
<br/>fully  understand  where  they  are  coming  from.    We  understand  the  nature  of  their  responses  and 
<br/>yesterday, the diatribe continued, so as to say, I was not informed, you are not present, even though 
<br/>emails and copies of emails were made available. Again, what is there in our role as Members of 
<br/>Parliament?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have another avenue available to us, and it is whether the Cabinet or the Cabinet Sub-
<br/>Committee, with the honourable Prime Minister, make the directive in this august House and trying 
<br/>to kick in the new format of seeing that things of this nature are fully addressed by this august House.  
<br/>We have the powers of scrutiny and oversight, and that is something that we have attested but we 
<br/>have got them all in order in the Standing Orders.  All I was asking is to bring that to your notice, 
<br/>honourable Members. There are ways and avenues of skinning the cat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you most sincerely, honourable Prime Minister, for your response this morning.  Do 
<br/>not worry, Sir.  As Prime Minister, as soon as you stand, we will have to all wait and hear what you 
<br/>are about to deliver in this august Parliament, whether is it an instruction, or it is something that you 
<br/>have asked to be done immediately. We thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
