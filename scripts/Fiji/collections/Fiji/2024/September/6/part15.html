<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  thank  you  for  the  update  on  the 
<br/>actual  MOU  that  has  been  signed  with  China  with  respect  to  deepening  the  blue  economic 
<br/>cooperation and sustainable development. Honourable Minister, this obviously has a Belt and Road 
<br/>Initiative (BRI) that was begun in 2018 as per to the actual agreement. The question is that under that 
<br/>BRI, there were quite a few things that Fiji was a beneficiary of, and I am talking about the Suva City 
<br/>Council building, et cetera, the Nabouwalu Dreketi highway, and some of the bridges that were done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Does this particular MOU have a portion of that agreement that will mean that we have some 
<br/>projects that Fiji will benefit through this particular MOU that has been signed, especially in terms 
<br/>of the sustainable development part of the MOU? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the great things with MOUs is, it 
<br/></span><span>is  almost  like  a  blank  canvas.  So,  it  allows  for  cooperation  on  various  aspects  so,  I  guess,  the 
<br/>opportunity  is  to  do  quite  a  few  things,  including  direct  economic  investment,  and  other  issues 
<br/>suggested by honourable Koya, will be part of the ongoing discussions going forward in terms of the 
<br/>development of this MOU. But sadly, in the initial conversation, what this brings to the table is an 
<br/>opportunity to discuss some areas of real opportunity for Fiji and try and convert them into good 
<br/>economics as well.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  definitely,  we  want  to  do 
<br/>more, we want to grow the economy. When we do sign MOUs, probably something that is critical 
<br/>and  Government  needs  to  seriously  look  into  this  now,  is  probably  more  along  the  lines  of  the 
<br/>question that honourable Koya has asked - the expertise within to help us elevate the standard of 
<br/>service and implementation so that we can achieve more, of course, particularly towards sustainable 
<br/>development goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation talked about 
<br/>brain drain yesterday. This is a problem. In my response to His Excellency’s Address, I talked about 
<br/>strategic immigration policies that probably allow us to recruit expertise. Honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister, this  is  very critical  for us and I hope that  Government  can be  open to  this in  getting in 
<br/>experts from our partners whom we are signing the MOU with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  just  talked  about  prawn  farming.    The  secret  in  prawn  farming  is  the  fertility  of  the 
<br/>mother prawns, and that is a specialist area.  So, whether we have it in the Ministry of Fisheries or 
<br/>not. If we do not have it, for prawns to grow and to do better, we need specialists.  So, will this be an 
<br/>important agenda under these MOUs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I will answer the question in a couple of ways. 
<br/>One, is just in terms of the immigration question </span><span>per se</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation, there is an active endeavour to fix immigration issues. We are hoping 
<br/>that towards the end of the year, there will be a total change in the way immigration currently provides 
<br/>services and God willing, if that is happening well, it will allow us to then, backfill some of the gaps 
<br/>that we have in terms of our manpower development.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the specific question raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, which is a great 
<br/>question,  the  MOU  does  talk  about  capacity  building  and  technical  knowledge  support.  You  are 
<br/>correct that in the early discussions on prawn farming, the issue of technical expertise did come up, 
<br/>which the investor is willing to provide, in this instance, but certainly in a broader sense.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we all agree that whatever areas of cooperation that we get into, if the need arises in 
<br/>terms of technical support or capacity building to be able to ensure that sustainability to some of these 
<br/>initiatives is given, the MOU adequately covers the ability to reach out for technical assistance and 
<br/>capacity building resource. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre 
<br/>(Question No. 213/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the development of the dedicated Drug Rehabilitation Centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/></span><span>With increasing Injectable Drug Use (IDU) which is a significant issue in the country, Government, 
<br/>through the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, intends to have a Drug Rehabilitation Centre.  
<br/>To do so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will need to tread carefully in terms of ensuring that services 
<br/>to be provided at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre is of local context.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1891 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  to  inform  the  honourable  Members  of  this  August  Parliament  on  what  is  drug 
<br/>rehabilitation, it is a multifaceted therapeutic approach aimed at aiding individuals in overcoming 
<br/>addiction  to  substances,  including  drugs  and  alcohol.  This  process  requires  multipronged 
<br/>pharmacological  and  non-pharmacological  interventions,  including  spiritual  components  under 
<br/>guidance of expert professionals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To give an update on the development of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the Sub-Committee of the Counter Narcotics Committee (CNC) are working towards the National 
<br/>Counter Narcotics Action Plan for August 2024 – July 2025. Included in this Plan is the Counter 
<br/>Narcotics Framework which consists of four pillars, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Harm reduction which focuses on Treatment and High Risk Behaviour. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Demand Reduction which focuses on Prevention and Awareness, 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Supply Reduction which focuses on Law Enforcement and National Security. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Legal Reform which focuses on Prosecution and Drug Court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation of these four pillars involves a whole of Government approach, involving 
<br/>the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection; Ministry of Youth and Sports; Ministry of 
<br/>Home Affairs  and  Immigration;  to  name a few.  The Drug Rehabilitation Centre comes under the 
<br/>Harm Reduction Pillar which is to be implemented by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>in the next three to five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The aims of this pillar are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Reduce substance abuse morbidity and HIV incidents from IDU by 85 percent over the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>next five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Have  practical  recovery-oriented  treatment  frameworks  in  place  that  leads  a  person 
<br/>through  clinical  treatment  into  community  recovery  (with  provisions  for  anticipated 
<br/>relapse episodes in the medium term). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Have  St.  Giles  as  the  last  (not  the  first)  option  for  treating  people  presenting  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>substance abuse disorders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Have  specialist  rehabilitation  centres  for  patients  with  drug  use  disorders  to  begin 
<br/>specialised  treatment  and  recovery  programmes  in  partnership  with  faith-based 
<br/>organisations (FBOs) and our Civil Society Organisations (CSOs).  At the moment, the 
<br/>Ministry is utilising available resources to deal with the current drug rehabilitation cases 
<br/>and, at the same time, will need to ascertain what services will be offered at the Drug 
<br/>Rehabilitation Centre should we intend to have one.  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Facilitate access to medical therapies where appropriate. 
<br/>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Create posts and funding for, at least, one full time counsellor and social worker, there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase hospital-based counselling capacity at all health facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would be specific therapy training at each facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Ensure screening resources are available at all hospitals, divisional and subdivisional. 
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Provide training to nurses on drug screening and drug use assessment as needed. 
<br/>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Develop clear protocols around drug use reporting and patient notes and when an external 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report can be requested. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Acquire land, building agreement which can be used as a first rehabilitation centre. 
<br/>(12)</span><span> </span><span>Set up a team of practitioner stakeholders, health and community sector to plan a recovery 
<br/>treatment  framework  for  the  rehabilitation  facility,  funding  and  resources  for  this 
<br/>framework can be sought in the following year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to update this august Parliament.
