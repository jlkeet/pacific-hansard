<div><span>The Coalition Government continues to recognise the significance of education at different 
<br/>levels  from  primary  to  tertiary-level  education.  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loans Service 
<br/>(TSLS)  was  established  in  2014  with  the  core  mandate  to  administer  Government 
<br/>scholarships, grants and study loans.  TSLS plays a critical role as the major stakeholder for 
<br/></span><span>human  capital  development  in  the  country  by  providing  highly  trained  and  competent 
<br/></span><span>workforce to sustain our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Since 2014, seventy thousand nine hundred and four students (70,904) students have been 
<br/>funded through scholarships, study loans, micro qualifications grants and apprenticeship 
<br/>scheme. This amounts to total financial investment of $1.1 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 68,700 students have been funded by TSLS through Scholarships, Study Loans 
<br/>and Grants at 19 local Tertiary Education Institutes (TEI's) and 18 Institutions in Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, 1,879 students have been assisted through Micro Qualification Grant and

<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>From 2014 to 2023 there were 21,685 students who have either absconded, are inactive 
<br/>or are yet to graduate and their Bond term has expired. This equates to approximately 
<br/>$160 million dollars of Investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The breakdown by Institution cannot be released as it will cause reputational damage to 
<br/>the Tertiary Education  Institutions. However, the institutions have the information  on 
<br/>probation, suspension and non-completion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Students were provided with a TELS loan from 2014 to 2019 with very low marks to 
<br/>do degree programmes which contributed to such high non- completion. The Technical 
<br/>Colleges also attributed to the non-completion figures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Parliament  has  approved  amendments  to  the  TSLS  Act  to  obtain 
<br/></span><span>academically 'at risk' student information. The information is to be used to subsequently 
<br/></span><span>prepare remedial plans for their tertiary education institutions to early detect and provide 
<br/>scaffolding support to reduce the non - completion rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>The Higher Education Commission Fiji (HECF) and Tertiary Scholarships and Loans 
<br/>Service (TSLS) have no legal mandate to collect employment records of the graduates. 
<br/>Due to this there are no records on where the graduates who benefited from Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>iv. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>funding  are  employed.  However,  with  amendments  to  the  TSLS  Act,  Bill  No.  16  of 
<br/>2024 and Act No. 12 of 2024, TSLS now has the mandate to collect student employment 
<br/>record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 17A of TSLS Act requires " A student or former student who is employed or 
<br/>self-employed, must provide the Service with his or her employment record". 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All TSLS funded students are now obligated to submit the employment record to TSLS 
<br/>within 6 months of being employed or self-employed and any other time as directed by 
<br/>TSLS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this requirement, it will not only allow TSLS to keep track of where students are 
<br/>employed but also assist in bond clearance process and national planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>TSLS  will  strengthen  the  policies,  regulations  and  the  Act  to  ensure  transparent  and 
<br/>accountable  management  of  government  funding  to  maximize  return  from  taxpayer 
<br/>investment in education.
