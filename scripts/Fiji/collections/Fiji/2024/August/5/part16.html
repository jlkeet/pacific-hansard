<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LANDS AND  
<br/>MINERAL RESOURCES 2018-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources 2018–2019, 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 Annual Reports which were 
<br/>tabled on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to present the overview of the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources operations for the fiscal year 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 
<br/>2020-2021.    These  years  have  been  pivotal  as  the  Ministry  navigated  various  challenges  and 
<br/>opportunities in managing Fiji’s land and mineral resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018-2019 the focus was on enhancing land administration in improving the efficiency of 
<br/>land services.  The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources made significant strides in updating 
<br/>land  records  and  streamlining  the  land  allocation  process.    Additionally,  the  Ministry  launched 
<br/>initiatives to boost sustainable land management and address environmental concerns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fiscal  year  2019-2020  saw  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  building  on 
<br/>these  foundations  which  increase  emphasis  on  strategic  resource  management  and  infrastructure 
<br/>development.  The Ministry initiated key projects aimed at strengthening the Ministry’s regulatory 
<br/>framework and  engaging with  local  communities to  ensure that land and  mineral  extraction were 
<br/>conducted responsibly and sustainably. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For 2020-2021 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the global COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented 
<br/>challenges.    Despite  this  hurdle,  the  Ministry  demonstrated  resilience  by  accelerating  digital 
<br/>transformation, ensuring continuity in land and resources management and adapting our strategies to 
<br/>meet  evolving  needs.  The  staff  continued  to  prioritise  maintaining  critical  services,  supporting 
<br/>economic  recovering  and  re-enforcing  our  commitment  to  sustainable  development.  Throughout 
<br/>these  years  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  has  remained  steadfast  in  its  vision  to 
<br/>manage Fiji’s land and mineral resources with integrity and foresight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Ministry had highlighted the activities and challenges while 
<br/>maintaining  the focus on the Ministry’s  commitment to  sustainable  resource management  in  Fiji.  
<br/>The Committee is thankful to the staff of the Ministry for their overall performance during the review 
<br/>period.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before I offer the floor, I have received the list of speakers from the Whips as follows: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J. Usamate; and

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decided not to participate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the  motion  on  the  2018  to  2021 
<br/>Consolidated  Report  by  the  Standing  Committee  on  Natural  Resources.    Before  I  start  my 
<br/>contribution,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands,  Chief  Valuer,  Director  of 
<br/>Lands and the Acting Permanent Secretary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today,  I  have  signed  an  agreement  with  the  Ministry  of  Lands  of  the  sales  data  which  is 
<br/>available for all the valuers.  The valuers should know that now we will be getting the sales data and 
<br/>our evaluation will be more accurate, honourable Minister.   I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would also 
<br/>understand how vital that information was, it had been missing for two and half years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It has been missing for how many years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- For two and a half years.  The thing is that till today, I have signed the 
<br/>agreement, we did not know the actual values of properties around Fiji, so it was very difficult for us 
<br/>to do a valuation in Fiji because of that vital data missing.   That is the heart of our valuation, so once 
<br/>again thank you honourable Minister, I really appreciate that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an old report, however, …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a side comment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Pardon, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a different thing?  So now you are going to your…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Going back to this one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Meandering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Appreciating.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I am appreciating, not blaming all the time, so I really appreciate the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  and  the  Government  of  the  day.    You  should  also  appreciate,  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going  back  to  the  Report,  looking  at  Recommendation  2  where  it  says  the  problem  of 
<br/>outsourcing the survey of land.  I understand that there has been a shortage of surveyors in Fiji.  Also, 
<br/>we can recommend that if the subdivision is given to individuals who can do the surveys if consent 
<br/>is granted, it will be much easier to have some of the informal settlements legalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We used to practice that during your time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we got consent for two lots to 
<br/>three lots and the lessees used to do the subdivision themselves, and the cost was borne by them.  It 
<br/>was  one  of  the  ways  we  could  reduce  the  number  of  informal  settlements  on  State  land  in  Fiji.  
<br/></span><span>Mostly, the Western area has a lot of informal settlements on State land, and I think the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister will agree with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one is the efficient service which is in Recommendation 3.  This one has to be 
<br/>improved because the mortgage and transfer consent has to be given on time, it should be fast tracked. 
<br/>If it is not given on time, for example, if it is a lapse of three months then the lessees or the buyers 
<br/>have to pay another consent fees of $100.  If it is done within three months or it can be done within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1415 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two weeks or three weeks, it will be much better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the officers of the Ministry of Lands see there is a breach of any condition which they have 
<br/>to rectify, that should be given to the solicitors or the lessees to rectify quickly so that the transfer or 
<br/>the mortgage consent could be given earlier.  This is one of the areas we think that the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands has to improve on - the consent to the mortgage and the transfer consent.  We look forward 
<br/>working with the Minister and other stakeholders to look into it and how they can fast-track those 
<br/>concerns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The major one is Recommendation 4 where the Committee has picked up the arrears of rental, 
<br/>so it is not new.  Arrears has been outstanding amounting to millions of dollars.  A major concern 
<br/>are properties with the State as they do not want to pay rental because it is between the four or five 
<br/>brothers or sisters, and they do not want to pay rental.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second issue is the increase in rental.  I know in 1999 to 2000, the land value was not 
<br/>that much. In Nasinu, it was $30,000 to $40,000, so rental on 2.5 percent was a bit less but now the 
<br/>land value with the same property has gone up to $150,000 to $200,000 and then UCV of that, you 
<br/>pay rental 2.5 percent is very high.  That may be one of the causes, so if the Ministry of Lands and 
<br/>other stakeholders and valuers could look into it, on how we can get into a percentage of rental where 
<br/>both parties benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To reduce rental, the best part will be for the Government to have amnesty to the lessees, the 
<br/>penal rental and the penalties, the Government can consider giving, I will stick to the lessees to pay 
<br/>rental so they can take out the interest and the penal rental which has been charged on those land 
<br/>leases.  These are the things which we can do - we can reduce rental and Government can have more 
<br/>revenue on it, otherwise the arrears will keep on increasing.  These are a few things which we can 
<br/>look into, and I hope the Government considers the amnesty to the lessees of the sugarcane lessees 
<br/>in the West and all the lessees in residential and commercial areas, so they can have revenue, and at 
<br/>the same time, the people will be able to clear off their rental. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the work done by the Committee.  I had been a 
<br/>former  Member  of  the  Natural  Resource  Committee  and  once  again,  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  first  and  foremost,  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the review of the Ministry’s Report from 2018 to 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry notes the role and the responsibility that it carries and the desire to 
<br/>continue to strive towards delivering excellence service to the public and to the people of Fiji.  The 
<br/>Standing Committee on Natural Resources have come up with seven general recommendations in 
<br/>the Report, which I will highlight in this august House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1: 
<br/>The Committee recommends that the Ministry clearly identifies performance indicators and 
<br/>also carries out proper assessments of the achievements of the Ministry.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry noted the recommendation and is working towards having clear 
<br/>performance  indicators  and  to  ensure  systematic  assessment  of  its  achievements.    Within  the 
<br/>Ministry,  there  is  a  quarterly  internal  verification  of  our  plans  conducted  from  all  the  respective 
<br/>divisions where officers are located.   From the verification of these reports, Sir, presentations are 
<br/>conducted which we were able to gauge the performance from these officers.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>1416 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2: 
<br/>The Committee recommends that the Ministry reconsiders its policy and actively undertake 
<br/>the development of subdivisions which includes the option of outsourcing development work 
<br/>whilst maintaining an oversight role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  recommendation  is  noted  by  the  Ministry  and  is  considering  issuing 
<br/>development  leases  to  potential  developers  who  have  the  capability  to  develop  State  land  to  its 
<br/>highest  and  best  use.        The  Ministry  will  strengthen  its  monitoring  mechanism  that  will  ensure 
<br/>development  works  are  carried  out  within  the  development  lease  and  to  avoid  issues  of  over 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3: 
<br/>The Committee recommends that the Ministry continues to enhance the use of information 
<br/>technology, digital platforms and applications to assist the Ministry achieve our targets and 
<br/>deliver better, effective and efficient services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is currently taking proactive steps in firstly scanning of all of 
<br/>our archaic files within our offices and for update we are almost completing scanning all the files in 
<br/>the West and North. The major task will be in ensuring that, that also happens in the Central and 
<br/>Eastern regions. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is using its in-house capacity to develop 
<br/>the following platforms and again I have spoken about this in my past addresses, and I just reiterate 
<br/>them again for the use and benefit of those who have and retain State leases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  MyLeaseInfo  app  for  State  land  leases  to  register  and access  their  lease 
<br/>information, we are urging this to all those who have State leases is to register. Again, the second 
<br/>one is on Online State Land Application shortly termed as OSLA.  That is a platform where all lands 
<br/>that belong to the State can be applied for by everyone without having to visit any Ministry office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consent application, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also coming online.  We are currently developing 
<br/>and have already trialled this consent applications which is to compliment the MyLeaseInfo and the 
<br/>OSLA platform where lessees can also apply online for various consents along with the digitization 
<br/>of the entire application process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4: 
<br/>The Committee strongly recommends that proper recovery plans for outstanding leases, rents 
<br/>are implemented to collect unpaid dues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges this comment and this recommendation. We are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>putting forward strategies to be undertaken by the Ministry to improve the collection of our rental: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>We  are  working  with  the  Solicitor-General’s  Office  in  taking  legal  advice,  particularly 
<br/>those who have commercial or industrial leases and continue to default on a yearly basis.  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>We  are  looking  at  waiver  of  interest  incentive.    Our  staff  are  also  visiting  lessees  and 
<br/>conducting awareness on rental payments, issuance of notices and flyer on rental payments. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>We are accepting undertakings with lessees to clear rental arrears within a respective period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is much media publicity and awareness being made by the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>We  are  providing  options  on  mode  of  payments  to  lessees,  development  of  Debt  and 
<br/>Revenue Management Policy within and, of course, the acceptance of undertakings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 5: 
<br/>The  Committees  strong  recommendation  in  the  continuation  and  strengthening  of  the 
<br/>Ministry’s retention policies and also its training and capacity building policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1417 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  welcomes  this  recommendation  and  ensures  that  proper 
<br/>procedures are in place regarding the retention of staff and human resources development within the 
<br/>Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 6: 
<br/>The Committee strongly recommends for proper application of financial procedures to enable 
<br/>efficient financial accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledged this recommendation, and we are working to 
<br/>strengthening our internal processes and ensure   that appropriate measures and guidelines are being 
<br/>followed in ensuring accuracy, transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  financial  accountability,  the  Ministry  is  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finance on its internal reforms and policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation 7: 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  strengthens  the  measures  by  which  it 
<br/>eliminates illegal sand and gravel extraction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has strengthened its monitoring of illegal sand and river gravel 
<br/>extraction in the three Divisions through the engagement of our natural resources monitoring officers 
<br/>within the Ministry. We continue to raise awareness and engagements with the landowning units to 
<br/>help them monitor the resources that they and the Ministry are able to provide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an MOU has been signed with the Fiji Police Force in 2022, to address 
<br/>the illegal river gravel and sand extraction in 2022. The Ministry is also moving to a lateral approach 
<br/>in  working  together  with  other  Ministries,  such  as  the  Provincial  Offices  and  other  Government 
<br/>Ministries in ensuring that illegal activities on State resources is minimised or eradicated altogether. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  I  once  again  commend  the  Report  and  thank  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Natural Resources for the recommendation and the work that has been done.  </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  for  leading  us  through  the 
<br/>deliberations on this Report, and the comments that have been received from the honourable Minister. 
<br/>There  are  just  a  few  things  that  I  would  like  to  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Having  been  part  of  that 
<br/>Ministry in the latter part of the period under review and also being part of the Committee, I would 
<br/></span><span>just like to appreciate the format of the Annual Report that was done by the Ministry. No long essays 
<br/></span><span>but just the focus on key results. I think that is something good for other Ministries to look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we were equally impressed with the Ministry and their Reports, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, was the strong gender equality and in particular, the leadership of the Ministry at that 
<br/>particular point in time - the Permanent Secretary, along with many of the Directors, the Chief Valuer, 
<br/>Divisional Lands Officer, were all women.  So, it was very remarkable to see that, that was happening 
<br/>in this particular Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, also appreciate at length the manner in which the SDGs that this Ministry was trying to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribute to meeting were clearly articulated in the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had a number of comments on a lot of the recommendations.  I think the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  has  identified  in  particular  how  they  are  addressing  some  of  these 
<br/>recommendations.  I will not spend too much time on it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>1418 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the first one on identifying performance indicators, it is clearly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>articulated how well they have done that - their performance management system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is one thing that I see, however, that a lot of these Annual Reports, we do not get an 
<br/>overall score on outputs or - an overall score of how the Ministry has done. In order to be able to do 
<br/>something like that, you would have to weigh the relative importance of different outputs so that you 
<br/>get  an  overall  assessment.  I  think  this  is  something  that  is  very  important  when  we  are  trying  to 
<br/>assess.  How well an entity has operated is to weight the different outputs so that you can get an 
<br/>overall score of the performance of the entity as a whole.  That is something that I hope that this 
<br/>Ministry and other Ministries can take into account.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has addressed at length the development of the subdivisions, I think there has 
<br/>been a lot of growth in that particular area. There has been comments also from the Minister and I 
<br/>want  to  repeat  that on how well the Ministry has done in  using information,  digital platforms, et 
<br/>cetera, to ease the way in which it carries out its operations.  I will not repeat all those responses that 
<br/>the honourable Minister has made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, on the plans that have been made for the recovery of arrears, we know that the current 
<br/>rent in the Ministry is around $16 million per year, but the arrears total is around $20 million. It has 
<br/>been stated that this is not a new issue, it has been longstanding, but I think, as parliamentarians, we 
<br/>need to raise our concern with it, and we hope that the Ministry can continue to look at innovative 
<br/>ways of reducing that level of arrears.  I know it is not easy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  take  note  of  the  measures  they  have  put  in  place,  and  we  hope  that  this  needs  to  be 
<br/>addressed because $20 million is a lot of money for the Government to look at.  It is an opportunity 
<br/>cost to what Government could have got out of that money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a person who is involved in training, the recommendation recommending 
<br/>the continuation and strengthening of the Ministry’s retention policies and its training and capacity 
<br/>building policies, is something I strongly endorse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were told that this particular Ministry, during this period, regularised 80 positions within 
<br/>the Ministry, and in particular, I was very impressed with what they referred to as an equalisation.  
<br/>When  looking  whether  to  give  someone  a  job  or  not,  they  just  did  not  look  at  the  academic 
<br/>requirements, but look at the person’s competencies, and if the competencies were equal to what was 
<br/>you thought you would get out of the academic qualification, the person was given the job.  So that 
<br/></span><span>was competency profiling and equalisation of not just the academic qualification of the person, but 
<br/></span><span>the  person’s  ability  to  do.    I  think  that  is  the  message  that  can  be  used  right  across  all  different 
<br/>Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you notice, we lose a lot of people.  Some people are very well skilled but do not have the 
<br/>academic qualification, but on the job, they deliver, whereas others have the qualifications but cannot 
<br/>deliver.  Eventually over time, they will deliver because they have that broad knowledge capacity 
<br/>and the academic qualifications, over time they grow to becoming much better at their particular job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wanted  to  emphasise  that  very  strongly.    I  have  always  been  very 
<br/></span><span>impressed with the Ministry on how they try to make sure that their staff are very well qualified.  
<br/>This is a very well qualified Ministry.  We have people with PhDs in this Ministry and a strong group 
<br/>that has Masters, all of whom have worked their way up through the ranks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I congratulate the Committee and recommend for proper application of financial procedures.  
<br/>The Ministry, over the past have always had qualified audit opinions and even in the year in question, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1419 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it  was  qualified,  but  I  understand  that  in  the  following  year  (2022-2023),  the  audit  became 
<br/>unqualified.  I think that is the achievement on its own and we hope that the Ministry can continue 
<br/>to do this, to make sure that the financial procedures are in place to ensure financial accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has mentioned the issue of about illegal sand and gravel extraction, 
<br/>and  this  illegal  extraction  is  something  that  we  find  for  all  of  the  resource  sectors,  whether  it  is 
<br/>forestry or fishing.  It is not easy to address because sometimes the people who are guilty of doing 
<br/>this are in cahoots with some of the landowners themselves.  That is always something difficult to 
<br/>try to address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to mention the idea about penalties, stronger partnerships with other agencies, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we hope that they can continue to work to improve that for this important Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of this Ministry during COVID-19 where 
<br/>their GIS Specialists were  at  the  forefront  of the activities that were undertaken.  The Command 
<br/>Centre  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  all  around,  were  using  their  GIS  skills  that  became  very 
<br/>important in that battle against COVID-19 at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues I wanted to raise, I was looking at some of the comments 
<br/>that were made by the staff, one of the areas that they had some difficulties in was the success of 
<br/>borehole development, which was less than 100 percent, which means that of the number of boreholes 
<br/>they put into the ground, not all of them were successful.  This is understandable, but  I think the 
<br/>percentage of it, whether it is how high it is, is a concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why that is of a particular concern to me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I was looking in this 
<br/>year’s  budget  (this  is  not  for  this  Report),  the  amount  of  budget  that  they  have  for  boreholes  in 
<br/>groundwater for the large islands, has increased from around $3million right up to $5 million.  I am 
<br/>worried,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  about  execution.    I  have  talked  about  this  in  forestry,  and  I  hope  the 
<br/>execution can be undertaken to make use of this rapid rise.  If not, and if we are not very careful, we 
<br/>will do it anyhow, you do not do the reconnaissance correctly and the assessments correctly, you just 
<br/>dig the borehole, and your percentage of successful borehole declines.  So, itt is very important that, 
<br/>that be done.  That is a concern that I have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one last thing that I have talked about is that, in the land situation that we 
<br/>have in Fiji, we have the iTLTB and the Ministry of Lands that looks after most of the land in this 
<br/>country.  There is a portion of 4 percent for the State land, then we have the portion under the iTLTB 
<br/></span><span>land.  One of the concerns that I always have, being a former Minister, working in Government, is 
<br/></span><span>the fact that so many civil servants cannot afford land.  A lot of them live in squatter settlements. I 
<br/>know that there is a grouping where the TLTB and the Ministry of Lands sit and they look at the 
<br/>whole land situation. We really need to find some sort of a solution where our own civil servants can 
<br/>get housing and can get land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  know  what  the  solution  is,  maybe  something  around  valuation  to  make  sure  that 
<br/>people can afford land, to reduce speculation which I think is one of the causes of the hyped land 
<br/>prices so that our own civil servants themselves can even get land to be able to have a house for 
<br/></span><span>themselves.  I  know  it  will  require  some  sort  of  a  framework  across  Government,  across  iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>Affairs, TLTB and the Ministry of Lands, to come up with some sort of a scenario or approach that 
<br/>allows our people to get access to land so that they can build a house.  There are too many people 
<br/>now moving into squatter settlements, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along those lines, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish the Ministry well with these recommendations.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was glad to hear the sentiments from the honourable Minister and I support the motion before the

<div><span>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I want to thank the honourable Members 
<br/>who have spoken before me and particularly, thank the honourable Minister for Lands for addressing 
<br/>all the recommendations very clearly so I am not going to talk about that. I also thank honourable 
<br/>Kirpal and honourable Usamate.  I think honourable Usamate today made some very good points and 
<br/>suggestions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I always do! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think he touched on some very, very importants points.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 18 months, I have realised the importance of this Ministry, the 
<br/>significant of this Ministry because when you look at how the economic entities, investment and he 
<br/>talked about housing, beyond housing is the efficiency and the effectiveness with which the Ministry 
<br/>of Lands and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs actually works.  It determines, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how 
<br/>quickly investors can get on to the activities, but also the availability of land for those who want to 
<br/>build their houses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the availability and access to land is a serious issue, and I agree that it is time that we, 
<br/>as a government, and Opposition should set up a taskforce to look at how more land could be opened 
<br/>up at a price at a rate which is affordable to many of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also very pleased to say looking at it from the Ministry of Finance that in the last 18 
<br/>months, a lot of progress has been made by the Ministry in terms of the legislation, review of some 
<br/>of  the  policies,  ongoing  digitisation  of  land  records,  Government’s  efforts  to  address  shortage  of 
<br/>registered valuers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the lease arrears, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see there is quite a bit of flexibility now in terms of 
<br/>what the Ministry is doing.  They have undertaken a review of the criteria and, hopefully, we will 
<br/>have further incentives to reduce the amount of arrears that has been there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just on the 2024-2025 Budget and in relation to what honourable Usamate shared with respect 
<br/>to boreholes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very good initiative in the Budget, and this came out very 
<br/></span><span>clearly throughout the national consultations that we had on the National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It seems to us that there was a lot of legacy issues in terms of availability of water supply in 
<br/>the rural areas. That is why the allocation for 1,700 boreholes over the next two years - 1,000 in Viti 
<br/>Levu, 500 in Vanua Levu and 200 in the maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take the point very well that honourable Usamate made and both, myself and the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands, I mentioned that in my Budget Speech that there will be a taskforce which will 
<br/>involve the Ministry of Lands, Ministry of Waterways, Water Authority of Fiji and the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Finance - a taskforce made up of Permanent Secretaries who will ensure that we are able to actually 
<br/></span><span>deliver all these boreholes and address this fundamental issue of access and availability of drinking 
<br/>water in the rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will engage, not only the facilities and the machines that are available 
<br/>with the Ministry of Lands, but also bring in private players so that there is an urgency, there is a 
<br/>very clear focus as to how we can complete these boreholes as per the allocation in the Budget. The

<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1421 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry’s overall budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was increased by $6.4 million, which is a significant 
<br/>increase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  important  allocation  of  almost  a  million  dollars  was  the  survey  of  mahogany 
<br/>plantations and we realised we had some discussions this morning that a lot of trees are getting old. 
<br/>The value may be declining, and part of the problem was how quickly these surveys were done and 
<br/>forest harvested.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Survey of Government Stations, Cabinet earlier this year had approved the extension on 
<br/>the Survey of Government institutions on </span><span>itaukei</span><span> land lease to the State for the next 10 years.  That 
<br/>is another additional allocation that we have provided.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The groundwater assistance programme which includes the boreholes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, 
<br/>again, a very important component of this year’s Budget within the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  once  again,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  has  covered  the 
<br/>recommendations very well and I thank the Committee on Natural Resources for their Report and 
<br/>the contribution the Members have made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural 
<br/>Resources to speak in reply, just some concerns caught my attention.  One was mentioned recently 
<br/>by honourable Usamate, the affordability of land for residential purposes by civil servants. He stated 
<br/>that it is so high, expensive, and it is difficult for them to acquire a land, especially for residential 
<br/>purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know, I have stated this already and I will want to echo that again, it is the Town 
<br/>Planning together with the Ministry of Lands and the iTaukei Affairs to just try and sit and sort out 
<br/>how best can they make Native land or State land attractive by not imposing very stringent conditions 
<br/>in the town planning approval. Put gravel road instead of tarsealed road. You just do GPS boundary 
<br/>survey on wooden stakes and then they are given a lease. If they want to go beyond that and getting 
<br/>the lease surveyed and things like of that nature, then it is upon them to follow that up, whether they 
<br/>go through their banks, at least, they have something in their hands. It is an agreement to lease but 
<br/>that is a contract.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  you  reduce  such  issues  by  the  very  approval  that  we  give  it  makes  the  land  very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expensive. Cadastral surveys are very expensive and honourable Kirpal has mentioned that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, instead of tarsealed road and gravel road, you are providing them access and 
<br/>it  is  upon  them  for  future  Government  development  to  come  up  with  that  to  tarseal  the  road 
<br/>afterwards.  We did that in Ba, Bainisucu in Labasa, Malolo Sector in Nadi and Drasa in Lautoka 
<br/>where we relaxed all the conditions, got the approval and it is cheaper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 caught my attention, the arrears, I also mentioned this in the past, when 
<br/>you do not isolate what is rental owing and what is truly rental arrears, then both will be seen to be 
<br/></span><span>clogged up together and that becomes arrears. That is why you have a $20 million arrears, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister  for  Lands.    If  you  take  away  the  rental  owing  because  the  rental  clause  in  the  lease  as 
<br/>provided by Ministry of Lands and iTLTB allows for the payment of an annual sum into modes of 
<br/>payments – 6-monthly. When the first 6 months has not been paid, it does not mean that has become 
<br/>arrears in July, it is still rental owing. We have tried this, we have had it tested in the Courts and that 
<br/>was upheld.  So, we reduced our arrears from $20 million to about $14 million or $15 million.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, when you go into trying to address arrears by spending more money in recruiting the 
<br/>people who will follow up the arrears, you are spending more money to get a money that was already 
<br/>owing to you. I hope I am making sense here.  I am just trying to share this so at least it could throw 
<br/>some light into this how could this be addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  the  honourable  Usamate  stated  is  very  critical  when  civil  servants  cannot  afford 
<br/>residential allotments and when the rents are high, arrears are high, the cost that comes with it to have 
<br/>it to be addressed, the end result is the eviction of people from land that is already expensive to get a 
<br/>hold  of.  I  am  just  sharing  that  in  the  hope  that  it  might  drive  some  ideas  into  you  honourable 
<br/>Members, to see how best you can address the arrears and the way to reduce the cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N.TUNABUNA.- I wish to thank all Members who have contributed to the debate 
<br/>this afternoon and for the supporting the Report that had been submitted. I have nothing else to add, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
