<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those 
<br/>watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the 
<br/>workings of your Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Visit to Fiji - Her Excellency the President of India 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as you are all now aware, Her Excellency the President of the Republic 
<br/></span><span>of  India  will  visit  Parliament  tomorrow  and  will  deliver  an  address.  For  the  duration  of  the 
<br/>Presidential visit, access to Parliament and its precincts and gallery will be by invitation only.  May 
<br/>I also remind you that sometimes this morning a tentative programme for the official visit will be 
<br/>circulated to all honourable Members.  That programme is  from the honourable Prime Minister’s 
<br/>Office.

<div><span>Communications from the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resolutions of the Business Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Honourable Members, I would also like to inform you that the Members of the Business 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee have unanimously approved the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Parliament  will  uphold  the  ongoing  practice  with  respect  to  the  speaking  times  during 
<br/>debates on the Standing Committee review reports, whereby the mover will have up to five 
<br/>minutes to open the debate and up to five minutes of their right of reply.  There will only 
<br/>be two speakers from each side of the House, and each of the two speakers will have up to 
<br/>10 minutes to speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Pursuant to the Standing Order amendments of 24th May, 2024, Ministers responses to 
<br/>Oral  Questions  will  be  up  to  10  minutes  (from  20  minutes  to  10  minutes)  to  avoid 
<br/>honourable Ministers being pointed out at in trying to make Ministerial Statements.  These 
<br/>are just  responses  to the  questions.     The  responses to supplementary  questions  will  be 
<br/>between five minutes and 10 minutes, at the discretion of the honourable Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Whips must notify the Secretary-General if some of your honourable Members 
<br/>wish  to  speak  in  the  vernacular  at  any  given  time  and  day  during  the  sittings.    All  the 
<br/>Secretariat ask from you honourable Members is, please, give notice to us so we can prepare 
<br/>the translators that they be given enough notice time, because otherwise, people fire off into 
<br/>their  own  dialects  and  the  poor  translators  at  the  top  are  finding  it  difficult  to  quickly 
<br/>respond  to  translations,  instead  of  speaking  in  the  Bauan  language,  they  use  their  own 
<br/>dialects.    I must say here,  especially the two of  our honourable Members  from the big 
<br/>Province of Ra - the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the honourable 
<br/>Ratu Niudamu.  I trust all honourable Members we will try and communicate accordingly 
<br/>with your Whips in that matter, or in that respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>An  official  request  was  received  from  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Justice, Law and Human Rights for the Standing Committee to table its reports on the Child 
<br/>Justice Bill, Child Care and Protection Bill and the National Disaster Risk Management 
<br/>Bill  at  a  later  sitting  of  Parliament.  The  Chairperson  has  confirmed  that  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee has further referred the Bills to the legal drafters with their comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, with your indulgence, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights will table its reports on the Child Justice Bill, Child Care and Protection Bill 
<br/></span><span>and National Disaster Risk Management Bill at a later sitting of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Business Committee has unanimously approved that all future Bills under Standing 
<br/>Order 51 will be referred equally to the Standing Committees of Parliament, and not only 
<br/>to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights.  This is to try and share the 
<br/>workload  to  the  other  Standing  Committees  of  which,  the  honourable  Members  their 
<br/>operational rights are all the same.  It is just a matter of sharing the burden, we have done 
<br/>this in the past, and as such, we would like to make it part of our Standing Orders now as 
<br/>to  ensure  that  it  will  be  referred  to  all  Standing  Committees.    As  such,  all  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Members on the Standing Committees must be capacitated to undertake such a function.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Business Committee has also approved the honourable Government Whip to ensure 
<br/>that the Bills are equally distributed between all six Standing Committees.  I understand 
<br/>your workload, Madam Whip, is a bit heavy but, again, that is the responsibility that goes 
<br/>with that position.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of the 26 Members of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  information  of  all  honourable  Members,  my  Office  has  received  from  the  25 
<br/>honourable Members of the Opposition that they are now Independents.  Some of them wrote to me 
<br/>and some of them declared during the participation of the debates in the recent past by informing 
<br/>Parliament that they stand here as an Independent now.  One honourable Member is awaiting the 
<br/>outcome of the appeal lodged with the Fijian Electoral Commission.  So, he still has to notify me of 
<br/>his decision whilst waiting for that appeal that he has lodged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can also confirm that pursuant to Standing Order 4(2), there are two working groups or blocs 
<br/>in the Opposition.  One is being led by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and this is the Group 
<br/>of 16.  You try and inform me of how you want to be called, but this is the message from the Chair.  
<br/>This group is now known as Group of 16 Bloc.  Their Whip is honourable Jone Usamate and their 
<br/>Deputy Whip is honourable Ketan Lal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other Group of 9 Bloc, (I hope you do not mind; this is like being in prison or something), 
<br/>is being led by honourable Ioane Naivalurua.  Their Whip is the honourable Viliame Naupoto and 
<br/>their Deputy Whip is the honourable Alipate Matasawalevu.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  far  as  the  26  honourable  Members  are  concerned,  all  26  Members  remain  Opposition 
<br/>Members,  operating  under  the  two  working  groups  or  blocs,  and  in  that  respect,  the  Speaker  is 
<br/>mandated  that  under  Standing  Order  18(2)  to  ensure  the  rights  and  privileges  of  all  honourable 
<br/>Members in Parliament and in the Standing and Select Committees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the two working groups or blocs in the Opposition and pursuant to Standing Order 
<br/>114(4) and Standing Order 115(1), my Office will undertake a review of the membership of the six 
<br/>Standing Committees and the four Select Committees to ensure fair representation of the two working 
<br/>groups or blocs, and a further announcement will be made later this week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, whilst we appreciate that we are now being faced with unprecedented 
<br/>situations pertaining to deregistration of a political party and Members continuing as Independents, 
<br/>I  plead  with  you  all  that  we  must  continue  to  engage  in  constructive  dialogue  as  we  have  done 
<br/>previously or recently in the Business Committee where Members of the Opposition just put their 
<br/>heads together and decided on how to raise questions.  As such, we will continue in that element of 
<br/>dialogue so as to ensure and uphold the best interest of the people that have elected you, and most 
<br/>importantly, our beloved country.
