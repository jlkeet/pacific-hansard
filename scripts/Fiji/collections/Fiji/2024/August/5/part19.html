<br/>Response to Question No. 109/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has 1 local Senior Veterinary Officer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there are vacant positions of a Principal Veterinary Officer, 2 Senior Veterinary Officers, 
<br/>and  1  Veterinary  Officer  at  the  Veterinary  Pathology  Laboratory,  which  will  be  re-advertised  on 
<br/></span><span>Saturday 10/08/2024 to attract qualified  Veterinarians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is also working on running a qualifier examination to register more local veterinarians, 
<br/>who have graduated from local institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  also  collaborating  with  the  Australia  Volunteers  Program  to  assist  with  3 
<br/>veterinarians from Australia to support the Ministry on Veterinary Clinical Work. We are expecting 
<br/>3 Volunteers in October 2024 to serve in our Ministry for a period of 1 year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review of the Fiji Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1956 will begin in mid-August of 2024 when 
<br/>the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) consultants arrive in Fiji. The review will 
<br/>incorporate  improvements  in  the  Act  to  address  gaps  and  meet  the  demands  of  the  sector.  
<br/>Furthermore, it will open up the registration of veterinarians from other academic institutions 
<br/>who  have  the  necessary  qualifications  and  experience  to  practice  in  Fiji.  The  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture  will  also  work  with  the  World  Organization  of  Animal  Health  (WOAH),  the 
<br/>Solicitor Generalâ€™s Office and other stakeholders in Fiji to set up a Veterinary Statutory Council 
<br/>which will oversee all decisions relating to veterinary work in Fiji.
