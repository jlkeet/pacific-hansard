<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on 
<br/>the  progress  of  the  plans  for  a  new  National  Rehabilitation  Centre  to  replace  the  current 
<br/>Twomey Hospital in Tamavua? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Ravunawa for his question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a point to note, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the question, if I can put it in order, the new 
<br/>rehabilitation  centre  is  not  to  replace  the  current  Twomey  Hospital,  but  rather  to  replace  the  old 
<br/>Tamavua Military Hospital or former Tamavua Rehabilitation Facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the current progress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the construction of a new National Rehabilitation 
<br/>Centre  has  been  approved  by  the  Government  of  Fiji  and  the  Government  of  Korea.    Last  year, 
<br/>Cabinet approved a subsidiary arrangement between the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), to establish Fiji’s National Rehabilitation 
<br/>Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per the agreement, KOICA will provide a grant-in-aid of not more than $10 million, which 
<br/>is approximately FJ$22.2 million and, therefore, we are grateful to KOICA and to the Government, 
<br/>and to the people of Korea, for their generous assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  of  the  Tamavua  Hospital  has  been  assessed  to  be  non-  compliant  with  OHS 
<br/>requirements from the non-maintenance of the aging buildings and facilities that were built in many 
<br/>decades ago. Although we have experienced some delays in finalising the relocation of all services 
<br/>currently offered at the old Tamavua Hospital and the clearance of utilities servicing the hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Tamavua  Hospital  Team  and  the  Ministry’s  Assets  Management  Team  have  been 
<br/>working closely with the Ministry of Works and KOICA Fiji’s Office in the last 10 months, to ensure 
<br/>that the site is ready for the KOICA Construction Team anticipated movement into the site in January 
<br/>of 2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, further to that, the health partner, the Latter Days Saints Charity, has also indicated its 
<br/>willingness  to  assist  in  funding  more  than  $300,000  required  for  the  temporary  relocation  of  the 
<br/>rehabilitation hospital to the Twomey Hospital for the duration of the construction, again, which the 
<br/>Ministry is grateful for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government has allocated a funding of $400,000 in this financial year for the demolition and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>preparation of the hospital site for the new rehabilitation hospital, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meanwhile, other preparatory activities have been undertaken and are ongoing.  They include 
<br/>the first in-country training by rehabilitation medicine experts from the Korean University and Korea 
<br/>Rehab which was conducted in April this year.  The second in-country training is planned for January 
<br/>next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  an  invitational  training  programme  also  planned  where  seven  to  eight  health 
<br/>professionals from Fiji will be travelling to Korea for onsite training at a Centre of Excellence in  
<br/></span><span>Korea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project team is also expected to be travelling to Fiji later this year for ongoing discussions 
<br/>with KOICA Fiji Office Team and the Ministry’s Team and the project designers, as we continue our 
<br/>preparation for this very important project, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the detailed design phase is anticipated to be completed in September of this year and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their process of tendering of project will subsequently follow in October 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health. This Rehabilitation Centre, is it specifically for physical impairment rehabilitation or is it 
<br/>also going to take care of our drug-dependent people that we know that St. Giles Hospital is unable 
<br/>to cope with the numbers at the moment?  Is the Rehabilitation Centre, generally speaking, for all of 
<br/>those or is it specific to physical impairment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  honourable  Koya  for  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. It is for the physical impairment disability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, we noted that there is a reduction in the budget for 
<br/>this year by $0.4 million for this particular project.  But I am happy that there is a plan underway for 
<br/>staff capacity building, also in preparation for the construction, as well as for the operation of this 
<br/>rehabilitation centre. I have no supplementary question, but I wish the honourable Minister well and 
<br/>thank the Government of Korea for their support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>I am interested in the total cost of the project.  You mentioned about the FJ$22 million from KOICA, 
<br/>the assistance from the LDS Church and the demolition cost. Will Government be required to fork 
<br/>out  some  more  funds?    I  did  not  hear  the  total  cost  of  the  project,  if  you  may  elaborate  on  that, 
<br/>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for his question. The amount FJ$22.2 million is the total cost for the project, which is equivalent to 
<br/>$10 million Korean dollars.  Nevertheless, our allocation has been in terms of the preparatory works.  
<br/>That is what is currently budgeted, even though it was not utilised in the last financial year due to 
<br/>some unforeseen difficulties to do with water and electricity that is currently also supplying the Fiji 
<br/>National University (FNU).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  are  some  obstacles  that  the  Ministry  has  faced  but,  nevertheless,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>allocation - the grant, that will cover not only the construction but also the capacity building, as I 
<br/>have raised, as well as the finer equipment that will be used to carry out the necessary services to be 
<br/>provided.    That  is  from  everything  -  the  beds,  equipment,  et  cetera,  that  are  all  included  in  the 
<br/>Agreement. So, that is, in a nutshell, what is included in the grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 98/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the establishment of the 
<br/>Financial Services Ombudsman? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Vanawalu  for  his 
<br/></span><span>question.  I am pleased to inform Parliament that during the Cabinet Sitting of 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024, the 
<br/>establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman was approved. Sir, this is a significant decision 
<br/>and it shows the Government’s commitment and political will to enhancing consumer protection and 
<br/>fostering trust in the financial services sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1394 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsperson has been set up and we 
<br/>have  appointed  a  skilled  and  knowledgeable  Ombudsperson  to  manage  complaints  and  aid  in 
<br/>resolving issues.  Sir, the person is Ms. Wati Seeto.  She has been appointed as the first Financial 
<br/>Services Ombudsperson, as announced by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) on 31</span><span>st</span><span> July - last month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ms.  Seeto  joined  the  RBF  in  2010  after  holding  senior  positions  at  the  Capital  Markets 
<br/>Development Authority, bringing with her 25 years of legal expertise, 15 years of which is spent in 
<br/>financial  regulation  and  consumer  protection.    She,  in  our  view,  will  spearhead  this  significant 
<br/>establishment due to her legal knowledge and commitment to consumer advocacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsperson function, the 
<br/>existing complaints management function undertaken by the RBF will be maintained, but elevated 
<br/>to ensuring the specific function is conducted by an appointed Financial Services Ombudsperson.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office will function as an impartial platform, dedicated to resolving disputes between 
<br/>consumers and financial services providers and regulated by RBF. Its primary responsibilities include 
<br/>investigating  complaints,  facilitating  discussions,  ensuring  fair  resolution.    Its  role  is  crucial  in 
<br/>providing consumers with the reliable mechanism to address their grievances which ultimately helps 
<br/>to build trust and confidence in the financial services sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, the Ombudsperson will have an increased focus on ensuring the principles of 
<br/>independence, to  secure  impartiality,  clarity of scope and powers, accessibility, effectiveness  and 
<br/>transparency  and  accountability.    We  are  confident  Sir,  that  the  Office  of  the  Financial  Services 
<br/>Ombudsperson  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  maintaining  transparency  and  accountability  in  Fiji’s 
<br/>financial services sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, how will 
<br/>the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman be funded?  What measures are in place to ensure 
<br/>its independence and impartiality, considering that the Office is based within Reserve Bank of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is a very good question.  The 
<br/>Governor of the RBF is appointed by the Constitutional Offices Commission, and it is an independent 
<br/>office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The credibility of RBF rests on the independence on which the Bank conducts its monetary 
<br/>policies.  Therefore, the framework of independence is within the existing structure.  However, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  be  reviewing  its  effectiveness,  and  we  will  see  how  it  works  within  the 
<br/></span><span>framework of the RBF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know  that  in  2000,  there  was  a  Banking  Services  Commission  Report 
<br/>which recommended the establishment of the Office of the Banking Ombudsman, but we are now 
<br/>talking about the Financial Services Ombudsperson’s Office.  We felt that this was an immediate 
<br/>issue that can be accommodated within the framework of the independence provided for the RBF, 
<br/>but we will be reviewing this within a year or so to assess its effectiveness, look at the data on the 
<br/>number of complaints and how effectively and efficiently the Office is able to serve and resolve some 
<br/></span><span>of those complaints.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. - Funding?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.– The funding, of course, will be provided by the RBF as an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>independent institution. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1395 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have a supplementary question to the honourable Minister.  With 
<br/>the creation of the Financial Services Ombudsman, I am just interested in the legislations that are in 
<br/>place for effectiveness and efficiency of the functioning of the Office because some of our laws are 
<br/>archaic and within the current environment.  So, my simple question, honourable Minister is, whether 
<br/>the laws that we have is sufficient to ensure that the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman 
<br/>is effective and serves the purposes in which we created it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition.  I think it is a very important point.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The existing Complaints Management Framework is supervised by the RBF, already in terms 
<br/>of all the financial institutions, the banks, but the honourable Leader of Opposition is right, that once 
<br/>we are able to review the effectiveness of this provision that we have created and we want to do that 
<br/>within a year, then I think we would be able to look at if it needs changes to the law or if it needs a 
<br/>completely separate Financial Services Ombudspersons Office outside of the RBF.  For that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  have  to  look  at  the  legislative  framework  and  the  changes  that  would  be 
<br/>required,  whether  it  is  part  of  the  Reserve  Bank  Act  or  a  separate  legislation  to  set  up  a  totally 
<br/>independent Office of the Ombudsperson. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. - I thank the honourable Minister for the development of this position 
<br/>of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  I am not too sure if this role will be more like a mediatory 
<br/>role where the parties come to a conclusion, or more like an arbiter.  If it is an arbiter, would his 
<br/>decisions then be legally binding on the parties? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. - Again, a good question.  At the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the position, within the framework of the RBF, will try and resolve the complaints that consumers 
<br/>have  with  respect  to  any  financial  services  institution.    But,  as  I  have  said,  the  original 
<br/>recommendation  that  was  made  in  2000  as  part  of  the  banking  inquiry,  suggested  a  completely 
<br/>separate office for the Banking Ombudsman at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years,  the  RBF  assumed  and  there  were  changes  made  for  it  to  have  a  special 
<br/>Complaints Management Framework, which has  been working.   But  this Office itself is  going  to 
<br/>strengthen and, perhaps provide a lot more teeth for an office within the RBF, and a dedicated person.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the kind of experience that Ms. Seeto has, would be able to resolve, in my view, a lot of 
<br/>the complaints  that consumers would have, but  that option is  still there  - to  look  at  a completely 
<br/></span><span>independent office with its own legislative framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for lunch.  The first bell will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be sounded at 2.25 p.m., so it is a two-hour lunch break. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.31 p.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of Re-Development at Sukuna Park 
<br/>(Question No. 99/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the status of Sukuna Park? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this issue has also been of  public interest 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I also wish to provide an update on the re-development of Sukuna Park in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This project Mr. Speaker, Sir, is of significant importance for the capital city.  The Sukuna 
<br/>Park has been named in honour of one of Fiji’s most revered leaders and Statesman; Ratu Sir Josefa 
<br/>Lalabalavu Vanayaliyali Sukuna.  The Park has long been a central feature of Suva offering a green 
<br/>space of leisure, cultural events and public gatherings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sukuna Park is a recreational space approved by the Suva City Council 
<br/>through the Ministry of Local Government.  The Council was able to partner with Auckland City 
<br/>Council in 2019 to understand multiple dimensions of municipal operations, one of the areas of study 
<br/>or review has been the recreational facilities management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  project  was  launched  with  the  goal  of  transforming  the  Park  into  a 
<br/>modern, multi-functional public space that meets the needs of Suva’s growing population and aligns 
<br/>with contemporary urban learning principles.  The re-development of Sukuna Park is a key initiative 
<br/>of the Suva City Council since 2020.  The objective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to improve the landscape, 
<br/>have a better podium to host events, increase foot traffic at the Park, improve lighting structure and 
<br/>introduce modern park furniture which is an increase of sitting, improved walkways and make the 
<br/>park smart through digital platforms such as charger booths and WiFi.  It is believed that this will 
<br/>enhance the Park’s functionality and statics while preserving its historical and cultural significance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project is self-funded by the Suva City Council with an initial budget 
<br/>of $13 million.  In 2020, the scope of work was altered to full re-development of the Park, including 
<br/>a two-level cafeteria; that was a concept of the previous administration.  However, Sir, the budget 
<br/>was  reduced  to  $7  million  with  a  decision  by  the  Special  Administrator  of  SCC  to  remove  the 
<br/></span><span>cafeteria. It is worth noting that a budget of $500,000 was allocated for landscaping purposes only.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  park  was  closed  by  the  SCC  towards  the  end  of  2021  to  allow  for 
<br/>demolition works and rehabilitation works. A consultant was engaged by Suva City Council who 
<br/>designed the initial master plan back then. However, in the first quarter of 2023, Suva City Council 
<br/>had engaged a new consultant; the revision of rehabilitation masterplan to reflect a modern Suva City 
<br/>Smart Park.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A new consultancy team was engaged and the construction of the podium began in June 2023. 
<br/></span><span>The sealworks were carried after the tender and evaluation by Suva City Council. These works were 
<br/></span><span>followed by building services and the landscape works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to update this 
<br/>august House, the project was completed last month. However, the contractors currently turning into 
<br/>defects  as  per  the  defects  liability  period,  as  such,  they  are  hoping  to  open  the  Sukuna  Park  re-
<br/>development project this month after the completion of the defects identified by the consultant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, the re-development of Sukuna Park represents a significant 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment  to  the  future  of  Suva  with  a  smart  city  concept.  The  provision  of  disabled  facilities 
<br/>indicates that no one is left behind for urban development. The Council has also further considered 
<br/>the importance of having security with CCTV cameras, fencing and provision of security at the park 
<br/>to avoid any criminal activities in the area. A newly developed Sukuna Park will also be strengthening 
<br/>the revenue streams of the Suva City Council through some commercial activities in partnership with 
<br/>several business houses as well as stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am confident that upon completion, Sukuna Park will stand as a testament 
<br/>to our commitment to creating a vibrant, sustainable and inclusive public space for all Fijians. Thank 
<br/>you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  allowing  me  to  respond  to  the  question  before  the  august  House  this 
<br/>afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question. I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  his  response.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  there  are  not  enough  parks  in  Suva  and  the 
<br/>surrounding areas. Two, the existing parks right now does not meet the needs of our people. Three, 
<br/>there is an urgent need to build multipurpose recreational centres in our community that is built for 
<br/>purpose and also for the future. My question to the honourable Minister, does he have this in his 
<br/>future plans?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.-  Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for raising a very 
<br/>important  issue  this  afternoon.  Some  of  the  concept  of  changing  the  way  we  do  things  in  our 
<br/>municipalities have also been shared with all our Special Administrators who currently manager the 
<br/>13 municipalities. In July last month the Tavua Town Council through its new Special Administration 
<br/>have opened a new park that is called the Family Park.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Family  Park,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  an  open  space  but  they  have  divided  up  into  three 
<br/>different spaces. One is to cater for the children’s park, the middle is where the family can go and 
<br/>gather while the children are playing and there is also a space just alongside those two spaces where 
<br/>they have dedicated for the senior citizens.  These are some of the new initiatives that we are doing 
<br/>at the moment, all the municipalities are inclusive in the designing and the re-designing of the current 
<br/>parks as well as some of the unutilised and underutilised open spaces that we have in most of these 
<br/>municipalities, especially in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also some unutilised spaces in Suva that we are also thinking of developing, and if 
<br/>you look at some of the recreational spaces, they are mostly open spaces.  There is no provision for 
<br/>them to have multipurpose courts while people are enjoying playing touch rugby, others can enjoy 
<br/></span><span>the other facility. These are some of the innovative plans that we are currently promoting with the 
<br/></span><span>Councils to ensure that when we come up with new designs of making use of the open spaces for the 
<br/>public, we have to be inclusive in the way we design some of these new recreational spaces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What about the one in Lami, that is a multipurpose one  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Sukuna  Park  was  designed  for  entertainment 
<br/>purposes, and mainly for the cruise liners that come to Suva. There was a purpose for that particular 
<br/>park mainly to entertain the working community, people who are in the office, et cetera, they can go 
<br/></span><span>to that park with their lunch and enjoy their lunch.  Part of that concept was this particular modern 
<br/></span><span>café. This café had a rooftop bar overlooking the ocean, and the back of the building had a stepwise 
<br/>pavilion, so people could sit and watch the entertainment happening at the podium.  When tourists 
<br/>come, they can also enjoy that facility, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  rather  saddened  that  this  particular  component  was  taken  away  as  part  of  the  re-
<br/>development plan.  We have just heard from honourable Naivalurua that anything you build is for a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purpose and for the future.  That particular structure was for the future.  I would like to know from 
<br/>the honourable Minister any reason why that particular structure was taken off considering that Suva 
<br/>City Council makes around $30 million every year from ratepayers and have sufficient money in its 
<br/>account.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for raising this 
<br/>question.  Maybe, she is right in her own way but if you look at Sukuna Park, it only is about 10,000 
<br/>square metres.  The green space that we have is not enough to cater for the population we have in 
<br/>Suva.  That is the very reason why I have also advised the Administrator to remove the cafeteria.  We 
<br/>need families to enjoy the green space, we want the kids to walk around freely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Entertainment to watch rugby. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Get the community to watch rugby. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  ...if  you  look  at  the  cost  factor,  initially  it  was  $13  million, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>removing the two-level cafeteria... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Build for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- ... reduced the cost to $7 million. The new Sukuna Park will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opened at the end of the month.  The people will enjoy using the Park.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I think he knows what I am going to ask him actually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Minister,  I  understand  what  you  are  doing,  even  with  the  shortfalls  that  are 
<br/>coming in, in terms of the development of the park.  Because you are going to put it in a particular 
<br/>pristine condition like Albert Park used to be, are you going to be setting certain ground rules and 
<br/>rules in terms of the usage and how it is kept so as we do not fall down that same trap that we have 
<br/>now at Albert Park where the vehicles are running around Albert Park? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Finance Minister give more money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  design  of  the  park  itself  has  enough 
<br/>walkways, where people can walk around the park.  I have also stated in my address that SCC also 
<br/>has plans to install CCTV cameras as well as have securities day and night to monitor the various 
<br/>activities around Sukuna Park and also ensure that the security and the safety of users are paramount 
<br/>when they utilise the park.  In any development there will always be a plan to maintain the quality  
<br/>and the standard of whatever plans that you have.  That is something that the Council also has in 
<br/></span><span>place to ensure that there is a plan in place to ensure that they maintain the Park at a level that is 
<br/></span><span>expected by the users and the general public.

<div><span>Young Entrepreneurship Scheme Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 100/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>Young Entrepreneurship Scheme Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Young  Entrepreneurship  Scheme 
<br/>Programme  is commonly known as YES Programme, and I have to admit that it was a construct of 
<br/>the previous government which we have continued to support for some very good reasons.  Firstly, 
<br/>it invests in our youths who have unique business ideas or innovative ideas, and the vision of which 
<br/>is to promote the entrepreneurial spirit in our young Fijians to become job creators rather than job 
<br/>seekers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since inception, the YES Programme has invested in about 18 recipients 
<br/>with  a total investment of about  $441,000 across a wide range of sectors from  health and human 
<br/>services, agriculture, traffic management, recreational services and information technology, just to 
<br/>name a few.  Each of these recipients offer a unique and innovative business idea that aims to improve 
<br/>upon the current service or product currently being offered in the market or offering something totally 
<br/>new to the people of Fiji.  The YES Programme offers up to a grant of about $30,000 for the purchase 
<br/>of  capital  expenditure  items,  and  the  eligibility  is  for  entrepreneurs  or  young  men  and  women 
<br/>between the age of 18 years and 40 years, and of course, has to be a Fiji citizen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme has some very interesting facts.  The success rate of this 
<br/>Programme is around 73 percent.  On average, a YES recipient creates about three jobs, on average, 
<br/>a  YES  recipient  has  a  total  turnover  of  close  to  $50,000.    In  the  year  2022  to  2023,  the  MSME 
<br/>Monitoring and Evaluation Team reported that four recipients were extremely active and performing 
<br/>at  an  excellent  level.    Of  course,  the  recipients  are  also  contributing  to  the  SDGs  by  fostering 
<br/>innovative business practices that promotes economic growth, social inclusion and environmental 
<br/>sustainability.  Not only commercial viability, but they also create a positive impact aligning with 
<br/>SDGs such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>SDG8 - Decent work and economic growth;  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>SDG9 - Industry innovation and infrastructure; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>SDG010 - Reduced inequalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Existing  YES  recipients  go  above  and  beyond  to  further  their  education  and  enrich  their 
<br/>knowledge, achieving personal growth and contributing to society.  Some of them end up being part 
<br/>of the Fiji Enterprise Engine cohorts, which is a very popular accelerator, incubator programme run 
<br/>through Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, there have been a few very prominent winners of the YES Programme.  I mentioned 
<br/>Christopher Vanualailai, who was named as one of the top 100 climate tax startups out of 10,000 
<br/>businesses assessed across the Indo-Pacific region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the other recipients that were supported this year included Rasalato Yanuyanurua of 
<br/>Aswhy Enterprises, who has transformed his business from exporting raw lumber to producing guitar 
<br/>billets and semi-finished guitar parts from mahogany. The young entrepreneur is now targeting high-
<br/></span><span>end  international  markets,  particularly  in  the  US  and  Canada,  showcasing  his  innovation  and 
<br/></span><span>determination in the new markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is Munesh Prasad of Cocosip, who is planning to launch premium packet coconuts by 
<br/>preparing and peeling coconuts into diamond shape pieces, having the top of the coconut flatten and 
<br/></span><span>adding a coconut opener that is sold in some of the major supermarkets and resorts. The business 
<br/></span><span>also plans to diversify their product to manufacture chip blocks made from coconut husks.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1400 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  these  demonstrates  the  type  of  innovation  that  exists  in  our  country  and  the 
<br/>Ministry plans to continue to encourage this culture of entrepreneurship in developing future aspiring 
<br/>entrepreneurs in the years to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  thought  I  just  mention,  and  I  have  mentioned  a  few  times  in  this  august 
<br/>Chamber, that this side of the House is trying to develop a comprehensive MSME ecosystem that 
<br/>ensures that we continue to support entrepreneurs in their journey.  As such, I just thought I would 
<br/>mention that there is about $300,000 sitting within TELS which is considered a Graduate Incubator 
<br/>Starter Programme in terms of a grant.  That will be used to actually assist our young entrepreneurs 
<br/>which is exciting and, at least, focused particularly on student graduates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, Mr. Speaker, to support our young entrepreneurs, the Ministry has established 
<br/>an  MSME  information  hub  at  the  Suva  Flea  Market  which  offers  assistance  to  MSMEs  and  has 
<br/>attracted many young people seeking information about the YES Programme.  Funding permitting, 
<br/>Sir, we hope to extend this out to other central locations across the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  been  one  of  the  recipients  of  this  very 
<br/>powerful programme, the YES Entrepreneurship Scheme, and I am glad to hear of all the successful 
<br/>stories that we have and it is so important  to  invest  in  our youth.  A question for the honourable 
<br/>Minister is, apart from the funding, is there any other multi-sectoral support in terms of, let us just 
<br/>say, “I was advised later on that I could use the $30,000 funding, put it through FDB, and I could get 
<br/>more out of it and get further assistance and that through low interest rates”? So, are there any more 
<br/>assistance, apart from the funding itself, provided to the recipients within the other Ministries? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  I  think  the  honourable  Sharma  has  answered  his  own 
<br/>question.  There  are  other  avenues  for  support  in  other  Ministries,  particularly  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture, Ministry of Rural and Development, Ministry of Youth and also Ministry of Women 
<br/>now has some support grants as well, Tourism has actually come up with a MSME grant. In actual 
<br/>fact, the total amounts that are now dedicated towards MSMEs is around $120 million in various 
<br/>forms, which includes the sugarcane farmers as well. So, that is quite a broad level of support that is 
<br/>happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is an exciting space because as we all know, 18 percent of GDP is represented 
<br/>by the MSMEs.  Not only that, it represents up to 60 percent of the jobs that are created in our country. 
<br/>So, that is why in terms of where this side of the House is headed, Sir, we are doing our best to really 
<br/>try  and  develop  this  ecosystem  to  ensure  that  over  the  next  couple  of  years,  we  do  create  a 
<br/></span><span>comprehensive ecosystem.  By that, Sir, I mean, just imagine if we start training our entrepreneurs 
<br/></span><span>from high school level before they get to university and beyond. Would that be an exciting prospect 
<br/>for our young people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  we  have  heard  you  speak  a  lot  about 
<br/>diversification,  et  cetera.  Can  you  tell  us  whether  in  terms  of  the  YES  Programme,  is  there  any 
<br/>specific programme within it which says that, “Alright, these are the areas that we need to diversify 
<br/>into”, and we are hunting down those young people that are in those areas that we can diversify into, 
<br/>whether it be exporting or whether it be producing something for our local markets?  Are we actually 
<br/></span><span>doing  that  so  that  we  can  diversify  with  our  young  people  because  they  do  end  up  being  quite 
<br/></span><span>successful entrepreneurs?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Thank  you  for  that  question.    Mr.  Speaker,  the  YES 
<br/>Programme is obviously targeted towards innovative ideas. By default, may be a lot of the ideas sit 
<br/>in the ICT space and also agricultural value-add processing. So, to the honourable Koya’s point, it 
<br/>starts creating that diversification that we all need in the economy.  There is a couple that comes to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mind - TraSeable Solutions.  They have been around for some time and are now developing solutions. 
<br/>A  local  couple,  developing  solutions  for  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  terms  of  IT  Solutions  for 
<br/>blockchain database design. I think they are now offering it to some of the other agencies. From what 
<br/>I hear, they are now in the Seychelles actually doing the same thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this is the level of entrepreneurship, Sir, that our young people are capable of.  It is quite 
<br/>an exciting thing to be watching and I think that if we provide the right level of resource, we provide 
<br/>the right training at the right time, we can see some very significant progress in this area, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Just  for  the  information  of  honourable  Members,  we  have  just  returned 
<br/>from a Parliamentary Meeting within the region. It was held in Indonesia, and Indonesia is renowned 
<br/>for MSMEs and all that. We were taken to a university where the overall start-up cost for MSMEs is 
<br/>so reduced that the students, straight away from university, go online and they are guided and helped 
<br/>by the universities.  I think some of them are being held now by what the Deputy Prime Minister has 
<br/>stated that some of the universities are helping out here, but this has reduced the start-up course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are well on their way to producing things straight into the online platform.  I am just 
<br/>sharing this since it has, kind of, ignited the interest on MSMEs because it is huge and promising for 
<br/>us here in Fiji because we just sell online.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the staff that we have now are going online and that is a great start.  But I do not 
<br/>know how they reduce their start-up cost by going that way.  I am just sharing that because that was 
<br/>one  of  the  things  that  struck  our  team  while  we  were  in  Indonesia.    We  were  amazed  by  the 
<br/>developments that Indonesia has undertaken right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fifth Oral Question for today has been moved to a later date.  That is the question by 
<br/>honourable Alvick Maharaj to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and 
<br/>Civil Aviation, who is now tied up with the preparation for the arrival of the President of the Republic 
<br/>of India.  As such, we will move that question to a later date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will go straight to the six Oral Question for today, honourable Members.  For that, I have 
<br/>also received communication from the Ministry of Finance, that this question should be redirected to 
<br/>the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  these  are  some  of  the  developments  that  has  come  during  question  time.    In  the 
<br/></span><span>Business Committee Meeting, we ask whether to accept these questions directed to the Ministers and 
<br/></span><span>we receive advice that the questions should be referred to another Minister.  However, we are getting 
<br/>communication  directly  from  the  Ministry,  asking  us  to  redirect  the  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1402 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for  allowing this change.  I was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not in the Business Committee, otherwise I would have raised it there, but thank you for allowing 
<br/>that.  I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Japanese Government has, over the years, offered financial assistance 
<br/>schemes  for  development  projects  designed  to  meet  diverse  needs  of  Fiji,  including  emergency 
<br/>assistance on resilience and recovery efforts to combat the aftermath of natural disasters or pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of Fiji acknowledges the assistance and support from the Government of 
<br/>Japan  over  the  years,  particularly  during  the  COVID-19  years  and  natural  disasters  where  the 
<br/>Government of Japan and other development partners provided immediate assistance to Fiji during 
<br/>that time when Fiji was in dire need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation (JICA) is the largest 
<br/>bilaterial lender to the Government of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, JICA provides grants and loan financing 
<br/>to Fiji, and it is the first development partner to provide concessional loan facility to the Government 
<br/>of Fiji.  So, JICA’s proposed financing is the standby loan for Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation 
<br/>- Phase 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, the Government was given Phase 1 of this standby loan for disaster 
<br/>recovery and the amount was FJ$80 million.  The proposed standby loan for Disaster Recovery and 
<br/>Rehabilitation is the continuation of the Phase 1 to Phase 2 and this was endorsed by Cabinet on 15</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>July. This facility provided by JICA is, again, to $72 million and is part of the Government’s loan 
<br/>funding programme for this fiscal year 2024 -2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  loan,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  JICA  is  to  promote  economic  stabilisation  and 
<br/>development  effects,  in  particular  enhancing  the  capacity  of  Disaster  Risk  Management.  The 
<br/>principal amount offered by the Japanese Government for such a facility is 0.25 percent of Gross 
<br/>Domestic Product (GDP).  In the case of Fiji, 0.25 percent of GDP was applied. However, noting 
<br/>Fiji’s vulnerability to natural disasters, the Japanese Government offered a standby loan facility in 
<br/>the amount US$46 million, equivalent FJ$72 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financing facility is actually pegged to achievement to policy reform 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actions on three key action areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Understanding disaster risk and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  the  Policy  Reform  Actions  will  be  achieved  in  a  coordinated  approach  between  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>National Disaster Management Office (NDMO);    
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Meteorological Office under the Ministry of Rural Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Municipal Council and City Council under the Ministry of Local Government; and  
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Mineral Resources Division under the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This standby loan facility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a very concessional loan with some of the most 
<br/>favourable terms the Fijian Government has received with an interest rate of 0.4 percent per annum 
<br/>and a 40 year repayment term after a 10-year grace period.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1403 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pre-condition for the draw-down of this loan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, (this is an emergency 
<br/>provision), is that a Declaration of a State of Natural Disaster Post-Disaster by Cabinet on the advice 
<br/>of  the  National  Disaster  Management  Council  in  accordance  with  section  17(1)  of  the  Natural 
<br/>Disaster Management Act 1998.  So, this loan, Sir, is contingent upon that condition being met after 
<br/>disaster had struck, after the Cabinet has declared it as a national disaster and conditioned on sound 
<br/>macro-economic and public financial management strategy.

<div><span>Subdivision of Informal Settlements on State Land 
<br/>(Question No. 103/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the informal settlements on State land that have been subdivided since January 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>The Ministry of Housing has acquired development leases for the Ministry of Lands to develop four 
<br/>informal settlements that are located on State land.  These are Cuvu in Sigatoka, Sasawira in Nausori, 
<br/>River Road in Nasinu, as well as Wainicaubati in Nasinu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of the four settlements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sasawira Settlement is located at 9 Miles which 
<br/>has an area of 17.3 acres.  River Road in Narere has an area of 26.2 acres and Caubati, normally 
<br/>called Mama’s Place, with an area of 21.5 acres, and are currently undergoing planning works.  These 
<br/>settlements,  including  three  other  settlements  on  iTLTB  land,  are  earmarked  for  completion  of 
<br/>construction phase by the end of this year, before progressing into construction phase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the completion of development for three informal settlements on State land 
<br/>will benefit 769 households.  The total estimated cost to upgrade these settlements is approximately 
<br/>$21 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cuvu Settlement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with an area of 9.3 acres, has had its construction works 
<br/>completed  in  2022.    This  included  drainage,  roads,  footpaths,  paddings  and  installation  of  basic 
<br/>utilities.    Due  to  a  number  of  disagreements  between  the  residents  of  Cuvu,  the  survey  plan  was 
<br/>amended and redefined to accommodate the request of the residents and the amended survey plan 
<br/>was approved in December 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  early 2024, the Ministry of Housing started the lot allocation process 
<br/></span><span>through the distribution of application forms to sitting residents.  The process is in accordance with 
<br/>the  Lot  Allocation  Policy.    The  allocation  of  the  lots  was  successfully  carried  out  by  Lomara 
<br/>Associates  to  determine  the market  value of  each lot.  The information  collected from applicants 
<br/>enabled  the  Lot  Allocation  Committee  to  identify  those  households  who  were  eligible  for 
<br/>Government assistance.  The total cost to complete development of Cuvu Settlement is $3.7 million.  
<br/>For the completion of the lot allocation process, 105 households of Cuvu will be able to legally own 
<br/>house blocks with a 99-year lease title.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in Cuvu last week and I was told by the tenants 
<br/></span><span>that the honourable Minister assured that the leases will be issued to the tenants.  May I know what 
<br/>is holding up the issuance of the leases because he also made a public statement in the media as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  I  have  stated  that  there  were  some  differences  regarding  the 
<br/>boundaries of some of the existing current residents, so the Ministry went in and  amended the scheme 
<br/>plan and also got the survey plan approved.  With Cuvu, there are some residents who have also been

<div><span>given the agreement for lease, and something that we have also issue that we have had with iTLTB 
<br/>on who is going to allocate the lease; iTLTB or the Ministry of Housing?  So, that is an issue we are 
<br/>trying to resolve with the iTLTB before issuing the leases to the current residents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Honourable  Minister,  you  did  mention  Sasawira.    I  took  a  cab 
<br/>yesterday and the owner of the taxi lives in Sasawira, and he asked me if I can raise this question in 
<br/>Parliament.  For him, they are waiting but there is a request from them, the road condition is so bad. 
<br/>He asked me if I can ask, “please confirm with the honourable Minister if they can do something 
<br/>about the road condition while waiting for the other developments.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I think there is some funding that we have allocated this year to 
<br/>assist  those  informal  settlements  who  have  issues  regarding  the  basic  services  and  infrastructure 
<br/>because the request is now raised in  Parliament, we will try and look into that honourable Member, 
<br/>and try to assist the residents of Sasawira. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I hope you will not mind honourable Minister because people are already 
<br/>there, they are sitting there.  That is why the road conditions has worsened because they use it all the 
<br/>time, but that is part of the development.

<div><span>Supply Chain Agreement Under IPEF 
<br/> (Question No. 104/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>Implementation of the Supply Chain Agreement under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 
<br/>(IPEF) for Prosperity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Tuiwailevu for the question and in 
<br/>case the House is wondering why I am so excited on giving an update, in my mind,  Mr. Speaker, the 
<br/>implementation of IPEF and the benefits that are potentially can accrue from IPEF is the reason why 
<br/>I will hopefully continue to update the House because there are some promising opportunities that 
<br/>lie at the heart of IPEF, should Fiji continue to be an active member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  all  know,  firstly I  would  like  to  thank  the  House  for  unanimously  approving  IPEF 
<br/></span><span>together, and I had the honour of attending the last meeting in Singapore with the honourable Premila 
<br/></span><span>Kumar.  Basically Mr. Speaker, since the approval  in  September of last year of the  IPEF Supply 
<br/>Chain  Agreement,  the  14  partners  that  make  up  40  percent  of  the  global  GDP  had  been  actively 
<br/>working together to try and get the agreement going.  The agreement officially entered into force on 
<br/>the  24</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2024  and  of  course  on  30</span><span>th</span><span>  July  marked  a  significant  milestone  with 
<br/>implementation of the agreement where we started putting in place the necessary committees that are 
<br/>part and parcel of the Supply Chain Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Supply  Chain  Agreement,  hopefully,  will  allow  the  14  countries  to  start 
<br/></span><span>working together in terms of supply requirements across the countries and it is my hope that should 
<br/></span><span>there be another crisis in the global supply chain, that the 14 countries including Fiji can work closely 
<br/>together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are three bodies Mr. Speaker that were required to be set up as part of the IPEF Supply 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chain Agreement.  These were the:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Supply Chain Council; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Crisis Response Network; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Labour Rights Advisory Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, Fiji in terms of trying to be an active participant in IPEF has actually put its 
<br/>hand up in serving on the Supply Chain Council and we have the Permanent Secretary for Trade and 
<br/>Co-operatives, MSME and Communications, Mr. Shaheen Ali on the Supply Chain Council.  In the 
<br/>Crisis Response Network, the Principal Trade Economist, Ms. Deepika Singh is a member of that 
<br/>Crisis Network body.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  Labour  Rights  Advisory  Board,  I  am  also  happy  to  report  that  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations, Mr. Jone Maretino Nemani, who 
<br/>is no stranger to most of us, will serve on the Labour Rights Advisory Board.  He is joined by Mr. 
<br/>Felix Anthony, the National Secretary of the Trade Union Congress and Mr. Jonetani Tonawai, Chief 
<br/>Executive of the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also probably significant to note, Mr. Speaker, that in discussions with some of the major 
<br/>partners in IPEF, Fiji has been invited to be the Vice Chair on the Labour Rights Advisory Board 
<br/>(LRAB) and so the Permanent Secretary for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations will 
<br/>serve as Vice Chair on LRAB, supporting the Chair from the United States of America.  This role 
<br/>underscores our commitment to strengthening labour relations and labour rights, and ensuring fair 
<br/>working conditions for all workers across the Indo-Pacific region, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Fiji’s election as 
<br/>Vice Chair of the Labour Rights Advisory Board is a recognition of the important role Fiji plays in 
<br/>the region, and our capability was clearly demonstrated during the ongoing IPEF negotiations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Vice Chair of the Labor Rights Advisory Board, Fiji will play a pivotal role in advancing 
<br/>labour rights and workforce development across IPEF supply chains. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have 
<br/>further plans in terms of the advancement of the implementation of the supply chain agreement which 
<br/>includes first in-person meeting in Washing DC in September 2024.  The meeting is part of a supply 
<br/>chain summit organised by the United States Department of Commerce and Fiji’s representatives 
<br/>will make most of the opportunity to progress the benefits for Fiji through the three bodies that I have 
<br/>mentioned under the IPEF supply chain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also have the Solicitor-General’s Office and FICAC attend the summit as Pillar 4 on 
<br/>fair economy will also be discussed.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is proud to be at the forefront of this 
<br/>initiative.  By working alongside with global players, we are committed to ensuring the security and 
<br/></span><span>competitiveness of our critical supply chains. Through participation in such initiatives, we aim to 
<br/></span><span>drive economic growth, improve living standards, and create are more resilient and prosperous future 
<br/>for our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, can you just give us a quick rundown on what is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the TOR for the Supply Chain Council?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I do not have the TOR in front of me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but 
<br/>it is really  to just look at the fair labour relations across the 14 countries, and discuss issues that have 
<br/></span><span>relevance towards industrial relations and try and build a common working environment across its 
<br/></span><span>jurisdiction. As you know, various countries are at different levels in terms of their labour relations, 
<br/>so this is an endeavour to actually have open discussions amongst the 14 in the IPEF family and 
<br/>continue to improve labour relations across all jurisdictions.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1406 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. My 
<br/>question to you honourable Minister is, what are some of the activities that will be undertaken to 
<br/>enhance Fiji’s supply chain capabilities?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Basically, the way IPEF is conducting, the forward progress 
<br/>is  there  are  various  elements.  There  are  elements  around  capacity  building,  which  was  actually 
<br/>initiated by Fiji as a major component of IPEF.  Before Fiji’s participation, it was not really there as 
<br/>a need.  There will be a lot of capacity building, there will be a lot of sharing information particularly 
<br/>in terms of the capabilities of some of the countries in terms of supply chain support.  By virtue of 
<br/>the relationship, we hope to see more closer working together in terms of getting cheaper imports, 
<br/>for example. That is the type of relationship building that may result from IPEF and we will be keen 
<br/>to progress as we go along.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land Transport Authority – RSL Number Plates 
<br/>(Question No. 105/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform  Parliament  why  LTA  is  holding  on  to  the  RSL  number  plates  for  those  providers 
<br/>whose approval has been given and are already providing the service? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform  Parliament that all 
<br/>road users, vehicle owners, passengers and permit holders of public services vehicles are governed 
<br/>by  the  Land  Transport  Act    1998  and  its  corresponding  regulations  under  the  Land  Transport 
<br/>Regulation 2000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to the question, I would like to advise the honourable Member that effective 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>January, 2018, the LTA ceased issuing Rural Service Licenses (RSL) following amendments to the 
<br/>Land Transport Public Service Vehicle Regulation.  Regulation 18A sub-regulation (6)(d) specifies 
<br/>that  an  RSL  issued  before  this  date  is  deemed  either  minibus  permit  or  a  road  permit  for  carrier 
<br/>licenses, depending on the vehicle’s construction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since then, the LTA has been converting valid RSLs issued prior to 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2018 into 
<br/>either mini-bus license or carrier license based on the vehicle type.  To- date, a total of 460 RSL 
<br/>permits have been converted, with this process continuing during annual registration or renewals for 
<br/></span><span>those RSL holders who have not yet completed the conversion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  reassure  the  honourable  Members  that  LTA  is  diligently  processing  the 
<br/>conversion of all RSLs into other minibus licenses (LM) or carrier licenses (LC) and is committed to 
<br/>facilitating this transition.  All permit holders are encouraged to visit any LTA branch to complete 
<br/>the conversion and obtain the necessary number plates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- The initial question came out of a complaint from a RSL provider, Sir, that 
<br/>despite providing all the relevant documents, some of the RSL providers have not been paid.  This 
<br/></span><span>has been happening for some time, we have received a number of complaints.  Why is it so, Sir?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I can look into that specific case, but as I mentioned, from the  
<br/>initially issued 460 RSLs, only eight have yet to be converted. That is the process which the LTA is 
<br/>currently going through in terms of the process when they are coming up for their license renewal.  I 
<br/>am not sure about that case, maybe it is included, but we can look into it.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1407 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Are you sure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- He needs the specific details. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you satisfied honourable Virendra Lal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to confirm with the honourable Minister, 
<br/>only eight left from the 460, after that there will be no more RSLs?  They will be fully converted to 
<br/>LM and LC? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will make that the last supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  answers,  but 
<br/>looking at issuing of RSL to twin cabs, these were given to a few twin cabs like in Levuka and Ra 
<br/>where  the  road  condition  was  not  good,  where  a  normal  carrier  cannot  go.    I  believe  these  RSL 
<br/>permits are not being renewed.  Can the honourable Minister throw light on this, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to check on those specific ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is okay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Who raised the question, you, honourable Nath?  Honourable Bala is saying 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>okay.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is alright, since the honourable Minister has agreed that 
<br/>he will probably provide the answers later.  That is alright with me because I understand, given the 
<br/>landscape of few places where normal carriers cannot go, and he is aware too.  I remember him asking 
<br/>a similar question when he was this side of Parliament.  Probably, he will come back with the answer 
<br/>at a later stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Impacts of the PALM Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 106/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations 
<br/>update  Parliament  on  the  impacts  of  the  Pacific  Australia  Labour  Mobility  Programme 
<br/>towards children of workers engaged in this Programme and what is the Ministry doing to 
<br/>address these challenges? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government sees the PALM Scheme 
<br/>and the New Zealand Seasonal Work Scheme as initiatives for economic benefits, empowerment and 
<br/>sustainable development through increased remittances and skills  enhancements  to  strengthen the 
<br/></span><span>economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  labour  mobility  for  our  unskilled  Fijian  workers  offers  a  means  for 
<br/>individuals to access employment opportunities, acquire new skills and generate income to support 
<br/>their families and communities, including children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1408 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour mobility schemes have a positive impact on children of workers by 
<br/>providing  them  with  access  to  better  education,  financial  stability  and  opportunities  for  personal 
<br/>growth and development.  Amidst the economic opportunities and contributions generated by labour 
<br/>programmes, there exists significant challenges on children’s welfare and protection not only in Fiji, 
<br/>but globally as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, children face multiple challenges due to labour mobility, such as prolonged 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>family separations, educational challenges, social isolation, emotional stress and lack of stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, children left behind by their parents engaged under such schemes are, at 
<br/>least, being neglected and exploited due to economic pressures put on them under the care of a single 
<br/>parent or guardians.  The absence of proper care and support exposes children to limited accessibility 
<br/>to education and healthcare.  A small number of parents also get involve in extra-marital affairs and 
<br/>neglect their families back at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that we address the issue, to ensure that benefits of labour 
<br/>mobility  do  not  come  at  the  expense  of  the  vulnerable  children,  emphasising  the  need  for 
<br/>comprehensive social policies and support systems to protect the children from abuse and neglect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, through my Ministry, is currently taking crucial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>steps to address this issue.  These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  expansion  of  the  four  days  pre-departure  briefing  into  two  weeks  to  be  more 
<br/>comprehensive and includes spouses, as well as caregiver participation and family focus 
<br/>sessions on family welfare and communication. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Reviewing client registration forms to include information on children of workers under 
<br/>the  care  of  parents  left  behind  or  guardians  to  strengthen  our  data  collection,  enabling 
<br/>effective monitoring on children who may be exposed to vulnerable situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Review the recruitment and selection process to discourage the participation of both parents 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)   The role of appointed Country Liaison  Officers in  attending  to  cases where workers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disengage from their families and the provision for pastoral care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)   Conducting financial literacy programmes which the families of workers can actively 
<br/>participate in, to ensure that remittances are managed effectively and contribute to the 
<br/>long-term wellbeing of the children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)   Establishing networks with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection and 
<br/></span><span>the Legal Aid Commission to provide the necessary support to children of spouses of 
<br/></span><span>disengaged labour mobility workers. The Fiji Council of Social Services representatives 
<br/>is also on our National Employment Centre Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)   Encouraging workers engaged under long-term to visit their families back home during 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the four-week break in December. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (8)   Participation of the recent Family Accompaniment Programme for August 2024, which 
<br/>is a step forward for Fijian PALM workers to take their families to Australia, reducing 
<br/>the impact of prolonged separation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  along  with  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  held  information 
<br/></span><span>sessions with 82 interested families two weeks ago. Under the conditions of this visa, spouses will 
<br/>have full work rights while in Australia and children can attend local public schools without paying 
<br/>international student fee. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1409 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Australian Federal Government’s recent announcement on establishing 
<br/>a world-first Workplace Justice Visa, allowing migrant workers, including labour mobility workers, 
<br/>who have been exploited at work, to extent their visa and seek justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the good news continues.  Last week also saw the introduction of a new 
<br/>stronger  protections  against  visa  cancellation  for  workers  when  they  have  been  subjected  to 
<br/>workplace  wrongdoings.  No  longer  will  workers  need  to  make  the  difficult  choice  between 
<br/>maintaining their visa and seeking justice at work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, redeployment in the same industry is now also possible, which was not there 
<br/>in the past. Why I am saying all these things, Sir, workers normally abscond or run away when they 
<br/>are ill-treated at the workplace, and they do not get justice. Now, all these is going to prevent them 
<br/>from getting into anything illegal because they have their rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these is because of the continuous dialogue we have been having with 
<br/>the Australian authorities and the relevant stakeholders during our ministerial visits. Had this been 
<br/>done several years earlier, by now, this problem would probably have been mitigated…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- …much further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- It hurts you because you didn’t do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Washing the hog now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to effectively protect children in the context of labour 
<br/>mobility collaboration amongst Government, Civil Society Organisations and stakeholders is crucial. 
<br/>Comprehensive strategies are needed to safeguard children’s rights and address risks from family 
<br/>separation due to labour mobility engagements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now in the process of establishing a working group of relevant stakeholders to monitor 
<br/>and resolve problems faced by the children of our workers. In this instance, again, the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Women, Children and Social Protection, as well as the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, will be included. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  above  strategies  put  in  place  will  assist  the  Government  to  prevent 
<br/>children from being harmed in any way due to prolonged absence of parents and seeks to ensure that 
<br/>children remain safe and supported and connected with their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, UNICEF and the Government of Vanuatu hosted a meeting of the labour 
<br/>sending  countries  on  16th  July  and  17th  July,  to  discuss  a  report  done  by  Academics  from  the 
<br/>University of Western Sydney as well as USP, on the negative impact of the Scheme on children that 
<br/></span><span>are left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  discussed  measures  to  be  put  in  place  for  the  prevention  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mitigation of this impact.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcome document should be ready in the coming weeks and then I will 
<br/>also be able to present a full Ministerial Statement on further studies that we will employ to prevent 
<br/>the negative impact on children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister for that very detailed reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I would like to take this time to introduce a housekeeping matter and, 
<br/>that is, for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times.  I now 
<br/>call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
