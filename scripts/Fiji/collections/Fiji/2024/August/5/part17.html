<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>SUGAR CANE GROWERS FUND 2019 AND 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fund 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Sugar Cane  Growers  Fund is a statutory body 
<br/>providing affordable loans to sugar cane growers in Fiji with the aim to increase the production of 
<br/>sugar cane, improve efficiency in planting, growing, harvesting and the transportation of sugar cane, 
<br/>also rehabilitate farms and farm buildings and other installations, the damaged, destroyed or affected 
<br/>by floods, cyclones and droughts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee upon being referred with the SCGF 2019 and 2020 Annual 
<br/>Reports undertook site visits to the Western and Northern Divisions and also received public hearing 
<br/>from the Fund headed by the Chief Executive Officer to gather information on the Fund operational 
<br/>dynamics as part of the Committee’s scrutiny process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Committee scrutinized the Report, it identified pertinent issues of concern such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Annual Reports provided by the SCGF failed to include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
<br/></span><span>for the periods under review. These indicators are essential for the Committee to make more 
<br/></span><span>informed recommendations and to gauge the performance of the organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Various  assistance programmes provided by the Ministry  of  Sugar other than SCGF to 
<br/>assist sugarcane farmers in improving their production and quality of cane. For example, 
<br/>Sugarcane  Development  and  Farmers  Assistance,  Weedicide  and  Fertilizer  subsidy, 
<br/>funding to improve Cane Access Roads, subsidy to purchase mechanical harvesters, grants

<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to encourage new farmers in the Sugar Sector and Cane Cartage Grant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Utilizing rail transport for cane would prove significantly more cost-effective compared to 
<br/>the current practice of using trucks. Trucks rely heavily on fuel and are subject to escalating 
<br/>fuel prices and contribute to road congestion and cause road damage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Committee  in  its  Review  Report  articulated  eight  findings  with 
<br/>recommendations in which the Ministry of Sugar has responded and provide assurance that the Fund 
<br/>will be working in implementing the recommendations to enhance sustainability and efficiency of 
<br/>the Fund and other sugar sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is satisfied with the Annual Reports during the review period. However, we 
<br/>note  that  there  are  certain  areas  that  can  be  improved  through  more  enhanced  coordination, 
<br/>commitment, and accountability of all sugar sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  The  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  and  before  allowing  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members to take the floor, I have a list from the Whips as well:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Multi Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S. Nand; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this motion.  
<br/>When cane farmers face financial distress or hardship, they rely on the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>for their welfare. The Growers Fund provides loans to the cane farmers for personal use and also to 
<br/>increase  sugar  production,  improve  efficiency  and  crop  diversification.  The  Sugar  Cane  Growers 
<br/>Fund  established  with  farmers  money  holds  a  90.6  percent  stake  in  South  Pacific  Fertilizers  Pte. 
<br/>Limited managed by the Growers Fund Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite Government assistance and funding from the Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/>Fund, cane production is declining and there is little crop diversification, and we know the key reason 
<br/>here is the cost of production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee scrutinized all the reports, and they came up with several 
<br/></span><span>recommendations but today I will speak specifically on four recommendations which was made by 
<br/></span><span>the Committee. Two of these recommendations focused on South Pacific Fertilizers Pte Limited and 
<br/>this  is  to  improve  its  financial  performance  and  invest  in  diversified  products  including  the 
<br/>production of natural fertilizers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is baffling, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the fertiliser company has not ventured into diversified 
<br/>products to become financially viable.  They still import and blend fertilisers failing to meet farmers’ 
<br/>demand, farmers need fertilisers tailored to the soil types, but what they get is not based on the soil 
<br/>type.  In all these, I question what Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) is doing?  They need to be 
<br/></span><span>there to see the effectiveness of these fertilisers when they are applied on the farm.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The South Pacific Fertilizers Limited has not made any effort to produce natural fertilisers 
<br/>using  locally  available  resources  like  chicken  manure,  et  cetera,  despite  high  prices  of  imported 
<br/>fertilisers.  Over the years, South Pacific Fertilizers Limited missed the opportunity to become the 
<br/>primary supplier of fertilisers to the non-sugar sector.  The company could have built a trusted brand 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for  farmers  across  all  farming  needs,  instead  it  relies  on  Government  subsidies  indirectly  to  stay 
<br/>afloat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the real issue lies with the Sugar Cane Growers Board of Directors, past and 
<br/>present. The question is, why have they allowed South Pacific Fertilizers Limited to remain stagnant? 
<br/>Is it because Sugar Cane Growers Fund continues to receive dividends at taxpayer’s expense? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also recommended that the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act 
<br/>be reviewed to expand its financial products to non-sugar farmers, making it a financial facility for 
<br/>every  farmer  needing  assistance.    This  diversification  would  generate  profits,  benefitting  cane 
<br/>farmers through broader agricultural support at reduced interest rates or even grants.  It is encouraging 
<br/>to note that the Ministry of Sugar is pursuing in this direction, leveraging the expertise of the current 
<br/>CEO who is a former banker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  noted  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund  Act’s  limitation, 
<br/>restricting loans during emergencies such as natural disasters.  In this regard, the Ministry of Sugar 
<br/>proposed  a  solution  through  the  Master  Award,  but  it  was  turned  down  by  the  Sugar  Industry 
<br/>Tribunal, citing that Sugar Cane Growers Fund cannot be given preference.  This narrow thinking 
<br/>has no place in an industry facing insolvency.  Fiji’s sugar industry is in crisis which is well-known 
<br/>by all of us, but it is propped up by past and present government assistance without addressing the 
<br/>fundamental problem.  Merely keeping it on life support, each year more taxpayer money is poured 
<br/>into  this  failing  system  with  no  change  to  the  status  quo.    This  is  not  a sustainable  solution,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the new financial year, the Government committed over $68 million to the sugar sector.  
<br/>Will this money improve sugar production?  Will it yield the results we hope for?  These are the 
<br/>questions  that  we  are  posing.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  sugar  industry’s  troubles  are  worsened  when 
<br/>politicians see the sugar sector as their world bank, engaging in blame games and fill good speeches. 
<br/>Sugar institutions instead of improving sugar production are engaged in political manoeuvring for 
<br/>their survival, obstructing essential reforms as seen during the consultations for the Sugar Bill that 
<br/>was introduced by the previous government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, the Government has decided to spend $200,000 on the Fiji Sugar 
<br/>Cane Growers Council elections.  Rather than taking politics out of the sugar sector and focusing on 
<br/>commercial viability, this Government is injecting politics back into the system at the expense of 
<br/>taxpayers who are paying for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  This  move  undermines  the  reforms  our  sugar  industry  desperately 
<br/>needs.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  sugar  industry  has  not  undergone  necessary  reforms  due  to  these 
<br/>obstructions.  The previous government's gradual reform to remove politics and establish the industry 
<br/>on a business model must continue. We can no longer afford to spend millions of taxpayer dollars 
<br/>each year on inefficient farmers, millers, and sugar institutions established during the colonial era. 
<br/>We cannot expect these institutions to become efficient and productive under the current structure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  industry  structure  was  designed  for  a  different  era,  characterized  by 
<br/>guaranteed sugar prices under the Lome and Cotonou Agreements. Trade dynamics have changed, 
<br/>yet we expect these colonial-era institutions to perform well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  we  must  learn  from  countries  like  Mauritius,  which  have  consolidated, 
<br/>modernized  and  diversified  under  the  new  Sugar  Efficiency Act.  The  mills  have  diversified  into 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>electricity generation, ethanol production and rum.  Our learned Minister has been visiting Mauritius 
<br/>quite a bit and we are looking forward to whatever learnings he has received through his study tour, 
<br/>he will be able to implement and bring the industry to a profitable level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all sugar institutions should assist farmers and treat them like kings. Some 
<br/>of these organisations do not efficiently serve the farmers, leaving them to run around to get their 
<br/>matters sorted and this is something we experienced during our field visit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, these institutions exist because of the farmers' hard-earned money.  Under 
<br/>the Master Award, 70 percent of sugar sales revenue goes to the farmers, and 30 percent to the miller. 
<br/>From the miller’s allocation, SRIF gets some component.  Unfortunately, FSC still owes more than 
<br/>$5 million to SRIF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  before  I  take  my  seat,  the  only  way  forward  and  I  want  to  emphasise  to 
<br/>prevent  the  imminent  collapse  of  the  sugar  industry  is  through  consolidation,  modernisation  and 
<br/>diversification.  I do understand that the Ministry of Sugar is in the process of hiring a consultant to 
<br/>dive deeper into all these problems and come up with some solutions.  We look forward to working 
<br/>with the Government in trying to address some of these problems which is encountered by the sugar 
<br/>sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  support  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic 
<br/>Affairs Committee Report on the Consolidated Review Reports of Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019 
<br/>and 2020 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I must commend the Board, the CEO, the management and staff for the 
<br/>remarkable transformation of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund that had gone under in the recent years 
<br/>under the leadership of its CEO, Mr. Raj Sharma and his new Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  notable  achievements  include  enhancement  of  the  Governance  Framework 
<br/>through the implementation of the various policies including the Compliance Risk Management and 
<br/>Audit.  It also includes the continuous review of the products and services, the introduction of a new 
<br/>technology platform and deepening the engagement with the growers and stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  applaud  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  its 
<br/>commitment  to  the  international  initiatives  as  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.    A  notable 
<br/>programme  is  the  Green  Cane  Incentive  which  was  recently  launched  complimenting  the 
<br/></span><span>Government’s incentives for the supply of green cane.  Under this initiative, the farmers will harvest 
<br/></span><span>75 percent or more of the green cane, receive a 2 percent deduction in interest from 6 percent to 4 
<br/>percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund has  repositioned itself both, 
<br/>within and outside of the sugar industry.  This is evident from the participation and the success of the 
<br/>Fiji Business Excellence Award for the last three consecutive years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  mindful  of  the  legislation  faced  by  Sugarcane  Growers  Fund  in  extending  credit 
<br/></span><span>services  to  both,  the  sugar  and  non-sugar  sectors.  The  Fund’s  strategic  intent  is  to  diversify  and 
<br/></span><span>expand  its  function  for  a  greater  sustainability  which  is  commendable.  In  this  context,  the  Asian 
<br/>Development Bank was engaged to conduct a debt analysis and develop a roadmap for the Sugarcane 
<br/>Growers Fund to potentially become a licensed financial institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sugarcane  Growers  Fund’s  intentions  is  to  diversify  its  balance  sheet  to  absorb  the 
<br/>unexpected shocks, such as natural disasters and to generate returns to the benefit of sugar which is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>noted and encouraged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugarcane Growers Fund is self-funded and concessionary that were 
<br/>surpluses. It has potential to evolve into a dynamic financial institution, operating on a commercial 
<br/>or semi-commercial basis, with the benefits accruing to the sugar sector as its core founders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also raises concern about the financial performance of the South Pacific Fertilizer 
<br/>Company  which  the  Sugarcane  Growers  Fund  holds  90  percent  of  shares.  We  are  informed  that 
<br/>appropriate actions are taken to address these issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must inform Parliament that consultants engaged to the 
<br/>Food and Agriculture Organization are currently conducting a comprehensive study on the sugarcane 
<br/>industry.  I  want  to  put  on  record  my  sincere  appreciation  to  honourable  Sakiusa  Tubuna  for 
<br/>facilitating our request for FAO at no cost to the Government of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  study,  Mr.  Speaker,  aims  to  identify  current  and  the  future  barriers  to  the  sugar 
<br/>production and provide a policy recommendation to revitalise the industry.  While there are concerns 
<br/>over the decline in sugarcane production, despite the availability of the funds from the Sugarcane 
<br/>Growers Fund and the various assistance from the Ministry of Sugar Industry. The FAO report is 
<br/>expected  to  provide  valuable  guidance  in  the  development  of  the  comprehensive  policy  for  the 
<br/>industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this report will be presented to us by end of October, to Parliament as 
<br/>well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our sugar industry faces a wide range of challenge from social and economic 
<br/>to  environment  forces.  A  deep  understanding  of  this  challenges  is  essential  to  appreciate  the 
<br/>industry’s performance.  The outcome of the study will offer a clear direction and strategies for the 
<br/>future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry has been and will continue to be a significant contributor to the economic 
<br/>growth and development of this nation building. The Sugarcane Growers Fund and its subsidy - SPFL 
<br/>both has vital roles within and beyond the industry’s economic drivers, especially with the ongoing 
<br/>reform of the Sugarcane Growers Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would like to just add on to what honourable Premila 
<br/>has said about the South Pacific Fertilizers and trying to get poultry manure, et cetera, I have initiated 
<br/>the programme and we  have been talking to  Goodman Fielder, Ram Sami and Sons and Rooster 
<br/></span><span>Poultry.    They  are  coming  on  board  to  help  the  Sugar  Research  Institute  and  also  the  fertilizer 
<br/></span><span>company to see how we can bring in new fertilizer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for 
<br/>their contribution and deliberation. Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before the House. Our 
<br/>farmers are the centre of the industry and apart from land leases, the biggest challenge our farmers 
<br/>face is high cost of production. The Sugarcane Growers Fund plays a very vital role in ensuring that 
<br/></span><span>funds are available to the farmers in terms of farm development, in terms of production, and also for 
<br/></span><span>their private and personal issues, for example, family issues or medical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would have loved to see a bit of expansion in the loans on types of loans that have been 
<br/>issued  to  our  farmers.    The  Fund’s  services  need  to  be  streamlined,  and  there  are  three  or  four 
<br/>institutions that are providing services to our farmers.  All these institutions should have a holistic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1427 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approach, so the farmer gets consolidated information from all the people - everyone sings the same 
<br/>song tune.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that apart from providing loans to our farmers, we should ensure that they are 
<br/>capable of managing their finances.  Therefore, workshops and seminars on financial management 
<br/>should be the core focus of the Sugarcane Growers Fund, so that our farmers’ capacities is developed 
<br/>and enhanced.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because of our land size and farm size, not all the farmers are able to mechanise, are not able 
<br/>to invest in machinery, therefore, the Sugarcane Growers Fund should exploring options where they 
<br/>can get for smallholder farms tractors that are walk-behind tractors, inputs that can be attached to 
<br/>this, so that the cost of production on the farm decreases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The biggest cost of production on the farm is labour and the inputs.  Farmers barely make a 
<br/>living out of the cane farm.  If mechanisation is done, if the farms are mechanised, efficiency  on the 
<br/>farm will increase.  The farmer will be able to get more done in a lesser amount of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The operations on the farm will increase and there will be a consistent in quality.   Labour 
<br/>savings would be another big savings on the farm. Initially, it will be a high cost of investment, but 
<br/>if you spread it over a period time, the farmer wins in terms of savings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The machinery can also be used for diversification.  We should strongly encourage our cane 
<br/>farmers to diversify.  They should not totally stick to cane production.  They should diversify into 
<br/>cash crop production, livestock production, so that each component can complement each other and 
<br/>enhance the farmers’ income.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  objective  should  be  to  ensure  that  our  farmers  have  a  sustainable 
<br/>livelihood and that our national agriculture throughput is improved, be it sugar or be it other crops. I 
<br/>believe  the  sugar  industry  has  the  potential  to  grow,  but  together  with  it,  the  other  agricultural 
<br/>commodities  have  a  potential  to  grow  and  I  would  love  to  see  that  the Sugarcane  Growers  Fund 
<br/>provide avenues to our farmers to enable them, whilst they are improving their cane production and 
<br/>improving their farm, they  improve their livelihood, they diversify, and have a better standard of 
<br/>living.  That is the ultimate goal we should all strive for, ensuring that our farmers, be it sugarcane, 
<br/>be it other diversified products, they should ensure that the Fund supports them, the Fund ensures 
<br/>them, that they can have a sustainable livelihood and a better living standard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister and other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members for the contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugarcane Growers Fund was established in 1984 on the Sugar Price 
<br/>Support Fund which was established in 1948 and it was part of a strategy to put aside part of the 
<br/>sugar price for the farmers into a fund for rehabilitation.   So, the history is long, the intention was 
<br/>very noble and the Fund, over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has served the farmers very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for laying out some of the progress that has 
<br/>been made over the last 18 months. However, I was kind of intrigued, happy as well as concerned 
<br/>about  the  comments  made  my  honourable  Premila  Kumar.  I  wish  she  was  able  to  make  those 
<br/>comments when she was in government, because we would not have wasted those four years that she 
<br/>was in government, we might have done something better.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I was not looking after sugar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Regardless of whether you were looking after sugar or not, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you were a member of the government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this reference to politics in the sugar industry, is what we used to hear for 
<br/>16 years.  When we had politics, we were doing very well, we were producing 3.2 million tonnes of 
<br/>cane  in  2006.    After  2006,  we  lost  $350  million  because  that  was  the  European  Union  funding.  
<br/>Honourable Kumar knows, we wrote a paper together on the impact of the Lome Convention on the 
<br/>environment and she did a very good thesis, and I must commend her for that, but she has probably 
<br/>forgotten about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She should have known when she was in government that, that $350 million, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, was precisely directed towards reforming the sugar industry.  Countries like Mauritius that she 
<br/>talked about, used European Union funding because the Lome Convention, the preferential prices 
<br/>was going to come to an end, and the European Union was providing all the sugar growing countries, 
<br/>under Lome Convention, with those additional grant funding so that there were three components - 
<br/>improving efficiency at the mill level, improving efficiency at the farm level, improving efficiency 
<br/>for the growers, so that the cost of production per acre went down, and the third component, of course, 
<br/>was alternative livelihood.  So, those who wanted to exit the sugar industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would 
<br/>be allowed to do that through an appropriate funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  lost  that.    They  abolished  the  Growers  Council.    She  referred  to  a  Bill,  that  was  the 
<br/>draconian  Bill  that  they  wanted  to  bring,  and  if  it  was  not  for  some  of  us  in  the  Opposition  and 
<br/>growers listened outside Parliament, to do that and that Bill, if there was not that kind of opposition 
<br/>outside of Parliament, would have enslaved the farmers to this day.  That is what they were trying to 
<br/>do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 18 months, is to provide an open political 
<br/>environment that is now more thinking.  Honourable Tubuna, an expert in agriculture, working with 
<br/>the FAO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, this is a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is thinking and putting together resources 
<br/>and putting more people.  We have a very good Chairman for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, we 
<br/>have good CEO, and there are people who are thinking now on how we can improve and get things 
<br/>done  for  the  sugar  industry  together.    As  I  have  said,  this  is  a  Government  which  is  not  about 
<br/></span><span>gimmicks, which is not about fancy stunt, this is a Government which is thinking seriously about the 
<br/></span><span>sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Change is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have changed a lot of things and we are doing things, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  But you cannot correct the 16 years of direct deliberate neglect of the industry by the 
<br/>government that she was part of, and some of them are sitting on the other side.  She concluded very 
<br/>well, and I thank her for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, going  forward,  I know the honourable Leader  of the Opposition 
<br/>knew about this and going forward, I agree that we should work as a Parliament, and we should come 
<br/>together.  The Committee that we have is going to drive the agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we do that, we will cut out all the hogwash, and we will do the right 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I thank the Committee Members for thinking and getting this 
<br/>Report done.  It is a good beginning and I think it will mean well for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 
<br/>and for the farmers.  There is a possibility that the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, as honourable Sachida 
<br/>Nand said which is a good point, could create itself into a much more agile fund, providing additional 
<br/>support for non-sugar crop sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  first  time,  has  put  in  policies.    We  are  now 
<br/>providing subsidies for fertilizer and weedicide for non-sugar crop sectors as well because we believe 
<br/>in diversification.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go to Vanua Levu, you will see the level of interest in the 
<br/>production of cassava, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, rice, and you will see Vanua Levu buzzing in many areas because of the 
<br/>deliberate Government policy to support the non-sugar agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there has been quite a lot that has been said 
<br/>about the industry.  This week, we will be discussing about the industry.  There will be four reports 
<br/>that will be tabled in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  honourable  Members  for  their  contribution  and,  of  course,  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of our sitting today.  I thank you all for your 
<br/>contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. in our preparation to receive 
<br/>Her Excellency the President of the Republic of India visiting us after the ceremony at the GPH.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 5.52 p.m.
