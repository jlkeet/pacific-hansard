<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Against what standards and quality were their courses benchmarked to, to justify receiving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a grant of $7 million in the last 18 months; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Polytech  has  been  benchmarked  against  the  standards  established  by  the  Higher 
<br/>Education Commission of Fiji (HECF) and has met these standards. Announcement of grants 
<br/>approved to any higher education institution is one thing, but actual funds are only released 
<br/>as delivered, spent, and properly acquitted  by the institutions with  documentary evidence. 
<br/>Pacific Polytech has received $2,260,000 since starting operations in 2021/22. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  the  award  programmes  have  either  been  developed  by  the  HECF  or developed  by  the 
<br/>Pacific Polytech are scrutinized and subsequently approved by the HECF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  HECF  was  created  under  the  Higher  Education  Act  2008.  The  Higher  Education 
<br/>Promulgation was gazetted on 14th October 2008 and came into effect on 1st January 2010 
<br/>establishing  the  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  as  an  autonomous  governance 
<br/>framework  that  is  responsible  for  standards  and  qualities  in  all  tertiary  institutions.  The 
<br/></span><span>HECF sets the standards of the National Qualifications and monitors the quality of delivery 
<br/></span><span>and assessment. A summary of the mandate of HECF is attached as Appendix 1. All NQs are 
<br/>benchmarked against the Fiji National Quality Standards.  These courses are for Fijians from 
<br/>the  age of  17  years  up,  who  are  not  in  any  form  of  employment  during  the  period  of 
<br/>sponsorship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Short  Professional  and Skill  Development  Programmes  for  industry: </span><span>These  are  courses 
<br/>developed  to  enhance  skills  and  competencies  of  employees  in  various  organisations.  These 
<br/>courses are developed in consultation with the specific employer and industry. Courses are in

<div><span>This section of the Polytech  is a new section, which  has started working  with  some  large 
<br/>employers to provide inhouse training to their employees. The courses are fully funded by 
<br/>the organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Two types of assessments were carried out: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>➢</span><span> </span><span>Financial:</span><span> </span><span>as  a standard  requirement,  as for all other institutions covered by HECF, the 
<br/>Polytech  is  required  to  submit  spending  acquittals  to  HECF  for  quarterly  grant  sums 
<br/>released. Once HECF is satisfied with spending acquittals submitted by PP, only then they 
<br/>authorize to  release grant for next quarter. This process is followed before  grant for any 
<br/>quarter is released. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, submission of audited financial statements of the institutions are mandatory. 
<br/>The Polytech has submitted its all the years for which it has received Government grants. 
<br/>These audits are clean and provide no cause for any concern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>➢</span><span> </span><span>Academic: The HECF monitors the programmes which are funded by government grants. 
<br/>No institution can offer programmes which are not approved by the Commission. All award 
<br/>programmes of the Polytech have received stringent scrutiny, and have been duly approved
