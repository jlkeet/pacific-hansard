<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the following Ministers have given notice to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate and Environment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade  and  Co-operatives,  Micro, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Education; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes.  I will then invite the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the statement of no more than five minutes. There will 
<br/>also  be  a  response  from  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  the  Group  of  9  Bloc  or  his 
<br/>designate, to also speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific as the Ocean of Peace 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also like to welcome those who are watching us 
<br/>on livestream and also some young visitors from the United States of America seating in the gallery 
<br/>this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to inform the House of the progress in the 
<br/>development of the concept of the Pacific as the Ocean of Peace. This week, Officials at the Ministry 
<br/>of Foreign Affairs, are taking the concept through the Pacific Islands Forum consultation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 15th November, 1520, a long time ago, long after the first Pacific Islanders had reached 
<br/>this ocean, Ferdinand Magellan sailed into the Mar del Sur (The South Sea - named by Vasco Nunez 
<br/>Balboa, Spanish Explorer and Conquistador) and renamed it Mar Pacifico, the Pacific Ocean because 
<br/>of its calm waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  waters  of  the  Pacific  are  not  always  calm,  they  can  be  stormy  at  times,  violent  and 
<br/>threatening. However, as Epeli Hau’ofa noted in his essay, </span><span>We are the Ocean: Selected Works</span><span> and I 
<br/>quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Just as the sea is an open and ever flowing reality, so should our oceanic identity 
<br/></span><span>transcend all forms of insularity, to become one that is openly searching, inventive and 
<br/>welcoming”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is fitting to note therefore, Sir, that at a time of geostrategic tension, economic uncertainty 
<br/>and  a  changing  climatic  environment,  those  who  are  the  custodians  of  the  ocean  welcome  the 
<br/>proposal that the Pacific be an Ocean of Peace and agree to adopt some high-level principles, to guide 
<br/>efforts to realise this ambition and embed peace as a cornerstone of future policies and strategies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  having  presented  to  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  (PIF)  leaders  at  their  meeting  in 
<br/></span><span>Rarotonga  in  November  2023,  the  leaders  have  tasked  the  PIF  Secretariat  to  further  develop  the 
<br/>Ocean of Peace concept for consideration at the 53</span><span>rd</span><span> Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Tonga later 
<br/>this month.  This directive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has since inspired deep reflections across the region 
<br/>about the opportunities inherent in that concept. It has also caught the attention of international 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1372 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leaders like President Biden of the United States of America, President Xi Jing Ping of China, the 
<br/>Emperor of Japan and his Prime Minister Kishida and the Prime Minister of India, Shri Modi, and I 
<br/>am sure Her Excellency, the President of India who is coming to Fiji this afternoon also agrees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  region,  the  Pacific  knows  the  value  of  peace  as  we  lived  through  the  horrors  of  its 
<br/>absence.  This ocean and its diverse and vibrant lands have been a theatre of two world wars and a 
<br/>testing ground of the most dangerous weapons, the impacts of which are still felt today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  not  a  passive  region  without  agency,  the  collective  voice  of  the 
<br/>Pacific is as loud as it is profound and proud.  Building Pacific regionalism over many decades, the 
<br/>Forum family have created a strong basis to give effect to this vision of advancing the region as an 
<br/>Ocean of Peace, the greatest area on the globe under Christianity yet so fragile and prone to conflicts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me be clear, Sir, the concept of peace comes from deep within our faith in God of peace, 
<br/>deference and justice that finds its expressions in our approach to issues that are embedded in the 
<br/>Pacific Way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an Ocean of Peace reflects the Pacific Way, as first defined in 1970 by the 
<br/>late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara at the United Nations. It is owned and shaped by Pacific people and 
<br/>Pacific  traditions.    The  concept recognises  that  whilst  core  values  and  Pacific identify  are  shared 
<br/>across the region, local customs and understandings vary. Humility, quiet leadership, reconciliation 
<br/>the 
<br/>and communication 
<br/>peaceful resolution of concerns, based on the Pacific Way of bringing people and nations together 
<br/>to find common ground and manage disagreements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is  a  shared  commitment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these  definitions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>run 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we work towards the principles, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ocean of Peace concept offers an 
<br/>opportunity  to  re-embrace  foundational tenets,  principles  and  ethics  of  Pacific regionalism  and  to 
<br/>weave  the  threads  of  our past  with  our  vision  for  the  future.  In  this respect,  the  Ocean  of  Peace 
<br/>underscores several key themes:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Protecting and recognising the Pacific's stewardship of the environment and ocean that 
<br/>underpins  the  lives, livelihoods  and  very  existence  of  our people  and  connects  us, 
<br/>including,  in  response  to  climate  change  -  which  our leaders  recognised  as  the 
<br/>greatest threat to existence, collective security and wellbeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Pacific's longstanding support for and ongoing contribution to global peace-making 
<br/>systems,  institutions  and solutions  which  resonates  with  the  calls  for peace  in  many 
<br/>parts of the world today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  sophistication  and  longevity  of  the Pacific's  advocacy  in  favour  of  core  global 
<br/>platforms  underpinning  peace  and security,  including  freedom  of  navigation, arms 
<br/>control and non-proliferation of hostilities arrangements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The 2050 Strategy vision of a shared responsibility for maintaining Pacific peace and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>security and for building capability to meet the region's needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The  </span><span>Boe  Declaration’s</span><span>  broad  definition  of  security  as  well  as  mutual  respect 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Statements reinforcing the Pacific's peaceful example to uphold international law and 
<br/></span><span>urge others to refrain from actions that undermine peace and security in the Blue Pacific 
<br/></span><span>and beyond.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>The  opportunities  and  benefits  for  the Blue  Pacific  in  enhancing  regional economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>connectivity and integration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ocean  of  Peace  is  a  signal  that  we  seek  a  region  in  which  strategic 
<br/></span><span>competition is managed, where stability is the touchstone of regional relationships, where coercion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1373 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is eschewed and where differences are resolved peacefully.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ocean  of  Peace,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  both an  aspiration  and  a  pathway  to  a 
<br/>regional arrangement crafted by the States of the Pacific region, but also respected by other powers of 
<br/>the broader Indo Pacific region, hence our desire that when they enter the region, they tone down and 
<br/>tune in to the ways of the Pacific. Yet, the Ocean of Peace cannot survive as a unilateral assertion.  It 
<br/>rests, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a shared commitment by all states in the region to put a stable peace at the 
<br/>centre of their strategic policies. Through the Ocean of Peace, we recognise the right of the people to 
<br/>peace and reaffirm the strong resolve of our people to maintain and strengthen international peace 
<br/>and security. By adopting this concept, Mr. Speaker, we declare and secure that right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  conscious  of  the  determination  of  the Pacific  Island  countries  to  preserve  their 
<br/>independence, their sovereignty and their territorial integrity, and to develop their relations under 
<br/>conditions of peace and liberty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are convinced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the importance of promoting peace and cooperation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Oceania for the benefit of the Pacific people, in particular, and humankind in general.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  convinced  of  the  need  to preserve  the  region  from  acts  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>militarisation, arms race, and, above all, nuclear weapons - their threats of use and use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise the interest and responsibility of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) membership 
<br/>to  promote  regional cooperation  for  economic  development  and peace.  Working  through  the  PIF 
<br/>and recognising that this is a long-term objective, Fiji promotes an Ocean of Peace based on a set of 
<br/>principles that recognises and complements existing frameworks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Leaders’  guidance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on the  refinement  of  the  principles  and 
<br/>situating it within the existing landscape of Pacific regionalism and global engagement would ensure 
<br/>it meets the needs and expectations of the PIF membership in a complex and contested environment, 
<br/>regionally and beyond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a concept, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ocean of Peace is an opportunity and should be seen as 
<br/>a beacon of hope, that could spur on the evolution of our region's longstanding commitment to peace 
<br/>and prosperity for our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ocean of Peace concept promotes and harnesses the innovation of the Blue Pacific and 
<br/></span><span>the unique perspective our region brings on issues of global significance, most especially at a time 
<br/></span><span>that the world is going through today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ocean  of  Peace,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  offers this  generation  the  opportunity  to  echo 
<br/>and embrace the determination, and I quote:  "to ensure, so far as lies within their power, that the 
<br/>bounty and beauty of the land and sea in their region shall remain the heritage of their peoples and 
<br/>their descendants in perpetuity to be enjoyed by all in peace”, </span><span>w</span><span>hich is clarified for those members 
<br/>who are party to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treat</span><span>y</span><span>, commonly referred to as the Treaty of 
<br/>Rarotonga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ocean of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also offers a platform to expand for a global audience, 
<br/>concepts central to the Pacific Way, including to articulate how those within and beyond the Blue 
<br/>Pacific  can  embrace  mechanisms  to  work together  and  resolve  differences  respectfully and  with 
<br/>understanding.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate for your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me, first of all, acknowledge and thank the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister for the Ministerial Statement on the development of the concept of the 
<br/>Pacific as an ‘Ocean of Peace’, that he has delivered in this august House this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me say from the very beginning Sir, in my response that we very much look forward to 
<br/>this, not only to this side of the House, but every Fijian because this is something that we first heard 
<br/>of, as stated by the honourable Prime Minister, when he attended the Leaders Meeting in Rarotonga 
<br/>in November last year.  We did some follow-ups with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and we were 
<br/>told that Fiji was to develop the concept further, as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister, and 
<br/>be presented in the meeting in Tonga this year and, of course, we look forward to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  let  me  acknowledge  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  as  well  for  assuring  us  that  this 
<br/>concept of peace recognises and complements the existing frameworks and particularly, as agreed to 
<br/>by our Leaders, the </span><span>Boe Declaration</span><span> and the 2050 Strategy, which we are familiar with.  So, I wish 
<br/>to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I say that in acknowledging the statement, we all know how important 
<br/>our ocean is, not only to Fiji, but other Pacific Island countries, whose livelihood and survival depend, 
<br/>to a large extend, on the oceans around us and moreso, its extractable into the </span><span>Boe Declaration</span><span> and 
<br/>the 2050 Pacific Strategy for a Blue Pacific continent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may just refer to that document, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in the strategic context and the 
<br/>Framework for Pacific Regionalism, it does state that the Forum Leaders endorsed the Framework 
<br/>for Pacific Regionalism, espousing their vision for the Pacific as a region of peace, harmony, security, 
<br/>social inclusion and prosperity so that all Pacific people can live free, healthy and productive lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst much of our livelihood is derived from the ocean to a large extent, it 
<br/>has also become an avenue of great vulnerability to our nations.  The Blue Pacific Strategy seeks to 
<br/>foster security and peace in the region, and the </span><span>Boe Declaration</span><span> on the other hand, affirms that the 
<br/>extended concept of security addresses the wide range of security issues in the region, both traditional 
<br/>and non- traditional.  I am sure we are familiar with these documents, there are six strategic areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Climate Change-being high in the list; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Human Security issues;  
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Resource Security issues; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Environmental issues; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Cyber-Security issues; and  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Trans-National Crime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are noble aspirations, and we acknowledge Government for that.  Of 
<br/>course,  our  people  deserve  to  live  in  an  environment  where  security  is  guaranteed,  and  peace  is 
<br/>abound.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last couple of months, we have been overwhelmed with the report of 
<br/>major drug finds and the impacts of drug abuse within our societies, and much of these have succumb 
<br/>to our shores via our oceans.  I know the honourable Minister for Home Affairs is doing his best in 
<br/>terms of monitoring of our vast ocean that we have, given the limited resources that we have, but we 
<br/>are thankful to the partnership, particularly SDG17 on partnership that will help us to ensure that we 
<br/>have a secure region.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1375 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I just conclude in the few remaining seconds, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to emphasise that, 
<br/>again, we are moving out to the region, but section 13 of the Climate Change Act 2021 stipulates our 
<br/>responsibilities in as far as oceans is concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I know that it comes under your portfolio, particularly on 
<br/>the  National  Ocean  Policy  Steering  Committee,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  is  a  very  important 
<br/>Committee. I know that it has been started previously, and I followed up with your staff, honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  Sir,  they  have  been  meeting  regularly,  which  is  good,  but  that  is  a  very,  very 
<br/>important Committee not only for Fiji, but particularly linking us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  just  completed  SIDS  4  in  Antigua  and  Barbuda.    These  are  all  issues  that  are 
<br/>relevant, and you have raised these issues too, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Tonga, during the Pacific Islands 
<br/>Parliaments Group (PIPG) meeting last year.  We look forward to this, as I have said, it is a new 
<br/>concept,  but  we look  forward to  its implementation  and we thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>again, and the Government for this initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate for your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to first thank the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and acknowledge his Ministerial Statement on such a very important matter for the 
<br/>world today.  The world is crying for peace, and everyone wants peace,  including this part of the 
<br/>world - the Pacific, we call our home.  The fundamentals of peace in this part of the world has already 
<br/>been articulated very well by the honourable Prime Minister.  I have had to take the time to follow 
<br/>his earlier speeches, not only here but also in the region, as well in the way that he has presented to 
<br/>the global world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is ahead of us are the challenges of the ‘20 fast century’.  I say ‘20 fast’ not the ‘21st’   
<br/>world.  The world is moving so fast that there are things that you and I can control, and there are 
<br/>things that we cannot control, and one of which is conflict. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  from  our  group  this  side,  we  endorse,  acknowledge  and  fully  support  the 
<br/>Government’s effort, led by the honourable Prime Minister, to put into place an ocean of peace.  Not 
<br/>long ago, this part of our home was referred to as  the ‘arc of instability.’  The honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister is quite familiar with that.  We were labelled as the arc of instability.  From our view on this 
<br/>side of the House, it is about time that we change this into the Ocean of Peace or the Arc of Peace, 
<br/></span><span>Prosperity and Stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our view from this side, Mr. Speaker, that the way forward to bring the world to our part of 
<br/>the Pacific that we create the right environment, the right situation, and we have in place leaders that 
<br/>not only foster and stand on the firm belief for peace, we create the environment of peace.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We wish the honourable Prime Minister well, as he embarks on the next Pacific Islands Forum 
<br/>meeting, which we believe this is where it is going to be discussed and endorsed.    We wish you 
<br/>well, honourable Prime Minister, as you posture our part of the world as the Ocean of Peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we adjourn for tea, honourable Members, I would like to add that 
<br/>we  have  also  just  returned  from  our  recent  trip  to  Indonesia  to  a  regional  meeting,  including  the 
<br/>Pacific.  They are identifying themselves as having their borders within the Pacific Ocean, and they 
<br/>were looking forward to knowing how best we can address issues that were outstanding, especially 
<br/>in trying to address what the honourable Prime Minister has just said. We turn it into an Ocean of 
<br/>Peace – the ocean that brings us together

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and identifies us together, should be a catalyst for peace within our region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are so grateful to hear that this morning, and that will be something that will be pursued, 
<br/>subject, of course, to the various ratifications that we have undersigned as a country, to guide us in 
<br/>the Pacific as well, as highlighted by the honourable Leader of the Opposition.   That, honourable 
<br/>Members, is certainly a worthy cause to pursue, especially in the name of peace within our region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  would  be  remiss  of  me  as  well  not  to  acknowledge,  even  though  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister  has  sounded  his  acknowledgement,  on  the  presence  in  the  gallery  of  some  students,  I 
<br/>understand, with same coloured shirts which is known locally as </span><span>kalavata</span><span>, and I apologise I do not 
<br/>have  information  here  with  me  as  to  where  you  are  from,  but  we  appreciate  your  presence  this 
<br/>morning  in  the  gallery  in  being  with  us  as  the  honourable  Members  deliberate  on  issues  that  are 
<br/>before them.  We invite you as well to the tea that you may share with honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the House is now adjourned for tea, and we will resume when the bell 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is sounded.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we shall now move on. I now call on the Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communications to deliver his Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Business Mission to North America 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and good morning to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to provide a Ministerial Statement of the update on the Business 
<br/>Mission to North America that was held on 4</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024 to 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024. The Business Mission 
<br/>served as a crucial platform for fostering bilateral relations, enhancing trade and economic relations 
<br/>with the North America region and, most importantly, reconnecting or rekindling our connections 
<br/>with our diaspora.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Business  Mission  was  organised  in  partnership  with  Investment  Fiji,  the  Fiji  Trade 
<br/>Commission of North America, and the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It featured business forums, networking diaspora events, business meetings, site visits, and 
<br/>meetings  with  government  officials,  investors  across  three  locations,  namely,  Surrey  in  British 
<br/>Columbia,  San  Francisco  and  California  in  the  USA,  and  Toronto  in  Ontario,  Canada.  It  was  an 
<br/>absolute honour, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to lead this unique Fijian delegation composed of Government 
<br/>representatives, private sector investors, and our exporters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only was this a large mission to the North American Region, which had over 25 Delegates 
<br/>representing wide range of businesses and agencies, we also visited the three separate locations, as I 
<br/>have mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members  of  the  Fiji  Delegation  included  senior  representatives  from  Investment  Fiji,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), Fiji Airways, iTaukei Land Trust Board 
<br/>(TLTB), BSP Life (Fiji) Ltd, Outsource Fiji, Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, the Trade 
<br/>Commission, and we were accompanied by Fiji's Honorary Consuls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji  delegation also included exporters from  Agro Marketing Authority of Fiji,  Green 
<br/>Kavalicious (Fiji) Pte Ltd, Pleass Global Ltd, Ranviz Fresh Farm Produce, Sea and Soil Fiji, Lami 
<br/>Kava, Green Gold Kava, and Road King Farms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given this Mission had both an Investment Delegation and an Exporter Delegation, separate 
<br/>programmes  were  coordinated  on  selected  days  where  the  investment  delegation  had  separate 
<br/>meetings from the exporters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The exporter delegation engaged in Fiji and Island Stores, warehouse, distributor visits, and 
<br/></span><span>had an opportunity to meet and engage in dialogue with store owners on Fiji products, particularly in 
<br/>the Bay Area, United States, and also in Ontario, Canada, and Surrey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Business Forums were the marquee events at each location, which enabled delegations 
<br/>to  present  to  invited  participants  on  Fiji's  economic  overview,  investment  opportunities,  business 
<br/>environment and incentives, key travel statistics, Fiji tourism sector, key markets and future plans.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agencies, such as Outsource Fiji, TLTB and the Ministry of Lands presented in the Business Forums 
<br/>together with FNPF and BSP Life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notably, Sir, at the Business Forum in San Francisco, senior executives from both Google 
<br/>and the Wonderful Company presented on their investments and plans for Fiji, and it set the stage 
<br/>for two of Fiji's largest investors to speak very positively about their potential and future plans.   In 
<br/>that  meeting,  Fiji  Water  or  Wonderful  Company  made  the  announcement  about  commercial 
<br/>agriculture in Fiji.  We, on this side of the House believe that it is a transformative announcement for 
<br/>our  country.    At  the  same  time,  Google,  which  is  approaching  its  entry  date  to  Fiji,  which  is 
<br/>sometimes this year, announced or reconfirmed their entry into Fiji and the exciting prospects that 
<br/>lay ahead in terms of our engagement between us and Google.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Business Forums offered exporters an opportunity to display their products and to present 
<br/>their products to the invited participants. This provided an opportunity for businesses and importers 
<br/>from North America to engage. It was also seen that the presence of our diaspora is quite large, and 
<br/>for me, Mr. Speaker, very exciting.  Canada particularly is a place where we have perhaps neglected 
<br/>over the years, in particular in Ontario where the mission provided a great platform to reconnect with 
<br/>our  diaspora  and  meet  with  our  business  leaders  and  government  officials  and  re-introduce  their 
<br/>country of birth to them and invite them to come and do business at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the three Business Forums, there was a significant number 
<br/>of  high  level  trade  and  investment-related  meetings.  This  included  meetings  with  senior 
<br/>representatives of Google at their Google Cloud Campus. We also visited the Wonderful Company’s 
<br/>Pomegranate  and  Solar  Facility  in  Del  Ray,  San  Francisco  which  probably  forbodes  what  the 
<br/>Wonderful Company or Fiji Water plans to do in Fiji.  They plan to replace their currently diesel-
<br/>powered factory with solar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as some of our diaspora members would say or</span><span> </span><span>I would like to say, they 
<br/>have become "sleeper agents" in  North  America.   As I have mentioned,  we have invited them to 
<br/>return  home  and  together  rebuild  Fiji.   I  would  like  to  acknowledge,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>hardworking people in North America who worked behind the scenes to ensure not only the success 
<br/>of the Business Mission, but we were welcoming warmed as if we never left Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Surrey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were honoured to be accorded a traditional welcome by the 
<br/>Semiahmoo First Nations and the iTaukei community. This event was coordinated by our iTaukei 
<br/>Cultural Society in British Columbia, including a </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session at the Peace Arch Heritage Hall in 
<br/></span><span>Surrey.  The Fijian Association of Canada also hosted a community event with discussions focused 
<br/></span><span>on diaspora investment, tourism growth and economic diversification at the Fijian Centre in Surrey 
<br/>Canada.  The Fiji Association of Canada has been the cornerstone of for the diaspora unity for the 
<br/>past 56 years, making it the largest Fijian Association outside Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At San Francisco, a </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session was also organised for the Bay Area diaspora, where they 
<br/>were informed of investment opportunities and incentives in Fiji, along with issues and challenges 
<br/>faced  by  the  diaspora  community  there.    In  Ontario,  Canada,  the  Fiji  an  Association  of  Ontario 
<br/>warmly welcomed the Fiji delegation and hosted us to both the networking and community business 
<br/></span><span>event.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we proactively continue to rebuild Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure our diaspora 
<br/>community in North America that we have heard their concerns and raised them in the margins of 
<br/>the business mission and are working towards addressing their issues.  The Coalition Government, 
<br/>of course, will try and ensure that their issues are addressed.  We are working closely with the Fiji 
<br/>Immigration Department to address some issues raised by our diaspora regarding passports and

<div><span>citizenship services, and hopefully we can provide some solutions in the near future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir I would like to talk briefly about kava.  The opportunity to meet with the 
<br/>US-based kava association and various actors in the kava sector was indeed timely to capitalise on 
<br/>the large growing market for kava in the United States of America.  During the mission, Fiji’s kava 
<br/>exporters who were part of the delegation met key large western market and Pacific Island diaspora 
<br/>buyers who import and distribute kava to kava bars, retail and online.  Just as an aside, Sir, there are 
<br/>about 400 kava bars in the West Coast including Miami, and they are growing at about 10 per month, 
<br/>I am told.  As the kava industry is anticipated to become a billion-dollar industry in the future, the 
<br/>Business Mission reinforced the desire to continue to pursue the Kava Bill in the interest to protecting 
<br/>the kava industry and establishing quality and food safety standards of Fiji’s kava.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is huge potential in kava.  We, as a country need to play our part and 
<br/>ensure that kava exported to the United States of America meets the Food and Drug Administration 
<br/>(FDA) and import requirements, and of course, by extension creates more jobs and wealth in Fiji.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the leg to Ontario, we did meet with the Government of Ontario.  I had 
<br/>the  privilege  of  meeting  the  Premier  of  Ontario  and  the  Minister  for  Intergovernmental  Affairs, 
<br/>honourable Doug Ford, a very inspirational leader, where we had very positive discussions around 
<br/>areas of mutual understanding, cooperation and opportunities for trade and investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also had the opportunity to meet with the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in Ontario, 
<br/>honourable  Ted  Arnott,  and  the  delegation  was  provided  a  private  tour  and  welcomed  in  the 
<br/>Legislative Assembly of Ontario.  Subsequently, we met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and 
<br/>Rural Affairs, honourable Lisa Thompson, and the Associate Minister for Small Business, Economic 
<br/>Development  and  Job  Creation,  honourable  Ninan  Tangri  with  discussions  that  centred  around 
<br/>potential areas for collaboration and support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  Ontario,  we  also  attended  some  high  level  meetings  and  networking 
<br/>events.  A significant one was, of course, being hosted to a private invite only networking event by 
<br/>the Toronto- Dominion (TD) Bank Group.  The TD Bank Group is one of the five largest Banks in 
<br/>Canada.  We were invited by senior members of that Bank to share the perspectives on Fiji.  There 
<br/>are some potential leads that have come out of that discussion.  In North America, we also had very 
<br/>fruitful discussions along the way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I guess in terms of trade missions, there is always the question of what you are 
<br/>bringing back to your home country.  I am pleased to report that in terms of potential investment 
<br/></span><span>generated  from  the  meetings,  there  was  about  $108  million  leads  generated  through  trade  and 
<br/></span><span>investment potential, and that is excluding the $200 million that is currently going to be invested by 
<br/>Google in the Data Centre.  I am happy to report that there will be delegations from Canada coming 
<br/>into Fiji very soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from what we saw during the visit, there is substantial potential in the North 
<br/>American region for trade and investment, including diaspora investment.  This mission has acted as 
<br/>a platform to connect with the diaspora, meet current and potential investors, develop networks and 
<br/>strengthen our relationships between Government agencies and partners of Fiji. I wish to assure this 
<br/></span><span>august House that we will continue to explore and strengthen our networks in the North American 
<br/></span><span>region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Canadian  opportunity,  Sir,  is  quite  exciting  particularly  when  it  has  the  same 
<br/>demographics and dynamics as the Australian economy, and it is almost like as if we were entering 
<br/>another major opportunity when we visited Canada. We look forward to further engagements with 
<br/>Canada and the Canadian businesses over the next few months.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I end, Mr. Speaker, I would like to place on record my appreciation for those who 
<br/>helped particularly those on the ground that helped with putting together of the event, I particular 
<br/>name the Honorary Consuls in the United States of America and Canada and Mr. Sam Basra, who 
<br/>was instrumental in putting together the visit to Canada. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on all matrices, this visit by this Government into North America has been a 
<br/>success and we look forward to continuing to work together with both the United States of America 
<br/>and Canada to explore the opportunities that lie ahead of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and Ministers, first  of  all, let me say congratulations to  the honourable Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Trade for recognising the importance of that particular region with respect 
<br/>to furthering Fiji’s trade, et cetera to North America. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this has actually been an ongoing issue with respect to North America in terms 
<br/>of bringing investment into Fiji and also growing our export market as rightfully pointed out by the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister. One of the most important issues that needs to be attended to and 
<br/>is critical as a component in all of these, is to ensure that our biosecurity pathways are cleared. I know 
<br/>the honourable Minister is hard at work trying to ensure that all of that is done, because one of the 
<br/>most important things for us in terms of foreign exchange, et cetera is cargo export.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, Fiji’s kava market, most of the kava is actually consumed locally, if I am correct, 
<br/>Sir, I think it is only 8 percent that actually gets exported.  It is a huge following in North America.  
<br/>As rightfully pointed out, there are kava bars popping up everywhere. So, there is a demand for all 
<br/>of these, Mr. Speaker, and from what I understand, it only takes five days for a packed kava parcel 
<br/>to go from here to Montreal.  There is room for Fiji to make considerable amount of money in North 
<br/>America in that industry and I take my hat off to the honourable Minister and I wish him well with 
<br/>respect to endeavouring into the kava industry and making it more viable for Fiji to export to Canada.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is one of the countries, there are issues that need to dealt with with Health Canada.  I am 
<br/>glad that he actually met the Minister for Agriculture also in Canada and try and get these things 
<br/>ironed out. One of the other things also, Sir, we must realise that we have a huge diaspora that actually 
<br/>lives in that particular portion of the world. Pre 1987, Fiji had a visa free to Canada and I am hoping 
<br/>also  that  the  honourable  Minister  managed  to  have  some  discussions  with  respect  to  that  issue 
<br/>because we have a huge diaspora and I think pretty much quite a few people who live in Fiji have 
<br/>relatives there.  It would be an important issue that would go hand-in-hand with our trade with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the rest of the North America, the trade that actually happens, the larger number 
<br/>out of the figures comes from Fiji Water export. We need to increase our trade and I think that is the 
<br/>only region where the balance of trade is in our favour, most of the places around the world are not 
<br/>in our favour but this is a one place and its comes out of the export of Fiji Water. We are exporting 
<br/>less to  that particular region  and these kinds of  missions are important  for us to  grow our export 
<br/>sector, but at the same time, the encouragement also needs to come for our local growers to try and 
<br/>pursue those avenues.  This is why I pointed out the issue regarding biosecurity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Canada also has a growing e-commerce industry. It exports many other things 
<br/></span><span>also, but it has a growing e-commerce industry and I hope the honourable Minister managed to tap 
<br/>into some people there to see if there was room for improvement and investment into Fiji. The travel 
<br/>and tourism industry also is something that is important to North America. These were discussions 
<br/>that were ongoing for many, many years but nothing has actually come to provision.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will wait, Mr. Speaker, to see how many of these projects that have come on board will 
<br/>come into fruition and I am hopeful that Investment Fiji will facilitate them as quickly as possible 
<br/>because I know that one of the things that comes out of this North Americans is that, they want things 
<br/>done quickly, approvals and processes, et cetera need to take place really quickly so that they can get 
<br/>their projects into the space and actually start exporting and importing whatever it is that they need 
<br/>to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One area that I am not sure if the honourable Minister managed to tap into, they have a huge 
<br/>cannabis industry also and I think the medicinal cannabis industry that the honourable Minister has 
<br/>spoken  about  earlier,  they  are  certainly  experts  in  that  particular  area  and  I  hope  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister managed to speak to some people to see if we can get some assistance whether we should 
<br/>be doing that or not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, I thank the honourable Minister for a well led mission. I think the right 
<br/>amount  of  people  and  the  right  people  actually  went  across  and  most  definitely,  Sir,  from  our 
<br/>perspective too we have heard some positive reports regarding the mission that actually went across. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade 
<br/>for his Statement this morning on the important work of diversifying a market, trying to improve, 
<br/>increase the sphere of our trade.  There is a commodity that Fiji has,  that is, our mahogany.  Our 
<br/>mahogany is the second largest plantation in the world, second to Brazil. Very unique feature of our 
<br/>mahogany they say is that because it has those pin knots. Fiji mahogany has got those little black 
<br/>dots.  I think that is a commodity as we go into our trade missions that we need to advertise or promote 
<br/>more because right now our mahogany usually goes down to America via South America, and it is 
<br/>really timber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one time, I sounded out a very rich businessman, a billionaire in fact and I 
<br/>asked him about mahogany in Fiji, I said, “what would you do with the mahogany if it belonged to 
<br/>you?”  He basically said, “Mahogany is a rich man’s furniture. I would process it halfway here in Fiji 
<br/>so  that  we  can  get  employment,  a  bit  of  down  streaming  and  then  send  it  across  to  one  of  those 
<br/>companies that do those signature furniture’s, put their signature on it and sell it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  in  further  trade  missions  that  we  should  be 
<br/>trying to promote our mahogany products, not only the timber but ways in which we can tap into 
<br/></span><span>those niche markets because ours is a plantation mahogany. In countries in South America where 
<br/></span><span>mahogany grows freely, there is a lot of restrictions put on it because of deforestation in the areas 
<br/>where they grow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on our diaspora, there is this big problem that we are 
<br/>facing now which is brain drain and the way to perhaps arrest brain drain is to turn it into a brain 
<br/>drain gain.  As they go out, they go and invest,  they learn how to run their businesses, they are well 
<br/>educated, but we would like to turn that brain drain into a  brain drain gain, and that gain comes when 
<br/>our policies, for them here locally, is correct -  policies with immigration and how they can come 
<br/></span><span>back, policies with how they can come in and set up their businesses. I know that we had a seen this 
<br/></span><span>big flow of people out of Fiji, as brain drain but we can turn that around, Mr. Speaker, Sir, into a 
<br/>brain drain gain by looking at the policies that we have to ensure that it can attract them to come back 
<br/>and share with us the expertise that they have and help build our country as well.  Again, I thank the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Minister for Education to deliver his Statement.

<div><span>Update on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>fellow Members of Parliament;  I thank you for the opportunity to present my Ministerial Statement, 
<br/>providing an update on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS) and the new initiatives 
<br/>for 2025.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Coalition Government, I would also like to wish TSLS a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happy 10th Year Anniversary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  is  making  serious  strides  towards  achieving  Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals (SDGs) on quality education. The TSLS plays a critical role by ensuring that the 
<br/>targets  on  increasing  access  to  tertiary  education  for  youth,  including  girls,  and  people  with 
<br/>disabilities are met through innovative scholarship and study grant policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must also thank the TSLS Board, the CEO and Management for coming 
<br/>up with recommendations for new initiatives and value adding to existing schemes in the 2024-2025 
<br/>Budget,  which  are  based  on  the  premise  and  rationale  to  allow  greater  access  for  human  capital 
<br/>development to commensurately mitigate loss of labour through migration and have demand-driven 
<br/>skills sets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced and passed in the 2024-2025 National Budget, $150.5 million is allocated to 
<br/>sponsor  10,830  new,  and  to  continue  to  fund  9,940  sponsored  students,  and  this  allocation,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is the highest ever for new intakes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  TSLS  came  up  with  a  recommendation  to  introduce  two  new  overseas 
<br/>schemes  for  cost  sharing  overseas  PhD  and  Masters  Scholarship  and  merit-based  Postgraduate 
<br/>Diploma specialisation in in-service overseas scholarship.  I thank TSLS for this initiative, as we 
<br/>need more people with specialist qualification to continue to build intellectual capital in disciplines 
<br/>of Medical and Health Services, Engineering, Climate Change, Marine, Forestry, Public Policy and 
<br/>Analysis, Economic Modelling and Policies, Public Financing and Veterinary Science, and in the 
<br/>fields of social science. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  TSLS  for  brokering  partnerships  with  four  Australian 
<br/>Universities,  who  will  bear  tuition  fee,  whilst  Government  will  take  care  of  stipend  and 
<br/></span><span>miscellaneous.   Funding  students  for overseas scholarships is  highly  costly  to the  taxpayers, as it 
<br/></span><span>averages  $350,000  to  $400,000  for  a  degree  programme.  Therefore,  the  PhD  will  cost  more,  and 
<br/>Government would like to thank the following Australian Universities for coming onboard on this 
<br/>scheme with TSLS.  They are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Western Sydney University; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Swinburne University of Technology; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>University of Newcastle; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Queensland University of Technology; and  
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Monash University who will sign an MOU later to join this scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS came up with a new initiative on Graduate Business Startup Scheme. 
<br/>This was timely, as the Coalition Government wants our graduates to also be job creators.  In the 
<br/>2024-2025  Budget,  30  TSLS  sponsored  graduates  are  provided  with  the  opportunity  to  undergo 
<br/>training and start up a business through training and mentoring by the Fiji Commerce and Employers 
<br/>Federation (FCEF), and this initiative will allow graduates to be job creators.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is taking another bold step by partnering with the 
<br/>employers with specialised training facilities and resources to train students and employ them after 
<br/>successful completion.  And I must thank the TSLS for coming up with the idea, as a new scheme of 
<br/>Industry/Employer Based Skills Qualification Scheme will provide opportunity to 300 students to 
<br/>get trained by the Higher Education Commission Fiji (HECF) accredited employer-based providers 
<br/>for skills qualification at Certificate III, IV or Diploma Level 5 Programmes. This will reduce the 
<br/>employer concerns and quality, and this is a game changer scheme to allow TVET to be employer or 
<br/>industry led.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to value add the Micro Qualification Grants, two new categories of White 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Good Repairs and Existing Micro Business training on book-keeping and marketing are added.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TSLS Board and Management firmly believes in providing transparent 
<br/>information  to  the  public,  being  the  taxpayer-funded  organisation.    On  2nd  August,  2024,  TSLS 
<br/>launched  the  publicly  accessible  Community  Awareness  Scholarship  Handbook  and  this  is  a 
<br/>testament.    This  is  to  assist  students,  parents  and  guardians  to  be  much  more  informed  and  get 
<br/>informed  decision  on  what  programmes  are  offered  under  TSLS.  The  handbook  can  also  be 
<br/>accessible online under the TSLS website, www.tsls.com.fj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS will be conducting Careers Teachers Workshop around the country 
<br/>so that Careers Teachers will also have full information on all the scholarships and grant schemes 
<br/>and are able to provide right advice to students and parents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be followed by school visitations to majority of the schools in Fiji, 
<br/>including the rural and maritime schools, to enlighten the students on the schemes available in the 
<br/>2024-2025  financial  year,  the  eligibility  criteria,  application  requirements  and  the  application 
<br/>process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has also opened the application for Hardship Assistance Scheme on 
<br/>2nd August, 2024, to allow those students who have completed Year 1 privately and has a pass rate 
<br/>of 50 percent to be assisted from Semester 2 of 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS will open the application for the first round of Micro-Qualification 
<br/>Grant  on  13th  September,  2024,  followed  by  the  opening  of  application for  all  other  Schemes  in 
<br/>December for the 2025 academic year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TSLS has some remarkable achievements in the last few years.  The 
<br/></span><span>launch of the in-house developed Employer Connect Portal marks the first of its kind in the Pacific.  
<br/>The portal was developed which allows graduates to search for job vacancies according to area of 
<br/>their specialisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the new online application system was also introduced by TSLS which allows students 
<br/>to seamlessly apply for scholarship.  The new online application portal is set to redefine the standard 
<br/>of educational support in Fiji.  It takes only five minutes to ten minutes to apply, if the applicant has 
<br/>all the pre-requisites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  TSLS  is  committed  to  providing  students  with  end-to-end  care,  which 
<br/>means a lot more is done in terms of providing scaffolding support, than just providing scholarships.  
<br/>It is pleasing to know that TSLS has a three-tier support system which not only caters for its current 
<br/>students, but students who have graduated as well, providing full support from scholarship awarding 
<br/>to employment.  In addition to weekly learning sessions for current students, postgraduate care is 
<br/>provided to graduates as a search for employment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS reviewed scholarship priority areas and developed a 10-Year Human 
<br/>Capital Development Plan, independently done by Professor Hitendra Pillay, who is an expert from 
<br/>Queensland University of Technology.  This plan is now used for allocation of funds for scholarships 
<br/>in the priority areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the strategic priority areas for TSLS in the Strategic Plan is to provide 
<br/>excellent customer service, and I am proud to say, as one of the line Ministers, that TSLS has done 
<br/>remarkably well in this area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 30th May, 2024, TSLS opened a new office in Nadi and this office is built around this 
<br/>objective, to provide excellent customer services to students in the West.  This office has a bigger 
<br/>area for customer service, learning support facility and self-serving student kiosks.  I applaud TSLS 
<br/>for increasing  its footprint in  the Western Division by opening  a Nadi  Office to  serve the South-
<br/>Western students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in ensuring convenient service to students, TSLS has come forward to take 
<br/>over the function of bond monitoring, travel clearance and full clearance from the Fiji Revenue and 
<br/>Customs Service (FRCS) effective from 1st January, 2025.  This will make TSLS a one stop agency 
<br/>for providing investment statements, bond and travel clearance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  effectively  carry  out  this  function,  the  opening  of  the  new  Nadi  Office  will  provide 
<br/>convenience to the students and graduates, as it is in close proximity to the International Airport and 
<br/>Immigration Office.  The TSLS will work closely with the Department of Immigration for listing and 
<br/>removal of names from the Immigration Controversial list.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has strategic priority focus on ICT transformation.  Together with the 
<br/>opening  of  the  new  Nadi  Office,  the  new  TSLS  website  and  the  Sponsorship  Information 
<br/>Management System was lodged, which is aligned to this strategic priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The TSLS is now proving to be amongst the most technologically advanced institutions in 
<br/>Fiji,  which suits them as their core  clients  are tech savvy.   The revamped TSLS website is  more 
<br/>convenient and easier to use and contains every information that students and stakeholders need to 
<br/>know  about  the  scholarships.    The  website  includes  disability-user  functions,  bond  calculator,  is 
<br/>highly  mobile  responsive,  user-friendly,  and  users  can  access  information  and  online  application 
<br/>system from anywhere on any device. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  new  patent  Sponsorship  Information  Management  System  is  an 
<br/></span><span>enhanced version of recording sponsorship data.  This shows a continuous commitment of TSLS to 
<br/>improve  the  management  and  accessibility  of  sponsorship  data.    The  newly  developed  platform 
<br/>includes student module, payment module and integration with the University system, the Ministry 
<br/>of Education’s Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS) and Immigration system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has presence on major social media platforms and a dedicated officer 
<br/>providing service through all the platforms.  The online Escalation Complaint Management System 
<br/>ensures that queries are given one day turnaround time.  The students can trace their complaints on 
<br/></span><span>this system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  online  chat  service  will  become  24  hours  by  next  year  to  the  student,  as  Artificial 
<br/>Intelligent (AI) tools are being added.  Currently, it is only from 8.00 a.m. to 4.30p.m. from Mondays 
<br/>to Fridays.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Board, the CEO and the Management of TSLS for envisioning 
<br/>and putting service at the forefront of its function.  The institution has won a Fiji Business Excellence 
<br/>Award at the Commitment Level twice and this external and independent testament of operational 
<br/>and management excellence is the indication that TSLS as a 10-year-old institution is a trailblazer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seek your understanding and approval to submit a copy of 
<br/>the TSLS 2025 Community Awareness Handbook for the Parliamentary recording purposes, and I 
<br/>offer  my  best  wishes  to  the  Board,  the  CEO,  staff  and  students  for  the  better  utilisation  of  the 
<br/>Government support system that is now being provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition  or his  designate to  speak in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; first and foremost, 
<br/>I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  for  his  Ministerial  Statement  on  the 
<br/>Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tertiary Education and Loan Scheme (TELS) was introduced in 2014 
<br/>with the focus of achieving the best educational outcomes for Fiji and ensuring that funding is spent 
<br/>on scholarship and loans, which would result in contributing to Fiji’s economic growth, workforce 
<br/>development and livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TSLS has spent $1.44 billion from the Budget to assist approximately 
<br/>68,000 students in its last 10 years of operation.  The total amount of taxpayers’ money spent has 
<br/>indicated  a  huge  contribution  to  Fiji  that  is  prioritised  through  tertiary  education  and  training 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, all students meeting the educational requirements at any tertiary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>institution were given loans, but that is not the case today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many students who have received admission into programmes at 
<br/>universities but are studying privately.  This is because they did not qualify for a scholarship or loan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  previous  Government  established  a  sustainable  funding  model  for 
<br/></span><span>tertiary  education  by  creating  a  revolving  fund  for  future  students  intending  to  study  in  tertiary 
<br/>institutions.  Unfortunately, this Government has created an unsustainable financial model where, 
<br/>every year, taxpayers fork out around $150 million for tertiary education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $150  million  could  have  gone  towards  public  goods,  hospitals,  roads, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bridges and other important developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  The  Government  is  given  budgetary  support  by  Australia  and  New 
<br/>Zealand.  Students in these countries are on higher education contribution scheme, not like ours.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the reality is that many of our graduates are now sitting at home without jobs and many 
<br/>more will join them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor!

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Government has imposed 50 percent penalties for forfeiting bonds, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if they wish to seek opportunities offshore.  How does this help our graduates or the economy?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remittances sent by unemployed students working abroad can contribute positively to our 
<br/>foreign  exchange.    Unfortunately,  this  Government  is  not  creating  jobs,  but  punishing  the 
<br/>unemployed graduates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolute shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Government decision to write off students’ debts has forced over 
<br/>$600 million directly equating to the current budget deficit.  Converting the students loan scheme to 
<br/>a scholarship is not sustainable for a small economy like ours.  Even larger economies like Australia, 
<br/>continue to maintain a loan scheme for tertiary education.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, I thank the honourable Minister this morning for his Ministerial 
<br/>Statement - a very educational one, and I also beg to differ from  honourable Hem Chand in terms  
<br/>of his response this morning, given that the TSLS was a making of the previous Administration, but 
<br/>the statement this morning by the honourable Minister talks about how this particular institution has 
<br/>developed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The announcement of the budget more recently, it has developed the four new scholarship 
<br/>schemes that are in the TSLS and also the value adding and expanding of existing schemes which we 
<br/>are very happy about.  It also considers other areas like micro qualification grant to mitigate skills 
<br/>shortage for labour and targeting unemployed youths. One of the statements that was just made by 
<br/>the honourable Member just before me in terms of unemployment, those who have graduated but are 
<br/>unemployed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One classic example was when we had our Women’s Parliament last week.  The Sergeant at 
<br/>Arms, the lady police was a Bachelor of Science graduate, but was recruited by the Fiji Police Force.  
<br/>This is how they are creating employment.  In terms of graduates, finding other means of employment 
<br/>through the Fiji Police Force, they can further their studies. So, these are some of the things that we 
<br/>must also consider. One of the things that  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to applaud is the Merit Based Higher Education – Level 7 Scheme.  Sir, $27.4 
<br/></span><span>million has been awarded, it will be catering for 700 awards under this scheme.  From these awards, 
<br/>it will reserve for rural and maritime for Year 13 students 100 awards. This is very important because 
<br/>in the previous administration where we had awards cut off marks and some of our students from the 
<br/>maritime areas and rural areas, they were left off because of the cut-off marks.  We are thankful that 
<br/>we are given 100 awards from the 700 awards that will be reserved for rural and maritime areas. 
<br/>Given the standard of our secondary schools in rural and maritime areas, they are not the same as 
<br/>those in the urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is in terms of the Apprenticeship Scheme that is also under 
<br/></span><span>TSLS where $1 million would be allocated for the Scheme and 50 percent tuition fee to encourage 
<br/>employers  to  pay  apprenticeship  students  to  offset  expenses  or  provide  wages  top-up.  This  is 
<br/>something  that  is  welcomed  for  the  Industrial  Attachment  Allowance  Scheme  that  is  also  under 
<br/>TSLS. I would like to thank the TSLS Board and also the CEO, Dr. Hasmukh Lal, for the innovation 
<br/>that has been done. In other areas where TSLS can also improve is taking up other courses for other 
<br/>disciplined forces like the RFMF TFs that are already there that can be used so that they can get

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are a few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of my contribution this morning and our 
<br/>response and I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement this morning and also to 
<br/>all the students out there in the university, we wish you all well in your education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maritime Pine Project 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I rise to deliver my statement on the Maritime Pine Project carried out by the 
<br/>Ministry of Forestry, in  collaboration with  our partners  Fiji  Pine Limited, Fiji  Pine Trust  and the 
<br/>landowners.    Mr.  Speaker,  our  logging  operations  in  the  maritime  islands  is  a  vital  project  that 
<br/>contributes  to  our  economy  and  supports  our  local  communities.  It  is  also  a  project  where  the 
<br/>Government has also re-strategised and invested heavily since this financial year; recognising and 
<br/>addressing the situation of resource owners on these islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Government introduced the Maritime Pine Package Project with the aim of 
<br/>ensuring  the  sustainable  use  and  management  of  maritime  pine  resources  through  investments  in 
<br/>machines,  skills  training  and  inventory  of  pine  resources.  The  project  was  introduced  to  support 
<br/>maritime  communities  to  use  their  mature  pine  plantation  resources  for  the  construction  of  their 
<br/>houses or needed renovations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since logging contractors from the mainland find it unprofitable to barge 
<br/>logs  or  timber  across  to  the  mainland  and  sell  them,  the  Government  stepped  in  to  support  by 
<br/>subsidising part of the operations   through the purchase of portable sawmill machines.  The main 
<br/>objective is to support the maritime islands’ pine schemes to be equipped with appropriate harvesting 
<br/>machines and tools with the capacity to economically harvest, process and market their matured pine 
<br/>trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overall socio-economic impact of this project is to improve the livelihoods 
<br/>of maritime villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work started in Cicia and in Gau.  Since then, the Government has been 
<br/>injecting funding support into the harvesting and processing of maritime pine plantations as a capital 
<br/>project in the annual budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Maritime Pine Development Programme, the Ministry has been 
<br/>able to  support maritime islands to  develop  their pine industry as well as provide timber to  local 
<br/>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are various measurable outputs and outcomes from these maritime 
<br/>projects,  support  and  beneficiaries  including  the  communities,  private  sector  and  the  nation  as  a 
<br/>whole.    For  our  maritime  communities,  there  are  financial  benefits,  for  example,  in  in  Muani, 
<br/>payment of $60 per tonne of logs to landowners resulting so far in a total payout of $0.8 million.  
<br/></span><span>This direct financial support will enhance the livelihoods of the local landowners and their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  there  are  employment  opportunities  for  communities,  the  project  will  create 
<br/>numerous  job  opportunities  in  logging,  transportation  and  port  operations,  leading  to  increase 
<br/>employment in the local communities.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, infrastructure development, the construction and upgrading of port facilities guided 
<br/>by the Fiji  Roads Authority will improve local  infrastructure, providing long  term  benefits  to  the 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the private sector will also benefit firstly through economic activity.  The 
<br/>release of $647,000 to Tropik Wood Industries Limited will stimulate economic activity within the 
<br/>private sector through barge subsidy. Secondly, business opportunities, logistics and transportation 
<br/>sectors  will  benefit  from  the  movement  of  six  barge  loads,  each  carrying  2,000  tonnes  of  logs, 
<br/>creating new business opportunities and partnership.  Thirdly, sustainable practices, by adhering to 
<br/>sustainable logging practices, the private sector can demonstrate its commitment to environmental 
<br/>stewardship, corporate responsibility, enhancing its reputation and ensuring long-term viability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the nation as a whole, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also a significant benefits:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Expected economic growth - the overall economic contribution of this logging operation, 
<br/>including job creation and business opportunities will support national economic growth. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Sustainable  development  -  the  project  aligns  with  our  national  goals  of  promoting 
<br/>sustainable practices, ensuring that our natural resources are managed responsibly for future 
<br/>generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Enhance agriculture – the improvements in port facilities and related infrastructure will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have lasting positive impacts on national logistics and trade capabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example, the project has been able to provide timber to build more than 
<br/>50 housing structures. This has a total estimated value of more than $400,000.  Harvesting has proven 
<br/>extremely fruitful over the life of the project.  We have seen harvesting in the village of Waiqori in 
<br/>Oneata with a total log volume of 160 meters cubed, sawn timber of 92 metres cubed and 19 housing 
<br/>structures built.  Tubou and Levuka Villages on Lakeba have log volume of 70.601 metre cubed, 
<br/>sawn timber at 40.591 metre cubed and eight housing structures built.  Nasau and Korotolu Villages 
<br/>on Moce Island, a total of 129.979 metre cubed sawn timber, 73.919 metre cubed and a total of 15 
<br/>housing structures built. The village of Mataso in Kadavu with a total of 450 metres cubed of log 
<br/>volume, sawn timber of 256 metres cubed and a total of 15 housing structures built.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also seen the development of vital infrastructure, for example, the 
<br/>construction and inauguration of a jetty in Muani, Kadavu to enable the export of logs.  The first 
<br/>logging barge departed in June this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Narocake Pine Scheme in Gau has also been assisted through the Ministry of Forestry’s 
<br/></span><span>Pine Development Capital Project in processing pine posts.  The Ministry has committed a total of 
<br/>$25,000 and produced a volume of 79 cubic metres worth of $59, 724 from the sales.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, with these funds, the Narocake Pine Scheme was able to purchase a three-tonne canopy truck.  
<br/>Together with the assistance from the Ministry of Trade and Co-operatives, the scheme managed to 
<br/>develop the Narocake Co-operative Limited as part of our community development programme using 
<br/>the Fiji Pine Trust Grant under Head 32 on Maritime Development.  Mr. Speaker, Moala and Lakeba 
<br/>has also been assisted through the Housing Rehabilitation Programme - 15 houses in Moala and 11 
<br/>houses in Lakeba had been provided for with a total value of more than $150,000.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the coming financial year, the Ministry will continue to expand maritime 
<br/>pine projects to ensure the socio-economic benefits of the forestry sector, including rehabilitation, 
<br/>rebuilding  and economic development  are extended to  our maritime communities.  This year, we 
<br/>have a number of planned activities to further this objective and we will continue to support logistics 
<br/>for commercial pine development, which includes the port construction at Wainiyabia, Lakeba and 
<br/>Solodamu, Kadavu. We will conduct a sustainable forest management for villages in Kadavu, Lakeba 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Gau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have Rehabilitation Integrated Restocking Programme with the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>and the Ministry of Forestry’s research and development for Muani, including planting short term 
<br/>agricultural produce to combat food security, planting of grasses to prevent wash-off sediments, the 
<br/>planting  of  food  trees  and  financial  literacy  training  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Co-
<br/>operatives and other financial institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also partake in the felling, sawmilling, timber treatment and 
<br/>marketing of the Narocake Pine Scheme, Lakeba Pine Scheme and the Kadavu Pine Scheme.  The 
<br/>support will include the purchase of equipment to assist in the felling of logs, processing of logs, 
<br/>ensuring consistent management of machines, treatment of the logs as well as marketing the finished 
<br/>timber product.  We will continue to support the maritime islands pine scheme using our commercial 
<br/>maritime pine subsidy in barge and boat fare to ensure the commercial viability of these projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the collaboration and support we receive from the Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji 
<br/>Pine Trust is invaluable to the success of the project.  We thank them for the invaluable contributions 
<br/>to our maritime communities.  The Ministry will continue to work closely with Fiji Pine Trust.  This 
<br/>year the total budget allocated for Fiji Pine Trust under the Capital Grant is $1.7 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to working with Fiji Pine Trust in developing a 20-Year Forest Management Plan, 
<br/>with harvesting schedules for all pine schemes in the maritime islands, we will work with the Fiji 
<br/>Pine  Trust  on  the  activities  mentioned  above,  including  the  development  and  construction  of  the 
<br/>jetties, silviculture including the establishment of a pine nursery in Kadavu, training awareness and 
<br/>business support for pine scheme workers.  It is through Fiji Pine Limited’s subsidiary Tropik Wood 
<br/>Industries  Limited  that  the  logs  are  processed  through  Fiji’s  largest  sawmill,  producing  both 
<br/>woodchip mill for export and being an independent power producer, exporting excess power to the 
<br/>national grid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Finally the Wainiyabia Wharf is going to be constructed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the 
<br/>honourable Minister for her Ministerial Statement on the maritime projects and the things that the 
<br/>Government has been doing.  I noticed also the amount of money in investment that is going into this 
<br/>particular sector.  We have had maritime pine around the islands over many years - Lakeba, Kadavu, 
<br/>Lomaiviti and various places.  It is good to see that the emphasis that is taking place that should help 
<br/></span><span>out the people in the maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the forestry sector, if there is one big crisis that is happening in this sector, 
<br/>that if we are not too careful in the few years ahead of us, the sector will run out of raw materials.  
<br/>There is basically a shortage of trees that is happening, this is impacting Tropik Wood right now, and 
<br/>I think Fiji Pine in particular there is a particular concern for this.  This calls upon the forestry sector 
<br/>in Fiji to be innovative in the way it approaches what it tries to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  very  glad  to  hear  about  all  the  economics,  the  plans  that  are  in  place  to  provide 
<br/></span><span>assistance for the people in the villages. I was actually in Dravuwalu and Mataso Villages earlier this 
<br/></span><span>year.  It is good that we have the plans but one of the problems that we have is execution; you have 
<br/>a plan and a budget and execution.

<div><span>When I was in Mataso this year, the sawn timber that had been cut down in the forest had still 
<br/>not been brought down to the village, it was rotting in the forest. I think it is very important for us to 
<br/>realize that when you have these plans, the execution is absolutely critical. In the village of Mataso,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one of the things that was in the agreement was, I do not know what the term is, in our iTaukei </span><span>na</span><span>
<br/></span><span>sui ni vale</span><span>; the main timber for the houses.  They were to do 15, they only did seven. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There is timber that is out there that is  cut, that is rotting away. Some 
<br/>of the houses that they were going to build in Mataso and around Kadavu, they were supposed to 
<br/>have the direct post that goes right from the ground to the top of the house.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- In the forest there, these thing are rotting.  What I am saying is, the 
<br/>plans are very good, they need to be executed well because when you go to these villages people 
<br/>complaining on the ground. Sometimes there is a hassle between the Fiji Pine and the Pine Trust of 
<br/>Fiji as to who is responsible; that is very important. The other thing that is very important, one thing 
<br/>that has always been in the forestry sector, they have always said, “we are asset rich but cash poor.”  
<br/>This is the same too for the islands.  If you go to some of the islands, Lakeba, I am </span><span>Vola Ni Kawa 
<br/>Bula</span><span> in Lakeba, I planted pine in Lakeba in the villages of Nasaqalau and Waciwaci ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- ..but the people complain about the returns not coming to them. They 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are not getting those returns on the ground where people matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is the complaint.  I was in my </span><span>Bose ni Yavusa</span><span> last Saturday, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is what they were talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we have these high and mighty plans, very 
<br/>good. But make sure you execute it, make sure you make it happen so that the people on the ground 
<br/>can get some returns in their pockets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is absolutely critical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that I must say too for the forestry sector, one that has 
<br/>been a private company in Fiji now that they are looking (because of this shortage of raw products 
<br/>that we have) to innovate, to look at new kinds of things that they should plant. Xinfa which has two 
<br/>solars in Vanua Levu, they are beginning to do tissue culture of acacia and eucalyptus. Why? Because 
<br/>they mature much faster and we need these raw materials to go into the sawmills to produce those 
<br/>things. I encourage the Ministry of Forestry and the whole sector, what you are doing is good, do fix 
<br/></span><span>the execution, make sure it reaches the bottom, do not just look at your outputs, ticking your boxes, 
<br/></span><span>make sure you have an impact on the outcomes on people’s lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, being innovative in what you are doing.  If you have done quite well in the past, 
<br/>you also need to be innovative, maybe these other forestry products and trees we need to look at; 
<br/>acacia and eucalyptus, things that mature faster because our sawmills are running out of inputs of the 
<br/>raw material to allow them to maintain the employment that we talk about, to maintain the industries

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1391 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that they feed into. Overall, this sector, exports have been declining, imports have been increasing.  
<br/>So, I value this, honourable Minister congratulations with this, just make sure we hit the execution 
<br/>right and we make sure it makes an impact on the people on the grassroots. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Your concern is noted given the likely shortage of our timber supply to the 
<br/>sawmills, et cetera.  But that problem has existed for quite some time.  Even my time as a Director 
<br/>of  Fiji  Pine  Limited,  because  good  raw  timber  for  milling  were  converted  to  chips,  but  now  that 
<br/>concern still lingers on, and I hope the Ministry of Forestry takes note.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for her 
<br/>statement this morning on the Maritime Pine Scheme, very much long-awaited by those that own 
<br/>pine  in  the  maritime  areas.  As  she  had  presented  this  morning,  it  is  also  triggering  a  lot  of 
<br/>developments and economic activities in those islands where they are harvesting from.  I would like 
<br/>to throw a bit of caution in the whole process and, that is, as we harvest the pine in these islands, I 
<br/>am suggesting that there is a study made as to whether it is proper to replant the pine, or you turn that 
<br/>land into farming land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years,  I  think,  if  there  is  a  study  at  the  Ministry  and  when  I  was  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary there, I saw that some of the pine were initially brought to Fiji to be planted in areas where 
<br/>you cannot plant anything else.  When it grew, it thrived, and it turned into an industry.  But what 
<br/>happened over the years as pine grew, the land began to be fertile for farming, especially in those 
<br/>islands where land is not as big, there is a shortage of land, and for those land where pines are planted, 
<br/>a study can be made if that can be turned into farmland, then please do not replant pine and then turn 
<br/>it into farmland. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also a study that would be lying down there in the Ministry when we had this big 
<br/>flood in the West few years ago. One of the reasons we concluded was that, that landslide that was 
<br/>happening because of the way we replant pine.  As you know, when pine is harvested, before you 
<br/>replant you have to burn down where it was harvested so that the glue that is in the pine is all burnt 
<br/>out.  It attracts insects that will eat the new pine plant that you will plant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, in the process of burning it down, it burns holes down where the stems of the pines 
<br/>are cut off and so you have these holes in the ground and we thought that when it rained heavily at 
<br/>that time, water seeped into those holes where the pine trees were, and it assisted in that big landslide 
<br/>that occurred. So, if you are going to replant in the islands, and you know all those pines are up on 
<br/>the hills, I hope that there is also a study that is made that we have to replant that. It does not trigger 
<br/></span><span>off this landslide of whatever land is available there now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you again to the honourable Minister for the maritime pine project. I know that it is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>project that they have been waiting for, for a long time, and I hope that it will be pursued well.
