<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>SUGAR RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF FIJI  2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Sugar  Research 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Institute of Fiji 2016-2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to present the overview of the Sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar Industry for submitting the 
<br/>responses to the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF).  
<br/>The Committee commends SRIF for its thorough research.  However, it is imperative that technology 
<br/>transfer be used by farmers, as research could only be useful if farmers are able to use innovative 
<br/>knowledge to improve productivity.  We hope that in the coming years, the Extension Officers from 
<br/>FSC can join SRIF to facilitate the knowledge and technology transfer to farmers.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While reviewing the SRIF Annual Reports, the Committee documented that SRIF has not 
<br/>been  fully  engaged  with  farmers  in  crop  diversification,  resulting  in  poor  soil  health  and  limited 
<br/>stream of income. While the sugar sector is not profitable, it could be due to lack of technical support 
<br/>and hand-holding our farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Sugar  Research  Institute  of  Fiji  needs  to  engage  in  training  our 
<br/>farmers to adopt integrated personnel management and integrated decision response to control and 
<br/>eradicate best decision which SRIF also needs to invest in social media for outreach programmes, 
<br/>and their contingency plan should there be any future pandemic to ensure business continuity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also received a list of speakers identified by the various Whips: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic and Sugar Industry; 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Ratu J.B. Niudamu; and 
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first let me thank the Committee for the great 
<br/>work – the Chairman and Members of the Committee for the efforts that we have seen through the 
<br/>Reports that we have debating throughout the course of the week. Since this is the last of the Sugar 
<br/>Report, I asked our Caucus if I can take up one of the speaking slots so that maybe I can help the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  and  Minister  for  External  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communication to understand things about the sugar industry better and of course 
<br/>perhaps also assure every Fijian that we all know and understand very well the importance of the 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The role of government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are well aware, growth is so important to 
<br/>this. But let us not only look at FSC in isolation.  The Government has done so much with other 
<br/>Government Commercial Companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Energy Fiji Limited (EFL), the status in which EFL was in and how it has progressed over 
<br/>the years to where it is now;  Fiji Rice, AMA, Food Processors Limited, Fiji Pine Limited, but when 
<br/>it comes to FSC, Sir, this is one thing, and I know the honourable Prime Minister cannot come up  
<br/>with a Cabinet Paper to shut FSC down tomorrow because Government has a social responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  want  FSC  to  be  profitable,  but  when  it  comes  to  hard  decisions  of  the  approximately 
<br/></span><span>250,000 individuals who directly or indirectly depend on the industry, because of the Government’s 
<br/>social responsibility, it will continue to support FSC.  That is what previous governments have been 
<br/>doing all these years, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That needs to be made clear to everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, we want FSC to be profitable, but there are so many factors, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir  and  it  has  been  discussed  so  many  times  in  this  House.    Let  us  not  forget  the  fact  that  the 
<br/>Government  has  a  social  responsibility  and  only  Government  can  afford  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  
<br/>Though  it  may  be  operating  at  a  loss,  but  we  have,  because  it  is  important  to  keep  the  economy 
<br/></span><span>functioning.  It is important because of the people who are dependent on the industry.  Let us not 
<br/></span><span>discuss issues in isolation.  Let us contextualise it so that it makes a lot of sense, particularly when 
<br/>we are dealing with policies and strategic directions in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday  we  were  told  that  we  had  been  doing  nothing  in  the  last  16  years  or  so.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, one of the key things that Government did when it came in 2006 was the land and the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners have benefitted from CBUL.  Land was heavily politicised.  I will not go into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>1538 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the past issues, but every Government that comes in, the subject is that we see now, most of those 
<br/>were initiated under the term of the previous government.  The mill upgrades, I know that there was 
<br/>an  upgrade  during  the  Labour  Government  but  that  did  not  work  out  well,  so  the  incoming 
<br/>government has to take over the responsibility.  These are past issues and problems that we can learn 
<br/>from, but we have to take the responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just focus on the report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have about five minutes left.  I will just 
<br/>focus on some of the key roles of SRIF, not on the recommendations, as it was established in 2006.  
<br/>I want to focus on dissemination of technology and information needed for increased productivity, 
<br/>profitability and sustainability of the sugar industry.  I have some recommendations to the honourable 
<br/>Minister.    As  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Usamate,  one  of  the  key  problems  that  we  have, 
<br/>particularly in the primary industry sector, is the transfer of technology from research to extension.  
<br/>We visited two universities in the Philippines a few years back.  To honourable Tunabuna, this is the 
<br/>Philippine National University in Los Banos and Pampanga State Agricultural University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key lessons that we have learnt from there is the Research Division also have their 
<br/>Extension Division.  Honourable Minister, one of the problems in Fiji is Research does their research 
<br/>and then they convene the Extension workers and then they transfer the information under technology 
<br/>to them.  How it is disseminated depends on the Extension officers.  But Philippines came up with 
<br/>this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of this issue.  Probably  this is something that Fiji  can learn from.  
<br/>Research must have its own extension so that there is no gap in between, and Research ensures that 
<br/>the transfer of technology is expedited and ensures that it reaches the target groups as well.  That is 
<br/>something we can learn particularly from the role of SRIF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to  talk  on  the  issue  of  soil  and  leaf  analytical  services, 
<br/>particularly in the role of SRIF.  It states that SRIF is responsible for a few areas and I will just speak 
<br/>on a few areas. I will just start on soil and analytical services, crop diversification and effective land 
<br/>utilisation.  On soil and leaf analytical services, again honourable Minister, there was a Mr. Bunda, 
<br/>he did a good article on sugar production in Fiji when he was in charge of Extension Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I hope, honourable Minister, if you can get hold of that report because that is something we 
<br/>have been arguing for a long time.  The soil condition in Fiji is one of the major contributing factors 
<br/>to the low production level, because of the pH level.  Most of the land in Fiji has a problem with 
<br/>either acidity or alkalinity.  Therefore, the intervention must be correct as well, whether we do aglime, 
<br/>which is calcium carbonate or we do gypsum which his calcium sulphate for alkalinity.  This is a big 
<br/>issue because we keep chemical fertilisers year in, year out.  One of the problems in sugar production 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji is the pH level. We fix the pH level, you will see a definite increase in sugar production, that 
<br/></span><span>is guaranteed. Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one is on crop diversification.  Sir, crop diversification has been there for a long 
<br/>time. When I came out of Ratu Kadavulevu School, I joined Native Land Development Corporation 
<br/>(NLDC) which is an extension arm of NLTB. Sir, Ratu Mara back in the Development Programme 
<br/>8 (DP8) he had already predicted that we will one day lose the preferential arrangement and secondly 
<br/>the diversification in the sugar industry is on tropical fruits.  I was part of that project, we did papaya 
<br/>and mangoes in Legalega. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Tikoduadua talked about macadamia nuts or duriano.  That 
<br/>was  the  diversification  programme  but  then  over  the  years,  nothing  happened.  Some  strategic 
<br/>decisions should have taken place long time ago, but it did not happen.  The diversification, let me 
<br/>repeat, was predicted and put in place by Ratu Mara way back in the DP8 (tropical fruits). Now I 
<br/>would insist, let us look at the potential in Vanua Levu.  If can beef up the production in Vanua Levu, 
<br/>we can have other options on Viti Levu, particularly when it comes to diversification.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1539 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can discuss this later, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but that is something that we need to seriously 
<br/>consider.  That diversification as I have stated, it has been there for a long time but that political will 
<br/>and decision needs to  take place and  I am  thankful.  We look  forward to  the FAO Report and, of 
<br/>course, perhaps  the convening  of a Special Committee as well, not  only to  look  at  sugar, but the 
<br/>whole agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May  I  just  conclude,  with  effective  land  utilisation.  Honourable  Minister,  back  in  2014  a 
<br/>database has already been drawn for FSC. The current Director for NDMO, that was her project when 
<br/>she came out of University but I do not know what has happened to that database. We were there 
<br/>during the launching in 2014, excellent database but how do we translate that database into execution; 
<br/>that is a big problem.  If we can dig into that, I have some information, I can help you honourable 
<br/>Minister, but of course definitely we need to take the industry forward and I thank the Committee for 
<br/>their work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give my statement on SRIF, I would like to 
<br/>comment on honourable Premila Kumar’s comment about gender balance or gender equality in the 
<br/>industry. We have re-instated mill area committees now in all three Mills and a majority are ladies.  
<br/>They have also appointed the first lady iTaukei Director on FSC Board, so I am trying to go in that 
<br/>direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did enquire about the database, in fact it was sitting in the FSC and FSC workers were not 
<br/>trying to share that. This is the problem that these five organisations had; they were not talking to 
<br/>each other.  When I came in and saw that the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing, 
<br/>that is why I am saying, why should we duplicate projects when we have already invested in those 
<br/>projects.  Again, I am heading towards that direction as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On crop diversification, in Thailand we realised that when the sugar price is low, they go and 
<br/>plant cassava.  That was what I saw but currently sugarcane prices from last year is good so they 
<br/>went back to cane. But we cannot basically encourage them to go into cassava otherwise Labasa Mill 
<br/>will close in no time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the soil conditions,  yes, that problem  we have come to  know.   We have  to  encourage 
<br/>farmers to add aglime but they are not willing to because it will cost them extra money. They  are 
<br/>expecting the Government to give it free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from last year, Professor Santiago Mahimairaja (CEO), he tried to promote that. 
<br/></span><span>So, when we went out to the farms to talk to the farmers, they said that they could not afford $25. So, 
<br/></span><span>we had to look at another set of subsidies; honourable Kamikamica, you are laughing.  Another thing, 
<br/>honourable Kamikamica said yesterday about the balance sheets of FSC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  inform  Parliament  today  that  for  the  first  time  FSC  will  present  its  2024 
<br/>balance sheet by September (the closing period is June).  Just another information, FSC’s balance 
<br/>sheet  was  very  weak  and  no  bank  was  willing  to  touch  it  because  of  what  had  happened;  FSC’s 
<br/>valuation  of  assets  was  15  years  old  so  we  revalued  FSC’s  properties.  It  has  jumped  from  $190 
<br/>million to $600 million which will be reflected in the balance sheet and, of course, the Government 
<br/></span><span>has written off $200 million of that. So, come the next balance sheet, honourable Kamikamica you 
<br/></span><span>will be very happy to see.   That does not mean that the balance sheet is right, we lose our interest on 
<br/>the farm itself. We have to work hard to make it possible. So, now with the balance sheet, I am pretty 
<br/>sure all the local banks will be willing to lend money to us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar 
<br/>Research Institute of Fiji 2016 to 2021 Annual Reports.  As we delve into the details of these Reports, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>1540 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to underscore the critical role SRIF has in our sugar industry.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SRIF stand as a sole Sugar Research Institute in Fiji. Its contribution 
<br/>ranges from the development of 19 commercial  sugarcane varieties towards advancement in crop 
<br/>improvement,  pest  and  diseases  management,  soil  health  research  mechanisation  and  sustainable 
<br/>farming practices.  These initiatives are crucial for the increase in productivity ensuring the long term 
<br/>resilience of the sugarcane sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ongoing  Research  Innovation  provided  by  the  SRIF  have  equipped  our  farmers  with 
<br/>necessary  tools  and  knowledge  to  navigate  the  challenges  posed  by  the  climate  change,  market 
<br/>fluctuations and other external factors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to extend my appreciation to the recently appointed CEO,  Dr. Vinesh Kumar 
<br/>whose  proactive  approach  has  been  instrumental  in  disseminating  critical  information  on  the 
<br/>sugarcane varieties, pest and disease management and best farm practices to our farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just two weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had the pleasure of immigrating the Wairuku Pest and 
<br/>Disease  Station  and  Cane  Breeding  Section  in  Dobuilevu.  These  initiatives  reflect  Dr.  Kumar’s 
<br/>commitment and the institute’s dedication to providing good services to our farmers. As elaborated 
<br/>in the Report, we recognise the necessity of establishing a formal Key Performance Indicator (KPI) 
<br/>with Research Institute of Fiji and are actively working towards this goal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  KPI  is  part  of  the  broader  initiative  to  create  a  comprehensive  Fiji  Sugar  Industry 
<br/>Strategic Plan that involves all stakeholders. Our commitment is to implement smart KPIs and regular 
<br/>monitoring mechanisms to ensure accountability and effectiveness across all operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, we support a clear demarcation of roles between the Sugar Research Institute 
<br/>and Sugar Corporation. SRIF will focus on science, extension and advisory service while FSC will 
<br/>concentrate on milling and sugar marketing.  This clear division is aimed to improve efficiency and 
<br/>streamlining operations.  Additionally, we endorse the transfer of Field Officers from FSC to SRIF 
<br/>to enhance the Institute’s capacity to provide consistent research-based guidance to farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry is fully committed to implementing these recommendations 
<br/>and  develop  strategies  for  the  industry’s  betterment.  We  acknowledge  the  challenges  but  remain 
<br/>steadfast in our efforts to enhance the performance and sustainability of the sugar industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders, including the Opposition, so that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can achieve our shared goals. Based on those remarks, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  support  the  motion  before  the 
<br/>House, I wish to share in this august House my personal experience, in realising the existence of such 
<br/>institutions, like the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently,  I  was  invited  to  the  commissioning  of  an  accommodation  facility  of  SRIF 
<br/>Dobuilevu  Cane  Breeding  Station  in  Ra,  together  with  honourable  Matasawalevu,  where  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister commissioned this Station.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this station is the birthplace of all 19 cane varieties that were released in 
<br/>Fiji.   Currently, the Station  has a germplasm  consisting of 727 varieties, collected over the years 
<br/>around the world.  I was told that it takes around 12 to 15 years to release a cane variety.  It is a hard 
<br/>and dedicated work, and I want to thank the dedicated scientists and technician who camped at this 
<br/>site for7 months to make sure that the sugar industry continues to have improved varieties of cane 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>

<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1541 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that gives us good sugar, resistant to pests and diseases, as well as remain productive amid climate 
<br/>change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to fully support the recommendation of the Standing Committee, 
<br/>especially on the need for extension services of FSC to be under SRIF, as alluded to earlier by the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  Opposition  and  I  am  grateful  that  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  has 
<br/>informed the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FSC by far, Mr. Speaker, has too many problems on its own.  It should remain focussed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on its core business and that is milling.  Let SRIF handle the extension services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, I have seen in the papers, and I was personally told as of now by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Sugar about the opening of the new pest and disease screening facility at Wairuku in 
<br/>Rakiraki.  It will also be a hub for technology transfer. This is exciting times for sugarcane farmers 
<br/>in Ra, as we hear about the plans of opening a new mill in Rakiraki, not only for sugar but other 
<br/>sugarcane products.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank SRIF its new local CEO, Dr. Vinesh Kumar, and his dedicated team of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mostly local scientists for their hard work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support the recommendation of the Standing on Economic Affairs and I fully support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, Sir, let me take this time to 
<br/>pay tribute to two of my colleagues in the Tourism and Civil Aviation, who have recently left us. 
<br/>Firstly, Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya of Kabara, who was one of the first trainee engineers with Qantas 
<br/>back in those days.  He became an aircraft engineer, came back to Fiji, served with Qantas, and he 
<br/>was one of the founding members for ATS which is now a well-established organisation with the 
<br/>shareholding built by the Government and the workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eliki had served as chairman of CAAF and did a great job in ensuring that CAAF lived up to 
<br/>its Charter.  He was a person known for the standards that he set, and we pay tribute to him for his 
<br/>contribution to tourism and civil aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mua Ieli Taukave, has also passed away.  A true son of Fiji and Rotuma, a dear 
<br/>friend who played a big role in Air Pacific back in those days from the 1970s and until recently, he 
<br/></span><span>was managing the Rotuma Airport.  So, I would like to ask the House that we pay tribute to these 
<br/></span><span>two larger than life personalities, who have contributed so much to tourism and aviation in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still on Aviation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to share with the House with great joy that the 
<br/>negotiations with the Americans in terms of the service to Dallas has now been approved and Fiji 
<br/>Airways should be flying to Dallas on 10</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024.  So, that is quite significant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we know, the Americans would only talk to us if we liberalise our aviation policy which 
<br/>we did.  Cabinet approved the liberation and dialogue with the Americans started in December last 
<br/></span><span>year in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Now, it is approved, and the service to Dallas will be on 10</span><span>th</span><span> December 
<br/></span><span>so  within  12  months,  we  are  able  to  negotiate  and  have  Fiji  Airways  fly  to  Dallas.    So,  it  is  the 
<br/>execution, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji, I am very passionate about 
<br/>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and sugar is a significant feedstock into the production of aviation 
<br/>fuel. I would like to see FSC thrive so that Fiji can produce its own aviation fuel, going

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forward, being a country that relies on aviation come tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you look at the report here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed a very significant statement here, 
<br/>where  SRIF  says,  and  I  quote,  “…it  is  not  about  increasing  the  size  of  land  but  increasing 
<br/>productivity”, which in this case is yield.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, the yield is 47 tonnes per hectare whereas the global standard is 90 
<br/>tonnes per hectare.  In Labasa, when we did the consultation on the Sugar Bill, in Labasa around the 
<br/>Waiqele Airport area, there is a farmer there, who was yielding about 130 tonnes per hectare.  In 
<br/>Nadi, there is a farmer who is doing 150 tonnes per hectare. So, given the size of the amount of land 
<br/>that is available for cane farming, if you increase the yield, we can easily reach our target. We need 
<br/>about 3.5 million tonnes to produce ethanol.  So, we need to reach that, we need to go to 3.5 million 
<br/>tonnes to enable us to really produce sufficient ethanol for SAF.  So, from aviation perspective, this 
<br/>is very, very important and I would like to see this happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is being shared today by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Sugar, the extension arm, role of SRIF,  I think we should encourage that.   It  is  also 
<br/>mentioned here in the Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on their long-term establishment of business arm of 
<br/>SRIF.  If they can do that, Sir, I believe we can do 3.5 million tonnes of sugar and reuse sufficient 
<br/>ethanol for aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not want to visit the old days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but remember when you were sitting on 
<br/>the other side, we pleaded for a bipartisan committee to look into sugar, but we were told to go and 
<br/>fly kites. They could not agree to include us in a bipartisan committee.  That was eight years ago, we 
<br/>were pleading with them.  But now, with the new way of leadership, we are more inclusive, let us 
<br/>work together to make this happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am quite encouraged by what I see here with SRIF, the technology we can introduce and to 
<br/>fully manage the work of SRIF, extend to the cane farmers to produce the cane crop that we want.  I 
<br/>am quite pleased with the recent announcement by the honourable Minister that the focus will be on 
<br/>Sigatoka to increase production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadroga/Navosa are also big in sugar production.  It was only possible, Mr. Speaker, because 
<br/>of the efficient rail network.  You know you have this main trunk and then it goes right into the 
<br/>valleys.  A company was picking their crop right on their doorstep and that is how my Province was 
<br/>able to be a huge part of sugarcane crop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to see more of that to come back.  It is unfortunate we did not repair the Sigatoka 
<br/>Bridge, but you need to go into areas like my Province of Nadroga/Navosa and Ra to enable us to 
<br/>make that target. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  quite  encouraged  by  the  SRIF  Report.  I  think  it  can  be  done  with 
<br/>commitment and new systems, scientists and all that running the show, we should be alright.  So, I 
<br/>support the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji was one of the 
<br/></span><span>top research institutions in the world. That is when we were working very closely; all the stakeholders 
<br/>with the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Extension needs to do thriving 
<br/>work.  The Extension Officers, the area, vehicle and everything and they were fully backed by the 
<br/>Industry.  You had good educated people in their Extension Division, as apart from the Field Officers  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1543 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the milling area.  When these two combine well, things work out well for the Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then you have a very robust sugar industry with the growers, and the landowners were slowly 
<br/>stepping into their area of getting direct deductions straight from the industry whenever there was a 
<br/>cane payment.  So, everyone benefited, right down to the landowners.  We at iTLTB knew quite well.  
<br/>That was when Deo Charan Singh was the Accountant with FSC in Lautoka.  He was later posted to 
<br/>Brussels, and I do not know where he is now.  So, those were the days when SRIF was really up there 
<br/>- top notch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to add into what you have just said 
<br/>on research.  Of course, I agreed that there was quite a lot of research being undertaken with SRIF. 
<br/>When we went there, they were discussing the findings and, of course, they improved the varieties 
<br/>that they have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, one of the problems that we noted from the Committee, is the low uptake of the 
<br/>new varieties. This is where we see the need to review the overall structure of the industry.   You 
<br/>have heard yesterday that I alluded to the cane payment system.  Farmers will only improve their 
<br/>variety  if  they  are  being  paid.  If  they  are  not  sufficiently  paid,  then  they  will  not  improve  their 
<br/>varieties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues that has been raised by the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition is on diversification.  There has been quite a lot of work already done by farmers.  
<br/>With the assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture, some farmer groups are already established.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, I was at Nubutautau and this farmer group from Sabeto came all the way there to 
<br/>train the villagers in planting bongo chillies. This co-operative, the New Valley Co-operative, they 
<br/>are based at Sabeto, they will be purchasing all those bongo chillies that will be planted by the people 
<br/>in the highlands.  So, it is already happening, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  we  are  developing  a  new  project  under  the 
<br/>Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and, of course, with Ministry of Agriculture on a $20 million 
<br/>project to target Vanua Levu on diversification.  If you can do it in Vanua Levu, as the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition had just said, then we can upscale it into Viti Levu.  Try to do it on a small 
<br/></span><span>scale, then upscale it on a big scale.   Of course, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be 
<br/></span><span>happy about what we are trying to do there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition has mentioned about the social responsibility of 
<br/>Government.  Of course, we have the social responsibility, but we also have to look at the economic 
<br/>benefits and cost to the people of this country.  I think, over time, we have been subsiding this industry 
<br/>for long and we need to look at the economic costs and benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister yesterday, mentioned about the elephant in the room 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I totally agree with him on that.  The elephant in the room in Fiji politics is the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, there is also the Greek mythology of the Pandora’s box.  I think the Pandora’s box 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Fiji politics is the Fiji sugar and I think it is time to open the box now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution, and I do support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion before the House.

<div><span>MINISTER FOR MULTI-ETHNIC AFFAIRS AND SUGAR INDUSTRY 
<br/>(Hon. C.J. Singh) 
<br/></span><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/>Response to Question No. 123/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonnes of Sugar Cane Crushed 
<br/>Over the last five years, the tonnage of sugar cane crushed has varied due to several factors, 
<br/>including weather conditions and operational challenges. The data is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Season 
<br/></span><span>2019 
<br/>2020 
<br/>2021 
<br/>2022

<div><span>Cane Crushed (Tonnes) 
<br/></span><span>1,806,572 
<br/>1,729,171 
<br/>1,417,185 
<br/>1,639,004 
<br/>1,565,564 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  highest tonnage was  recorded  in 2019,  primarily due to  favourable  weather conditions and 
<br/>operational efficiencies. However, the subsequent years saw variations, with a notable drop in 2021 
<br/>due to severe weather conditions, including Cyclone Yasa, which caused extensive crop damage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Amount of Sugar and Molasses Produced 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The production  of sugar  and molasses over the same period also  reflects  similar trends  as it is 
<br/>directly linked to sugarcane production:

<br/>155,812 
<br/>139,628 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar Production: </span><span>The highest output was in 2019 with 168,703 tonnes, and the lowest was in 
<br/></span><span>2021 with 133,209 tonnes, largely influenced by adverse weather and operational challenges.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Molasses Production: </span><span>Molasses production peaked in 2019 with 83,734 tonnes and was lowest in 
<br/>2023 with 68,010 tonnes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Downtime of the Mills, Dates and Cost to Repairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of mill downtime has been a matter of critical concern, driven by equipment failures and 
<br/>maintenance requirements. Before delving into the specifics, it is essential to clarify the data and 
<br/>terminology  associated  with  mill  operations  during  the  crushing  season.  There  are  four  key 
<br/>categories: Cleaning Intermission Stops, Inside Stops, Outside Stops and Actual Crushing Time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Cleaning Intermission Stops </span><span>- These are planned factory stops scheduled for the regular 
<br/>cleaning of components such as evaporators and boilers, which cannot be accessed during 
<br/>regular operations. Typically, these stops occur on Sundays. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inside  Stops  </span><span>-  These  interruptions  result  from  plant  breakdowns  and  operational  issues 
<br/>within the  factory's control,  causing the  mill to halt crushing. This  category includes the 
<br/>downtime referred to by the Honourable member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Outside Stops </span><span>- These are stoppages due to external factors beyond the mill's control, such 
<br/>as low or absent cane supply caused by poor harvesting efforts, inclement weather, logistical 
<br/>challenges, or strikes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Actual Crushing Time </span><span>- This metric represents the mill's actual operational time, calculated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by subtracting the total stoppage time from the total available operational hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past five years, the downtime and associated costs, expressed in hours, are as  follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mill                                                                  National

<div><span>8,045.2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6,873.8 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to highlight that the downtime attributed to internal factors, known as Inside Stops, 
<br/>peaked in 2019 at 2,163.6 hours and reached its lowest in 2023 with 1,558.6hours. This represents a 
<br/>substantial  reduction  of  605  hours  or  28%.  Despite  these  improvements,  the  figures  remain 
<br/>significant, and we are committed to continually reducing downtime, recognizing the challenges 
<br/>posed by our mills' century-old infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>
<div><span>iii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the stoppages due to insufficient cane supply, categorized as Outside Stops, were notably 
<br/>higher  in  2023  at  2,139.6  hours  compared  to  previous  years.  This  increase  has  led  to  rising 
<br/>operational costs for the FSC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must acknowledge that unplanned stoppages, irrespective of their cause, have detrimental effects 
<br/>on  both  the  FSC  and  our  growers.  Therefore,  it  is  imperative  that  both  the  FSC  and  our  farmers 
<br/>collaborate closely to address these issues. The FSC should focus on minimizing Inside Stops, while 
<br/>our farmers must work to mitigate Outside Stops. Together, we can enhance operational efficiency and 
<br/>secure the industry's future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The costs of maintaining the mill operations year on year basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total running maintenance costs over these years amount to $29,148,136.

<br/></span><span>29,148,136 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  highest  costs  were  incurred  in  2020,  totalling  $6,656,104,  due  to  extensive  repairs  and 
<br/>adjustments necessitated by the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and ageing equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Ct</span><span> </span><span>was evident that the challenges faced by the FSC, included equipment failures, operational 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inefficiencies, and inconsistent cane-supply, that significantly impacted production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>While the Ministry recognizes the challenges and shortcomings faced by FSC's operations, we 
<br/>have unwavering confidence in the current board, under the leadership of Mr. Nitya Reddy. 
<br/>We are assured that they possess the vision and capability to address these issues decisively, 
<br/></span><span>steering FSC towards a path of long-term self-sufficiency and sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Government is also committed to tackling these challenges head-on. Plans are already in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>place to address the issues faced by the millers during these downtimes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>We must recognize that while farmers receive a guaranteed minimum price of $85 per tonne of 
<br/>cane, FSC operated without such guarantees from the government, especially when there is a 
<br/>shortfall  in  cane  supply.  The  inconsistent  cane  supply  has  directly  affected  FSC's  ability  to 
<br/>generate sufficient revenue to maintain their mills adequately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Therefore, it is imperative that we work together with farmers to ensure a consistent and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>adequate supply of cane, reduce stoppages, and improve the industry's  potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Let us move forward with these plans to secure a sustainable and prosperous future for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sugar industry in Fiji.
