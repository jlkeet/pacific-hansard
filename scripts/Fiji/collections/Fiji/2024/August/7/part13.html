<div><span>Critical Shortage of Dental Hygienists  
<br/>(Question No. 124/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on the strategies to resolve the critical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shortage of Dental Hygienists in public hospitals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU.  A.R.  LALABALAVU.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  answering  the  question, 
<br/>allow  me  to  please  elaborate  on  why  the  critical  shortage  and  the  strategies  the  Ministry  is 
<br/>undertaking to address the critical shortages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Dental  Assistants  and  Dental  Hygienists  posts  and  responsibilities  are 
<br/>almost the same, it is a one year course dental hygienists. Dental Assistant and Dental Hygienists is 
<br/>a  two-year  programme.  Prior  to  1998,  there  were  Junior  Dental  Assistants  graduating  from  Fiji 
<br/>School  of  Medicine  (FSM)  back  then  with  Certificate  in  Dental  Assistant  which  is  a  one-year 
<br/>programme and very few Dental Hygienists in Fiji, then, with the total number less than ten while 
<br/>Junior Dental Assistants dominated the dental workforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1998, six month bridging course was developed by FSM engaging dental staff from the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services. These all upgrade into junior Dental Assistant in the public 
<br/>hospitals. These junior dental assistants were all upgraded to Dental Hygienists graduating with a 
<br/>Certificate in Dental Hygienist at the end of 1998. Dental hygienists then performed the duty of both, 
<br/>junior dental assistants as well as dental hygienists.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2018, the last batch of dental hygienists graduated from the Fiji National 
<br/>University and the programme ceased from continuing. The reason for ceasing was that there were 
<br/>not  many  interested  in  the  Dental  Hygienist  programme  and  most  high  school  leavers  opted  for 
<br/>Dental  course  to  become  full  Dentists  or  Dental  Officers  and  then  the  FNU  introduced  the  new 
<br/>enrolment  system  where  all  school  leavers  offers  to  undertake  Bachelor  in  Dental  Surgery 
<br/>programme to undergo the first two years together with those attaining high marks at the end of the 
<br/>second  year  proceeding  to  the  Bachelor  of  Dental  Surgery  programme  with  a  total  of  five  years 
<br/></span><span>training to become fully-fledged Dental Officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due  to  the  shortage  in  dental  hygienists  in  Fiji,  the  government  in  2014  offered  20 
<br/>scholarships, with fourteen being enrolled at FNU and 7 completed the course and graduating after 
<br/>two years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2022,  Fiji  National  University  has  commenced  training  of  dental 
<br/>assistants in a one-year programme. So, at the moment the total establishment for Dental Hygienists 
<br/>is 80, total filled is 27, temporary vacant is three and vacant post is 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In answering the strategies, the Ministry is re-engaging dental hygienists retiring at 55, re-
<br/>employing  dental  hygienists  not  vaccinated,  re-engaging  dental  hygienists  over  60  but  who  are 
<br/>certified medically  fit, and we are working with our own Human Resource Department  and their 
<br/>submission will be made with regards to the strategies in the next few months. Nevertheless, we are 
<br/>being active in those initiatives that I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1509 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of there are also plans in creation of the Dental Assistant posts within the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical  Services and they will perform  duties, roles and responsibilities of Dental 
<br/>Assistants currently undertaken by Dental Hygienists in the public hospitals. So, in a nutshell, FNU 
<br/>has ceased the programme and the Ministry is strategizing how it will cater for the current vacancy 
<br/>as it is. Like I mentioned, re-hiring 55 and above, ensuring that those who were not vaccinated get 
<br/>hired back and ensure that those over 60 who are still medically fit are hired on a contractual basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Public Service Broadcasting Grant 
<br/>(Question No. 125/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament on the Public Service Broadcasting Grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  before it was brought up as part of our Cabinet 
<br/>recommendation  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics, I took a paper up to Cabinet and the release made after that 
<br/>Cabinet meeting said this, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“To ensure fairness and a level playing field in the Media Industry, the Cabinet has 
<br/>agreed to open up Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) Grant to all the media organisations 
<br/>other than the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Prime  Minister  said,  the  People’s  Coalition  Government  intends  to  engage 
<br/>other  service  providers  to  ensure  a  wider  reach  on  issues  of  public  interest  and  fair 
<br/>competition in the Media Industry.  In the past, the Government had exclusively engaged 
<br/>Fijian Broadcasting Corporation to provide public service broadcasting through radio and 
<br/>TV.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question, I thank the honourable Member for allowing 
<br/>me  to  elaborate  on  this  issue.    Prior  to  financial  year  2023-2024,  Government  had  exclusively 
<br/>engaged Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) to provide public service broadcasting through radio 
<br/>and television at an annual cost of $10.4 million, with the intention to inform and educate the Fijian 
<br/>public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In accordance with the previous PSB contract, a sum of $6,677,400 (VAT exclusive) per year 
<br/>was paid to FBC as fees for producing PSB radio programmes, and operating and maintaining two 
<br/>PSB radio stations, including the AM services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FBC  also  paid  a  fee  of  $4,600,000,  also  VAT  exclusive,  to  produce,  procure  and 
<br/>broadcast  an extensive range of PSB TV programmes and for the operation of a brand new non-
<br/>commercial PSB TV channel - FBC 2.  In essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fee under PSB contract is 
<br/>paid to FBC for the production, broadcast and transmission of Pacific local radio and TV programmes 
<br/></span><span>that are of benefit to all the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  August  2023  onwards,  after  considerable  deliberation  and  assessment,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government and the new FBCL Board, appointed on 11</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023, in consultation with the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics proposed a 44 percent 
<br/>reduction in PSB fees to radio and television with the reduced contract price.  The contract came into 
<br/>effect from August 2023. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new allocation for the Public Service Broadcast Grant is a total of $7,206,407, inclusive 
<br/>of VAT, for a term of three years from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2026.  The PSB TV - $2,599,001 
<br/>(VIP) and PSB Radio - $4,670,406 (VAT Inclusive) with a total of $7,206,407. The main objective, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of this decision was to reduce FBC’s reliance on the PSB fees and to build a self-
<br/>sustaining business as the country’s national broadcaster. This has been done without any disruption 
<br/>to the current operations of the organisation and its people and are now working hard to become more 
<br/>self- sustaining and to operate as a commercially driven organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that I highlight the allocation that the Government has made 
<br/>for the 2024-2025 Financial Year for Public Service Broadcast (TV and Radio).  This is reflected 
<br/>under Head 50 (if you still have your blue book around).  You will see that on Page No. 284 - Head 
<br/>50  –  Miscellaneous  Services,  SEG  5  –  Public  Service  Broadcast  (TV)  -  $3,766.7  million;  Public 
<br/>Service Broadcast (Radio) - $6,677,400. So, that is the total of $10.4 million (VAT exclusive) for 
<br/>both PSB Radio ($6.67 million) and PSB TV ($3.76 million). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Cabinet  on  15th  July,  2024  approved  that  while  $10.4  million  will  be 
<br/>maintained for Public Service Grant Broadcasting, $6.2 million (VAT exclusive) will be utilised for 
<br/>the engagement of FBC while $4.2 million will be utilised to engage other media service providers.  
<br/>The  Government  will  conduct  the  required  tender  process  through  an  Expression  of  Interest  and 
<br/>public  tender  for  the  provision  of  public  broadcasting  services.  In  the  past,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>Government had exclusively engaged FBC to provide Public Service Broadcasting for radio and TV.  
<br/>To ensure fairness and a level playing field, it was stated in the Cabinet Release after the Cabinet 
<br/>meeting, the Government intends to engage other service providers to ensure a wider reach on issues 
<br/>of public interest and fair competition in the media industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>elaboration  on  the  Public  Service  Broadcast  Grant.  I  am  just  interested  to  know  if  there  is  an 
<br/>allocation already of $6.6 million for FBC and the other is $4 million?  Do you pre-determine what 
<br/>is going to FBC and what will be tendered?  I am interested because the issue of AM Radio stations 
<br/>which go out into the islands.  Is that just given to FBC or is that something that is open for tender 
<br/>amongst all the other radio stations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, your assumption is correct.  That amount to FBC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the rest is opened to tender.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has just alluded to that they 
<br/></span><span>want to open up, especially in times of disaster.  We know the FBC has the AM station and the reach.  
<br/></span><span>So,  my  question  here  is,  most  of  our  people  depend  on  FBC  because  of  its  AM  transmitter  for 
<br/>information during disaster.  With the other service providers, do they have the reach or the capability 
<br/>to provide this service during times of disaster?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  ongoing  discussions  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Regional Development and Disaster Management, I have also taken into account those emergency 
<br/>needs at the time of emergency.  At the moment, we have ongoing discussions with some of our aid 
<br/>development partners who will enhance our capabilities in those areas.  Whether we will continue to 
<br/></span><span>rely on the AM or FM or other frequencies and other systems of broadcasting and telecasting, that 
<br/></span><span>will come up in the discussions that are ongoing at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe I ask the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/>direct the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communication to look at the Walesi 
<br/>issue because that will help the coverage in the remote islands as well.  My question to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister is on the Ministry’s specific programmes. I will use Ministry of Agriculture because 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1511 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they have a Department of Information in the Ministry in terms of the dissemination of information.  
<br/>One of the earlier discussions was the use of FBC, for example, for </span><span>dalo</span><span> diseases et cetera, but the 
<br/>charges  they  give  is  so  high.    Is  this  part  of  the  consideration  later  on,  on  Ministries  specific 
<br/>programmes to be included rather than just the normal broadcasting that we do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has now been brought to my attention and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intend to do something about that and make it more useable for those in difficulties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Perhaps  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communications would like to add to that.  It is the high cost for Walesi, it should be free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I am  not  too  sure  what  the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition is alluding to, but, in terms of the cost of Walesi, once you hook up there 
<br/>is no cost involved.  I guess he is referring to the coverage issue.  That has been packaged as part of 
<br/>the full review of Walesi at the moment, and I am hoping to bring that to Parliament in September or 
<br/>the sitting after that.    I know that they had some coverage issues, I am aware of that, Sir, and we are 
<br/>trying to incorporate that as well, as part of the holistic look at Walesi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  to  add  on,  Sir,  the  Walesi  going  forward  is  going  to  be  a  very  professionally-run 
<br/>organisation.  We now have a Board that has Taito Tabaleka as its Chair.  He is probably the foremost 
<br/>authority on telecommunications in Fiji.  I am not sure what they had before, but it is nothing like 
<br/>the  calibre  of  the  Board  that  is  there  now.    I  think  the  assurance  in  terms  of  execution  to  the 
<br/>Opposition, is the execution will be far better going forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We encountered that here and we looked at the streamlining of this and we 
<br/>are hooked up to Walesi and it should be a free to air service, but they were charging our Parliament 
<br/>a really big sum of money.  It was in the hundreds of thousands.  Every year, Parliament pays them 
<br/>for that service to get this streamlined into their system out into the whole of Fiji.  That was Radio 
<br/>Fiji at that time, but luckily that has been stopped by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister coming 
<br/>in and having discussions with both sides.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MOU on Defence Pacific Air Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 127/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration update Parliament on 
<br/></span><span>the Memorandum of Understanding between Fiji and Australia on the Defence Pacific Air 
<br/>Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Iliesa Vanawalu for his 
<br/>question on the Memorandum of Understanding between Fiji and Australia on a Defence Pacific Air 
<br/>Programme (DPAP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this moment, I would like to begin by expressing our gratitude to the 
<br/></span><span>Government of Australia for the support they have provided to Fiji through the Defence Pacific Air 
<br/></span><span>Programme. This exemplifies the cooperation that we share under the renewed Vuvale Partnership 
<br/>in the areas of defence and security and the strong bonds between our two nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to update Parliament that on 27th July 2024, the Government 
<br/>of Fiji signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Australia on the 
<br/>Defence Pacific Air Programme. The MOU provides the overarching governance framework that  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will facilitate the rotation of the Australian C-27 Aircraft in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the programme. our counterpart the Australian Department of Defence will operate on 
<br/>a rotational basis a C-27 Aircraft within Fiji. The aircraft undertakes a whole range of taskings that 
<br/>are  requested  by  the  different  government  ministries.  The  aircraft  provides  support  in  areas  that 
<br/>includes,  protecting  Fiji’s  maritime  domain,  delivering  government  services  in  remote  areas,  and 
<br/>supporting humanitarian assistance and disaster responses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the success of the Defence Pacific Air Programme is due to the efficient 
<br/>coordination  of  its  operations  across  government.    It  is  truly  a  whole  of  government  exercise 
<br/>coordinated  through  my  Ministry.  This  year  a  total  of  12  government  agencies  have  utilised  the 
<br/>aircraft  to  support  their  activities.  These  includes  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services 
<br/>likewise the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the C-27 has successfully completed three rotations in Fiji with its inception 
<br/>flight  in  February  this  year,  with  the  second  flight  in  April  and  the  third  in  June.  Under  the 
<br/>programme, there were over 36 flights to areas such as Rotuma, Labasa, Savusavu and also to Nadi. 
<br/>Through these flights, over 200 Government officials and members of the Disciplined Forces have 
<br/>been transported throughout Fiji to deliver critical services to the communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key activities includes:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>providing emergency medical care;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>maintenance and repairs to our schools and hospitals; plus  
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engineering assessment of our critical infrastructures to ensure Fijians remain safe.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  our  Military  Forces  has  been  able  to  resupply  its  remote  bases,  establish 
<br/>communication links, conduct search and rescue exercises and undertake community engagements. 
<br/>Moreover, five maritime aerial patrols have been conducted for the surveillance of our vast Exclusive 
<br/>Economic Zone and disrupt illegal fishing, identify suspect vessels and respond to maritime hazards 
<br/>and pollution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  importantly  the  Defence  Pacific  Air  Programme  has  assisted  the 
<br/>Government in accessing some of the remote areas of Fiji, delivering water tanks, school supplies, 
<br/>communication equipment and training activities to Rotuma.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform this august House that the fourth rotation commenced 
<br/></span><span>on Monday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> August and is scheduled to conclude on 17th August.  So, the plane is in Nausori 
<br/>right  now.  This  morning  the  aircraft  transported  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Maritime  Safety 
<br/>Authority of Fiji personnel to Rotuma.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  highlight  that  the  rotation  present  valuable  learning  and 
<br/>development opportunities for Fijian Government personnel. This rotation enables our personnel to 
<br/>gain diverse experiences, broaden their skills and contribute to their overall professional growth and 
<br/>effectiveness in serving our nation.  We will carefully assess the results and the findings from each 
<br/></span><span>rotation  to  inform  the  Ministry  future  considerations  aimed  at  strengthening  and  advancing  our 
<br/></span><span>potential future air capabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I wish to emphasise that this august House, security continues to 
<br/>be  a  top  priority  for  the  Fijian  Government.  We  are  committed  to  working  closely  with  our 
<br/>development  partners  such  as  the  Government  of  Australia  to  enhance  a  defence  capabilities  and 
<br/>maritime security.

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1513 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Just  a supplementary question.  How do the Ministries access  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>flight? Do they come to the Ministry of Home Affairs to request or what is the process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr, Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/>Yes, you are right. We are only the coordinating centre. The schedule goes out to all the Ministries 
<br/>in terms of the time available that the aircraft will be here. It is two weeks in every two months. It is 
<br/>up to them to give us a list of tasking that they want to use the aircraft for. So, it is operated by the 
<br/>Australians but it is for us to decide the missions to which the aircraft flies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Just a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. What form of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>air assistance do we get from our partners in the event of disaster in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, our defence partners are many, Australia is just one 
<br/>of them, New Zealand is another and France also. In the emergencies of the past, the closer countries 
<br/>that are closer to Fiji would normally provide air support to us whether it be in strategic lift or just 
<br/>normal cargo and people transportation.  So, countries like Australia would normally provide a C130 
<br/>Aircraft. In this case they are providing us with C27 which is a slightly smaller aircraft which can 
<br/>land in much smaller airfields and New Zealand also does. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> They also have surveillance aircrafts that do surveillance of our maritime zone so they do a 
<br/>survey as well after the times of disaster.  Not only  but they also have rotary-wings too. So, in the 
<br/>past there have been helicopters that they provide to Fiji from the Royal New Zealand Airforce by 
<br/>the same token as well.  The Americans have been here with their Seahawks and Black Hawks and 
<br/>the Australians too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- My question to the honourable Minister is, how many passengers can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>travel on this aircraft and whether it can carry cargo? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, this particular aircraft that we have can carry 40 
<br/>passengers. Of course it can carry a small vehicle like land rover. It can carry a bit of cargo too. If it 
<br/>carries both there is a limitation in terms of how much of which it can take but no cargo 40 people 
<br/>can travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, I am not too familiar with the technicalities 
<br/>of the aircraft but there was an exercise that we also had done with the Australians was the status of 
<br/>all our airfields in Fiji.  I remember Australia used to have the creamer which is a short take of aircraft 
<br/></span><span>and particularly during emergencies. So, I am not sure whether that programme will continue now 
<br/></span><span>because of the aircraft that is already in place given that the remote islands needs to be serviced as 
<br/>well, the status of our airfields in the rural areas which the survey has already been undertaken by 
<br/>Australia? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition for that question.  He is right.  Towards the end of the term of the last Government when 
<br/>the  honourable  Member  was  Minister  for  Defence,  Government  had  commissioned  the  Royal 
<br/>Australian Air Force to conduct a study of the capabilities of all of our landing strips.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That study has been completed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have the report.  On 26</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, 
<br/>under Cabinet Decision 219/2023, Cabinet had endorsed this decision to develop our air capability 
<br/>for Fiji, based on that study that had already been made. Now, Cabinet had already said, ‘yes’, but in 
<br/>the interim before this study is going to be put into place, because that was the study made by the 
<br/>Australians.  We have to decide what we need, and we will need experts both from locals and the 
<br/>Australians to help us decide on the kind of air capability that we need. I hope you understand that.

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, we do not have any determination on the kind of aircraft we have, you mentioned 
<br/>Caribou, so Caribou has been replaced by the C-27.  It is a short landing and short take-off aircraft.  
<br/>So, you could say that the C-27 is the kind of aircraft that we need in Fiji.  That depends if we do 
<br/>need  the  fixed-wing  air  capability,  but  it  is  actually  quite  a  good  aircraft.    But  until  that  study is 
<br/>completed, we will not make any determinations in terms of what Government actually needs for its 
<br/>purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is also thinking that what is the best way to support these capabilities once they 
<br/>come to us.  Because if you remember in the past, RFMF had two helicopters and they were the only 
<br/>aircrafts that belongs to the State at that time.  So, we need to decide in terms of what we have in Fiji, 
<br/>integrate that with what the Australians might want to offer us in terms of capability and decide what 
<br/>we  need  in  terms  of  rotary  or  fixed-wing  aircrafts  that  we  could  use.  But  that  is  already  on 
<br/>Government’s pipeline, I want to assure Parliament in that regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  interim,  before  this  comes  online,  Government  had  decided  that  it  would  seek 
<br/>Australia’s assistance under the Vuvale Partnership.  So, I have written to the Australian Minister for 
<br/>Defence – honourable Richard Marles, and he had agreed to send this aircraft in the interim for us to 
<br/>use.  But in the long term, we will need to finish this study and decide for us the kind of air platforms 
<br/>we need that will get the greatest reach in the way that our islands are spread within our maritime 
<br/>group.

<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is on drugs trafficking and its getting more 
<br/>complex, more sophisticated nowadays and most of these are done under water.  I am just wondering 
<br/>if part of this arrangement  and the capability of this  service to  track those.  I know that they use 
<br/>technology, GPS, et cetera, below the sea, could it be part of that?  I know most of the drugs coming 
<br/>into Fiji are transported under water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  not  quite  aware  that  they  are  using 
<br/>submarines  to  comes  to  Fiji  but  jokes  aside,  I  think  honourable  Naupoto  will  inform  honourable 
<br/>Tuinaceva that in the maritime capability, there are these capabilities of detecting what is in the water 
<br/>from the air.  That is available, that is not being used in this particular aircraft, except that it also has 
<br/>the capability to do that, if you want it to do that. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just a bit of housekeeping and for the purposes of 
<br/>complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the 
<br/>Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion
