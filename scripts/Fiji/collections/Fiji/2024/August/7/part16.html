<h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT-SUGAR INDUSTRY TRIBUNAL 2016 TO 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3>
<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT-  
<br/>SUGAR INDUSTRY TRIBUNAL 2016 TO 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry and 
<br/>Tribunal 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to present the overview of the Sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industry Tribunal 2016 to 2020 Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar 
<br/>for submitting the responses to the tabled Consolidated Review Report.  The Sugar Industry Tribunal 
<br/>(SIT) serves several and crucial purposes within the Fiji Sugar Industry.  This includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Dispute  resolution  –  the  Tribunal  mediation  resolves  disputes  between  the  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corporation and cane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Setting  standards  –  the  Tribunal  establishes  standards  for  mutual  rights  and  obligations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between FSC and farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Conciliation - it encourages conciliation between various parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While reviewing the SIT reports, the Committee recommended that the Tribunal has failed to 
<br/>meet  its  obligation  to  provide  up  to-date  annual  reports.    The  Committee  has  found  that  SIT  is 
<br/>performing  basic  tasks  and  responsibilities  that  could  be  handled  much  more  effectively  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Sugar.  The SIT should be disbanded and the Ministry of Sugar takes the responsibility 
<br/>to appoint a Tribunal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the discussions the Committee has had with the Ministry of Sugar, the Committee is 
<br/>confident  that  the  Ministry  has  the  capacity  and  the  expertise  to  effectively  manage  Tribunal 
<br/>functions  related  to  sugar  industry.    This  will  optimise  the  resource  utilisation  considering  the 
<br/>industry  is  insolvent.    The  review  of  SIT  2016  to  2020  reports  revealed  the  lack  of  a  centralised 
<br/>database accessible to all institutions in the sugar sector, which is causing confusion amongst the 
<br/>stakeholders.  The Committee reviewed the annual reports and is deeply concerned about the various 
<br/></span><span>issues that has been identified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the list of speakers in front of me provided by the Whips: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J.N. Nand; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic and Sugar Industry; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Co-operatives, Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House. The 
<br/>Sugar  Industry  Tribunal  was  established  under  the  Sugar  Industry  Act  1984.  The  function  of  the 
<br/>Tribunal are prescribed in sections 21, 22 and 26 of the Act.  The Sugar  Industry Tribunal serves 
<br/>various crucial purposes within the Fijian sugar industry. These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1530 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Dispute Resolution: The Tribunal mediates and resolves disputes between the Fiji Sugar 
<br/>Corporation (FSC) and cane farmers. It ensures fair treatment and adherence to contractual 
<br/>obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Setting  Standards:  The  Tribunal  establishes  standards  for  mutual  rights  and  obligations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between the FSC and farmers. This helps maintain transparency and consistency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Efficiency  Promotion:  By  advising  the  Minister  for  Sugar  on  industry  objectives,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tribunal contributes to improving overall industry efficiency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Conciliation:  It  encourages  conciliation  between  parties,  aiming  to  prevent  prolonged 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>conflicts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the recommendations is that the SIT to be disbanded and the Ministry 
<br/>of Sugar takes the responsibility to  appoint the Tribunal. From the discussion the Committee had 
<br/>with the Ministry of Sugar, the Committee is confident that the Ministry has the capacity and the 
<br/>expertise to effectively manage Tribunal functions related to the sugar industry. This will optimize 
<br/>resource utilization, considering that the industry is insolvent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully  support  this  recommendation,  as  over  the  years  there  has  been 
<br/>numerous  complaints  from  the  farmers  regarding  how  the  Sugar  Industry  Tribunal  handles  the 
<br/>disputes of the farmers. The Sugar Industry Tribunal is having too much authority and a one man 
<br/>show.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as stated earlier on, a crucial process  and the purpose of the Tribunal is 
<br/>conciliation which means it encourages conciliation between parties, aiming to prevent prolonged 
<br/>conflicts.  I cannot vouch for this, recently due to a dispute, a  farmer Mr. Abdul Faroon of Maro, 
<br/>Sigatoka was suspended from the harvesting gang indefinitely. This means that Mr. Faroon has been 
<br/>left with no choice but to harvest his cane on his own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Faroon even sought the assistance of the honourable Minister for Sugar 
<br/>on  numerous  occasions  but  until  to-date,  the  honourable  Minister  has  not  responded  with  any 
<br/>concrete solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Follow the process! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the issue that Mr. Abdul Faroon has raised with 
<br/></span><span>me through a viber message, if I can be allowed to read it which says, “since I have been expelled 
<br/></span><span>from the gang, I gave a call to the Sugar Minister, he said that he will be coming Lomai Flood Gate. 
<br/>All papers were given to him and he promised me that he will give me a call.  This year, 5</span><span>th</span><span> April a 
<br/>meeting was held in the Lautoka Growers Council office hall I spoke there regarding my issue to the 
<br/>Sugar Minister and another person and they promised that they will look into the matter yet after 5</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April till to-date, I receive no response from the Sugar Minister and the other person.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Change the Minister! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  “We  are  the  family  of  six  and  no  finance  for  groceries,  I  have  been 
<br/></span><span>requesting help from my friends and I even asked you to assist me which you have done. Thank you 
<br/>for assisting me in this matter though you are not the Sugar Minister. Thank you, once again and God 
<br/>bless you.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 5</span><span>th</span><span> April the issue was raised with the Minister, this is the mid-season of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crushing season, the season is about to end and the honourable Minister is still looking into it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1531 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Change him! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  intension  is  to  buy  a  pair  of  goggles,  a  pair  of 
<br/>binoculars,  microscope  and  telescope  and  give  to  the  honourable  Minister  so  that  he  can  see  the 
<br/>problems thoroughly and respond to the farmers in a timely and appropriate manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not dispute the ruling of the Tribunal, I believe them, but Mr. Faroon 
<br/>is 60 years old and he has been asked to harvest his cane on his own. My question is, if the Tribunal 
<br/>has made a decision, there should be some alternative for the farmer to harvest his cane. How on 
<br/>earth, this particular farmer can hire a labourer and harvest his cane? The season is about to end, I 
<br/>think the honourable Minister will keep on looking into it, when the season will end, he will give him 
<br/>the answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very sickening and despite numerous calls, the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Sugar has not answered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I agree with  the honourable Pillay, to  change him and replace him with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture. He is doing a very good job.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you do not fire him, give him another portfolio; a Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without portfolio so that he can keep on looking at the problems, looking busy doing nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I fully support the recommendations in the Report. The Sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industry Tribunal disbanded and the Ministry of Sugar takes responsible to appoint a tribunal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers like Mr. Faroon can be served better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I firstly like to say one thing to the honourable Member 
<br/>who just spoke, his statement was sickening.  That farmer only cuts or harvests 25 tonnes of cane. I 
<br/>know the story about it. I actually went to his place but he had not given the full story to you. Nowhere 
<br/>a gang will get rid of a farmer unless you are a troublesome farmer and he is. So, please do not come 
<br/>and teach me about what happened there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  speak  on  the  motion,  I  would  like  to  say  something  about 
<br/>honourable Pillay last night when he finished off.  He has been talking about the stoppage of Ba Mill 
<br/></span><span>and I think tomorrow morning honourable Bala will also question me on the same issue. But I would 
<br/></span><span>like to say one thing, Mr. Speaker, that we really feel sorry for the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 18 years of the last government, they had not finished the mill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Do you know the heart of a sugar mill is its boiler? The boiler has not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been replaced and that is the real problem of the sugar mill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, if the boiler had a mouth to speak, it would have told them 
<br/>the problem. A human being, if his stomach pains, he will go and tell the doctor, “I have pain in my 
<br/>stomach.”  But with this boiler problem, once you fix one side of the boiler, something else breaks 
<br/>down. If you had replaced the boiler then the mill problem would have been solved.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, without knowing the full facts, they will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>try to politicise the farmers. No amount of politics this time will get them any votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar 
<br/>Industry Tribunal 2016-2020 Annual Reports as outlined by Parliamentary Paper No. 77 of 2024.  
<br/>This comprehensive review offers a critical assessment of the Tribunal’s performance highlighting 
<br/>areas which need improvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge  the  recommendations  provided  by  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic 
<br/>Affairs and I can assure you that my Ministry is committed to implementing the recommendations 
<br/>of the Standing Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has noted the request of the SIT to establish a standalone database.  We agree 
<br/>with the Committees recommendation for a centralised database system and this proposal will be 
<br/>evaluated alongside the current collaboration with FSC which shares a database infrastructure with 
<br/>Sugar Industrial Tribunal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to the submission to update the Annual Reports, the Ministry 
<br/>concurs  with  the  Committees’  concerns.  We  are  working  to  resolve  the  issue  highlighted  by  the 
<br/>auditors to ensure timely and accurate reporting will be done.  This includes addressing the backlog 
<br/>of  the  annual  accounts  and  aligning  future  reports  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals 
<br/>particularly SDG5 of the Gender Equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outdated Master Award, a cornerstone of industrial regulation is also under review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  committed  to  modernise  this  legislative  framework  is  part  of  the  broader 
<br/>policy overall to better reflect the current reality of the sugar industry.   Furthermore, we acknowledge 
<br/>the complexities surrounding the SCGF trust fund.  While the Ministry does not directly oversee this 
<br/>Fund, we support the call for transparency and accountability.  Discussions will be held with relevant 
<br/>stakeholders, including the Sugar Cane Growers Council and Fiji Sugar Corporation, to ensure that 
<br/>proper management and necessary further investigation is forwarded to FICAC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee’s to disband the Sugar Industry Tribunal and transfer its responsibilities to 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry has been noted. It recognised the importance of optimising resources, especially given 
<br/></span><span>the industry’s current financial challenges, and this proposal will consider a comprehensive study on 
<br/>the  sugar  industry  by  the  FAO,  as  I  had  mentioned  on  Monday,  with  the  goal  of  transparency, 
<br/>efficiency and governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  fully  supports  the  Committee’s  Report  and  is 
<br/>dedicated to addressing the recommendations to improve the sector’s governance and its operational 
<br/>effectiveness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ongoing reforms and the strategic initiatives will be critical in ensuring a sustainable and 
<br/></span><span>a  prosperous  future  for  Fiji’s  Sugar  Industry.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  urge  all  the 
<br/>honourable Members of this esteemed House to support this motion of this important work that lies 
<br/>ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on 
<br/>this motion. We all know the importance of Sugar Industry Tribunal.  As we have heard, it is a body 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1533 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that deals with dispute resolution. The function of the Tribunal is to regulate a Master Awards, and 
<br/>to ensure fair treatment and adherence of contractual obligations between farmers and growers, and 
<br/>this function is vital for maintaining harmony and co-operation within the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee reviewed the Sugar Industry Tribunal Annual Reports from 
<br/>2016 to 2020, and the Committee had put forward eight recommendations, but I will speak only on 
<br/>four of these recommendations, because some of these recommendations was already covered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a significant concern highlighted in the Report is the lack key performance 
<br/>indicators for most stakeholders in the sugar industry, including the Sugar Industry Tribunal. Sir, just 
<br/>to give you an example, the vision of Fiji Sugar Corporation, and let me read it out, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  vision  of  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  is  to  transform  sugarcane  farming  to  a 
<br/>sustainable and profitable farming activity for cane growers with sugar as a world class 
<br/>brand now and in the future.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What a beautiful vision! And what do we find? Most of these organisations will have their 
<br/>vision and mission, put in a bigger words and staple on the wall, but what is the problem here?  The 
<br/>problem is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is no KPI, how will they work towards their vision? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- All these organisations are directionless, they do not have a direction.  
<br/>They do not know where they are going.  The honourable Minister is working hard to improve the 
<br/>industry, I can see that.  He has got his mind and heart there, but he alone cannot fix it.  That is the 
<br/>thing that I am trying to say.  Unless and until all these CEOs of different sugar institutions sitting 
<br/>there, start fixing their area of work, they have to work towards that vision and without KPIs, they 
<br/>lack clarity, they lack focus and what does that do?  It results in scattered efforts and wasted resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know this inefficiency hampers our industry’s performance which is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actually visible in the sugar sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unacceptable that the Sugar Industry Tribunal and other stakeholders 
<br/>operate without targets, especially when taxpayers’ money is involved.  It is not their own money, it 
<br/>is the taxpayers’ money.  We need to ensure that taxpayers’ funds are yielding tangible results.  They 
<br/>must get value for money, which they are not getting that kind of return, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has also recommended the development of a centralised statistical database 
<br/>which the honourable Minister has mentioned, and our experience is in each and every report when 
<br/>they come up with the Annual Report, beautiful data is given, with graph, with tables, colourful.  But 
<br/>when you read one report to another, they are talking about the same thing but the information is 
<br/>different.  The number of growers is different, number of hectares of land being used is different.  
<br/>So, that is  why it is very important  to  have this data at  one place  -  at  one repository spot, where 
<br/>everyone else can access.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has already said that he is looking into that because with single data, 
<br/>there can be innovation, there can be problem solving because then, you will know what the issue is 
<br/>and you can work towards solving that problem.  But when the data is different, you do not know 
<br/>what  you are doing with the data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another critical recommendation which the honourable Minister has also touched on is the 
<br/></span><span>outdated Master Award. I believe, and this is my personal believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the critical issue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the Master Award.  The 35 year old Master Award, developed in 1989, and we are trying to use 
<br/>that Master Award to solve today’s problem and the farmers are complaining…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- You should have done that 16 years ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Yes,  we  were  trying  to  review.    Go  and  read  the  </span><span>Daily  Hansard</span><span>.  
<br/>Honourable  Minister,  go  and  read  the  </span><span>Daily  Hansard</span><span>  which  you  are  not  doing.    Read  the  </span><span>Daily 
<br/>Hansard</span><span> then you talk in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go through the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>,  it is very clear 
<br/>that the Master Award was being reviewed but NFP stopped it.  And I can assure the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Sugar, NFP will, again, be the spanner in the works because that is sugar politics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am trying to say here is that the Master Award is 35 years old, it needs to be fixed and 
<br/>we have already made the recommendation to review the Master Award, along with the new Sugar 
<br/>Policy. So, when the new Sugar Policy is established, review the Master Award and that will set the 
<br/>direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the disputes that the growers normally have is on mechanisation.  But mechanisation 
<br/>is not covered in the Master Award.  That is how outdated the Master Award is.  It does not take into 
<br/>account technological advancement that has happened over the years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also disappointed, very disappointed actually, that the sugar industry, 
<br/>whether you talk about FSC and the various other institutions that exist within the sugar sector, they 
<br/>have failed to report on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on Gender Equality in the Annual Report.  
<br/>This oversight is a significant issue.  That is why when you go into any of the sugar industry bodies, 
<br/>you will just find men, everywhere, and that is the state of the sugar industry today.  Research has 
<br/>shown that if you have women in the organisation, they will bring different perspective, and they can 
<br/>improve the system because they will look after your homes, they look after the community, then 
<br/>why are they put aside when it comes to sugar sector?  Just because it is a men’s job?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The worst is, they do not even report because they do not want anyone to pick that up.  So, 
<br/>do not tell them, no one will know, but you and I know that it is a requirement of Parliament, it is a 
<br/>commitment to SDGs that it must be reported.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am urging all these institutions, please, wake up and start reporting on the SDGs so that 
<br/>we  can  see  whether  gender  equality  is  in  your  organisation  or  not,  whether  you  are  giving  equal 
<br/>opportunity to women to work in that organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat, there is something else that I wanted to speak about.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we have heard twice in this House, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics has mentioned that when we had politics 
<br/>we were doing well.  He has said it.  When we had politics, the sugar industry was doing well. He 
<br/></span><span>fails to understand that when politics was there, they were getting preferential sugar price.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You can have as much politics as you like because you were getting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more than the market price for that sugar.  But today, we cannot allow this politics, simply because 
<br/>its taxpayers’ money you are talking about.

<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-</span><span> </span><span>Imagine each and every household, when they get a paycheck, their 
<br/>money is deducted and it comes into the Government’s coffers. They can use that money to build 
<br/>their house but no, they are contributing to the Government’s coffers so they must get that return.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.–  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  to  provide  some  comments 
<br/>regarding the Sugar Industry Tribunal Reports and just a fact that we are looking at the 2016, 2017, 
<br/>2018, 2019 and 2020, basically says a lot, and we do not need to say much more. But, of course, 
<br/>being me, Sir, I want to say a bit more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, you went around, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday and I used the analogy of the lights that 
<br/>goes on, on the indicator. Honourable Usamate was talking about execution today and I thought I 
<br/>would just respond respectfully to honourable Usamate on execution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the sugar industry is on the precipice of collapsing and 16 years of that was under the 
<br/>other side - that is execution. The only thing that this side of the House can say, we have seen what 
<br/>the other side of the House can do with execution, Sir, and we will definitely do better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to raise, just to educate honourable Usamate on 
<br/>execution, the honourable Prime Minister is always very humble when he talks in Parliament.  When 
<br/>he talked about the $10 million Public Service Broadcasting Grant, he sort of politely did not really 
<br/>say what he should have said which was, you were giving away $10 million to one entity for 16 years 
<br/>or more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the honourable Prime Minister’s leadership, he gave a brief to the Board and said, 
<br/>“you need to turn this entity around, make it self-sustaining”. So, what the Board did in one year, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  they  came  back  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  said,  “We  can  live  with  $6 
<br/>million. The $4 million is a saving.”  The honourable Prime Minister said, “Alright, there is a saving, 
<br/>let us put it back in the pool for the other broadcasters.” That is execution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  the  report  before  us,  I  think  honourable  Premila  Kumar  has 
<br/>actually said what has to be said about the Report. It is just very troublesome, it is symptomatic of 
<br/>what  has  been  happening  in  the  industry  for  some  time.    Their  Annual  Reports  have  not  been 
<br/></span><span>submitted on time, the Master Award is outdated, the Audit Report from 2016, I believe, were all 
<br/></span><span>qualified and we talked about the qualification of the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) report yesterday, 
<br/>and here we go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in some ways, I will use another, sort of, saying, the fish rots from the top. So, because 
<br/>we  failed  to  actually  manage  FSC  well,  that  resulted  in  so  much  losses  for  over  20  years,  it  is 
<br/>happening to all the other entities. So, the need for the report of the FAO, again, something that is 
<br/>initiated by this side of the House will actually plot a way forward for the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thought I would end on a positive note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after all of that.  I will just talk a 
<br/></span><span>bit about something that I have seen in the industry that can provide a template for the rest of the 
<br/>agricultural sector actually.  It is one of the most organised industries in Fiji.  It is set up quite well.  
<br/>It has a Tribunal, it has got its own funding mechanisms, it has a council, it has got its own Act, and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1536 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is the future for the agricultural sector in Fiji, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to commercialise it, bring in these kind of support mechanisms, and then we will 
<br/>see the type of growth that we know we are capable of in the agricultural industry.  By bringing in 
<br/>partners, such as Fiji Water, which I have talked about, and some others, we will surely be able to 
<br/>actually execute on them.  Through the capabilities of the honourable Minister for Agriculture, you 
<br/>will  see  some  transformational  change  happening,  Sir,  certainly  in  this  term  of  Government  and 
<br/>beyond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Sir, I thank the Committee for being very honest about the status of 
<br/>the Sugar Industry Tribunal.  Perhaps, if anything, my suggestion is, “Let us get a Cabinet paper 
<br/>together tomorrow and shut this down, if it is not working.  Let us move on and try and make this 
<br/>industry  profitable  or  at  least  self-sustaining,  and  then  we  can  move  on  and  develop  the  other 
<br/>agricultural sectors that offer so much potential for Fiji.  I thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comments are noted.  However, I just wish to talk 
<br/>on the issues that has been raised by honourable Premila Kumar when we were going around visiting 
<br/>the stakeholders in the industry and, of course, meeting up with them – the need for more harmonious 
<br/>relationship between all the various stakeholders in the industry.  There is a lot of fragmentation and 
<br/>what I have been saying in the Committee, is the need for all these stakeholders to be singing from 
<br/>the same hymn sheet, to have some sort of clear policy so that everyone will be singing from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is a lesson for those in an industry which is quite huge like this.  I think once we have 
<br/>the policy in place, the policy will be directing all the stakeholders to be singing from that same hymn 
<br/>sheet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Members  for  their  contribution  and,  of  course,  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, I do support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
