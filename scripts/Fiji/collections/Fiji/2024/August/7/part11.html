<h3>AMENDMENT TO THE 2024 CALENDAR OF PARLIAMENT SITTINGS</h3>
<div><span>AMENDMENT TO THE 2024 CALENDAR OF PARLIAMENT SITTINGS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament adopts the amended 2024 Sitting Calendar for November and December.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as all 
<br/>honourable Members are aware, Parliament approved the Sitting Calendar for 2024 earlier this year
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amendment – 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with an amendment made during the July sitting, following discussions at the Business Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As is customary, the Business Committee agreed that if there was a pressing need to adjust 
<br/>any of sittings, this would be subsequently tabled in Parliament for endorsement.  Therefore, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, this motion seeks Parliament’s approval to allow for the following changes to the sitting 
<br/>calendar: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to defer the Sittings scheduled for 18</span><span>th</span><span> to 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November to 2</span><span>nd</span><span> to 6</span><span>th</span><span> December; and   
<br/>to reschedule the Prorogation date from 2</span><span>nd</span><span> December to 16</span><span>th</span><span> December. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason for this request, Mr. Speaker Sir, is due to the recent confirmation of the COP29 
<br/>meeting dates, which would coincide with the November sittings.  At the initial approval of the Sitting 
<br/>Calendar, the COP29 meeting dates were not out yet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, COP is a crucial meeting given that climate change significantly impacts 
<br/>the Pacific Islands States.  Our vulnerability as small island States to natural disasters such as tropical 
<br/>cyclones, floods and other climate-related events makes it imperative that we participate in the COP 
<br/>meeting both at the Government level and the Parliamentary level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of some of the issues at COP, which are pressing needs in terms of 
<br/>our nation, we should note that we have a 100 percent electricity target for all Fijians, there is a target 
<br/>of 81 percent renewable energy by 2021 but so far only 60 percent has been achieved and mostly via 
<br/>hydro-electricity. Fiji has been lagging behind in its ability to attract, establish and retain Independent 
<br/>Power Producers.  It is critical that we reach out and also secure funding in terms of renewable energy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the long term, Fiji will require $4 billion in investments between 2024 to 2036 to 
<br/>achieve its 100 percent renewable energy targets with cumulative investment cost expected to be $20 
<br/>billion  by  2050,  which  is  also  why  we  are  currently  conducting  a  diagnostic  study  through  the 
<br/>International  Renewable  Energy Agency  (IRENA)  in  order to  move this forward.  Of course, we 
<br/>cannot just brush aside the fact that our total imports of fuel is 26 percent of the total import cost 
<br/>amounting to approximately $1.03 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of water, Sir, climate change impacts also, as we have also highlighted in the 2050 
<br/>Water Strategy, the rise in the earth’s temperatures is estimated Year 2100 to be 2 percent to 4 percent 
<br/>and sea level rise 25 centimetres and the nation estimates $4.5 billion estimated to  strengthen the 
<br/>resilience of our water infrastructures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, aging infrastructure, again, this is related to what will be discussed in COP29, $3 
<br/>billion a total of $8 billion.  So, there is a huge amount of cost in terms of climate, ensuring that our 
<br/>infrastructure is climate resilient, which is why we, as a Ministry, and also other Ministries under the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Ministry  of  Climate  Change  at  the  moment  are  engaged  in 
<br/>formulating concept papers and proposal which will be taken to COP29.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From that, we are looking forward to securing or at least begin the initial discussions to secure 
<br/>funding to move us forward. Not only in the term of this government but also for the next government 
<br/></span><span>in case there is a change of government.  We are preparing the groundwork and the base for that in 
<br/></span><span>this COP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We prepared it for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amendment – 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1467 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We are preparing it for you because you did not prepare it for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were some major projects, thank you to the last government.  As a government, we 
<br/>continue the good work of the previous government.  In light of these brief salient points, I seek the 
<br/>indulgence of the honourable Members to support this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the motion to Parliament and urging approval of the proposed amendments.  I 
<br/>believe this is a very critical COP that we are preparing for in terms of preparation, and we are, in 
<br/>fact, preparing various proposals which will be moved forward at this COP, in order to secure not all 
<br/>the funding we need but at least the critical funding to take us forward for the next 10 years to 20 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I extend my gratitude to the Members of the Business Committee for their support, and I look 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forward to the support of this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate, if any. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  on  behalf  of  the  Group  of  16  to  show 
<br/>support to the motion.  This has been discussed in the Business Committee and the Government has 
<br/>justified the reason why we need to change the Sitting Calendar and, of course, we have accepted it.  
<br/>The good thing about this change is, it does not mean a loss in the number of sitting days or weeks 
<br/>as the case in the previous adjustments, but this is just a postponement of the sitting dates and shifting 
<br/>it from November to December.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  has  spent  quite  a  considerable  time  talking  about  COP  and 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, I think he should attend the next COP in Baku, Azerbaijan.  He has talked 
<br/>about water and energy which are critical, but I would urge Government honestly the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, Sir, our preparation last year was not good.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know it comes under your portfolio, talking to the officials, there was no meeting at all prior 
<br/>to  our  departure.  A  lot  of  technical  meetings  should  be  happening  and  even  the  politicians,  the 
<br/>Ministers who would accompany you, Sir need to be well briefed because COP is not a holiday.  We 
<br/>need to go and fight our issues because this is the biggest existential threat as we admit, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I would urge the Government, we still have a few months now to prepare because there 
<br/>are a lot of issues and the technical staff will help those senior officials.  The Ministers that will be 
<br/>attending COP, particularly now we have progressed in Loss and Damage, Just Transition, you are 
<br/>well aware, honourable Prime Minister, is one of the key issues that is under the lens now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, for us, carbon trading, forest issues and deforestation and the issue on resilience 
<br/>and adaptation, although we are doing our best in terms of the mitigation plans, I would just urge the 
<br/></span><span>Government, let us prepare well for this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are fortunate that we have experienced people like Ambassador Yauvoli who led the team 
<br/>last year and we thank him for his leadership, but there needs to be a lot of preparation and maybe 
<br/>through  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  if  we  can  take 
<br/>responsibility in ensuring that we convene the meetings prior to departure because that will be very 
<br/>important for us.  This is not the only one, honourable Minister, all COPs are important, not only 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amendment – 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COP29. Every COP is important to every Pacific Islander and every member of Alliance of Small 
<br/>Island States (AOSIS).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  just  finished  the  4</span><span>th</span><span>  International  Conference  on  Small  Island  Developing  States 
<br/>(SIDS4)  meeting  in  Antigua  and  Barbuda.    I  had  some  very  good  discussions  with  the  High 
<br/>Commissioner of Samoa last night in the reception at Government House because they are currently 
<br/>Chair of AOSIS. That synergy, when it comes to the voices of the Pacific Islands into AOSIS and 
<br/>the G-77 plus China, plus the other geopolitical groupings will be very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we wish the Government all the very best in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>terms of preparation for COP29. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the motion.  I thank the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition as well as the Business Committee for moving the dates as is 
<br/>mentioned, we are not going to forego any sittings but moving it to December. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, an equally important platform that will be marked next year (2025) is the Beijing 
<br/>Platform for Action on Gender Equality.  That was the Beijing Platform for Action was in 1995, there 
<br/>was a global commitment to achieving gender equality or SDG5 and next year 2025 is 30 years.  In 
<br/>that very same week, the dates have also been set for global leaders to meet to prepare for 2025 on 
<br/>the Beijing Platform for Action +30, so that will be happening also in that week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support this motion to be able to have our Government represented at that particular 
<br/>meeting.  It is being hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and 
<br/>the Pacific (UNESCAP) along  with  UN Women.  More importantly, Mr. Speaker, as our Pacific 
<br/>leaders continue to commit where they have made a pledge for gender equality in the Pacific, this 
<br/>supports our work as we prepare for Beijing Platform for Action +30. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Business Committee and I also seek the support of the Members 
<br/>of the House to agree to this motion as we look forward as a Government to prepare for this very 
<br/>important platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Honourable Premila Kumar would like to speak after this, I am sure.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a woman Member of Parliament, I would hope she would support the 
<br/></span><span>very important work of the Government as we prepare for this historic occasion next year as we mark 
<br/>the 30</span><span>th</span><span> Anniversary of Beijing Platform for Action, and on that very week we are convening for this 
<br/>particular event.   I do support the motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just to share a few ideas of preparing for this COP29 
<br/>meeting as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, the last COP we 
<br/>attended  in  Dubai,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  including  myself,  were  astounded  by  THE  38 
<br/>members of our delegation attending the meeting.  I even met one and said ‘hello’ to her.  I said to 
<br/></span><span>her, “You come from the United States or what, because I follow your page on </span><span>Facebook </span><span>and know 
<br/></span><span>that you sell food online.”  She said, “No, Sir, I am part of your delegation.”  I said, “Oh!”, so there 
<br/>were 38 there, and we could not figure out where they were from and what organisation they were 
<br/>there for.  It was an amazing incident there, but quite costly as well.  We were all meeting up on the 
<br/>other side of the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1469 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  again,  as  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  stated,  it  was  not  really  well 
<br/>prepared but, hopefully, I understand this one here would be a better one in the hope that we better 
<br/>prepare our Prime Minister   because the Prime Minister leads the delegation.  And when it comes to 
<br/>Government one-on-one, that is when you get to understand how important it is and we also get a lot 
<br/>from whatever the rich countries that are there and are very much trading in fossil fuel because the 
<br/>aim is to reduce that, and their aim is to ensure that they dangle carrots in front of us and that will 
<br/>keep us quite for another year – smoke emission, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  we  are  on  this  side  of  the  world  where  we  are  at  the  whim  of  the  big  smoke 
<br/>polluters.  We cannot do anything.  They smog the whole world, and we suffer.  That is something 
<br/>that we should badly prepare for when we go into this kind of meeting, and that has been, kind of, a 
<br/>reminder to us by the honourable Leader of Government in Parliament, as well as the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all I have to say, and I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak in reply, if any. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response, I  thank the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition for his comments.  Under the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Climate 
<br/>Change has definitely taken measures to ensure that we are well prepared in moving forward.  Not 
<br/>only that, but also in terms of the specialised personnel and the coordination between the Ministries, 
<br/>because at the end of the day, in a lot of the international fora, developing countries are always asking, 
<br/>“what  are  we  getting  out  of  it?  This  is  in  terms  of  the  complexities  related  to  accessing  climate 
<br/>finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of that, we have also had a few workshops regarding that.  Currently, there is one 
<br/>going on in terms of the modalities and processes involved, so when we get there, at least, what we 
<br/>need to have are concept papers and proposals.  But linking that up technically before we get there 
<br/>so that when we get there, there is at least some movement forward in terms of mitigation  and other 
<br/>avenues where we could benefit from as a nation because I believe discussions have been going on 
<br/>for number of years and we are at a stage where some of the financing mechanisms are at a maturity 
<br/>stage, I would say, and it would be really, really good for us to take advantage of the opportunities at 
<br/>this point in time and ensure that whatever we are able to secure as a Government also benefits our 
<br/>people, moving forward, no matter whatever government is in power in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
