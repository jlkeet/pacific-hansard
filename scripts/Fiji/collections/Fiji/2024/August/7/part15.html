<div><span>Restoration of Water Supply in Parts of Suva 
<br/>(Question No. 128/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform Parliament as to when will people enjoy undisrupted water supply in parts of Suva 
<br/>like Raiwaqa, Tamavua, and Wailoku? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.  – Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question.  The undisrupted water supply in Suva, Raiwaqa and areas as mentioned, we cannot really 
<br/>100 percent guarantee that because it will always be disrupted by natural disasters, et cetera.  So, the 
<br/>question is really a hypothetical question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of undisrupted water supply or interruptions, of course, it is a matter of significant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importance and I thank the honourable Member for that question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of current situation and challenges, the Tamavua Water Treatment Plant is a critical 
<br/>component  of  these  areas,  currently  operating  at  a  capacity  of  75  mega  litres  per  day,  despite  its 
<br/>original design capacity of 60 mega litres per day. So, this is an overextension, but is necessary to 
<br/>meet the demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also presents challenges, especially during dry periods, as you have seen, 
<br/>when  the  raw  water  sources  experience  lower  yield.  Consequently,  areas  including  Tamavua, 
<br/>Wailoku, Samabula and Raiwaqa are directly affected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we, as a Government, note the critical importance of this and, of course, extending 
<br/>from the work of the previous government, there are two specific projects – one is to alleviate this 
<br/>situation which is the Elevated Princess Road Water Infrastructure Project.  This has already been 
<br/>tendered and we are looking at finalising the contract by November or end of November.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This basically is the laying of pipelines from the Sawani Junction to Khalsa Road Junction 
<br/>along the Princess Road. We had a walk through these locations a few weeks ago.  The cost is $35 
<br/>million,  project  duration  is  24  months  and  it  will  also  benefit  any  future  developments,  moving 
<br/></span><span>forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it involves installation of new pipelines which will tee off from the existing 
<br/>Viria gravity main at Sawani, and there will be a pump station.  From the pump station to Colo-i-
<br/>Suva Reservoir site and  gravity lines. It  will involve, as  I have mentioned, design  and build new 
<br/>gravity  pipes  of  1.43  kilometres,  Diameter  Nominal  (DN)  630,  high  density  polythene  pipe  and 
<br/>moving from the Sawani junction to the proposed pump station at Buresasa, which is as you come 
<br/>up Princess Road about halfway before you reach the corner towards Colo-i-suva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the new rising main water pipeline from that pump station to the current Colo-i-Suva 
<br/></span><span>Reservoir site where two 5 mega litre steel  tank reservoirs will also  be built.   That  is the current 
<br/>project  which  the  Government  is  working  towards  with  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (WAF)  towards 
<br/>alleviating that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, there will be performance-based contract initiatives in terms of alleviating 
<br/>the leakage which is 47 percent.  Over the next five years, it is targeted that it will be reduced to 20 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent.    Basically,  working  on  hydraulic  improvements  and  also  locating  the  leakages  through 
<br/>various methodologies and progressively working on this for the next five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  these  plans,  we  are  looking  forward  to  the  improvements  in  terms  of  those  areas  as 
<br/>indicated in the question.  Apart from that, the Viria Project is also covering up for the shortfalls in 
<br/>the water supply.  I believe there has been noticeable improvements in terms of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But there are also current water tank assistance for those areas with intermittent water supply. 
<br/>These have been delivered to areas such as those in need in Sakoca and some other areas and it is 
<br/>available there and people have been applying for it.  Those are some of the measures taken to address 
<br/>the water disruptions in the areas as questioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question; can the honourable Minister 
<br/>enlighten Parliament that apart from ensuring regular water supply to the metered areas, what plans 
<br/>are  there  in  place  for  connecting  water  to  the  non-metered  areas?    In  other  words,  how  many 
<br/>residential areas have been identified to get connected to the water supply in this financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the list of areas.  Of course, 
<br/>there is a list there in terms of those who have applied and also the prioritised areas.  For example, 
<br/>just related to Viria, as agreed with the landowners, we have extended the pipeline too.  This pipeline 
<br/>covers  the  villages  of  Viria,  Waitolu,  Naqali,  Navatuvula,  Naqali  Government  Station  and  all 
<br/>households and communities along Sawani and Naqali.  For those, they need to apply for the water 
<br/>meter connections and  WAF is  currently going  through those community.  As the extensions  are 
<br/>done, the awareness and also discussions with the communities along that are happening in terms of 
<br/>the applications and facilitating the connections under water meters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker.    While  we  are  still 
<br/>speaking about WAF, I would like to bring to the attention of the honourable Minister that the open 
<br/>trench in Kaunitoni Street still exists.  It was opened in January last year, it is almost close to two 
<br/>years now.  Or vehicles are being damaged, so if he can actually look into that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along with that, there was a complaint lodged of a leakage in Kaunitoni Street around two 
<br/>weeks ago which is still unattended.  Am I being victimised of being an Opposition MP that you are 
<br/>not fixing the Kaunitoni Street?  Please clarify. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- My apology for that.  That has already been raised with Water 
<br/></span><span>Authority of Fiji, but the word “victimisation”, sort of, rekindles bad memories when we were in the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not want to say victimisation specifically, but you should not have raised that because it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>brings bad memories to some of us here, especially related to Bill No 17 and being taken to CID. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway,  that  is  besides  the  point.    As  a  Government,  definitely,  we  do  not  victimise  or 
<br/>specifically withdraw services from certain areas because of political affiliation, that is not in our 
<br/>DNA. Definitely, we will look into that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the honourable Minister, I am very interested and 
<br/>I am glad to see that they are targeting non-revenue water from 47 percent down to 20 percent.  Can 
<br/>you just explain what are the broad strategies that will be used to do this to get that non-revenue water 
<br/>down? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not really familiar with the technical methodology, but 
<br/>what I understand is the hydraulics will be monitored in terms of differences in pressure and all that 
<br/>to try to specifically identify the areas with potential leaks.  I think they are also using infrared with 
<br/>the contractors to try to locate the areas where there the leakages are specifically when there is a 
<br/>difference along one line in terms of water pressure from one point to another; with a significant 
<br/>difference. So, there must be a leakage in between, apart from those ones which are already identified 
<br/>as we move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.E.  LEUNG.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  apologise  to  you  personally  and  to 
<br/>honourable Members of the House for inadvertently breaching protocol when I exited the Chambers 
<br/>earlier today.  Please accept my apologies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, certainly, honourable Attorney-General.  But I was thinking of giving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you a red card.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You traversed the whole Chambers. Thank you, honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress of Informal Settlement Upgrade Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 129/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the progress of the Informal Settlement Upgrade Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/>Informal settlements around the country are becoming a mammoth challenge for any government 
<br/>due  to  their  unplanned  structure,  poor  access  to  basic  amenities  and  infrastructure.    To-date  the 
<br/>Ministry of Housing has acquired development leases as well obtained consent from the Department 
<br/></span><span>of Lands for 48 informal settlements since 2010. Out of these, 44 are located on iTaukei land and 
<br/></span><span>four on State Land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These development leases, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are spread throughout Fiji with 13 settlements 
<br/>located in the Central Division, 14 settlements located in the Northern Division and 21 settlements 
<br/>located in the Western Division.  Just by way of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very interesting 
<br/>to note that 48 government leases, 31 were acquired in two years (2017 and 2018).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, three out of the 48 informal settlements, Cuvu in Nadroga, Ledrusasa in 
<br/></span><span>Votualevu, Nadi and Waidamudamu in Nausori have had their upgrades completed in 2022.  These 
<br/></span><span>settlements are now in the process for lot allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  regards  to  these  settlements,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Cuvu  Informal  Settlement  Lot 
<br/>Allocation  Committee  had  completed  assessing  these  applications.    The  Waidamudamu  sitting 
<br/>residents  have  submitted  their  applications  for  their  house  blocks  as  well  as  their  Expressions  of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1519 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interest  were  accepted  until  10</span><span>th</span><span>  July,  2024.    Upon  the  completion  of  the  Waidamudamu  Lot 
<br/>Allocation process, the Ministry will then commence with Ledrusasa Lot Allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, four informal settlements are presently in construction phase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Sakoca, Nasinu- 174 households; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Tavela, Nadi - 68 households; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Field 4, Lautoka - 77 households; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Tore, Lautoka - 59 households.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  additional  two  informal  settlements  are  to  commence  with  construction 
<br/>phase  this  financial  year  are  Vunika  in  Labasa  with  101  households,  and  Valewaquyaya  in  Ba 
<br/>comprising of 35 households.  The total cost of these upgrades in these settlements is around $30 
<br/>million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, planning works is underway for 16 informal settlements.  These are located 
<br/>in  Lovu  seaside,  Bare,  Delaisaweni,  Tukutoro,  LUluisila,  Delainamasi  informal  settlements  in 
<br/>Lautoka;  Valewaquyaya  in  Ba,  Vunivau  A  and  Vunivau  B,  Siberia  and  Vatia  in  Labasa  and 
<br/>Veivauceva,  Caubati  River  Road,  Wakanisila  in  Nasinu,  Sasawira  in  Nausori  and  Nadonumai  in 
<br/>Lami  are  earmarked  for  completion  up  to  engineering  plans  by  the  end  of  this  years  before 
<br/>progressing  into  construction  phase.    The  estimated  cost  towards  upgrade  of  these  settlements  is 
<br/>around $200 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, completion of preparation works indicates that topographic surveys, scheme 
<br/>plans, EIA, geotech survey and engineering plans are completed, allowing the commencement of 
<br/>construction works.  Hence, all settlements are earmarked to be formalised over the next five years 
<br/>subject to budget allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The remaining 23 informal settlements are in preliminary phase to begin their planning works 
<br/>in phases over the next five years, subject to budget approval.  The preliminary phase includes the 
<br/>acquisition  of  development  lease,  socioeconomic  survey  done  by  the  Ministry  officials  and 
<br/>preparation of terms of references for consultancy work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also pays the lease premiums and yearly rentals 
<br/>for the 44 development leases on iTaukei land.  The total of $4.1 million in premium had been paid 
<br/></span><span>in  addition  to  $921,000 in  yearly rentals.  I wish to  highlight  the Ministry of Housing’s informal 
<br/></span><span>settlement upgrade programme aims to improve livelihoods through the provision of a 99-year lease 
<br/>to fully service lots to those living in these development areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  few  informal  settlements  in  Delaisaweni, 
<br/>Nabare and nearby areas.  The last meeting with the sitting tenants was held in 2022.  The sitting 
<br/>tenants  are  still  not  aware  of  the  progress  and  other  details.    Is  it  possible  for  the  Authority’s 
<br/>concerned to have meeting with the sitting tenants to provide them with an update and answer their 
<br/>questions and concerns?   I met them two weeks ago, they had lots of questions and concerns and I 
<br/></span><span>was not  able to  answer their questions.   Is it possible to  meet  the siting  tenants  and answer their 
<br/></span><span>questions and concerns? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have also highlighted in my response 
<br/>that some of these areas are on planning stage right now. Based on the request by the honourable 
<br/>Member, there is a need to also go back and share the status of the project so that the residents are 
<br/>also aware of what the Ministry has done or what the Ministry is going to do with regards to

<div><span>Staff Welfare and Concerns – USP Council 
<br/>(Question No. 130/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament what is Government 
<br/>doing to ensure our Fijian staff welfare and concerns are taken to the USP Council through 
<br/>staff representatives?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to start of  with, the Coalition is committed to 
<br/>ensuring  the  welfare  and  concerns  of  our  Fijian  staff  at  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  are 
<br/>adequately addressed and represented at the Council. Just by way of background, being a regional 
<br/>University with 12-member countries, the Council is the executive governing body of the University.  
<br/>It  has  all  the  powers  and  exercises  it,  conferred  on  the  University  by  the  Charter,  subject  to  the 
<br/>powers, duties and functions conferred upon by its statutes. The Council makes ordinance to direct 
<br/>and regulate the University and its authorities and members.  The Council meets twice a year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statutes of the University clearly states the membership of the Council 
<br/>and the determination of the membership. There is also a provision in the statutes of the University 
<br/>of the South Pacific for the appointment of a visitor and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“10.1  The last visitor appointed was Sir James Bruce Robertson who is a retired Judge of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Court of Appeal of New Zealand.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Even the process of appointing a visitor is quite different from the normal expressions of 
<br/>interest because member countries used to nominate names and then once the name is nominated, 
<br/>they  are  agreeable  to  their  names  being  nominated,  then  they  are  requested  by  the  Secretariat  to 
<br/>submit the EOI and their CVs.  We currently do not have a visitor because of the process involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the USP Council’s Standing Orders, the representatives from 
<br/>Fiji can also call for a special meeting of the Council to be convened and the written request to the 
<br/>Secretary who counselled by the Chair over any member of the Council. The reason for a special 
<br/>meeting and business is to be discussed at the speacil meeting, it must be clearly stated in all requests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is aware of the concerns raised given that USP has around 75 
<br/></span><span>percent of staff who are Fiji citizens working at the University. There are a lot of issues that has been 
<br/>raised, in particular the strike threat that has been addressed.  We also understand that staff that had 
<br/>been terminated had taken the matter to  the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial 
<br/>Relations and I would like to leave it at that. Maybe the honourable Minister for Employment may 
<br/>elaborate more on the processes involved in handling such cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the background that I have just alluded to, it is my intension to try 
<br/>and resolve the issues that has been raised and the welfare of the Fijian staff and concerns by calling 
<br/></span><span>a  special  meeting  of  the  University  to  address  the  issues  that  has  been  highlighted  regarding 
<br/></span><span>termination and strike threats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have this morning briefed the honourable Prime Minister on the various issues pertaining to 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific  and together with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance and maybe with the honourable Minister for Labour, we will be convening a meeting and 
<br/>thereafter requesting a Special Council Meeting as it is my intention to resolve the many cases in  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1521 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular the welfare and concerns of the Fijian staff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also taken into account the advice by the honourable Minister that we respect the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and all other member countries of the USP Council and to ensure the 
<br/>smooth  running  of  USP  with  the  teachers  and  students  welfare  also  taken  seriously  to  achieve  a 
<br/>healthy environment of learning and employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The employment contract 
<br/>of all staff, it very clearly states that proper process with procedural fairness and natural justice is 
<br/>accorded to staff. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament if due process was followed in the 
<br/>academic’s termination case? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I think that is an operational matter which we would 
<br/>not like to delve into but maybe if you allow the honourable Minister for Labour to enlighten the 
<br/>Members in terms of the processes involved in addressing this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you do so, honourable Minister, honourable Hem Chand, this is a 
<br/>very sensitive case.  This will get out of hand because the media may be able to twist things around 
<br/>considering how sensitive the case is. Yes, we will give the honourable Minister for Labour to have 
<br/>a go, but I think that it should remain there rather than us discussing it here because it has not been 
<br/>resolved. We are trying to find ways to get it resolved, we have not really convened the meeting. It 
<br/>is  only  after  that  then  we  can  come  and  talk  and  say,  “alright,  this  was  successful,  this  was  not 
<br/>successful” because staff are involved here. They have a Charter to follow. Can we leave it at that, 
<br/>honourable Hem Chand? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry’s Assistance to the Unemployed 
<br/>(Question No. 131/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations 
<br/>inform Parliament on how the Ministry intends to assist the unemployed persons in finding 
<br/></span><span>suitable employment locally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Assistant Minister for 
<br/>asking the question.  Given the significant number of students graduating from the different training 
<br/>institutions annually, I acknowledge the important work the team in my Ministry is undertaking in 
<br/>helping secure suitable jobs for unemployed Fijians within the local employment market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are committed to establishing employment opportunities through partnerships with other 
<br/>agencies, developing effective pathways from education to employment, formulating policies that 
<br/></span><span>support job  creation initiatives and implementing programmes that encourage the involvement of 
<br/></span><span>unemployed individuals in different workplaces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the financial year 2023-2024, my Ministry successfully executed 
<br/>the Student Employment Exposure Programme in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the 
<br/>Fiji Commence and Employers Federation and the International Labour Organization. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the collaboration with these stakeholders on the 
<br/>success of this Student Employment Exposure Programme, which allows workplace placements for 
<br/>Year  11  students,  to  experience  the  world  of  work  during  the  two  weeks  school  holidays.  This 
<br/>initiative aims to facilitate the transition from school to employment of Year 11 students and this 
<br/>will be further extended to the Western and Northern Divisions in this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  would  also  organise  a  Mini  Job  Fair  in  the  Western  Division  in 
<br/>Koroivolu Park in Nadi last month.  Through the National Employment Centre, my Ministry invited 
<br/>20 employers and exhibitors to conduct walk-in interviews and offer immediate hiring opportunities.  
<br/>However, the number of employers doubled to 40 on the day of the event, signifying the high interest 
<br/>from our local employers to be part of this platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  remarkably,  the  two-day  event  resulted  in  the  employment  of  612 
<br/>individuals, while a total of 1,582 unemployed persons where registered in the work-ready pool for 
<br/>the participating employers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mini Job Fair serves to strengthen partnerships between the Ministry 
<br/>and  the  key  stakeholders,  including  private  sector  employers,  educational  institutions  and 
<br/>international organisations to improve employment opportunities in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, my Ministry plans to organise similar events in Suva, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well as in the Northern Division in the new financial year, to ensure inclusivity of all individuals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from  this,  we  also  have  a  Workplace  Attachment  Programme 
<br/>whereby  those  who  hold  certificates,  diplomas  and  degrees  can  register  with  the  National 
<br/>Employment Centre and we assist  them with  attachments at  suitable  workplaces for three to  six 
<br/>months.  Employers pay 50 percent and we pay the other 50 percent of the weekly wages.  Certificate 
<br/>and Diploma holders received $150 a week and graduates received $180 a week.  At the end of the 
<br/>three or six months, the employers may decide to employ the worker full time or permanently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, in collaboration with the external partners, Cabinet has sanctioned a review of 
<br/>the  National  Employment  Policy  of  2018  to  tackle  economic  disparities  and  encourage  self-
<br/>employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Policy will be developed through comprehensive consultations, and it 
<br/>aims to align with international best practices, ensuring that it meets the needs of all Fijians and 
<br/></span><span>empowers our citizens to engage actively in the local labour market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is committed to developing initiatives to bridge the skills gap 
<br/>among  our  graduates,  ensuring  that  they  possess  the  necessary  skills  to  meet  the  labour  market 
<br/>demands. We will also be implementing and overseeing policies to ensure fair compensation to our 
<br/>workers in accordance with the established wage guidelines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, we will be working with the various stakeholders to promote 
<br/>the  participation  of  Fijians  in  the  labour  market  through  initiatives  such  micro-skills  training, 
<br/></span><span>upskilling, re-skilling and facilitating connections between workers and potential employers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are collaborating with the training institutions, with the TSLS, with the 
<br/>Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth.  Together, we intend to move this forward. I thank 
<br/>you for the opportunity, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is what is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1523 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current rate of employment in Fiji at the moment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the question. I will get the answer for it later on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  a  supplementary question.  I noted from the 
<br/>presentation that there were thousands of students graduating with Certificate, Diploma and Bachelor 
<br/>who are still waiting.  We thank the honourable Minister for encouraging these new graduates to be 
<br/>introduced into the labour market.  My question is, while they are waiting or while they are enrolled 
<br/>into  the  areas  of  work  that  are  opened  up  for  them,  is  this  part  of  the  bond  system  that  is  being 
<br/>introduced by the Coalition Government, even though the area they are working in is not relevant to 
<br/>their area of study? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are burdened with the unemployed graduates or 
<br/>Diploma holders because of the poor planning in the past.  We did not plan according to the demands 
<br/>of the job markets. We have now got a comprehensive study done by Professor Hitendra Pillay, as 
<br/>was alluded to by the honourable Minister for Education yesterday, and according to that we have a 
<br/>5-Year to 10-Year plan.  We know which areas will be needing graduates and that is the way we are 
<br/>now awarding scholarships to students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those who are still unemployed, opportunities will come as we go along.  That is all I can 
<br/>say now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have also alluded to the fact that we are also reskilling and upskilling 
<br/>people.  So, there are opportunities to look at areas where there are opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  The honourable Minister just 
<br/>alluded  that  because  of  poor  planning,  they  have  graduates  not  being  employed.    Could  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, please, advice on which areas we have abundance of graduates and where can 
<br/>they get employment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually the statement came from the other side, that 
<br/>there are unemployed graduates and now let me tell you, Sir.  I know one area very well and that is 
<br/>Education because I was involved there.  In Education there are certain subjects in the secondary 
<br/>school, the teachers have been waiting for three to four years now after graduating waiting with no 
<br/>jobs. There are other areas where there is extreme shortage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  primary  schools,  we  have  secondary  school  teachers  who  are  unemployable  in 
<br/></span><span>secondary schools and teaching in primary schools, filling the gaps because there is big shortage in 
<br/></span><span>primary schools. So, that is a clear example. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Poor execution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Other examples? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one example is enough 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister in explaining all the 
<br/>measures that they have been taking for employment.  I congratulate him, but all those measures, 
<br/>there is nothing new there.  Those kinds of measures have been implemented for a long time and he 
<br/>will  find  that  no  government  is  perfect.    The  world  is  always  changing,  and  the  role  of  every 
<br/>government is continual improvement.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very interested in the 600 that got jobs. Do you have any tracking system later on to get 
<br/>some sort of feedback of how well they have fared so we can do some sort of analysis in terms of the 
<br/>selection process and what the outcome was for those that got their jobs?  I am just interested if there 
<br/>are any kinds of studies like those taking place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that question.  Of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>course, honourable Usamate has been an Educator and he knows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  National  Employment  Centre  has  got  all  the  data,  all  the  information  on  where  the 
<br/>workers are placed now, and we have the ability and the capability to follow and see how they are 
<br/>doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Progress of Work for Gas Crematoriums 
<br/>(Question No. 132/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  update 
<br/>Parliament on the utilisation of the $500,000 in the 2023–2024 financial year for the progress 
<br/>of works for gas crematorium in Navua, and the Western and Northern Divisions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J.  SINGH.  – Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  morning  when  I heard from  the leader of the 
<br/>Group of 9 Bloc, honourable Naivalurua that he had 9 plus 2, it gave me a little bit of comfort that I 
<br/>am in a comfort zone in Parliament now. So, I can relax and answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Do you believe that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.– Mr. Speaker, Sir,  in the next voting, we will probably know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by honourable Sachida Nand and I 
<br/>thank him for raising this question. Indeed, this question gives me an opportunity to highlight in this 
<br/>august  House  some  of  the  key  developments  my  Ministry  has  undertaken  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>crematorium project so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  all  know,  the  funding  in  the  previous  budgetary  provision  was  a  study  project  on 
<br/>crematoriums. In fact,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a budgetary provision of $500,000 just for the 
<br/></span><span>study but I will tell this august House that I hardly use $50,000 for the study because this project is 
<br/></span><span>not a new project in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We looked at the three Crematoriums - in Raralevu, of course, the Dignified Crematorium, 
<br/>so it is not a rocket scientist project. I got the help of the committee of Raralevu and Mr. Rosario who 
<br/>gave me the assistance with my team to see that we can do the project training at a very minimum 
<br/>cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  accomplished  all  the  necessary  paperwork  for  the  Tuatua 
<br/></span><span>Crematorium project, including design and engineering plans and a tender for the project was also 
<br/></span><span>called. The tender opened on 9th March, 2024 and closed on 27th March, 2024.  It was re-advertised 
<br/>on 4th May, 2024 and closed on 5th June, 2024 as the bidders did not meet the required specifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that the evaluation of this tender has been completed 
<br/>and the Ministry has submitted the Evaluation Report to the Government Tender Board for approval. 
<br/>The Ministry is expecting a response from the Government Tender Board by next week. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1525 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, the Ministry also called for tender for supply of 
<br/>installation, commissioning and training of four gas pipe cremators from India. The tender was called 
<br/>on 23rd March, 2024 and closed on 17th April, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to inform Parliament that the Government Tender Board 
<br/>has approved a contractor to supply, install and commission and provide training for the use of the 
<br/>four gas pipes cremators. The Ministry and supplier have signed a contractual agreement on 25th 
<br/>July, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the requirement of the Ministry of Environment, my Ministry is engaging 
<br/>a consultant to develop the Environment Management Plan (EMP) before initiating any construction 
<br/>work at Tuatua or other cemeteries for these gas pipe projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  last  week,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  received  an  Expression  of  Interest  from 
<br/>consultants to undertake the EMP.  A successful bidder will be identified by the end of this week to 
<br/>commence the EMP process. Once the EMP process is completed, the ground-breaking ceremony 
<br/>for Tuatua Cemetery will be conducted by the Ministry, hopefully, by the end of this month or early 
<br/>next month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to the installation of other gas pipe projects in this financial year, 
<br/>I am pleased to inform that the Ministry is working closely with the management of Lovu Cemetery 
<br/>in  Lautoka,  Varoko  Cemetery  in  Ba  and  Raiwaqa  Cemetery  in  Navua.  The  committees  of  these 
<br/>cemeteries are expected to carry out the construction works themselves, while the Ministry will only 
<br/>cover the cost of procurement and installation of the gas pipe cremators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  completed  all  due  diligent  and  are  in  process  of  completing  all  mandatory 
<br/>documentation for the project.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are processing as per our plans and expect to 
<br/>achieve full implementation before the end of this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the detailed 
<br/>explanation.  Just last week, I returned from Labasa.  I was slightly worried that the Tuatua Cemetery 
<br/>where  the  crematorium  has  been  identified  to  be  erected,  what  about  the  parking  area?      Is  there 
<br/>sufficient parking because most of the time, people going to Tuatua Cemetery park their vehicles on 
<br/>the roadside and that is a disaster waiting to happen.  Are we providing enough parking for people to 
<br/>come and park inside? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got a parking lot next to the Cemetery itself.  
<br/></span><span>So, there is one big lot next to the Cemetery and, of course, when there is overcrowding, then some 
<br/>people park on the road but a lot of people prefer to park on the road because as soon as the body is 
<br/>burnt, they want to get out of the place.  But if they part inside the parking lot, they will have to wait 
<br/>for other cars to move out.

<div><span>Construction of Seawalls – Natewa Bay Peninsula 
<br/>(Question No. 133/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>construction of seawalls in the villages situated in the Natewa Bay Peninsula? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must applaud the honourable Member for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interest in the seawalls in the villages situated in the Natewa Bay Peninsula and I congratulate him 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has completed the construction of a 400 metre boulder retaining 
<br/>wall at Drekeniwai Village, in the Savusavu District.  The project marks a significant milestone and 
<br/>the Ministry’s efforts to protect coastal communities from the impacts of climate change and coastal 
<br/>erosion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is working closely with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 
<br/>and  anticipates  signing  a  grant  agreement  worth  US$1.5  million  for  the  Nature  Based  Solutions 
<br/>Seawall projects in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This donor-funded initiative will fund the construction of six Nature Based Solution seawalls, 
<br/>which  include  two  sites  within  the  Natewa  Bay  Peninsula  in  Vanuavou  Village,  in  the  Vaturova 
<br/>District, and Navetau Village in the Saqani District. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first quarter of 2024-2025 financial year, the Ministry is set to sign a 
<br/>grant  agreement  worth  US$5million  with  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
<br/>Change (UNFCCC) Adaptation Fund through the Pacific Community. This project will construct 14 
<br/>Nature Based Solution seawalls with Tawake Village in the Saqani District being one of the sites in 
<br/>the Natewa Bay Peninsula. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  this  project  demonstrates  the  Ministry’s  commitment  to 
<br/>enhancing the resilience of coastal communities through sustainable and environmentally-friendly 
<br/>infrastructure and the Ministry is  grateful  for the support of international  partners that enable the 
<br/>implementation of these critical approaches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the update 
<br/>but  remember there  are  villages too  on the other side of the bay.  Please make sure that they get 
<br/>assistance as well. I will ask the question on behalf of Kanakana Village, Sir.  Honourable Minister, 
<br/>you have stated a few projects but Kanakana Village has been on the list for quite a while. Kanakana 
<br/>Village has the same threat as Vunidogoloa because it is at the mouth of the river and, of course the 
<br/>sea as well. I ask the honourable Minister if he can consider Kanakana Village as one of the priorities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must applaud the honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition for his interest in the Natewa Bay peninsula, in particular, on the other side.  Of course, 
<br/></span><span>we will include Kanakana Village in the list like you have stated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  supplementary  question.    We  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for the work of doing the retaining wall for Natewa. He has already mentioned 
<br/>about Viani, Drekeniwai up to Natewa; there is a Natewa Health Centre.  In my last visit there, there 
<br/>was evidence of coastal erosion along the boundary of the Natewa Health Centre.  My question to 
<br/>the honourable Minister, will that be included or will they relocate the health centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Member does not have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the same interest like the previous honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, we will see what the honourable Member has raised is looked into and included in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>list, Mr. Speaker, Sir.
