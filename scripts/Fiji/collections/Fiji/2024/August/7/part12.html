<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, we will 
<br/>then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, including the two groups, to speak on the 
<br/>Statement for no more than five minutes. As I have just said, I will also invite the leader of Group 9 
<br/>Bloc to speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  now  call  on  the  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  to  deliver  his 
<br/>Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament;  and  I  also  warmly  welcome  the 
<br/>students who are with us this morning and we wish them well in their studies. I also acknowledge 
<br/>the presence of the Japanese Ambassador with us this morning, and also those who are watching us 
<br/>on livestream or listening to the radio.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to say a few words on my recent three-day visit to Japan 
<br/>for the 10th Pacific Island Leaders Meeting or PALM10, and I thank His Excellency the Ambassador 
<br/>for pushing for me to go as I was thinking that I should not go. But when I went, I knew it was a 
<br/>good decision to go as I was there in the 1st PALM, and the only remaining Pacific Leader from that 
<br/>group that went to the 1st PALM.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Japan, like many of our other partners, has consistently been a reliable partner for Fiji over 
<br/>many  decades.  We  appreciate  Japan's constructive  engagement  in  the  region  and  its  significant 
<br/>contributions to Fiji's socio-economic development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year marks the 54th anniversary of our bilateral relations with Japan 
<br/>which, over the recent past, has been nothing short of impressive, while our multilateral relationship 
<br/>has been strengthened via the PALM Summit held every three years over the last 27 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  1997,  as  Prime  Minister,  I  led  the  Fiji  Delegation  to  the  1st  PALM 
<br/>Summit, held in Tokyo in that year, but three years prior to that, we had formed the foundation of the 
<br/>group that we eventually called PALM, also held in Japan and I was also there, and I had the honour 
<br/>of visiting His Majesty the Emperor at that time.  His young son was not in the palace, he was touring 
<br/>in Fiji at the time, and this time I met him as the Emperor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The relationship between Japan and the Pacific Island countries have developed along two 
<br/></span><span>tracks  -  the  bilateral  and  regional.    I  proposed,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  focus  first  on  the  bilateral 
<br/></span><span>relationship before I elaborate on the PALM Summit itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of our bilateral relationship in 1970, Japan has provided 
<br/>approximately  USD1.6  billion  worth  of  development  assistance  to  Fiji,  for  which  I  express  our 
<br/>sincere appreciation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  also  pleased  to  acknowledge  the  ongoing  positive  collaboration  and  exchanges  on  a 
<br/>possible  Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  between  our  two  countries.  A  Strategic  Partnership 
<br/></span><span>Agreement  would  be  a  landmark  achievement  in  advancing  our  bilateral  relationship  to  greater 
<br/></span><span>heights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Wednesday, 17</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024, I was privileged to lead our delegation 
<br/>to  a  bilateral  meeting  with  the Japanese  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Fumio  Kishida.   In 
<br/>discussions with Prime Minister Kishida, I acknowledged the continuous and continuing support 
<br/>of  the Government  of  Japan  with  our  infrastructure needs  in  critical  sectors  including 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>healthcare, education, fisheries, aviation, and disaster management capabilities.  I also expressed 
<br/>gratitude  for  the  approval  for a  stand-by  loan  for  disaster  recovery  and rehabilitation. The 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics elaborated on that during the 2024-2025 National Budget presentation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  establishment  of  a  seamless  disaster  prevention  system  in  Fiji 
<br/>through initiatives such as the Disaster Risk Management Reporting Service using the Quasi-Zenith 
<br/>Satellite System  (QZSS).  It  is  called “Michibiki”, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The QZSS enabled disaster 
<br/>reporting  service, will  enable  our  people  to  be  better  informed of  imminent  natural  disasters, 
<br/>facilitating better preparation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To further our bilateral cooperation, three documents were signed, the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Minutes of Meeting for a study on feasibility of utilising Japan's renewal, maintenance and 
<br/>repair technologies to extend the lifespan of the bridges, and feasibility of public private 
<br/>partnership projects. This is between the Ministry of Infrastructure of Japan and the Fiji 
<br/>Ministry of Public Works and the Fiji Roads Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Memorandum of Cooperation in Emergency Warning Satellite System using QZSS.  This 
<br/>is between the National Space Policy Secretariat, the Cabinet Office of the Government of 
<br/>Japan and Fiji’s Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Fiji’s Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources. 
<br/> Memorandum  of  Cooperation  on Trade  and  Investment  Promotion between  the  Japan 
<br/>External Trade Organization (JETRO) and Investment Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Prime  Minister  Kishida  and  I  also  exchanged views  on  various  regional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issues, including the proposal for the ‘Zone or Ocean of Peace</span><span>.’ </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also informed Prime Minister Kishida, Sir, of our gratitude to the Government of Japan for 
<br/>its transparency and honesty in dealing with the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS</span><span>)</span><span>.  We 
<br/>acknowledge  Japan's commitment  to  keeping  the  Forum  Leaders and  the  global  community  fully 
<br/>informed of the measures being taken to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the ALPS process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  noted  the  International  Atomic  Energy Agency’s  (IAEA)</span><span> </span><span>4th  July,  2023  report  and 
<br/>the IAEA  Taskforce’s  first  full  report  issued  in January  of  this  year,  since  the  discharge  began 
<br/>last year.  The IAEA Task Force concluded the discharge to be consistent with the international safety 
<br/>standards and reaffirmed the conclusions from the Agency’s comprehensive safety report issued last 
<br/></span><span>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We continue to request the Government of Japan to continue to take measures in accordance 
<br/>with international safety standards and to take all possible measures to ensure no transboundary harm 
<br/>to the Blue Pacific Continent happens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PALM Summit held every three years since 1997, has developed into a 
<br/>central platform for regional policy dialogue.  I commend the Government and the people of Japan 
<br/>for the consistent delivery of its commitments throughout the PALM process for nearly three decades.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Thursday, 18</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 10</span><span>th</span><span> Pacific Island Leaders Meeting was 
<br/>held under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Kishida Fumio, Prime Minister for Japan, and the honourable 
<br/>Mark Brown, Prime Minister of Cook Islands and current Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders 
<br/>Meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I attended the Summit with Leaders and representatives of 14 Pacific Island countries, as well 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Secretary-General of the 
<br/>Pacific Islands Forum (PIF).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the Government of Japan for agreeing to incorporate 
<br/>the seven priority areas of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and its Implementation 
<br/>Plan  into  the  PALM  process.    This  was  achieved  via  a  series  of  preparatory  meeting  of  Senior 
<br/>Officials  of  PIF  Member  States,  with  representatives  of  the  Government  of  Japan  at  the  Forum 
<br/>Secretariat in the months and weeks leading up to the Summit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outcomes of Senior Forum Officials discussions were tabled to the Caucus Meeting of 
<br/>Pacific Leaders in Tokyo on Wednesday, 17</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024, prior to the PALM Summit on 18</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2024.  As an aside, that Caucus Meeting allowed Pacific Leaders to also discuss other urgent matters, 
<br/>including the situation in New Caledonia, while we were still in Tokyo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Leaders issued a Declaration and Joint Action Plan as the outcome of 
<br/>our discussions.  The PALM10 Joint Action Plan is the basis for mutually acceptable projects for 
<br/>cooperation and exchange.   The honourable Leader of the Opposition pointed out this morning that 
<br/>perhaps we did not see indications of the success of our participation in COP Meetings, but the same 
<br/>was true for PALM.  Most of the actions take place after those consultations at those meetings, and 
<br/>the result will come when there is direct consultation with the officials of the various Governments 
<br/>participating.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Plan includes multiple concrete projects for cooperation and exchange, in line with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2050 Strategy and its Implementation Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Joint Action Plan endorsed at the Summit, forms the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>basis for mutually acceptable projects for cooperation and exchanges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  the  PALM  Summit  and  bilateral  meeting  with  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister of Japan, there were an additional 13 engagements and meetings that were made for a very 
<br/>busy three-day visit to the ‘Land of the Rising Sun.’   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along with the other Pacific leaders, Mrs. Rabuka and I were also honoured to meet their 
<br/>Royal Majesties, the Emperor and the Empress of Japan, in a brief audience.  And as I have mentioned 
<br/>earlier, he was a young man when I visited his father, the late Emperor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Prime  Minister  of  Japan,  honourable  Kishida,  also  hosted  Pacific  Leaders  to  a  State 
<br/></span><span>Banquet, and I must express my gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Government of Japan for all 
<br/>the full courtesies and privileges given to me and my delegation.  I do not know whether he will get 
<br/>the </span><span>Letters to the Editor</span><span> questioning the cost of the banquet, but that is for him to deal with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I held fruitful discussions with the Chairman of the Japanese Internation 
<br/>Cooperation Agency (JICA), Dr. Akihiko Tanaka, to discuss ongoing and new areas of development 
<br/>cooperation. One area, Sir, that has been successful is the area of people-to-people exchange and 
<br/>human resource development.  While I was there, part of the discussions for the return of the remains 
<br/></span><span>of  a  young  man  who  was  playing  rugby  there.    We  thank  the  Government  of  Japan  for  their 
<br/></span><span>cooperation and also the Ministry of Health of Fiji in their cooperation for the return of the remains 
<br/>of that young man.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  close  observation  of  the  strength  of  the  Japanese  economy  and 
<br/>infrastructure, which must  be described  as the  miraculous transformation from  the struggles after 
<br/>World War II.  I was impressed that despite the economic success, the people of Japan have retained 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1473 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their culture of discipline, hard work, respect and civility.  In this regard, I sought more opportunities 
<br/>for people-to-people exchange, in particular for our young people, including sports exchange.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just as an aside, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was very peaceful and orderly on the roads in Japan. 
<br/>They have much better roads than we have, they are much cleaner, and the drivers are so courteous. 
<br/>Even in traffic, we did not hear anyone honking as they respected the law that exists.  It is used only 
<br/>in an emergency or dangerous situation. I was travelling in one of the new energy cars and I hope we 
<br/>will be able to buy, we have charging facilities in Fiji, all the cars were clean - very clean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the presents of PIF leaders in one location allowed me to catch up briefly 
<br/>with the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Penny Wong and a few other leaders. I also 
<br/>had  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  the  Speaker  of  the  Japanese  Legislative  Assembly,  honourable 
<br/>Fukishiro Nukaga and the Chairman of the Japan-Fiji Parliamentary Friendship League and other 
<br/>senior members enthusiastically attended our meeting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  have  invited  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  send  a  delegation  from  Fiji  to  continue  the 
<br/>conversation in the league I conveyed to honourable Nukaga your greetings, Sir, and I also conveyed 
<br/>his  reciprocals  greetings to  you.  I also  took  the  opportunity  to  invite the honourable Nukaga  and 
<br/>members  of  the  Japan-Fiji  Parliamentary  Friendship  League  to  visit  Fiji,  perhaps  on  the  55</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>Anniversary of our Independence which is next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also took the opportunity to meet with key Non-Profit Foundations who 
<br/>have been long time friends and supporters of Fiji and the Pacific. These are the Sasakawa Peace 
<br/>Foundation and its parent, the Nippon Foundation. I looked around and I felt that I was the oldest in 
<br/>the hall, then I went to these two leaders and found out that I was very young.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sasakawa Peace Foundation hosted the Japan-Fiji Nations Conference in Tokyo in 1988, 
<br/>attended  by  the  late  former  President,  Prime  Minister  and  </span><span>Turaga  Bale  Na  Tui  Nayau</span><span>,  Ratu  Sir 
<br/>Kamisese Mara, nine years before the first Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM) Summit held in 
<br/>1997 and its still there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sasakawa  Peace  Foundation  hosted  a  special  week  of  seminars  and  lectures  during  the 
<br/>PALM10 Summit to which it invited Pacific Leaders, academics and researchers. I was honoured to 
<br/>attend to give my view on the PALM Summit and the challenges that we faced  in Fiji and in the 
<br/>Pacific. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation  carries out extensive work on oceans related projects as 
<br/>well research related to the blue economy and Scholarships for the World Marine University. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was also honoured, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to meet Dr. Yohei Sasakawa, the Chairman of Nippon 
<br/>Foundation which facilitates development cooperation in Fiji and other parts of the world on ocean-
<br/>related projects as well as disaster preparedness, quality education and health, particularly on leprosy 
<br/>and poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I always relish the opportunity to meet our people who have made Japan 
<br/>their home or the country that I visit as their home and Japan was no exception.  My meeting with 
<br/>the diaspora in Japan at Fiji House, the residence of our ambassador, was a joyful one.  I also met my 
<br/></span><span>grandson (honourable Minister for Education’s son), who was mixing the </span><span>yaqona</span><span>. I thought he would 
<br/></span><span>make the presentation, he told me, “</span><span>Au sega ni kila na vosa vaka noqu.”</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also noted that this is a subjective observation that they are the most polite diaspora group 
<br/>that I have met. I think the culture of the Japanese has got onto them. They are very courteous and 
<br/>polite. I do not know what will happen when they come back to Fiji. I hope they retain that culture 
<br/>or respect.  I believe the respectful manners, hard work and discipline of the Japanese people have or

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>influenced them really positively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  highlighted by these areas  of collaboration, our enduring relationship 
<br/>with Japan is marked by increasing engagement across various critical sectors and issues and I take 
<br/>this opportunity to thank the Government and the people of Japan and JICA for their support and 
<br/>partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I  now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first let me thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>on his Ministerial Statement on the recent Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM10) that was held 
<br/>in Tokyo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I speak on some of the issues that he raised, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just clarify our 
<br/>non-attendance  to  the  </span><span>veiqaravi  vakavanua</span><span>  yesterday  because  we  were  confronted  with  so  many 
<br/>questions from Members of Government.  Let me clear the air that we did not boycott the </span><span>veiqaravi</span><span>
<br/>yesterday. Simply  we did  not  receive  any official  invitation  from  Government.  And, honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, Sir, this has been the case in the three recent visits – visit by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister of Australia, honourable Prime Minister of New Zealand and, again, yesterday.  Someone 
<br/>in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to answer to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are equally concerned 
<br/>and disappointed too and I need to raise it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I will see to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, PALM plays a very important role in strengthening our cooperation within the region and 
<br/>indeed  with  our  bilateral  partners.  I,  therefore,  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>participation in the PALM10 Summit and for having committed Fiji to the Leaders Declaration and 
<br/>Joint Action Plan as agreed to by the leaders during the Summit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to acknowledge the leadership of the Government of Japan and I 
<br/>convey that through His Excellency the Ambassador who is in Parliament this morning for hosting 
<br/>the Summit and, of course, indeed Japan plays a very crucial role in our development as Small Island 
<br/>States  and  has  demonstrated  that  through  the  years.    I  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for 
<br/>clarifying the bilateral and, of course, the regional cooperation that we have with Japan as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Fiji in particular, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has alluded to Japan’s contribution 
<br/>towards our Disaster Management Programmes and relief over the years that have been immense. I 
<br/>benefitted  a  lot  from  the  exchanges  with  Japan,  particularly  with  the  Father  of  Disaster  Risk 
<br/>Reduction (DRR), the old Professor, and Fiji through the NDMO has learnt a lot, and of course, with 
<br/>the signing of one of the three MOUs particularly, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, on the Quasi-
<br/>Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) satellite system.  That is most welcomed because Japan also played 
<br/>a key role in the development of our Disaster Risk Reduction Policy that is consistent with the Sendai 
<br/>Framework of 2015.  A particular element of the DRR Policy is on Early Warning Systems and that 
<br/></span><span>relates to our resilience particularly, and of course, that is a welcome move.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, honourable Prime Minister for highlighting the issue on the Fukushima Nuclear 
<br/>Waste.  That was one of the questions that I would want to raise because last year, I thank the Japanese 
<br/>Ambassador,  my  office  was  provided  with  an  update  on  the  scientific  assessment  of  the  waste; 
<br/>science is science.  It is actually the effects on the ground that we want to hear, and of course, with 
<br/>the leaders present, we thank you for providing that update because it will probably provide some

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relief to those concerned Pacific Islanders and environmentalist.  We hope that we will continue to 
<br/>have dialogue with the Japanese Government as we progress when more of such waste is dumped 
<br/>into the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have heard about the three MOUs.  One of the major projects, honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>Sir, that was discussed previously is the Nadi River Realignment, whether that was also brought up 
<br/>in your meeting with JICA President, but His Excellency the Ambassador is listening this morning, 
<br/>that is a major project for Fiji; the Nadi River realignment.  The scoping has been done already, the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture with  the Department  of Land and Water Resources was heavily involved 
<br/>before the formation of waterways and that is something that is hanging in the agenda between our 
<br/>two countries.  I hope that this is something that can be pursued further and, of course, the Ministry 
<br/>of Waterways and Rural Development will also be very keen to see how this will progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for your Statement this morning and of course we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>acknowledge once again our cooperation with the Government and the people of Japan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Group of Nine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand on behalf of G9 plus 2.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.-  Sorry G9 Bloc, just a slip of the tongue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is increasing or is it your tongue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- I rise to say  thank you and acknowledge the Ministerial Statement 
<br/>by the honourable Prime Minister on his back brief to this honourable House on his visit to Japan 
<br/>which  has    covered  the  bilateral  relationship  between  the  Fiji  Government  and  the  Japanese 
<br/>Government, and likewise an overview of the PALM discussions in the meeting that he had attended.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is of great interest to our side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is really the issue on the Zone of Peace.  
<br/></span><span>I think Japan plays an important role in supporting Fiji in ensuring not  only the Indo-Pacific is  a 
<br/></span><span>peaceful, stable and prosperous nation or zone, but has a very effective role to play in supporting our 
<br/>zone here as the Zone of Peace or the Ocean of Peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  bilateral  issues,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for 
<br/>highlighting the Agreements or the Memorandum of Cooperation that has been signed.  We know in 
<br/>this honourable House that our National Budget is not able to support all our needs, wants and there 
<br/>is an endless list.  I take this time to thank the Japanese Government for their support in the past years 
<br/>in the areas that we have asked for their support and cooperation, and this has covered many areas 
<br/></span><span>and fields.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to highlight a specific one which just happened recently, that is, the visit of the 
<br/>Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces to Japan.  What has been highlighted in his visit 
<br/>that  an  agreement  where  both  Japan  and  our  small  country  here  recognised  the  importance  of 
<br/>maintaining  our  region,  our  zone  and  our  home  as  a  place  where  there  is  peace,  stability  and 
<br/>prosperity.

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps in the presence of His Excellency the 
<br/>Ambassador this morning to raise a point and request for the assistance to Black Rock.  There is a 
<br/>great need to build a hospital in Black Rock, the honourable Whip on my side here when he was the 
<br/>Commander, he had brought this issue up.  I wanted to take this opportunity if they are able to support 
<br/>us in building a good hospital inside there and it will help the hospitals in the Nadi and Lautoka areas.    
<br/>I also acknowledge the support for the Search and Rescue.  Thank you very much Your Excellency 
<br/>for that particular role that your Government has played. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  before  I  sit,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  point  that  was  raised  that  perhaps  excited  me  is  the 
<br/>People-to-People  Exchanges  of  Cooperation  which  has  been  spoken  at  length  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister.  If there is something that we should learn from, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the people.  
<br/>Japan, they are unique in many ways; their character, the way they behave, the way they act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, we spoke about the toilets here and our inability to use the toilets properly perhaps 
<br/>is of great concern.  The cleanest toilets I know of, is in Japan.  People know how to behave, how to 
<br/>act because of their character and what they have been taught to do. So, I would encourage more 
<br/>People-to-People exchanges between our country and this wonderful place, Japan.  I thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  highlight  a  few  of  these  issues  in  response  to  the  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement by the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- If I may just add a bit on what you have stated and that is the state of our 
<br/>toilets yesterday.  Honourable Members, I forgot that the state of the toilets here in Parliament too is 
<br/>something for you to see, it is so dirty.  We are talking about public toilets, yet our toilets right here 
<br/>are not clean.  Maybe my staff or maybe the members of the public are not careful in how they utilise 
<br/>this public convenience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, I am taken by a line stated by the honourable Prime Minister on his visit to 
<br/>the great country of Japan in that given that the people who are responsible for PALM who initiated 
<br/>the PALM project, they are still around.  That is why the honourable Prime Minister mentioned that 
<br/>he was still young… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Still young. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- … very young.  I like that because the energy now in Fiji is to get more 
<br/>youth into Parliament but at the same time, the lesson learnt from Japan is the longevity of life and 
<br/>how they rely on the wisdom of the old people to guide them through, that is overwhelming and 
<br/></span><span>interesting.   Maybe those are some things that we need to learn from as highlighted by honourable 
<br/></span><span>Naivalurua  of  the  great  country  of  Japan  and  we  thank  you  His  Excellency  for  all  that  you  have 
<br/>rendered to the country of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, on that note, I would like to adjourn the House for morning tea and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will resume when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>Tourism and Civil Aviation to deliver his Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Northern Air Britten Norman Islander Aircraft Incident - Gau Aerodrome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen;  
<br/>before  I  commence,  let  me  just  comment  on  the  visit  by  Her  Excellency  the  President  of  India. 
<br/>Actually, a delightful lady, I was honoured to be given the privilege to meet her at Nadi Airport and 
<br/>at Sheraton, a truly, truly delightful experience.  I was quite saddened that I did not see the Opposition 
<br/>at the traditional ceremony yesterday and as you know, going forward, this Government now does 
<br/>not exclude anyone.  So, we made a commitment to correct that going forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. – Like you boycotted Moti? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- On the visit by Prime Minister Modi, the arrangement was such - in 
<br/>writing, delivered to the SODELPA people at that time, that the Leader of Opposition, Ro Teimumu 
<br/>Kepa,  would  deliver  the  Vote  of  Thanks.    But  two  days  before  the  event,  government  said 
<br/>“Opposition,  you  have  no  role  to  play  in  this,  we  will  do  it  all”.  We  were  boycotting  the  heavy-
<br/>handedness of the FijiFirst Party, not of Prime Minister Moti.  Let me clarify that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  –The  programme  came  from  Parliament,  which  is  sovereign. 
<br/>Parliament said, “Leader of Opposition, you give the Vote of Thanks.”  But then the Prime Minister 
<br/>came and said, “No, we will do it all.” So, that is it, not against Prime Minister Modi who we cherish 
<br/>very much, but the heavy-handedness in which it was handled. We were protesting that. Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to clarify that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation, I rise today to shed light on 
<br/>the  recent  incident  involving  a  Northern  Air  Britten  Norman  Islander  (BN2A)  Aircraft  at  Gau 
<br/>Aerodrome on the morning of 23</span><span>rd</span><span> July, 2024.  This incident has understandably raised concerns, but 
<br/>it also presents an opportunity to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to aviation safety and our 
<br/>collective resilience in the face of challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that day, the aircraft overran its designated landing area and collided 
<br/>with a rock mound at the end of the runway. Despite the significant damage to the aircraft, I am glad 
<br/>to report that the two crew members and three passengers on board were swiftly and safely evacuated 
<br/>without any injuries by airport personnel. This outcome is a testament to the rigorous emergency 
<br/>response procedures and the exemplary professionalism of our aviation personnel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to assure this august House and the people of Fiji that aviation safety is paramount for 
<br/>this Government.  Fiji is a signatory to the Chicago Convention and is bound by the International 
<br/></span><span>Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  standards.  These  standards  are  the  bedrock  of  our  national 
<br/></span><span>aviation  regulations,  ensuring  that  all  aircraft  operators  and  personnel  meet  stringent  safety 
<br/>requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To operate commercially,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, an  aircraft must possess a valid Certificate of 
<br/>Airworthiness,  the  airline  must  hold  a  valid  Air  Operator’s  Certificate,  and  the  pilot  must  be 
<br/>appropriately licensed.  Moreover, the airport itself must be certified to accommodate the specific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>1478 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>type of operation. This rigorous certification process is overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority of 
<br/>Fiji (CAAF), as part of our robust aviation safety oversight system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to reiterate that the safety of our citizens and visitors is of utmost importance. While 
<br/>the  recent  incident  in  Gau  Aerodome  is  deeply  regrettable,  it  is  crucial  to  understand  that  a 
<br/>comprehensive investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the overrun. The findings 
<br/>of this investigation will inform any necessary corrective actions and enhancements to our aviation 
<br/>safety protocols. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with the Civil Aviation (Occurrence Reporting and Investigation) Regulation 2009, 
<br/>Captain Norman Walding has been appointed as the Aircraft Accident Investigator. Captain Walding 
<br/>has been involved in the aviation industry for five decades, starting as a pilot and flying instructor on 
<br/>light aircraft, and later as captain on medium-sized twin turbo-prop aircraft. He spent over 15 years 
<br/>as a Senior Flight Operations Inspector at the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF), regulating 
<br/>the  domestic  aviation  industry  during  which  time  he  had  been  engaged  to  conduct  several 
<br/>investigations in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, accident investigations are pivotal in our quest to enhance aviation safety. 
<br/>They  are  not  about  assigning  blame,  but  about  uncovering  the  causes  and  implementing  safety 
<br/>recommendations to prevent future incidents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s  effective  safety  oversight  implementation  rate  is  currently  sitting  above  the  global 
<br/>average of 61 percent.  The  ICAO audit for  Fiji  is  sitting at  78.72 percent since 2019, which is  a 
<br/>testament to our adherence to international standards and our proactive safety measures. Our skies 
<br/>remain among the safest, and this investigation will only serve to strengthen that assurance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  aircraft  involved,  a  43-year-old  model,  was  maintained  diligently  by  CAAF, 
<br/>underscoring  the  importance  of  rigorous  maintenance  and  operational  standards.    Northern  Air, 
<br/>which owns and operates four aircrafts, also owns and operates an additional three Cessna aircrafts 
<br/>for  its  South  Pacific  Aviation  Training  Institute  (SPATI)  Flying  School,  which  operates  out  of 
<br/>Nausori Airport aerodrome.  The airline continues to uphold these high standards, ensuring that our 
<br/>aviation operations are conducted safely and efficiently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our pilots, including those involved in this incident, are experienced professionals dedicated 
<br/>to the highest levels of safety and competence.  Northern Air’s aircraft has been certified as airworthy, 
<br/>confirming that the aircraft is in good operational condition. Additionally, the airline’s Air Operator’s 
<br/></span><span>Certificate is valid.  These valid safety documents reflect our stringent regulatory oversight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the investigation process, which is currently underway, is aligned with the 
<br/>Civil Aviation (Occurrence Reporting and Investigation) Regulations 2009.  The State of Occurrence, 
<br/>Fiji in this case, is primarily responsible for the investigation, which includes the notification of the 
<br/>accident to the State of design, manufacture, and to the International Civil Aviation Organization 
<br/>(ICAO). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Minister  responsible  for  Civil  Aviation  appoints  the  Investigator-in-Charge,  who  is 
<br/></span><span>granted extensive powers to access and analyse evidence, issue safety recommendations, and produce 
<br/></span><span>both,  preliminary  and  final  reports.    Captain  Walding,  our  appointed  Investigator-in-Charge,  will 
<br/>ensure  a  comprehensive  examination  of  the  incident,  preserving  evidence,  inspecting  aircraft  and 
<br/>components, and accessing manufacturing and maintenance premises as needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investigation process typically spans  over a  year, to  ensure thoroughness  in  line with 
<br/>ICAO  standards.    A  preliminary  report  is  expected  to  be  produced  in  the  first  phase  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1479 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investigation,  which  is  30  days  after  the  appointment  of  the  investigator,  while  a  final  report  is 
<br/>expected to be produced by the Accident Investigator at the end of the investigation, typically after 
<br/>12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As normally expected after an investigation is carried out and a final report is produced, the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  ensures  that  safety  recommendations  are  addressed 
<br/>appropriately, and preventative actions that are considered necessary, are taken promptly to enhance 
<br/>aviation safety.  In addition, the final report is also submitted to ICAO as a guide to future global 
<br/>safety measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  allow  me  to  highlight  an  element  that  is  needed  for 
<br/>dissemination for public consumption with regards to subsidies.  Gau Aerodrome, like several others, 
<br/>including Vanuabalavu, Koro, Cicia, Lakeba, Rotuma and Kadavu, operates under a subsidy.  These 
<br/>island routes, which are not regularly serviced by sea transport, are applicable under the air subsidy 
<br/>scheme.  These subsidies are not merely financial support - they are investments in connecting our 
<br/>communities, fostering economic growth and ensuring that every Fijian, regardless of their location, 
<br/>has access to safe and reliable air travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Airports  operates  the  Nadi  International  Airport  and  manages  Nausori  International 
<br/>Airport  and  13  domestic  outer  island  airports  on  behalf  of  the  Government.    These  airports  are 
<br/>overseen by CAAF to ensure they are safe and secure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This incident, while unfortunate, is a poignant reminder of our shared commitment to safety, 
<br/>our resilience, and our continuous pursuit of excellence.  It is through these challenges that we grow 
<br/>stronger, reaffirming our dedication to the safety and wellbeing of every passenger who takes to our 
<br/>skies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to re-emphasise that the objective of the accident investigation is to generate safety 
<br/>data and information to aid with the prevention of future and similar accidents from occurring.  It is 
<br/>not to apportion blame or liability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition for giving me this opportunity to respond to the honourable Minister because I had posed 
<br/></span><span>the initial question that was supposed to be addressed by the honourable Minister a day before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/>gave his Ministerial Statement, he spoke about the recent visit of the President of India to Parliament, 
<br/>and then tried to justify their actions back in 2014 when they were not present in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am just responding to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I was sitting there too, honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  fact  remains  that  when  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister of India, Mr. Modi, came to this Parliament, the Opposition were missing, but when the 
<br/>President of India came the Opposition were present, although we were not invited for the traditional 
<br/>welcome.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, now going on to the substantive matter of what transpired in Gau, it is good to 
<br/>know that everyone is safe. While flying in the maritime areas and navigating through the terrain, 
<br/>especially rough terrain, it is not easy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Northern Airline has been providing services in  the maritime areas for some 
<br/>time now. We need to look at the safety, visibility needs to be clear when pilots are approaching the 
<br/>airstrip and Government needs to actually start thinking of investing in the lights at the airstrip. It is 
<br/>much more easier to land a plane in Nadi, Nausori or in Labasa, but it is really difficult for a pilot to 
<br/>land a plane in this kind of terrain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also note that Northern Air is the only Airline that provides competition to 
<br/>Fiji Link. Previously, Northern Air used to provide a daily service on the main routes - Nadi to Suva, 
<br/>Nadi to Labasa and Labasa to Suva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if we look at Fiji Link, their parent company - Fiji Airways, has lucrative routes 
<br/>to fly to, like Nadi to Auckland, Nadi to Sydney, Nadi to Los Angeles, Nadi to Singapore, et cetera.  
<br/>The  profits  that  are  obtained  by  Fiji  Airways  are  invested  in  the  new  fleet.  Unfortunately,  the 
<br/>Government is using Northern Air as their social responsibility tool to subsidise the flights and fly 
<br/>them to maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unless and until we allow Northern Air to fly on lucrative routes, such as Nadi to Suva, Nadi 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Labasa, Labasa to Suva …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do for 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It’s deregulated – no restrictions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- …they are not able to fly out of Suva to Labasa on a daily basis. 
<br/>They need to start flying on daily basis and, at least, three times a day to provide a better competition 
<br/>to the passengers who are actually travelling.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before speaking,  I did a bit of research  on my  phone.    If  I  have to  travel to 
<br/>Labasa tomorrow and return the day after, the minimum fare that I might be paying to Fiji Link is 
<br/>$350 and the maximum is $1,220.  How is this justified, Mr. Speaker, Sir 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If more conducive environment is provided to Northern Air to fly more on this lucrative flight, 
<br/></span><span>they can then invest in the new fleet and not rely on the fleet, as mentioned by the honourable Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister that was more than 40 years old. They need to make profits on lucrative routes in 
<br/>order  to  invest  in  the  new  fleet.  And  if  we  are  able  to  produce  or  give  this  kind  of  conducive 
<br/>environment to Northern Air, Mr. Speaker, they can invest in new planes and such an incident can 
<br/>be prevented in the future. That is all, Mr. Speaker, </span><span>vinaka</span><span>.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Deregulated, my friend. They can fly anywhere they want.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- And I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his desigate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to extend my sincere appreciation to the  
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation for his dedication 
<br/>and  relentless  effort  in  leading  the  investigation  related  to  the  unfortunate  accident  involving  a 
<br/>Northern Air Britten Norman Islander (BN-2A) aircraft at Gau Aerodrome, where two crews and 
<br/>three passengers  were on board.  This is in accordance with section 16 of the Civil Aviation Act 
<br/>1976 which deals with liability for loss or damage caused by aircraft.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the timely submission of the preliminary update report to Parliament this 
<br/>morning will be instrumental in reinforcing our commitment towards aviation safety.  The detailed 
<br/>insights, as well as the in-depth analysis encapsulated in the report so far, offer us essential tools for 
<br/>the effective prevention of future accidents of a similar nature.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, the comprehensive nature of the investigation has underscored 
<br/>the need for thorough review of our existing safety protocols, not just at Gau Island, but across the 
<br/>aerodromes domestically, thus, setting in motion the appropriate plans for improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the finding and recommendation in the preliminary report, as 
<br/>we have heard this morning, I am sure that necessary steps will be taken promptly to implement the 
<br/>proposed  changes.    This  will  be  done  to  improve  the  safety  of  our  domestic  aerodromes,  and  to 
<br/>continuously  ensure  the  protection  of  passengers  and  the  crew,  alike.    Despite,  this  unfortunate 
<br/>circumstance that led to this, it is commendable that we have turned a challenging scenario into a 
<br/>learning opportunity, thereby, enhancing our aviation standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I extend my sincere gratitude to the dedication and the earnest endeavour shown 
<br/>by the honourable Minister during this investigation process. I am positive that with such continuous 
<br/>leadership,  we  will  successfully  navigate  the  improvements,  to  ensure  the  safety  of  our  aviation 
<br/>industry in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I only hope that it was not stray dogs that led to that accident in Gau. They 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>usually have a problem with stray dogs there.  They took care of it and ate all the dogs.

<div><span>National Sports, Recreation and Physical Activity Policy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the    honourable 
<br/>Leader of the  Opposition,  honourable Members  of Parliament,  I  acknowledge those sitting in  the 
<br/>public gallery and viewers who are watching through television broadcast live from their comfort 
<br/>zone; it is with a profound sense of duty and optimism that I stand before you today, through the 
<br/>Grace of God, to present and discuss the National Sports, Recreation and Physical Activity Policy, 
<br/></span><span>which we have recently launched as a Ministry in July 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before, I do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, kindly allow me to congratulate and to thank our men’s 
<br/>Rugby Sevens Gladiators.  Congratulations for winning the Silver Medal, and we thank you most 
<br/>sincerely for making our nation proud of your achievement.  I also wish to commend our Fijiana 
<br/>Sevens Team and other Olympians representing Fiji for giving their best efforts on the field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Policy has been a long time in the making, reflecting years of dedication 
<br/>and collaborative effort since 2017.  Its launch represents the culmination of a vision that has been 
<br/></span><span>patiently nurtured and stands as a testament to our commitment to fostering a vibrant, inclusive and 
<br/></span><span>sustainable sports culture for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this policy is not just a formal document, it is a bold and comprehensive 
<br/>plan that reflects our commitment to the future of sports, recreation and physical activity in Fiji.  This 
<br/>policy is designed to be a blueprint for the development of sports across all levels, from grassroots 
<br/>participation to elite performance, to ensure that physical activity is woven into the fabric of our daily

<div><span>lives.   Sports in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has always been more than just competition.  It is an integral 
<br/>part of our national identity, a source of pride and a means of fostering unity among our people.  With 
<br/>this, we are not only looking to the future of sports, but also addressing the present challenges and 
<br/>opportunities that lie before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the significance of the National Sports Creation and Physical Activity 
<br/>Policy,  the  importance  of  this  policy  to  sports  development  in  Fiji  cannot  be  overstated.  Sports 
<br/>recreation and physical activity are essential elements of healthy, dynamic and prosperous society. 
<br/>They contribute to the physical and mental well-being of individuals, strengthen social ties within 
<br/>communities and have a significant impact on our economy.  The policy also embraces the fact that 
<br/>sports play a crucial role in addressing the youth issues facing Fiji today, such as unemployment, 
<br/>substance abuse, social isolation, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By engaging young people in structured sports programmes, we provide them with positive 
<br/>outlets for their energy and creativity, helping to deter them from negative behaviours.  Sports teach 
<br/>valuable  life  skills,  like  discipline,  teamwork  and  leadership  which  are  essential  for  personal 
<br/>development and future employment. Moreover, by fostering a sense of community belonging, sports 
<br/>help to build self-esteem and resilience among youth, empowering them to overcome challenges and 
<br/>contribute positively to society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on its economic impacts, the potential of sports as a catalyst for development 
<br/>is immense.  Studies have shown in Fiji that for every dollar invested in sports, there is a return of 
<br/>$20.  This return comes in the form of economic growth, job creation and the promotion of tourism.  
<br/>Sports events both large and small attract visitors, generate revenue for local businesses and creates 
<br/>jobs across a range of sectors from hospitality to retail, from event management to media coverage.  
<br/>Moreover, investing in sports infrastructure and programmes can lead to long term savings in health 
<br/>care cost.  As a nation grappling with the rise of NCDs, we must recognise the preventative power 
<br/>of physical activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The social and cultural benefits of sports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are equally significant.  Sports 
<br/>have  a  unique  ability  to bring  people  together,  transcending  differences  of  ethnicity,  religion  and 
<br/>socio-economic status.  They foster a sense of community belonging and shared purpose.  Through 
<br/>sports, we can build bridges between different groups within our society, promoting social cohesion 
<br/>and national unity. This policy is designed to ensure that sports and physical activities are accessible 
<br/>to all Fijians, regardless of age, gender, ability or background.  By promoting inclusivity, we are not 
<br/>only enriching our sports culture, but also ensuring that every citizen has the opportunity to lead a 
<br/></span><span>healthy and active lifestyle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  health  and  well-being,  the  health  benefits  of  regular  physical  activity  are  well-
<br/>documented, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Physical activity is not only essential for maintaining physical health, 
<br/>but it also has profound effects on mental health.  In a world where stress, anxiety and depression are 
<br/>increasingly common, sports and recreation offer a vital outlet for stress relief and emotional well-
<br/>being.  This policy aligns with our national health goals by encouraging Fijians to engage in regular 
<br/>physical  activity  which  will  help  reduce  the  prevalence  of  Non-Communicable  Diseases.  By 
<br/>promoting active lifestyles, we are making a long-term investment in the health of our nation. This, 
<br/></span><span>in turn, will lead to a healthier, happier population, with fewer healthcare costs and a stronger and 
<br/></span><span>more resilient workforce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to delve into the key components of this policy which are designed 
<br/>to  address  the  diverse  needs  of  our  population  and  the  various  challenges  we  face  in  sports 
<br/>development.

<div><span>1483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure Development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The availability of adequate and modern sports facilities is the foundation upon which all 
<br/>other  aspects  of  sports  development  rest.  Without  proper  infrastructure,  even  the  most 
<br/>talented athletes cannot reach their full potential. This policy prioritizes the construction 
<br/>and upgrading of sports facilities across the country, ensuring that both urban and rural 
<br/>areas are equipped with the necessary resources to support sports and physical activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Through this policy, the Government is committed to ensuring that these facilities are 
<br/>accessible,  safe  and  well-maintained.  This  includes  building  new  stadiums,  sports 
<br/>complexes  and  recreational  centres,  as  well  as  upgrading  existing  facilities  to  meet 
<br/>international standards. These investments will not only benefit our athletes but also 
<br/>provide communities with spaces where they can come together, be active and enjoy 
<br/>the benefits of physical activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Talent Identification and Development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, identifying and nurturing talent is crucial for the future of sports in Fiji. 
<br/>Our nation has a rich history of producing world-class athletes, and this policy aims to 
<br/>build on that legacy by creating pathways for our young athletes to excel. We will invest 
<br/>in talent identification programmes that reach out to schools and communities across 
<br/>the country, ensuring that no talent goes unnoticed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to identifying talents, this policy places a strong emphasis on development. 
<br/>We  will  provide  our  athletes  with  access  to  high  quality  training  facilities,  expert 
<br/>coaching  and  the  resources  they  need  to  compete  at  the  highest  levels  through  the 
<br/>establishment  of  the  Fiji  Institute  of  Sports.  This  includes  partnerships  with 
<br/>international  sports  organisations  which  will  allow  our  athletes  to  gain  exposure  to 
<br/>global standards and compete on the world stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusivity and Accessibility 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusivity and accessibility are at the heart of this policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The policy 
<br/>states that sports and physical activity should be accessible to all, regardless of physical 
<br/>ability,  gender  or  socio-economic  status.  This  policy  outlines  specific  strategies  to 
<br/>ensure that marginalised and under-represented groups are actively included in sports 
<br/></span><span>programmes.    For  example,  we  are  committed  to  adapting  facilities  for  people  with 
<br/></span><span>disabilities, ensuring that they can participate in sports without barriers. We will also 
<br/>promote women’s participation in sports, breaking down the stereotypes and cultural 
<br/>norms that have historically limited their involvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Integration of Sports and Education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the integration of sports and education is another key aspect of this policy. 
<br/>Schools play a crucial role in shaping the future of our nation and by embedding sports 
<br/></span><span>into  the  educational  curriculum,  we  are  not  only  fostering  physical  fitness  but  also 
<br/></span><span>teaching valuable lifeskills such as teamwork, discipline and resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The policy highlights the need to closely collaborate with the Ministry of Education to 
<br/>ensure that sports programmes and, in particular, physical education programmes are 
<br/>effectively  implemented  in  schools  across  the  country.  These  includes  providing 
<br/>schools with the necessary resources such as sports equipment and trained coaches to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliver quality physical education programmes. By doing so, we will create a generation 
<br/>of young Fijians who value physical activity and carry those habits into adulthood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Good Governance and Safeguarding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the policy ensures that sports organisations operate transparently, ethically 
<br/>and with accountability fostering trust and integrity at all levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  it  prioritizes  the  safety  of  all  participants  particularly  children  and  the 
<br/>vulnerable  group  by  implementing  robust  measures  to  prevent  abuse,  discrimination 
<br/>and exploitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Promotion of Physical Activity Across All Ages 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, promoting physical activity across all ages is essential for the long-term 
<br/>health  and  wellbeing  of  our  population.  This  policy  supports  community-based 
<br/>programmes that encourage lifelong participation in physical activity from youth sports 
<br/>leagues to senior fitness classes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The policy ensures to create a culture where physical activity is seen as a normal and 
<br/>enjoyable part of daily life. This includes initiatives to make our cities and towns more 
<br/>walkable,  creating  more  public  spaces  for  physical  activity  and  promoting  active 
<br/>transportation options like cycling and walking. By making it easier and more enjoyable 
<br/>for people to be active, the policy will help to reduce the barriers to physical activity 
<br/>and encourage more Fijians to lead active lifestyles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Strategic Implementation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the success of this policy lies in its strategic implementation. This will 
<br/>include the active involvement of all stakeholders, not only the sports community but 
<br/>also businesses, schools, healthcare providers, and community organisations. We have 
<br/>established a robust governance and organisational structure to oversee the execution 
<br/>of the policy. This includes the development of a Policy Action Plan that will guide the 
<br/>implementation of the policy and ensure that the policy’s objectives are met. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports,  Fiji  Sports  Council  and  the  Fiji  National  Sports 
<br/></span><span>Commission  as  statutory  organisations  mandated  for  sports  development  will  work 
<br/></span><span>closely  with  the  various  stakeholders  including  sports  federations,  educational 
<br/>institutions,  private  sector  partners,  civil  society  organisations  and  international 
<br/>partners. By fostering partnerships and encouraging collaboration, we will be able to 
<br/>leverage the strengths of each sector to achieve our common goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  policy  highlights  the  need  to  build  strong  partnerships  with  these  stakeholders, 
<br/>ensuring that everyone has a role to play in the implementation of the policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Timeline and Milestones 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this policy is designed with a clear timeline and milestone to ensure that 
<br/>progress is measurable and transparent. We have set specific targets for infrastructure 
<br/>development, participation rates and talent development over the next five years. For 
<br/>example, we aim to have new sports facilities built or upgraded in every major urban 
<br/>center and centralised rural areas within the next five years.  We also aim to increase 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1485 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the participation rate in sports and physical activity by 20 percent over the next three 
<br/>years with a particular focus on increasing participation among women, children and 
<br/>people with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)  Monitoring and Evaluation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure that the policy achieves its intended  goals, Mr. Speaker, we have put in 
<br/>place a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework. Performance metrics 
<br/>have  been  established  to  track  progress  in  key  areas  such  as  infrastructure 
<br/>development, participation rates and health outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regular evaluations will be conducted by the Multi-Sector Coordination Committee 
<br/>(monitoring  &amp;  evaluation  mechanism)  comprising  of  senior  officers  from  the  line 
<br/>ministries that will coordinate efforts across different sectors and findings will be used 
<br/>to  inform  policy  adjustments  and  improvements.  This  will  ensure  that  the  policy 
<br/>remains responsive to changing needs and challenges, and that we are always working 
<br/>towards our ultimate goal of promoting sports and physical activity for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)  Policy Principle 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accountability is a cornerstone of this policy. We are committed to transparency and 
<br/>will  ensure  that  all  stakeholders  are  held  accountable  for  their  roles  in  the 
<br/>implementation of the policy. These includes regular reporting to Parliament and the 
<br/>public on the progress of the policy and its impact on the nation.  We will also work 
<br/>to ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently, with a focus on achieving 
<br/>the  best  possible  outcomes  for  our  citizens.  By  maintaining  high  standards  of 
<br/>accountability, we can build trust and confidence in the policy, ensuring that it has the 
<br/>support it needs to succeed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the many individuals and 
<br/>organisations who have  contributed to  the development  of this policy. Special thanks goes to  the 
<br/>dedicated team at the Ministry of Youth and Sports who have worked tirelessly to bring this policy 
<br/>to  fruition,  including  the  support  from  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  and  the  Fiji  Sports 
<br/>Council.  Their  hard  work,  expertise  and  commitment  have  been  instrumental  in  shaping  this 
<br/>comprehensive and forward-thinking policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also extend my gratitude to the sports federations, educational institutions, private sector 
<br/></span><span>partners and civil society organisations that provided invaluable input and feedback during the policy 
<br/>review process. Their insights have ensured that this policy is grounded in the realities of our nation 
<br/>and reflective of the needs and aspirations of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the support of our international partners, who have 
<br/>shared their expertise and experience, helping us to learn from global best practices and adapt them 
<br/>to  our  unique  context.  Their  collaboration  has  been  vital  in  ensuring  that  this  policy  is  not  only 
<br/>ambitious but also achievable.  There is a call to action, as we move forward, Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
<br/></span><span>Fijians  to  embrace  this  policy  and  the  opportunities  it  presents.  This  is  not  just  a  Government 
<br/></span><span>initiative; it is a national movement that requires the participation and support of everyone; whether 
<br/>you are an athlete, a coach, a parent, a stakeholder or simply a sports enthusiast, your involvement is 
<br/>crucial to the success of this policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Sports, Recreation, and Physical Activity Policy 
<br/>is more than just a framework for sports development; it is a vision for a healthier, stronger and more

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>united Fiji. By investing in sports and physical activity, we are investing in the future of our nation. 
<br/>We are creating opportunities for our youth, promoting health and well-being, and building a legacy 
<br/>of excellence that will inspire generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I seek your indulgence and approval to submit a copy of the National Sports, 
<br/>Recreation and Physical Activity Policy for Parliamentary recording purposes and I also offer my 
<br/>best wishes to all stakeholders, all sport organisations, donors and resources providers in expediting 
<br/>the policy objectives. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you honorable Members for your attention 
<br/>and commitment to this important initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you for that Statement, honourable Minister, it is reassuring, since 
<br/>payment as promised by the honourable Prime Minister is still coming.  You have indicated that is 
<br/>not part of your budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, Sir.  We are planning for the national celebration in consultation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the Office of the Prime Minister, before we pay out the rewards for the boys. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You should have done that when you made that statement.   
<br/>I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise as the Opposition Shadow Minister for Youth  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Sports to respond to the honourable Minister’s Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  hope  you  would  not  mind,  it  is  five  minutes  only.    You  really  went 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overboard there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud that the honourable Minister’s comprehensive articulation on the 
<br/>ideology of boosting a career for youth in sports, and I applaud all the relevant stakeholders who 
<br/>have been part of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Sports Recreation and Physical Activity Policy was recently launched by the 
<br/>Ministry  and  the  Policy  has  been  in  a  long  time  of  the  making  and  the  years  of  dedication  and 
<br/></span><span>collective efforts since 2017 and has also been in line with the National Development Plan 2017-
<br/></span><span>2026, the Ministry of Youth  and Sports Strategic Plan 2018-2020 and the Fiji  Youth Declaration 
<br/>2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising  the  multi-sector  nature  of  youth  development  in  Fiji,  it  takes  the  whole  of 
<br/>Government approach, bringing together key Government Ministries, Departments and authorities 
<br/>to work in a coordinated way towards achieving strategic goals for Fiji’s youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementing this Policy will involve a diverse range of programmes in key areas such as 
<br/></span><span>health and wellbeing, education, skills and employment, safety, protection, environment and climate 
<br/></span><span>change,  participation  and  empowerment,  inclusion  and  non-discrimination,  and  strengthening  the 
<br/>enabling environment for youth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  developing  policies  and  programmes  and  in  allocating  the  necessary  resources,  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  needs  to  also  focus  on  relevant  key  strategic  areas  where  we  need 
<br/>efficient, effective, sustainable and socio-economic and cultural development for youth.  Also, in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1487 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas of strengthening to develop virtual delivery of education, practical skills, soft skills, education 
<br/>curriculum, and also to improve financial literacy and management in our schools and especially for 
<br/>our athletes. Also, to maintain and build more sporting facilities, as highlighted by the honourable 
<br/>Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must know that the Super Rugby match that was held in Fiji for the first 
<br/>time was between Crusaders and Chiefs on 1st July, 2016. Government needs to realise that hosting 
<br/>international rugby games has boosted economic activity and economic generations for our nation as 
<br/>a whole.  It has inspired the younger generation for a future in sports because our youth are dynamic, 
<br/>ambitious, innovative and talented, so as Government, we need to promote various sports in Fiji to 
<br/>unlock this potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  I  look  at  the  Paris  Olympics,  only  two  representatives  have 
<br/>represented Fiji in the swimming category.  Had Fiji had another Olympic standard swimming pool, 
<br/>we  would  have  encouraged  more  youth  to  have  a  career  in  sports  because,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we 
<br/>cannot  expect  our  youth  to  swim  or  practice  in  lakes,  rivers  and  in  the  ocean  and  dream  for  the 
<br/>Olympics.    That  is  why  I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  to  build  the  Lautoka  Swimming  Pool  to 
<br/>international career standard so that it is for our youth of the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to congratulate the Fiji Sevens Team for their achievement and the various other 
<br/>representatives of Fiji. I also would like to congratulate the Lautoka Team for winning the BOG since 
<br/>2016, although my father called me and said, “</span><span>Ba toh Ba hai</span><span>”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  needs  to  urgently  look  at  key  areas  of  school  violence 
<br/>where  it  can  be  tackled  by  students  being  exposed  to  sports,  rebellious  behaviours  of  students  in 
<br/>public  places,  especially  in  buses  where  you  see  buses  swinging  from  left  to  its  right  after  their 
<br/>celebrations as it is really dangerous for the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth also involved in abuse and hate on social media, and I feel like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sports is one of the key ways to get students from out of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth play integral role in the decision making and process and their 
<br/>potential for key agents of social change, innovation and future leadership, providing these facilities 
<br/>and education that increase participation through sports for our younger people, are key factors in 
<br/>achieving this global progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have expressed my concerns to the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports in Parliament, 
<br/></span><span>and I am hopeful that there is a multi-sectoral approach so that we are able to create a Fiji in which 
<br/>all  youth  are  healthy,  respected,  safe,  included  and  empowered  to  reach  their  full  potential  and 
<br/>meaningfully engage in and contribute to the civil, political, economic, social and cultural growth 
<br/>our beloved nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I call on the leader of the Group 9 Bloc or their designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Youth and Sports on the National Sports Recreation and Physical Activity Policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to earlier by the honourable Minister, this will enhance  sports 
<br/>and physical activity delivery at all levels of participation.  Not only that, Sir, sports play an important 
<br/>role in our national unity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Policy, if rightfully followed as well as executed, can very well provide 
<br/>the  pathway  for  every  minor  sporting  body  to  achieve  high  honours  in  competitions  around  the 
<br/>region, and even qualification for the Olympic Games of any international competition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that our nation’s passion for sports and support from Fijians 
<br/>and athletes have propelled Fiji onto the global sporting stage. I agree that the honourable Minister 
<br/>mentioned about the many challenges that are there to ensure that the Policy is formulated, is well 
<br/>followed and carried through by various sporting bodies in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  just  highlight three  key  challenges  that  can  further  consolidate  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthen the National Sports Policy, in my view: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Limited  resources  and  funding  -  the  lack  of  funding  for  smaller  and  minority  sporting 
<br/>bodies and also various clubs and sporting teams in our communities.  Also, as mentioned 
<br/>by the honourable Minister in his Statement, there has also been a challenge for the various 
<br/>minority sporting bodies to provide acquittals to the sporting organisations that is looking 
<br/>after the allocation of funds to the various sporting bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Lack of sporting facilities, which was also highlighted by the honourable Minister and I am 
<br/>thankful that he did mention that in the next five years, Government is looking forward to 
<br/>build more sporting facilities in every community and rural areas around Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Talent  Identification  and  Development  Programme:    This  is  very  important  and  also 
<br/>mentioned by the honourable Minister.  We need to ensure that every sporting body needs 
<br/>to have a Talent Identification and Development Programme, which will ensure that we 
<br/>have a pool of athletes whom we can groom and train to perform at a level that is required 
<br/>regionally and internationally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Minister for the National  Sports, Recreation and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Physical Activity Policy, and very much looking forward to the progress and its implementation. </span><span>

<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  </span><span>Na  Turaga  na  Tui  Cakau,  </span><span>the  honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; before 
<br/></span><span>I begin, I just thought that I also acknowledge the presence of the students from Corpus Christi, who 
<br/></span><span>are training to be teachers.  All I can say to them is, welcome to your Parliament.  Just remember that 
<br/>you have a profession that the whole of Fiji relies on.  You will be training the next few generations 
<br/>of people in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, on top of that, some of your very highly respected professionals have ended up in this 
<br/>House as Leaders of the Opposition, Cabinet Ministers, Deputy Prime Ministers, and who knows one 
<br/>day, even as Prime Minister.  So, welcome, and I hope you will find today instructive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  provide a Ministerial  Statement on the significant  strides that 
<br/></span><span>Government continues to make in terms of fostering a robust investment climate to drive impactful 
<br/>economic development and sustainable development growth.  I will be talking specifically about one 
<br/>particular initiative that we have developed and has been passed to Cabinet, called the Significant  
<br/>Investment Policy, which forms part of the discussion here today.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As one of the leading nations in the Pacific, the Fiji Government is actively working towards 
<br/>attracting investments that will bring economic benefits and promote sustainable development and 
<br/>inclusivity in our islands.  Our approach involves improving the investment climate, strengthening 
<br/>partnerships and pursuing opportunities aligned with our national development goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the last few years, some businesses have hesitated to invest and commit to Fiji.  This, 
<br/>perhaps,  stems  from  uncertainty,  Government  overreach  and  excessive  control,  mismanagement, 
<br/>perhaps, and unfriendly business environments.  Due to these factors, Sir, there have been challenges 
<br/>which we are trying to resolve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when we formed Government 19 months ago, we promised the people of Fiji 
<br/>that we would listen, and we are listening.  We also understand that the economy needs to promote 
<br/>economic growth and development, and we also that we need to make the environment in Fiji a lot 
<br/>more investor friendly and predictable. So, we remain committed, Mr. Speaker, in terms of ensuring 
<br/>that these objectives are met. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Cabinet, in its sitting on 7</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, approved the Significant Investment 
<br/>Policy framework for Fiji.  This Policy Framework will provide comprehensive guide for promoting 
<br/>and  managing  significant  investments  in  the  country.    With  the  focus  on  enhancing  economic 
<br/>development, sustainability, social impact, this framework will serve as a foundation for attracting 
<br/>investments across critical sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The policy framework, Mr. Speaker, defines clear objectives for significant investments to 
<br/>align with national priorities, create a conducive environment for attracting and retaining investors 
<br/>in Fiji, and ensure sustainable and socially responsible investments contribute to the country’s long-
<br/>term development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under this Policy Framework, Mr. Speaker, Government will provide support on a case-by-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>case basis to investment projects that meet specific criteria which include:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic impact and strategic importance which must align to the country’s priorities and 
<br/>contribute to growth and development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technological Advancement - Priority investments in new technologies, know-how, or 
<br/>expertise  that  can  benefit  local  industries,  contribute  to  Fiji's  skill  development,  or 
<br/>enhance our overall competitiveness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environmental  and  Social  Sustainability 
<br/>Investment  projects  prioritising 
<br/>environmental  sustainability,  social  responsibility,  and  community  wellbeing  will  be 
<br/>considered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Risk  Mitigation  -  Investment  mechanisms  to  mitigate  risks  and  ensure  long-term 
<br/>viability, promoting stability and growth in the local market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Minimum Investment Threshold – For these projects which are considered significant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investments will be around $200 million or above.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>▪</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local participation - such as partnerships with local businesses and employment of local 
<br/>talent  will  be  encouraged.  Local  expertise  in  the  architectural,  engineering  and 
<br/>construction sectors, while sourcing materials and employing local workers is also of 
<br/>keen interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  Policy  Framework,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  also  an  Investment  Facilitation 
<br/></span><span>Committee (IFC) which had been earlier created by this Government which is crucial in promoting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and facilitating investments in Fiji. Representatives from key Government Ministries and agencies 
<br/>are represented in this Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  has  the  overarching  mandate  to  identify  hindrances  to  investment,  and 
<br/>provide guidance, support and coordination throughout the investment process, instilling optimism 
<br/>about future investments in Fiji.  I was interested to note a positive comment from Mr. Brent Hill, 
<br/>the  Tourism  Fiji  CEO,  talking  about  a  more  friendly  business  experience  and  I  got  some 
<br/>congratulations, Mr. Speaker, on that remark.  But I told them it is early days, and it is still very much 
<br/>a work in progress, as I will explain in more detail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  this,  apart  from  the  Government  representatives  on  this  IFC,  there  are  also 
<br/>members from the private sector, who leverage their expertise and resources to assist in investment 
<br/>bottlenecks.  By  collaborating  with  other  agencies,  expediting  critical  approvals  and  removing 
<br/>bottlenecks, the IFC will continue to contribute to a more efficient and effective investment process, 
<br/>ultimately speeding up investment and driving growth in the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          The  recommendations  of  the  IFC  are  channeled  through  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  the 
<br/>Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, who also then tabled 
<br/>these significant investments on the Economic Strategic Committee (ESC). This is another creation 
<br/>of this Government in an endeavour to continue to support high level business activities.  Once the 
<br/>investment projects are overseen or considered at the ESC, then the Government moves forward in 
<br/>terms of assisting these significant projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I have just mentioned is something that has never been done in this 
<br/>country and I think it positions us well in terms of the way investment will go forward in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What does the Significant Framework mean for Fiji and interested investors?   Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, Government, of course, will provide the mechanisms on a case by case basis to look at, obviously, 
<br/>financial incentives, infrastructure development, and take away some of the mystery that normally 
<br/>happens when investors come to Fiji particularly when there are infrastructure requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Regulatory and logistical  support is  also  provided,  Mr. Speaker, and these are the support 
<br/>mechanisms that are being put in place to ensure that going forward, the investor climate continues 
<br/>to improve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is already one significant investment on the table, Mr. Speaker, which I will be tabling 
<br/></span><span>at the ESC very soon. It is the first of our hope for the many significant investments in the country. 
<br/></span><span>It is worth about $300 million and, potentially, it will create 500 jobs, and that is what we are trying 
<br/>to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I thought I would just touch on the other types of efforts that are going in by 
<br/>this Government in terms of trying to improve the investment climate in Fiji.  I would like to talk 
<br/>about the Ease of Doing Business or the reform of our processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now through the businessNOW FIJI initiative, which is a new initiative 
<br/></span><span>to digitise the whole of government business processes.  We are actually working at the moment on 
<br/></span><span>automating  the  first  or  hopefully  will  be  many  digital  processes  in  Fiji,  starting  with  starting  a 
<br/>business process and also obtaining a construction permit process. If we are able to complete those 
<br/>two processes, there is particular enthusiasm about the second opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which 
<br/>is obtaining a construction permit.  I truly believe that in Fiji, one of the major obstacles to doing  
<br/>investment in Fiji is how difficult it is to obtain a construction permit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, you have to comply with documents which are probably up to this level high, make three 
<br/>copies, give it to the Department of Town and Country Planning then it circulates around with all the 
<br/>agencies.  Documents go missing, people go missing, everything happens. What we endeavour to do 
<br/>with the new automation, Sir, hopefully by the end of next year, we will actually allow investors to 
<br/>load their documents once and it is processed right through seamlessly by each agency online.  If we 
<br/>are able to do that, we will make significant headway in terms of creating the Ease of Doing Business 
<br/>experience in our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just thought I would also just like to touch on some of the things that we have been able to 
<br/>achieve.  Through the honourable Prime Minister’s leadership, before environment used to be a major 
<br/>challenge in terms of approvals. It was the top most significant issue when it came to Ease of Doing 
<br/>Business.  Sir, that is no longer an issue.  Delays in approvals have come down to about 20 from what 
<br/>I hear, they are more proactive in terms of their execution.  That is credit to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and his leadership that we have brought that down in terms of addressing that particular 
<br/>issue. This is why we are listening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  immigration  is  a  challenge.  The  two  Deputy  Prime  Ministers 
<br/>have been working with the honourable Minister for Immigration at the moment and what we are 
<br/>trying to do, Sir, is bring about some transformative changes in the way we are doing processing in 
<br/>terms of work permits and the like.  I am hopeful that, that will come through very quickly, we are 
<br/>giving ourselves till the end of the year and I hope that by then the experience and the ease with 
<br/>which we are getting our work permits done will be a lot more seamless and a good experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this not because I am in  charge of investment, but I say this in all 
<br/>sincerity.  We  are sitting on the edge of a major  construction boom  in  this  country.  All  that my 
<br/>Ministry and the stakeholders has to do is to unlock that potential.  We have significant investment 
<br/>in  the  pipeline,  there  are  about  four  major  hotels  about  to  be  constructed,  we  are  now  seeing 
<br/>opportunities in the housing sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Unlock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are actively working with them to see what can be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, we are sitting at about a $6 billion pipeline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, things are looking up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, one of the things that we have endeavoured to do is genuinely broaden up 
<br/>the Fijian economy. In other words, try to re-engineer the economic architecture in Fiji.  When we 
<br/>say  that,  I  talk  about  what  Fiji  Water  is  now  doing  with  commercial  agriculture  in  Fiji.    I  can 
<br/>confidently say, I have got two other large investors who have met us that are saying that they will 
<br/>also do commercial agriculture in Fiji. If that happens, Sir, we will have an opportunity to genuinely 
<br/>broaden out the economy of Fiji, particularly in economic agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The hope is, Sir, that we will actually be able to reach down into the rural community and 
<br/></span><span>create supply chain and the change that comes through from our rural communities and create a stable 
<br/>income for all our people.  I have talked about  the Kava Bill,  I am  working  very busily  with  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture to bring forward the Kava Bill.  Like I have said on numerous 
<br/>times here, it is a billion-dollar industry for our country. I cannot understand why the Kava Bill was 
<br/>not passed by the previous government, but that is okay, we will do it.  By the end of this year, it will 
<br/>be done.

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of medicinal cannabis, I am happy to report that we are at the final 
<br/>stages  of  starting  the  legislative  process.    That,  Sir,  to  me  opens  up  another  opportunity  for  our 
<br/>country, not only in terms of the medicinal cannabis, but the research into the nutraceutical industry.  
<br/>That has a big potential for Fiji.   Just imagine, Sir, if we can commercialise things like some of our 
<br/>natural medicines and share it on the national stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Deliver.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Deliver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are saying deliver, I am doing this in 
<br/>18 months, they have done nothing about this in 16 years.  I think in terms of the timeline, there is a 
<br/>bit of a disparity when it comes to timeline and execution.  Let us not forget Google and also Starlink 
<br/>that is now here, and these are the types of things that create an environment that I believe suits Fiji 
<br/>well in the months and years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these initiatives are not just about creating economic growth in the country, 
<br/>it is also part of ensuring that development in this country going forward is sustainable, inclusive and 
<br/>beneficial  to  all  Fijians.    We  are  on  a  promising  path,  and  with  continued  collaboration  and 
<br/>commitment,  we  will  ensure  that  Fiji  attracts  significant  investments  and  secures  a  position  as  a 
<br/>leading economy in the Pacific.  Let us all work together towards a Fiji that is prosperous, has a stable 
<br/>future and of course, a sustainable future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I only have five minutes, let me just quickly refer him 
<br/>to a World Bank Report on investment in Fiji.  Just a line that comes out of it, this is something that 
<br/>is extremely important to create that particular investor climate and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Risks  to  the  outlook  including  persistent  out  migration  and  skilled  labour 
<br/>shortages,  global  commodity  price  shocks,  and  natural  disasters.    Structural  reforms, 
<br/>economic  diversification  and  fiscal  consolidation  are  essential  for  building  resilience, 
<br/>enhancing growth, and reducing poverty.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope he takes heed of what is being said there.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, what can we deliver to the 
<br/>investor?  We have to have a ready-workforce but we are facing problems because of migration.  I 
<br/>understand the  work that has gone on  with  respect  to  the digital  infrastructure that is  going  on,  I 
<br/></span><span>commend him to ensuring that that has actually completed.  These are some of the basic incentives 
<br/></span><span>that are needed to create a conducive environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The creation of that investment climate, the one that is friendly and the one that is swift, is 
<br/>extremely important for Fiji.  We all know that, Sir, we all want it to succeed.  Incentivisation is not 
<br/>quite there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to bringing in more FTIs, especially for those industries 
<br/>that we are actually targeting.  Training of our local workforce has to be relooked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly, in the current state that we are in, one of the most important things that are 
<br/></span><span>actually being looked at is the volatility.  There is a way that it is measured, volatility is actually 
<br/></span><span>measured.  We have to look at how volatile we are.  That volatility can be negatived or neutralised if 
<br/>we have something that we can say to the investor that says with confidence that there is one thing 
<br/>that you can rely on and be safe and that is the necessary legal framework that will protect them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our legal system also must be brought up the speed so that investors look at 
<br/>Fiji and not worry about it at all. At the moment, there are deficiencies, et cetera that need to looked 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1493 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at importantly and these are the things that create a better investment climate, these are the things 
<br/>that larger companies from overseas look at. They will hold-off on the investment if they see anything 
<br/>dubious that is happening within those particular circles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important things that are actually looked at by any company that is going to 
<br/>come here is risk tolerance. They will look at that before they invest, they will look at that before 
<br/>they start any kind of investment. They also look at what kind of returns there are in terms of whatever 
<br/>objective  to  take,  they  also  look  at  the  kind  of  treatment  that  they  are  going  to  get,  the  kind  of 
<br/>protection  they  get  and  I  understand  where  the  honourable  Minister  is  coming  from;  all  of  these 
<br/>things are important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not something that is born today, it was born many years ago, so it is advise that has been 
<br/>given to us by IFC, World Bank, et cetera. It is not just this Government that has to deal with it, we 
<br/>have also had to do deal with it, but gradually it has been done and I must say, Sir, I am glad that the 
<br/>honourable Minister is taking heed of all of these and he will ensure that these particular things are 
<br/>actually dealt with properly in order for us to do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of business facilitation, the digital Government solutions I know he is looking at, 
<br/>that is also very important, but we must remember that we cannot look at digital solutions with respect 
<br/>to Government from a top-down approach, it must be looked at from the bottom-up approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a particular line that I want to quote, Sir, and it comes from the UN 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade and Development Secretary-General, her name is Rebeca Grynspan and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Investment  is  just  not  just  about  capital  in-flows;  it  is  about  human  potential 
<br/>(which  we  must  look  at),  environmental  stewardship  (which  he  actually  just  spoke 
<br/>about,  it  is  actually  very  important)  and  the  enduring  spirit  of  a  more  equitable  and 
<br/>sustainable world.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not just very hollow words, that is very important to Fiji.  We have 
<br/>actually ticked the boxes of quite are few of those things.  I know the honourable Minister understands 
<br/>exactly what I am saying with respect to the ones that we have not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Bank recently has supported us with a new package, we have got 
<br/>about US$95 million worth of support that is coming towards our budgetary support. What is more 
<br/>important, Sir, is we must also look at how much of that budget support goes towards creating this 
<br/></span><span>better investment climate.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish him well, it is for Fiji that it has to be done but there are so many other 
<br/>important things and that is just a brief from our side to say that please look at those things when we 
<br/>are actually doing them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to the Leader of the Group of 9 bloc or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Trade, I know it is not easy to respond given the two former Ministers for Trade, one 
<br/></span><span>has just given his response and also the current Minister for Trade, but I will try my best. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- I am not saying that I am going to be the future Minister for Trade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but again Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Trade ….

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is to do with trade, honourable Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Okay! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is to do with trade, you cannot be a win-win situation all the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  It cannot be a win-win situation! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The big terms that have been used by the honourable Ministers, but I will try to get it down 
<br/>to  our  understanding  to  those  who  will  be  listening  on  television.  I  thank  the  current  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Trade and the Coalition Government for putting in place these investment facilities and 
<br/>committee. It is very important, given that it creates ease of doing business and also the processes 
<br/>that were there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even the previous administration had also brought in the National Single Window System 
<br/>(NSWS), I think it is still available.  It gives that opportunity for those investors.  Most of the investors 
<br/>when they come to Fiji, they are somewhat turned back, given the red tapes that we have, but this 
<br/>particular committee will try to remove that and give confidence to potential investors that are coming 
<br/>in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole idea, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a way of how we can promote a positive image of Fiji 
<br/>as a profitable investment destination. At the same time also, the systems and processes in Fiji to be 
<br/>more efficient to those investors.  Those are the two big links that Fiji needs in its investment policies 
<br/>that needs to be in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank Cabinet too for passing this significant Investment Policy framework 
<br/>given that it provides the guidelines for our local interest and what our interest will be in terms of 
<br/>sustainable  development,  friendly  businesses  and  attracting  those  and  providing  for  those 
<br/>investments in creating employment for our local people and the knowledge that they will gain from 
<br/>those who will be coming from overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday I responded to the honourable Minister for Education in terms of TSLS. There is 
<br/>also a provision of the new scholarship on micro grant.  That particular policy is for areas where we 
<br/></span><span>have a shortage of labour and skills, that particular facility will also encourage competency-based 
<br/></span><span>training for our locals so that when these particular investments come in, they are able to fit in and 
<br/>are qualified for those particular jobs. Much has been said in terms of losing our brain-drain overseas, 
<br/>as alluded to by the honourable Koya, but again the Government can take on board something to this 
<br/>effect.  It could put in a policy called the “brain drain gain” where we can bring back those in our 
<br/>diaspora overseas, attract them back to Fiji to further invest and provide back to their communities 
<br/>in various ways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We totally support the Government’s policy and the framework that has been announced by 
<br/></span><span>the  honourable  Minister  for  Trade  and  Investment  this  morning.  We  look  forward  to  more 
<br/></span><span>investments coming to our country, creating more employment and also more developments in the 
<br/>various communities where natural resources and the various resources can be developed especially 
<br/>in areas where we can connect roads and other accessibilities so that the people can participate in the 
<br/>bigger economic spin and economic growth.

<div><span>Update on Ministry’s Key Capital Programmes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers  and  honourable    Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; I rise today to provide an update to this august Parliament on the work of the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management in serving the citizens of our rural and 
<br/>remote areas across our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, the Ministry’s capital development project budget 
<br/>was increased to include the Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Development Programme and the Rural 
<br/>Housing Assistance Programme.  These were for $2.5 million and $3 million respectively.  Also, 
<br/>there was a budget of $0.5 million for the Seafaring Entrepreneurial Assistance (SEA) Subsidy. The 
<br/>existing programmes of addressing access to clean water and sanitation, new pilot roads, footbridges 
<br/>and footpaths, and economic empowerment for our rural people were maintained.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Development Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  invest  in  infrastructure,  it  helps  connect  people  with 
<br/>opportunities, promotes economic growth, and improves livelihoods.  Through the allocation of a 
<br/>$2.5million funding  for  the  ROI  Programme  in  the  2023-2024  Budget,  the Ministry  was  able  to 
<br/>implement  a  total  of  50  projects  across the  country,  focussing  on  three  main  sectors  including 
<br/>agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Access to basic infrastructure is key to develop these sectors for farmers, markets, women, 
<br/>children, the senior citizens and those with special needs. The two focussed areas of support that 
<br/>were provided for the agriculture sector in the last financial year, include assistance intended for 
<br/>livestock  farmers  and  the construction  of  rural  farm  access  roads.  The  forestry  sector  is  also 
<br/>supported under the Programme to strengthen the manufacturing of logs and mahogany waste, to 
<br/>enhance the key roles of wood carvers, and those operating in processing timber to make household 
<br/>furniture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  update  this  august  House  on  how  the  Ministry's  ROI 
<br/>Programme has  had  an enormous impact  and has also  helped to  transform  the lives of our rural 
<br/>communities across Fiji for the better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Northern  Division,  75.5  kilometres  of  rural  farm  access  roads  were  constructed, 
<br/>connecting  the  interior  of  Macuata  and  Cakaudrove  Provinces.  The  road  construction,  as  I  had 
<br/>mentioned during my reply to the honourable Minister of Finance’s Budget Address, cuts across 
<br/>three major different routes – the Kedra-Sese Road, the Nasasa to Valevoni Road, and a connecting 
<br/>road to  Nubusoqosoqo.  Communities in these regions used to  walk  more than 10 kilometres to 
<br/>reach the main road for transportation. More than 77,000 people reside in these two rural Provinces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Western  Division,  16.9  kilometres  of  rural  farm  access  roads  were  constructed, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covering the highlands of Ba in Nadala, Ratalevu, Nadrau, Natawa, Navunitawa and Nasaucoko.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main rural farm access roads constructed in the Central Division were at Mau, Nakavika 
<br/>and Vunidavo in the Province of Namosi. For thousands and thousands of our rural Fijians, these 
<br/>investments are not just farm access roads, but a new lifeline, and a path to a better future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Eastern Division, the construction of Rural Farm Access Roads focussed on the island

<div><span>in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>a key component of the ROI Programme is to promote and support value 
<br/>addition  activities  in  the  rural sector.  This  includes  the  provision  of  support  for  the processing  of 
<br/>turmeric and ginger powder, cassava and dalo chips, and kava pounding machines in potential areas 
<br/>that have been identified. The procurement of 12 sets of food processing units is the initial step to 
<br/>provide equipment and resources to support value adding economic activities in the rural and outer 
<br/>islands.  We do this in cooperation with other Ministries and other agencies, such as the Department 
<br/>of Co-operatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>to support the forestry component of the ROI Programme, four portable 
<br/>sawmills  were  procured  through  the  approval  of  the  Government  Tender  Board.  Under  the 
<br/>Programme, the portable sawmill will support resource owners to log and process their own timber 
<br/>for rural housing and other value adding processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provision of these equipment is expected to assist the Ministry of Forestry’s logging and 
<br/>milling programmes in rural areas. The portable sawmills will also support the supply of materials 
<br/>and household furniture demanded by the growing rural households across the four Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has noted an increasing demand for wood processing machines for value adding 
<br/>activities,  particularly  from  the  islands  of Kabara,  Ogea  and  Namuka  in  the  Lau  Group.  These 
<br/>maritime islands  are  renowned  for  their  supply  of  wood-made  souvenirs to  most  souvenir  retail 
<br/>outlets in Fiji, and this has been considered in this new financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue to improve our ROI Programme, a new component of the 
<br/>Programme will be introduced in this new financial year. This new initiative includes the incubation 
<br/>of our ROI farmers and recipients for the next three to five years. This is crucial to ensure that the 
<br/>Government's rate of return on investments from these Farm Access Roads and the provision of value 
<br/>adding machineries are realised in the next three to five years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,</span><span> </span><span>this  incubation  programme  will  include  the  close  monitoring  of  their 
<br/>production plan for the next three to five years, facilitation of market access, training and awareness, 
<br/>especially  on  good  governance,  financial  literacy, leadership,  time  management  and  changing 
<br/>mindset towards self-sufficiency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  order  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  ROI Programme  in  the  future,  a 
<br/></span><span>baseline survey will be conducted</span><span> </span><span>in all our communities assisted under the Programme, to ensure 
<br/>that the programme objectives are realised as planned, particularly in the programme contribution 
<br/>towards addressing rural poverty, improve living standard and reducing rural-urban drift.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  given  the  ROI  Programme's  shift  towards  result-based  development 
<br/>approach, some of our key development  partners are now onboard to  support the Ministry in this 
<br/>Programme and this is encouraging to note.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Housing Assistance  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>the Rural Housing Assistance (RHA) Programme was re-introduced in the 
<br/>Ministry last year through the Coalition Government. The Ministry worked hard to get the necessary 
<br/>resources to deliver the expectations of the Government for our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the Ministry is working on completing the recruitment of all

<div><span>personnel, we are pleased to note that the Programme has been able to assist our rural families have 
<br/>access to affordable and safe shelter, whether in the form of full house construction, house completion 
<br/>or retrofitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>in the last 12 months, over 160 applicants have been assisted. These were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Central Division  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29 full houses constructed, four houses completed and four retrofitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Eastern Division</span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25 full houses constructed, additional five houses completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23 full houses constructed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Western Division</span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12  full  houses  constructed,  12  applied  for  house  completion  and  54  applied  for 
<br/>retrofitting, which were also completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir</span><span>,  </span><span>last  month,  I  had  the  opportunity  to witness  the  commissioning  of  four 
<br/>newly constructed houses in the village of Nadoria in Rewa by the honourable Prime Minister, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for  Public Works and  the honourable Assistant  Minister for iTaukei  Affairs.  
<br/>Those were houses that were initially destroyed in a massive fire in July 2023. It was immensely 
<br/>satisfying to personally witness the joy on the faces of the household members as they took ownership 
<br/>of their new dwellings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we continue to improve our Rural Housing Assistance Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 
<br/>also important to note that the Ministry recently completed a site visit to New Zealand to physically 
<br/>inspect  some  of  the  new  models  of  designing  rural  housing  that  will  not  only  improve  our  rural 
<br/>housing  resiliency  with  regards  to  cyclone  certification  due  to  the  quality  of  materials  and 
<br/>construction  techniques,  but  also  address  fire  risks  and  the  impact  of  termite  infestation  in  the 
<br/>country. The Ministry is also working closely with the Ministry of Housing and our development 
<br/>partners in improving our rural housing design. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also finalising a Memorandum of Association (MOA) with 
<br/>the  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund  (FNPF)  and  SOLE  FINTECH  in  terms  of  supporting  our  rural 
<br/>dwellers to save and meet their one-third contribution for housing assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are dedicated to ensuring that our people have access to resilient homes and feel safe in 
<br/></span><span>their environment.  We are working on achieving targets associated with Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goal (SDG) 11 – access to sustainable communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High Risk Water and Sanitation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in aligning to our global commitment to SDG6 on achieving clean water 
<br/>and sanitation, the Ministry remains dedicated to addressing high-risk water and related infrastructure 
<br/>needs.    We  are  grateful  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  allocating  $1  million,  an  increase  of  $0.2 
<br/></span><span>million from the last financial year, to continue this initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  the  inception  of  the  programme  in  the  2021-2022  financial  year,  the  Ministry  has 
<br/>implemented more that 70 projects across our rural and maritime communities, totalling $1.3 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had been installing Ecological Purification System recently in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>various communities across the country, as follows:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to assist in the reduction of occurrence of diseases and access to 
<br/>better hygienic living conditions, the Ministry provided communities with better sanitation facilities 
<br/>in the following areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Central Division: 1 village and 2 settlements; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment in Rural Infrastructure  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Government, we are responsible to make sure that our people are 
<br/></span><span>provided with  good roads  and necessary infrastructure, which will allow them access  to  so many 
<br/></span><span>other services to the world out there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  budgetary  allocation  of  $2  million,  the  Ministry  utilises  this  for  our  CARFF 
<br/>Programme in terms of construction of new pilot access roads and construction of footbridges and 
<br/>footpaths where these are necessary to provide safe access to our rural people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the recent financial year alone, the Ministry was able to complete a total 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of over 50 projects, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>Searing Entrepreneurial Assistance (SEA) Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  financial  year  2023-2024  was  the  first  year  that  the  Ministry  was 
<br/>allocated a budget for this Programme. With $0.5 million allocated, the Ministry was able to assist 
<br/>39 applicants across the four Divisions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>Empowering Rural Communities  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  Self-Help  Programme  is  one  that  assist  individuals  or 
<br/>communities  through  partnership  arrangement  of  Government,  providing  subsidy  in  the  form  of 
<br/>paying two-thirds of the project costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our first year in office, the Ministry has been able to assist over 50 communities across the 
<br/>country.  The assistance was in the form of water projects, resource centres and income generating 
<br/>projects, such as bread ovens, bread mixing equipment, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  projects  achieve  several  multiple  objectives  under  the  SDGs,  namely,  reduction  in 
<br/></span><span>poverty, food security, access to clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and decent 
<br/>work and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last 12 months, the Ministry was able to subsidise the following number of  projects 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>across the country:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resilient rural communities for an integrated manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Sir, unfortunately,  honourable Vijay Nath is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sick and I will respond to the Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  clearly  highlighting  the  achievements  of  the 
<br/>Ministry.  Most of these programmes are not new - the six capital projects, and I just wish to thank 
<br/>the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will respond in the same sequence that the honourable Minister delivered his Statement.  
<br/>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Programme, we are thankful that now, the 
<br/>Ministry has other options, particularly in addressing the needs out there in the rural communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I have been listening to few of his previous statements and one of the concerns that I had was 
<br/>the focus on infrastructure, but of course infrastructure is needed as well because initially when ROI 
<br/>was with the Ministry of Agriculture, it was focussing on food security for our people in the rural 
<br/>islands and then, hopefully, graduating them into market-oriented farmers and fishermen, and then 
<br/>looking at other programmes in the other Ministries to pick up from the ROI Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I am thankful for the various programmes and particularly, the inclusion of fisheries and 
<br/>forestry,  because  when  ROI  was  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  perhaps,  it  was  more  on  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture.  The honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and 
<br/>the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture would know this very well.  We are thankful that 
<br/>now you are able to buy circular source, and of course, the value addition as well.  So, that is very, 
<br/>very good to hear, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On rural housing, I wish to thank the Government for the increased allocation in rural housing. 
<br/>This is something that we have been raising as a Ministry previously because this is good for our 
<br/>resilience programme, particularly when we want to get our people out of the poverty cycle post-
<br/>disasters.    So,  it  is  very,  very  important  that  this  increased  allocation  is  provided  to  the  Ministry 
<br/>because it will help us in the long term, due to lessons learnt from </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, </span><span>TC Harold</span><span> and </span><span>TC 
<br/>Yasa</span><span> as well.  Some of our people in the rural areas just simply leave.  The internal displacement was 
<br/>simply because years of hard work and investing in their homes was just lost within 24 hours or so, 
<br/></span><span>and that contributed to the shift.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  high-risk  water  and  sanitation,  I  just  wish  to  perhaps  remind  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  that  this  programme  he  will  need  to  work  very  closely  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Health  because  this  is  particularly  on  the  high-risk  areas  where  there  is  typhoid  and  other  water-
<br/>related diseases. We have hotspots identified by the Ministry of Health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Self-Help, perhaps the only comment, honourable Minister, Sir, looking at both budgets, 
<br/>I think I had raised this.  Previously, because Multi-Ethnic is back now, the same allocation is also 
<br/></span><span>provided  with  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs.    So,  hopefully  in  the  next  budget,  we  will  also  have  that 
<br/></span><span>allocation of $1 million or whatever the amount is available with the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs 
<br/>as well because of the diverse needs out there in the communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the other two programmes – Seafaring and CARFF as well as Self-Help, 
<br/>these are important, but I think going back to my address in the Budget response, we need to focus 
<br/>now on the outcomes.  It is good that we are spending the money.  Honourable Minister, you had

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stated so many times in your previous addresses about taking out people away from the culture of 
<br/>dependence  so  that  they  can  be  sufficient  and  be  able  to  sustain  themselves.    This  is  why  the 
<br/>monitoring is so important, so that we can be more focused on the outcomes rather than the outputs 
<br/>which we are delivering, and you have correctly stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I think that is very, very 
<br/>important for us in terms of the way forward, and documents such as the Household  Income and 
<br/>Expenditure Survey Report and also previous Poverty Reports will help the Ministry in concentrating 
<br/>in the critical areas and in the geographical regions as well, so that we can be more surgical in the 
<br/>way we do rural development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I now call on the Leader of the Group of 9 bloc or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement 
<br/>by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development  and Disaster Management.  Firstly, 
<br/>Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the update and the insightful statement.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu 
<br/>Turaga Minisita.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need to improve the quality of life for the rural population cannot be 
<br/>overstated.  The $9.8 million used on the project as mentioned by the honourable Minister on the six 
<br/>capital  programmes  is  more  than  a  figure.    I  look  at  it  as  a  commitment  towards  equitable 
<br/>development and equitable access to opportunities to all Fijians, a point that was highlighted by His 
<br/>Excellency the President in the Opening of Parliament this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, the programme impacted the lives 
<br/>of around 390,000 people; that is inclusive development. I want to sincerely thank the Government 
<br/>for serving our rural and maritime communities diligently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging to see that the Government continues to place emphasis 
<br/>on rural  housing programme with  a new phase, community access  roads and the water sanitation 
<br/>programme.  I know these are the touching areas with our rural people, and I call on the honourable 
<br/>Minister to ensure all rural communities are assisted.  Perhaps at this point, I appeal to the honourable 
<br/>Minister  to  visit  some  villages  and  settlements  such  as  Valewaqa,  Tacilevu,  Cakaudrove, 
<br/>Nautoloulou,  Wainunu,  Bua,  Nukubolu  and  Naikawaga,  Koroalau,  Cakaudrove,  the  villages  in 
<br/>Matuku in Lau and the Uluisavudua community in Sawani, Naitasiri.  There are some issues and 
<br/>concerns on their drinking water and access roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  again,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  Ministerial 
<br/></span><span>Statement  and  I  do  wish  him  well  and  his  entire  team  in  the  execution  of  the  programmes  and 
<br/></span><span>upcoming projects planned in the 2024-2025 Financial Year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 40 on Ministerial Statements where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A Minister who wishes to make a statement on a public matter of national importance …” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this particular Ministerial Statement, Sir, I do not think this is really a matter of national 
<br/>importance  right  now,  but  I  think  the  statement  being  made  is  to  avoid  being  asked  the  question 
<br/>which is Question No. 126/2024.  I think a lot of statements that have been taking place so far are the

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1503 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issues that are urgent, national importance.  This particular topic, Sir, I would suggest, is not of that 
<br/>nature. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMNET MEMBERS.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  And  also  at  the  same  time,  honourable  Usamate,  like  previously  done.  
<br/>When a Statement is made, the questions that we have usually takes care of it.  So the question is not 
<br/>raised.  It will be a similar one too on this particular case.  After she makes her Statement, that takes 
<br/>care of the question that has been proposed here.  We used to do that in the past and I hope we will 
<br/>continue doing that; whether it is a matter of national importance, these are the rights of the Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For sure all that they are trying to raise in their Ministerial Statements are of importance to 
<br/>them in their role and to the people that they look after.  I hope we can just continue and let us hear 
<br/>her  out,  but  at  the  same  time,  as  you  have  alluded  to,  that  will  take  care  of  Oral  Question  No. 
<br/>126/2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fish Cage Culture System 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the honourable Member 
<br/>that this issue or this subject is also important not only for the Ministry, but for the nation as a whole.  
<br/>I know it has been talked about since the Budget Debate, so I am just here to clarify some of the 
<br/>issues and views that the honourable Members on the other side have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and 
<br/>gentlemen, </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka</span><span>.  This afternoon I am pleased to deliver a Statement on the Fish Cage 
<br/>Culture System that are currently being practiced around the world and the challenges we face in the 
<br/>development of this concept in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fish  Cage Culture of  farming involves  culturing fish in  a captive  environment where  free 
<br/>exchange of water can take place. The cage has five sides, the bottom, and the four vertical sides are 
<br/>enclosed with nets.  These nets are suspended in the water column with a flotation system around the 
<br/>perimeter.  Pen Culture is similar to cage culture but with an open bottom allowing direct contact 
<br/>with  the  water  body.    We  are  more  familiar  with  pond  culture  which  involves  rearing  fish  in  an 
<br/>artificially  constructed  pond,  where  water  is  maintained  in  an  enclosed  area  mainly  on  land  and 
<br/>coastal areas and this is currently being practised in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these fish culture structures are globally used including the Pacific Island 
<br/>countries that have ventured into finfish aquaculture and mariculture. As global fishery resources are 
<br/>harvested  at  an  accelerating  rate  due  to  technological  advancement  in  harvesting  gear,  culture 
<br/>systems have been proposed as innovative solutions to counter over-fishing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing  pressure  on  marine  finfish  resources  driven  by  global  and  domestic  demand 
<br/>encourages  many  Pacific  Island  countries  to  venture  into  aquaculture  of  several  candidate  fish 
<br/>species. The following candidate fish species have been trialled and cultured on a low scale in some 
<br/></span><span>Pacific Island countries including Fiji: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Milk  fish  or  </span><span>Yawa</span><span>  –  In  Kiribati,  a  hatchery  was  constructed  and  sea  cage  trials  were 
<br/>constructed  in  support  from  Taiwan  and  now  China.  The  Government  of  Tuvalu  also 
<br/>conducted fry collection and sea cage trials with support from the United Nations Food and 
<br/>Agriculture  Organization.  The  Government  of  Nauru  conducted  fry  collection  and 
<br/>recirculating aquaculture system on land culture with the European Union (EU) support.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was also part of this development, conducting fry collection and pond culture in Vitawa, 
<br/>Ra which was destroyed by </span><span>Tropical Cyclone Winston</span><span> in 2016. Currently, the Ministry of 
<br/>Fisheries is conducting pond culture of milk fish at Caboni Research Station in Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Rabbit fish or </span><span>Nuqa</span><span> – The government of New Caledonia constructed a hatchery and sea 
<br/>cage  culture  processing  and  marketing.  The  government  of  Solomon  Islands  initially 
<br/>trialled fry collection and cage culture. The Ministry of Fisheries is currently undertaking 
<br/>pond culture and broodstock management for natural spawning in a hatchery at Caboni in 
<br/>Ra. This was also trialled in fry collection and pond culture in Raviravi, Ba in the 1970s.  
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  other  species  currently  trialled  by  our  Pacific  Island  partners  include 
<br/>Pacific threat fish, red emperor and yellow kingfish.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fish Cage Culture Research Project previously known as the Makogai 
<br/>Development Project was budgeted for in the 2021-2022 fiscal year. It focuses on diversifying from 
<br/>giant clam culture to culturing candidate fish species such as king fish, coral trout, grouper and rabbit 
<br/>fish in collaboration with local and overseas partners and institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, discussions with the South Pacific community were conducted to undertake 
<br/>a preliminary assessment of the economic feasibility of marine fish farming in Fiji and to identify 
<br/>candidate species for culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sea and lagoon areas along Makogai Island provide an important and 
<br/>suitable site for fish cage culture.  However, the main drawback is the lack of proper modern hatchery 
<br/>and laboratory facilities to undertake finfish culture on the island, along with the need for reliable 
<br/>power supply to operate the hatchery and aquaculture work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020 a request was made to the government of Koren through the Korean 
<br/>Embassy  for  the  development  of  Makogai  Island  Research  Station.  Discussions  are  currently 
<br/>underway and the Ministry will report back to this august House on the implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s aquaculture sector has the potential and demand to grow further due 
<br/>to the rise in global demand for seafood and the over expectation of coastal fisheries resources. The 
<br/>main challenge for marine fish farming in Fiji is the unavailability of the high cost of feed. This is 
<br/>the most significant economic and logistical challenge to be managed for marine fish farming in Fiji. 
<br/>There is a need for more research on feed quality and the development of low cost feed with high 
<br/>nutritional value.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Sea  Cage  Culture  Project  for  milk  fish  were  trialled  in  Tuvalu  with  the 
<br/>support from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In one production cycle, which 
<br/>is  about  160  days,  they  were  able  to  produce  3.2  tonnes  of  fish  with  a  total  operating  cost  of 
<br/>US$72,168. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  other  adverse  factors  contributing  to  the  difficulty  of  establishing  cage 
<br/>culture  in  Fiji  include  the  threat  of  diseases  that  vary  among  candidate  fish  species.  Fiji’s 
<br/>geographical  position  being  cyclone  prone  also  hinders  the  progress  in  this  aspect  of  fisheries 
<br/></span><span>development due to frequent adverse weather conditions and natural disasters that may destroy the 
<br/></span><span>significant  investments  in  marine  fish  cage  culture.    Mr.  Speaker,  despite  these  challenges,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries is optimistic about the future of cage culture in Fiji.  Fiji has potential sites for 
<br/>Fin Fish Sea Cage Culture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it should be noted that fish cage culture in  Fiji  has several  vital  aspects  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs to be addressed.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  additional  budgetary  allocation  of  $400,000  for  the  Fiji  Cage  Culture 
<br/>Research Project is for the establishment of a solar farm at Makogai Research Station. This project 
<br/>will provide consistent power supply for the water pumps and aerators needed for the proposed cage 
<br/>culture species. Makogai Research Station is situated in the bay of the mainland therefore simplifying 
<br/>the monitoring of assets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of work to be done but the Ministry is determined to deliver what 
<br/>is  expected.  It  will  ensure  the  proper  fundamentals  are  set  to  support  these  projects,  ensuring  its 
<br/>longevity and effectiveness in relieving pressure on our depleted fish stocks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  her 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>address on cage farming and how the Ministry is addressing this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, cage farming is something that has been talked about and there has been a lot 
<br/>of discussion over the years. I think the advantages of cage farming are obvious but she has articulated 
<br/>very well the various challenges that are faced in terms of cage farming; the issues of hatcheries, 
<br/>diseases, proclivity of cyclones that we have in our part of the world and the danger that this has on 
<br/>the cages and the people that have to manage it and  also the lack of skills available to be able to 
<br/>manage this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister has pointed out, this has been going on at Makogai for clams but 
<br/>now they are going into fish and I am glad to hear some of the successes that have happened in the 
<br/>past. The </span><span>Yawa </span><span>fish in Vitawa which has cultivated in ponds and also the </span><span>Nuqa</span><span> in Caboni. So, there 
<br/></span><span>has been some success. I think the big challenge for us in terms of fisheries and a lot of these things, 
<br/></span><span>is the ability to take it from research and to make it actually exist where it needs to be done. We are 
<br/>talking about fish, you are talking about anything else.  A lot of time is spent in research but you are 
<br/>not able to get to that particular stage to move from the research phase into the extension phase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She has articulated a lot of the challenges. It has been ongoing for a long time.  I know that 
<br/>we have in the past here in Fiji, there has been a lot of talks about cage fishing in various place. They 
<br/>always talk about it, for instance, in that pond that you have up in Deuba, the reservoir that you have, 
<br/>there was talk about doing it there in terms of cage fishing and ponds.  There has been talk about 
<br/></span><span>doing it in places like Monasavu. They can put the cages in on other places of that sort. There is 
<br/></span><span>another place that I had here. I cannot remember what the third one was. Also, in Dreketi where we 
<br/>do the rice farming. You have the lake the possibility of doing that in that particular area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the other advantage of doing cage farming, if you are able to get 
<br/>there is that in some other parts of the world where they have this cage farming of fish, it also has 
<br/>infection to other areas. When you have the fish in the cage farming when they spawn and the eggs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>go out, the fish itself is captured and harvested but the offspring can spread the thousands of eggs, it 
<br/>can be used, it can cover that whole area.  So, that also gives fish supply to people who live in that 
<br/>particular vicinity of the area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In other part of the world where you cage farming of fish, it is also an opportunity for tourism.  
<br/>Tourists can come to pay to come and feed the fish or watch the fish where it is in the water, so, there 
<br/>is a whole lot of things that is here.  I know that the Ministry has a lot of challenges in retaining its 
<br/>staff.  But one of the things that I always mention is the importance of execution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Deputy Prime Minister was taking about all his plans, I was saying they are very 
<br/>good plans but the important thing for us is it to execute - not to execute to chop the head, to execute 
<br/>the implementation to be able to deliver things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, when the President of India was here, there was a lot of things 
<br/>that was not executed well by that Ministry. There was no invitation for the Leader of Opposition.  
<br/>When she sat down for the kava ceremony, they did not give one </span><span>Vadawa </span><span>for her.  They did not have 
<br/>a Vada -very small things, but they mean a lot.  They gave the wrong kind of fan, the fan that you 
<br/>put on the wall.  That is poor execution.  Good plans - poor execution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  had  poor  execution,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  bringing  of  Bills  into  this  House.    The 
<br/>Heritage Bill had so many flaws - poor execution.  They put a Bill here that is still not been able to 
<br/>come back into Parliament because we have so many problems with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>               The requirement for us in Ministries, you have your big plans, you have to have the right 
<br/>people on board, you have to have the right processes and you must have good management of all 
<br/>those processes.  If not, you have your big plans and I will tell you, you will produce nothing because 
<br/>you are note executing well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You must have your plans, you must have you outputs and outcomes and you have the right 
<br/>people in leadership.  If you have the wrong people in leadership, the wrong person driving the bus, 
<br/>the bus will end up in the wrong place.  Have the right people in, make sure that you can execute so 
<br/>you can deliver for the people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Usamate, that is a lively one.   Let us 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hope we will board the right bus and we get off at the right place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I offer the floor to the leader of the Group of 9, I just share a story on this cage farming.  
<br/>So much interest has gone into it. I did put a request to honourable Koroilavesau when he was the 
<br/>Minister of Fisheries sometimes back, if you could  bring in  some giant clams  to  be raised in  my 
<br/>shoreline in the village of Somosomo.  He arranged the bringing over of the giant clams – it was in 
<br/>boxes or cages. So, we had two big cages, one near to the end of the village of Somosomo which is 
<br/>known as Lamini and another one near the hotel. This is to ensure that it could become a major tourist 
<br/>attraction because we do not have any more giant clams in my village, so we had it there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After a couple of months, I visited the village and I went down to Welagi. I met the ladies in 
<br/>the village.  They asked me, “where are you going, Sir?”  I want to see this cage that we have put 
<br/>here. So, they never uttered a word, they remained silent.   Automatically, I knew something was 
<br/>wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1507 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I went there, I could not find any cage, only the bottom of the ocean.  I turned around, 
<br/>I saw the ladies there. I said, “Looks like this thing has disappeared.”  They never said a word.  I said, 
<br/>“Did it taste good?”.  The immediate reaction, “Oh, very nice, Sir.”  So, the villagers did not have a 
<br/>clue as to what we are trying to do there with this cage.  They need to be properly led and properly 
<br/>taught that the giant clams takes a while before it reaches that big giant clam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other cage that was placed near the hotel, when I visited the site, the same thing - there 
<br/>was no cage there.  When I asked the people working in the hotel.  They said, “No, it did not grow 
<br/>well here because of the noise of the outboard going up and down.  It affected its growth.” I asked, 
<br/>“Was it good?”  They said, “Yes, it tasted nice.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  they  ate  that.    This  is  again  what  this  new  development  brings  to  us  in  the  village, 
<br/>especially for my village in Somosomo, the population has really grown.  Even seaweed, the </span><span>lumi 
<br/>boso</span><span>, </span><span>lumi cevata</span><span>, et cetera, they have disappeared because it is an ongoing thing.  Day in and day 
<br/>out, the women are there in the sea to sustain their livelihood.  It is our negligence, so to speak, that 
<br/>we are causing all these problems now.  I think you better bring some of us to feed on before we start 
<br/>raising these things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate to make their contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just add on to the story that you have shared 
<br/>with us.  Aquaculture whether it is mariculture, brackishwater culture or even freshwater culture, is 
<br/>an important direction for Fiji.  I think it is a direction that the world is taking as we try and ensure 
<br/>that the wild stock of our fisheries is sustained and that our future generation also enjoy what we are 
<br/>enjoying now, to help to regulate the wild stock that we have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an important point when we talk about aquaculture.  One of the natural spawning 
<br/>places for fishes are mangroves.  As we balance between development and keeping our mangroves, 
<br/>when we remove our mangroves, we remove the spawning ecosystem for most of the fish that we 
<br/>catch out in our reefs.  So, it is worth also looking at preserving the mangroves that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the story, Mr.  Speaker mentioned, aquaculture is  not  only for finfish but  also  for non-
<br/>finfish.  I know that in collaboration with James Cook University, the Ministry of Fisheries way back 
<br/>then I was there, looked at sand fish (</span><span>dairo</span><span>) in Wailevu, Cakaudrove, we hatched them in the hatchery 
<br/></span><span>and just take them back to their natural environment which was quite a successful programme.  The 
<br/></span><span>products that we raised out of fish where we call it cage culture, it is used also to reseed the reefs that 
<br/>are  baren  or  even  ecosystems  that  are  running  out  of  fish  that  we  enjoy.    So,  it  is  not  only  for 
<br/>consumption, but it is also to ensure that our ecosystems are revived so that they can last into the 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also would just like to add to that, perhaps, we should look at the bigger cage fish farming, 
<br/>as  you  have  explained,  honourable  Minister  and  see  how  we  can  farm  perhaps,  archipelagic  fish 
<br/>which are quite the high-end market of fish and maybe in there would be a niche market, but I thank 
<br/></span><span>the  Ministry  for  Fisheries  for  pursuing  this  aquaculture  direction.  It  is  very  good  for  Fiji  for 
<br/></span><span>sustainability of our resources and also a source of income for those who are into pond culture for 
<br/>tilapia and prawns, and I wish the Ministry well in its drive towards aquaculture.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Members, please, take note that Oral Question No. 
<br/>126/2024 on today’s Order Paper will be dropped, as the statement made by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Fisheries and Forestry is well enough to take care of that question.
