<div><span>Development of Medical Tourism 
<br/>(Question No. 116/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aviation update Parliament on the progress made in the development of Medical Tourism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Vakalalabure  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question, which is an important one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medical tourism is essential when people travel to another country to receive medical care. 
<br/>This market has expanded rapidly over the years for many reasons, such as cost effectiveness, where 
<br/>it  is  cheaper  abroad,  some  treatments  are  not  available  locally,  waiting  time  for  surgery  and  the 
<br/>quality of care.  A number of countries are leading in this area and a good example is India where 
<br/>our own people from Fiji and the Pacific travel yearly for treatment, and this is really supplementary 
<br/>revenue for India as a destination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, medical tourism is much more than hospitals and doctors, you are looking 
<br/>at  complementing  niches,  such  as  health  and  wellness,  where  people  cross  borders  for  spa,  yoga 
<br/>camps and mindfulness retreats.  For medical tourism to work in Fiji and to be a premium medical 
<br/>tourism hub, we need to get the health infrastructure right for the benefit of not just tourists, but our 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2022, we had an estimate of 2 percent of visitors taking part in some form 
<br/>of health and medical activity.  In 2023, we had a slight increase to 2.6 percent.  In the 2024-2025 
<br/>National Budget, the Government is investing $540 million in the health sector, around $450 million 
<br/>to  the Ministry of Health and $90 million for the Ba and Lautoka Hospitals  under Public Private 
<br/>Partnership.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investments are being made to enhance our healthcare infrastructure.  For 
<br/>example,  the  Indian  Government  is  supporting  the  construction  of  a  super  speciality  hospital  in 
<br/>Nasinu, focussing on cardiac and kidney care, as Her Excellency the President of India had alluded 
<br/>to  this  morning.  The  CWM  Hospital  is  also  undergoing  major  upgrades  with  the  Australian 
<br/>Government funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are building robust partnerships with esteemed medical institutions and 
<br/></span><span>universities worldwide. A prime example is Pacific Specialist Healthcare (PSH), which exemplifies 
<br/>our  commitment  to  excellence  in  specialised  medical  care,  and  I  had  the  pleasure  of  visiting  the 
<br/>facility  a  few  weeks  ago.    It  is  situated  right  across  from  the  airport  and  is  already  adding  to  its 
<br/>facilities  and  will  soon  open  an  annex,  almost  doubling  its  size.  Sir,  PSH  is  leading  the  way  in 
<br/>providing state of the art facilities in advanced treatments, helping position Fiji as a centre of medical 
<br/>expertise.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1443 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government also has in place incentives to encourage investments in 
<br/>private  hospitals.    We  are  looking  at  investment  allowance  for  capital  expenditure  in  building, 
<br/>renovating  or  expanding  a  private  hospital.    Under  the  medical  investment  package,  there  are 
<br/>concessions and duty-free entry of certain capital equipment, plant and machinery. This is part of our 
<br/>broader efforts to drive private sector investments in healthcare. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  last  year’s  Fiji  Tourism  Convention,  we  discussed  the  possibility  of 
<br/>convening a medical tourism dialogue to explore where we are, where we want to get you and where 
<br/>the gaps are.  This is something we will work towards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our marketing campaign will highlight Fiji as a premier, safe and  an advanced healthcare 
<br/>destination. This market holds great potential because it really is a year-round activity.  If properly 
<br/>managed, it can be linked to other products such as cultural tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we have made progress on the medical tourism front, 
<br/>there is still much to be done. We are committed to delivering a comprehensive strategy for becoming 
<br/>a leading regional hub in medical tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Minister. 
<br/>Honourable Minister, will we be looking at different sorts of accreditation that needs to be done if 
<br/>we are going to truly benefit out of the medical tourism?  Together with ensuring that apart from just 
<br/>medical tourism, we are also looking at wellness tourism where we know that worldwide, it is actually 
<br/>a billion-dollar industry. So, there is issues of accreditation and there are pitfalls and dangers that 
<br/>exist when we start doing medical tourism and the necessary laws also that need to be done to ensure 
<br/>that there is proper protection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, our standards are quite at levels that are consistent with 
<br/>what is observed in other countries, so accreditation is not a major issue.  We know that we subscribe 
<br/>to standards that are observed in our part of the world and we are quite comfortable with that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge everyone to take the time to visit PSH in Nadi, right across 
<br/>from the airport.  The quality of the service there is world class.  That is an indication of what we 
<br/>have today, and the beauty about it is the people there are mostly locals. I was quite impressed with 
<br/>the medical staff in there, they are mostly locals but carrying out care that is world class.  You really 
<br/>have to go and see what is on offer.  It is something to be proud of, and as I have said in my address, 
<br/>they are already building an annex, doubling its size.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of wellness, Mr. Speaker, most operations in Fiji and most hotels now have their 
<br/>own spa and the likes, and these are, again, market driven - standards that are observed worldwide.  
<br/>Even  going  forward,  a  major  resort  is  going  to  be  opened  in  Namuka,  between  Shangri-La  and 
<br/>Natadola, that will also have some cosmetic surgery, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst talking about medical tourism, I agree with 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, I did visit Pacific 
<br/>Specialist Healthcare (PSH) in Nadi which is  worldclass, and  I also visited Nadi Hospital which is, 
<br/></span><span>at the moment, pathetic in nature and the service delivery there is more than pathetic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, we had a case whereby  a young lady  died because of negligence.   She was not 
<br/>transferred to Lautoka Hospital on time, and her parents are still crying for justice to prevail and have 
<br/>an investigation into that case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>1444 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while on one side, we have a private hospital which is of worldclass, on the 
<br/>other side, we have a public hospital which is really pathetic.  The honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>would also remember that during his time, he had also commented about the service delivery at Nadi 
<br/>Hospital.  Unfortunately, it remained the same.  Doctors have come and gone, nurses have come and 
<br/>gone,  staff  have  come  and  gone,  but  for  some  reason,  service  delivery  at  Nadi  Hospital  is  not 
<br/>improving.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we are looking at medical tourism, there seems to be some core problem that we need to 
<br/>identify and improve on, in order to give a worldclass service at Nadi Hospital.  At the moment, I 
<br/>think the Board of Visitors that is managing Nadi Hospital, I stand to be corrected, I think there is 
<br/>some disconnect between the Management and staff.  That is why the service is not delivered as per 
<br/>the expectation of either the last Government or the current Government, but patients are suffering.  
<br/>If the honourable Minister can assure that they can look into that before actually going into medical 
<br/>tourism.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is quite an important observation because we 
<br/>cannot  uplift  the  standard  only  for  tourism,  we  need  to  see  the  uplifting  of  standards  across  the 
<br/>community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  huge  market  segment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  are  the  baby  boomers,  people,  kind  of,  my 
<br/>generation. They have retired, they have quite a lot of disposable income, but they only travel to areas 
<br/>where they are assured of medical care. This is where the challenge is for Fiji, and the uplifting of 
<br/>medical tourism will also need the uplifting of what is available to our people. So, the example of 
<br/>CWM Hospital is quite remarkable, very encouraging, and with the assistance from the Australian 
<br/>Government, it will upgrade CWM Hospital to a standard consistent with what is observed overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Nadi, in particular, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did mention my experience there.  Last week, I 
<br/>went to welcome the Guru from India at Prince Charles Park and I went to Nadi Hospital as I wanted 
<br/>to use the washroom. I could not use it, but I shared it with the honourable Minister, and efforts are 
<br/>being made to improve those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the drives now that we will be sharing with you is just to get the basics right.  And I 
<br/>shared with him, like I am also a hotelier.  People come to my hotel everyday, bathrooms need to 
<br/>work, electricity needs to be there, air conditioning, plumbing, so I have suggested to him that there 
<br/>must be a maintenance team in every hospital in Fiji.  So, that is where we are going, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, to get the basics right. If a door breaks, fix it.  There is a carpenter there to do it.  Plumbing is a 
<br/>problem, so there is a plumber there to fix it, like in a hotel.  So, likewise, we would all need to see 
<br/>our hospitals.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  as  I  said  earlier,  medical  tourism  is  actually  a 
<br/>billion dollar industry.  One of the most lucrative parts of medical tourism is cosmetic surgery.  This 
<br/>is one of the reasons why I asked about accreditation, et cetera.  Will you be looking at ensuring that 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Finance provides the necessary incentives for the private sector to set up 
<br/>such hospital, because there is interest?  This is great for Fiji because it takes us to another level.  So, 
<br/>will you be looking at making sure that there are incentives provided for those from the private sector 
<br/></span><span>who may need to?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, when you start doing these things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the necessary legislation needs to 
<br/>be put in place so that we do not foul of any laws, et cetera, in reconstructive surgery that goes on.   
<br/>It is a great place to come, get a nose job, enjoy the sun and then go back home, and there are people 
<br/>interested in actually getting that done.  Will the honourable Minister be looking at probably doing a 
<br/>comprehensive survey as to what is needed and what is not from within, and also the incentivisation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1445 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is required to get these people to come and open up these particular surgeries?  There are many 
<br/>different facets to medical tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have indicated in my speech, there is a lot of 
<br/>concessions to anyone investing in tourism.  In actual fact, the IMF says that Fiji provides the most 
<br/>concession in any country towards the development of tourism.  Similarly, those concessions are also  
<br/>extended to those who want to invest in medical tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, there is a five-star or six-star resort that will be opening in the Coral Coast 
<br/>and  they  are  looking  at  cosmetic.    This  is  an  Australian-based  operation,  so  it  will  be  based  on 
<br/>Australian standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we have seen, for instance, in 
<br/>the development of the Aspen Hospital, it provides services at a cost for people coming from offshore, 
<br/>but for our own population who earn lower income, they will be provided with services free.  For the 
<br/>agencies  that  we  have  coming  across  and  establishing  facilities,  is  Government  thinking  of  some 
<br/>system where own local population who might not have access to those kind of specialist services 
<br/>they  provide,  that  Government  will  consider  a  mean-tested  approach  for  locals  who  cannot  go 
<br/>anywhere  else  for  that  kind  of  service,  to  utilise  from  these  facilities  and  have  them  assisted  or 
<br/>subsidised?  Is there any notion of doing that for this kind of facilities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with Pacific Specialist  Healthcare (PSH) as an 
<br/>example, they structure their rates, and it actually has a payment plan for locals.  So,  all that they 
<br/>have there, Mr. Speaker, is available to locals also rates that we can afford.   But that will be important 
<br/>as we move forward, that we consider the local population in terms of affordability for these highly 
<br/>specialised services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Allocation Utilisation - iTaukei Land Development 
<br/>(Question No. 117/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.B. SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update 
<br/>Parliament on the utilisation of the $4 million allocation for the iTaukei Land Development 
<br/>in the 2023-2024 Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to the iTaukei Land Development grant, I also thank the previous Government for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introducing this programme, which was to develop the people and grow the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project is in two phases.  The first one is on the documentation which is 
<br/>scoping and engineering documentation.  The second phase is on the construction, which deals with 
<br/>land clearing, levelling, subdividing the lots and put in essential services - electricity, water and roads. 
<br/></span><span>As we took over the project last year, three projects were still in phase one, that is, on the scoping 
<br/></span><span>and engineering documentation. Seven projects out of the ten that was approved in 2015, so three in 
<br/>phase one and seven in phase two.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The one which is under construction when we took over, three have been completed, one is 
<br/>on hold and three are ongoing.  The three that have been completed are in Nasoqela, Tailevu, Vuda 
<br/>in Lautoka and Yadua in Nadroga. The project that is on hold is the Vuda II in Lautoka, which was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done by General Machinery Hire.  The three that are ongoing are Wairabetia in Vuda done by B.W. 
<br/>Holdings which has been completed; the Tubalevu project in Tavua, also a contract by B.W. Holdings 
<br/>which is about 85 percent completed; and in Saweni which was done by B.W. Holdings but taken 
<br/>over by Vikash Construction which is about 85 percent completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of project that has been on documentation and engineering is the Lovu General Industry in 
<br/>Lautoka which has completed Phase 1 and Saravi in Nadroga, while Veiseisei in Vuda has completed 
<br/>the scoping but still awaiting the engineering documents.  The advice that was given to us by the 
<br/>consultants is that the money that was given to us is just enough to complete the three construction 
<br/>works, which is the subdivision for Saweni, Wairabetia and Tubalevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, our utilization was $1.6 million, or 39 percent of the budget. The delay was 
<br/>caused by the adverse weather, the slow in the approvals process, and the shortage of the construction 
<br/>materials. Also, adding into it is the hand-over time that was given to us.  These projects were with 
<br/>two Ministries - the Office of the Attorney-General and the Ministry of Finance. So, when we took 
<br/>over, we had difficulty in trying to get all the details on how the project was run. As of now, we have 
<br/>been advised by the consultant that the projects should be completed by the end of September. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I visited the sites two weeks ago, I told them that it will never be completed at the end of 
<br/>September.  So, that is how the projects have been going on and we are trying our best to complete 
<br/>the  two  leftover  projects.  We  do  not  want  to  introduce  any  other  ones  to  go  into  the  phase  two, 
<br/>because we want to complete the first two, then we will decide on how we go forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>very detailed answer to question and I wish him well and we leave it on your good hands, honourable 
<br/>Minister, particularly for the completion of the remaining projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a quick question, honourable Minister, you are aware of the housing and office space 
<br/>shortage in Levuka.  If I may ask the question on behalf of the community of Vuma Village because 
<br/>I  think  in  the  previous  Administration,  this  is  one  of  the  projects  that  was  also  in  the  list.    The 
<br/>Government wants to diversify and strengthen its presence in Levuka but we are limited by and office 
<br/>issues. So, I just wish to raise the question about the Vuma Project, if it is still under consideration, 
<br/>if you can just, please, confirm, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, with the projects that were given to us, we took over the 10 
<br/>projects that was first approved. Out of 142 applications, there were 10 approved and 132 did not 
<br/>meet  the  criteria that is  set  for the grant.  So,  I  will look  into the one that  you have  raised today, 
<br/>honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  a  supplementary  question.    Thank  you, 
<br/>honourable Minister, for your responses. One of the things that I have been talking about the whole 
<br/>of this week is about the importance of execution and implementation, and 39 percent, I understand 
<br/>the reason that you have given but I think that is something that Government needs to take note of - 
<br/>the importance of good execution, good implementation, to raise those percentages up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am interested, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on one of the criteria that we had when the system was put 
<br/></span><span>up and would like to know whether this criteria has changed. One of the conditions was that after it 
<br/>has been developed, that the landowners who are taking on the development should not sell the lots 
<br/>at anything below the market value. Is that condition still in place? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, the condition still stands and that is the reason why most of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the lots are still not being able to be sold. After this, we will have to look at it because the quicker 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>they sell the lots, then people can move in and construct their own house.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been an issue now because some of them have already made their arrangements in terms 
<br/>of the price, but when we put in the price for valuation and commercial for market price, it is a bit 
<br/>hard for them to sell at this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, most of the Ministers are involved in bilateral talks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we will skip Question No. 118 and move to Question No. 119. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sale of Fresh Ginger - Australia Ginger Farmers Association 
<br/>(Question No. 119/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the 
<br/>progress of the sale of fresh ginger to the Australia Ginger Farmers Association in the last 12 
<br/>months, as mentioned by the Minister in Parliament in March 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the talks between the two countries and the relevant organisations continue. 
<br/>However, the Ministry cannot afford to wait for an opening in the Australian market, while harvested 
<br/>ginger continues to go to waste.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  looking  to  amend  the  relevant  legislations  which  are  stringent  and  non-
<br/>facilitative for fresh exports to Australia. Currently, Mr. Speaker Sir, there are two main exporters of 
<br/>processed ginger in Fiji - Kaiming Agro Processing and Fresh Pack Trading, while other exporters 
<br/>that send small quantities include Produce Processing Pte Limited, Shahi Foods, Vinaka Farm and 
<br/>Ranadi Plantation, which specialises in organic ginger. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  the  over  production  and  supply  of  ginger  last  year,  the  Ministry 
<br/>through its capital intervention, increased the capacity of our local ginger exports to absorb an extra 
<br/>100 tonnes of matured ginger, in addition to their annual quota of 400 tonnes.  So, the immature 
<br/>ginger quota remains at 1,500 tonnes per year, and all ginger supplied to the market is processed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kaiming Agro Processing supplied 300 tonnes matured processed ginger to 
<br/>the United States of America and Canada, while 250 tonnes processed crystal, paste and juice was 
<br/>exported to Australia in the last season. The requirements remain the same, all farmers supplying to 
<br/>registered  exporters  have  a  quota.    However,  meeting  the  quality  criteria  remains  a  challenge.  
<br/>Climatic  conditions,  management  practices  and  awareness  of  quality  standards  is  currently  being 
<br/>worked on in scaling up to order by the Ministry and the stakeholders in order to meet the market 
<br/>demands and to supply the export markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exporters continue to experience resistance in accessing fresh ginger exports to Australia due 
<br/>to claim of nematode risk of Fiji ginger. However, Fiji continues to facilitate the Australia markets, 
<br/>while the Navua-based Vinaka Farm, an organic ginger provider for local and overseas export has 
<br/>managed to supply eight tonnes of fresh organic matured ginger to Australia in the last fiscal year.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is working in partnership with such players, together with the Ministry of Trade, 
<br/>to try and increase the volume of organic ginger production in Fiji, increasing Fiji’s competitive edge 
<br/>in the global market and also as a way out of the difficulty in accessing the Australian market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bilateral quarantine agreement protocol to supply ginger remains the 
<br/>same, as I have alluded to earlier, and this continues to be supported and executed by the Ministry.  
<br/>When I delivered my Ministerial Statement last year, it triggered bilaterial discussions not only with 
<br/>Australia but New Zealand as well, to the effect that the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council hosted a 
<br/>workshop in April this year, inviting a New Zealand-based company to discuss the import of fresh 
<br/>ginger  and  banana  from  Fiji.    The  MOU  is  currently  being  developed  and  expected  to  be  signed 
<br/>between the two organisations. Further discussions with Biosecurity of Fiji and other stakeholders 
<br/>are  in  progress  to  send  a  five-tonne  shipment  via  airfreight  to  compete  with  the  Italian  ginger 
<br/>currently in the New Zealand market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to work with the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council in upskilling 
<br/>our farmers on record keeping,  quality  standards and registration, to  meet  the standards for fresh 
<br/>supply  to  New  Zealand.    Fiji  can  further  raise  its  standards  through  Good  Agricultural  Practices 
<br/>(GAP) and Organic Certification by 2026 to obtain premium prices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while Fiji ginger is highly regarded in the international market, it has been 
<br/>difficult to access the fresh ginger market in Australia.  We understand that they also have the interest 
<br/>of their own ginger farmers to protect.  So, our way forward is to support agro-processors in Fiji, to 
<br/>increase their capacity to value-add ginger and purchase more ginger from farmers.  However, the 
<br/>Ministry will continue to discuss with Australia and the stakeholders to increase its market share for 
<br/>Fiji processed ginger, and it will also explore new pathways to send Fiji ginger into new markets 
<br/>both, local and abroad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, a supplementary question.  Honourable Minister 
<br/>thank you for your response.  It appears that Australia is not going to open more for us in terms of 
<br/>our ginger.  You truly said and I do agree that for ginger farmers (I am a ginger farmer myself), we 
<br/>cannot wait this long.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just came back from Indonesia, together with the honourable Speaker, on a trip last week 
<br/>and after a bilateral talk with our Indonesian partners, on the side, I was able to talk with one of the 
<br/>Members of P raising this question about them buying ginger from us. He said, “Indonesia is big, we 
<br/>have enough ginger, we can feed our own market.”  However, if we think of talking with them to 
<br/>take part of our ginger or a quarter of our ginger, they are ready to talk with us on that.  It was very 
<br/>encouraging when I heard that and I shared to the honourable Speaker, “Maybe, it is time for us to 
<br/>move away from Australia and look for other markets.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will consider that opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  Honourable Minister, one 
<br/>of the most successful ginger companies in Australia is Buderim Ginger.  To circumvent the push 
<br/>back from the Australian ginger farmers, Buderim was actually getting younger ginger out of Fiji - a 
<br/></span><span>substantial amount and labelling it and turning it into sweets.  The question is, has that expanded 
<br/></span><span>somewhat where we are sending more of our younger ginger out to Buderim because they seem to 
<br/>be very keen with respect to Fijian ginger and they hold it in very high regard?  They are one of the 
<br/>world’s best ginger companies and for purposes of our own farmers producing that kind of ginger 
<br/>that they need.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1449 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is correct.  In fact, in Fiji, the baby ginger 
<br/>market is more lucrative than the matured ginger market, simply because of what we are discussing 
<br/>right now - the non-reluctance of Australia to  accept  fresh ginger, but  we all understand.   I have 
<br/>raised it here that the quality of Fiji’s matured ginger is equal to none.  It melts in your mouth, it is 
<br/>the best ginger in the world, and that is probably why Australia wants to make it difficult for our 
<br/>fresh matured ginger to enter because they simply would not be able to compete.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the opening in the New Zealand market gives 
<br/>hope to ginger farmers.  I declare my interest as well, we are in the planting season now, starting in 
<br/>September.  Do we have hope in completing this MOU getting it signed so that when the crops starts 
<br/>maturing next year, there is hope that it will access the New Zealand market?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- I hope you declare your interest.  Yes, we will work on fast-
<br/>tracking the signing of the MOU because that is a definite offer that has come to us from the company 
<br/>in New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, for the statement made by honourable Tuinaceva, I 
<br/>think what needs to be undertaken first is an MOU.  I do not know if it is still there with Parliament 
<br/>or straight from bilateral, because they have indicated there is a market there.  If we can shift to Asia, 
<br/>there is a big market there rather than relying on the premium market that we have in Australia.  They 
<br/>have so many rules and regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have met several times with a Chinese descent businessman.  We discussed very thoroughly 
<br/>on how best we can advance the stalemate that has been reached in ginger marketing, but it seems 
<br/>that the interest of the Australian farmers, again, is something that the Australian Government readily 
<br/>protects.  I think it is an MOU and maybe, that is something for Government to follow up on, on the 
<br/>Indonesian available market and maybe, it is much closer to us because we have their fishing boats, 
<br/>and we have several issues that we have been trading with in Indonesia and the Melanesian Spearhead 
<br/>Group.  We are holding one-on-one discussions with them as well.  The providing of markets for our 
<br/>readily available agricultural products is one of the things that can be pursued.  I just wish to highlight 
<br/>that in this very important issue that has been raised regarding the market availability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  Question  Numbers  120/2024,  121/2024,  122/2024  and  123/2024,  I 
<br/>think  will  have  to  be  rolled  over  to  the  next  sitting  or  availability  of  time  where  they  could  be 
<br/>addressed, because most of the Members are in the bilateral talks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question Nos. 120/2024; 121/2024; 122/2024; and 123/2024 deferred to later  
<br/>sitting) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I intend to adjourn the House for lunch.  When we resume, Madam Deputy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker will be presiding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 1.09 p.m.
