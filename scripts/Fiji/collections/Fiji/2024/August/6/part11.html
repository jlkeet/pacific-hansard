<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has any plans to  expand the Dental Care Programme under the Private  Public Partnership 
<br/>Health Care Scheme to the Northern, Western and Eastern Divisions in this new financial 
<br/>year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  The short answer, Sir, is that at the moment, there are no plans but let me just explain the 
<br/>Public Private Partnership (PPP) General Practitioners Scheme very briefly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a COVID-19 measure, and it was a sensible and right thing to do 
<br/>at that time because the hospitals were having difficulties with the availability of the services so the 
<br/>General  Practitioners  (GPs)  were  allowed  to  look  after  and  see  the  patients  and,  of  course,  the 
<br/>Government was paying for those services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Scheme,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  still  continuing.    There  are  some  Dental  GPs  who  are 
<br/>providing those services in Suva.  We, obviously, found out that once you start this kind of Scheme, 
<br/>then the expansion and the demand for it never ends and we also found, as the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Health and Medical Services would tell you, that a lot of people who could go to the health centres 
<br/>and  get  the  same  kind  of  basic  services  were  choosing  to  go  to  private  GPs  and  the  bill  for 
<br/>Government kept increasing post-COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we brought a means test and we said that all those people 
<br/>on social welfare schemes could continue with the GP Scheme, but those who can and should use 
<br/>public health facilities, particularly those around health centres, then they should. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  additional  answer  to  the  honourable  Member’s  question,  that  is 
<br/>something that we can look at but we have to have a good, proper, demand assessment.  As I have 
<br/>said about Aspen, for example, in my Budget Speech, on the financial model, the demand assessment 
<br/>was never considered properly when that Scheme was started. So, the cost just kept escalating, the 
<br/>demand kept escalating, so people who could go to a health centre would end up at a public hospital, 
<br/>paid for by Government, when these services are also available in the health centres.  So, that is a bit 
<br/>of a background with respect to the question asked by honourable Ravunawa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare my interest before asking 
<br/>this  question,  as  I  am  a  Director  of  one  of  the  private  pharmacies  under  PPP  in  the  Health  Care 
<br/>Scheme.  We have seen  that when a patient  goes to  a hospital or health  centre, he/she is  given a 
<br/>prescription,  he/she  can  come  and  get  those  medications  that  are  provided  for  free  from  private 
<br/>pharmacies.  But if a GP writes the prescription and that prescription is taken to a hospital or a health 
<br/>centre pharmacy, they are not given that medication.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the burden has actually shifted to the private pharmacies to keep this medication in 
<br/>pharmacies and previously, we used to get 45 cents per item but now we are getting somewhere close 
<br/>to around 20 percent per medication, which is not basically the cost recovered for our overhead in 
<br/>running a private pharmacy, why are public hospitals and health centres not keeping the medications 
<br/>that are provided under the Free Medical Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  know  the  question  is  directed  to  me,  but  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Health and Medical Services is here already.   I am not aware of that happening but, 
<br/>perhaps,  the  honourable  Minister  can  answer  that  very  specifically,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  with  your 
<br/>permission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if  I  can just  elaborate on the 
<br/>question raised by honourable Maharaj, he knows the difference between the private pharmacy and 
<br/>the public pharmacy, that the private pharmacy will review its essential drug list and that essential 
<br/>drug list will then include some of the medications that are not currently available in the Government 
<br/>Pharmacy but are available in the private pharmacy.  When that happens, then it will solve what the 
<br/>honourable Member is saying, that if a prescription is given by the private pharmacy, then they can 
<br/>also source it from the Government Pharmacy by using that programme on Free Medicine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question. The honourable Member has asked 
<br/>about the PPP in the Eastern Division as well. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  has  answered  for  the 
<br/>Western  and  Central  Divisions.    But  knowing  that  we  have  the  </span><span>MV  Cagivou</span><span>  -  the  former  Prime 
<br/>Minister had a vision to have a vessel which is state-of-the-art, with a hospital itself inside the vessel, 
<br/>in the past 20 months, did the honourable Minister visit that Vessel and understand that this PPP 
<br/>Scheme can also be utilised in the Eastern Divion as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the honourable Member 
<br/>is referring to, and I could not get was he was asking. But if he is asking whether these services are 
<br/>available in the public health facilities, of course, these services are available.  Part of the problem, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to GP Scheme was that a lot of the patients who could go to the health 
<br/>centres and get basic services, treatment and medicine, were choosing to go to this GP Scheme and 
<br/>this  is  what  I  was  saying.  That  was  a  COVID  measure,  and  it  continued  and  expanded,  and  the 
<br/>demand was never ending, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in the last Budget, we took a good decision to say, “Alright, we will have a means test.  
<br/>We will look at those who deserve to get those kind of services paid for by Government”.  We have 
<br/>done that, and I think it is working well.  But with respect to dental services, apart from the Central 
<br/>Division, we do not have this in other Divisions and as the honourable Member has quite rightly said, 
<br/>whether the Government has plans to do that or not, we will consider that, we will look at the demand, 
<br/>we will look at the cost, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and then we will make the decision. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- A supplementary question, Sir. What we have noticed is that when patients 
<br/>go to those GPs that are under the Scheme, when those GPs prescribe medicine, they ask their patients 
<br/>to go to some of their own pharmacies, rather than going to the health centres and hospitals.  What 
<br/>can  be  done  about  that  because  the  patients  go  to  these  doctors,  and  they  have  their  own  friend 
<br/>pharmacists?  Instead of getting free medicine from hospitals and health centres, these patients are 
<br/>referred to certain pharmacies.  Are we educating the patients about this, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have indicated a very serious situation where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you are saying that some of the doctors are referring them to their own pharmacies? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Yes, they do, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you have evidence of that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- I can provide evidence, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, you can provide that because I am not too keen to allow that question 
<br/>to continue because you are basing it on some wild allegations, et cetera.  We need to be very careful.  
<br/>Yes, he is a private practitioner…. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1433 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Sir, just for clarification, I think what the honourable Member is 
<br/>saying now is that a general rule applies where a prescriber should not be a dispenser.  Ever since 
<br/>there was a law passed that hospitals can operate their own pharmacies, what we have seen is that 
<br/>there can be a compromise in a patient’s treatment if, for example, a particular medication is not 
<br/>available. And if I am a prescriber and I am a dispenser, having an interest in that, I can prescribe 
<br/>whatever is available in my pharmacy.  It does not necessarily mean that I will send them to my 
<br/>pharmacy, but  I will prescribe what  is  available  in  my  pharmacy so that  it is  convenient to  get  a 
<br/>prescription from me and get dispensed from the pharmacy that is owned by me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that is something that we need to look at into future because we cannot compromise the 
<br/>health of the patients, whether the prescriber should be allowed to also own a pharmacy, so he or she 
<br/>becomes a prescriber and a dispenser at the same time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Maharaj, you have declared your interest already, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can see where you are coming from. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am glad that honourable Maharaj brought that issue up, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  When they were in Government and we were on the other side, we opposed that Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We actually said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that that was not a good 
<br/>Bill and it was done to benefit certain people.  I am very happy that honourable Maharaj now agrees, 
<br/>and we should look at that.  He is right, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to add, in the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we added an additional item to the 21 zero-
<br/>rated  items  -  prescribed  medicine.    So,  if  you  get  a  prescription  from  your  doctor,  you  go  to  a 
<br/>pharmacy, you do not pay 15 percent VAT on it.  So, the prescribed medicine is now VAT free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>JICA’s Grant Funding for Fiji Airports 
<br/>(Question No. 114/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament on the Grant Funding from the Japan International Cooperation Agency for Fiji 
<br/>Airports? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tuiwailevu for his question 
<br/>which is a very useful question because it brings the Government to answer and to let it be known in 
<br/>the House and to the people of Fiji what this development partner had been doing with Fiji and for 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like many of our development partners, the Government of Japan have been a very reliable 
<br/></span><span>partner for Fiji over many decades and we welcome the constructive approach that Japan brings to 
<br/></span><span>its relationships, not only with Fiji but with the region in general, and their contribution towards Fiji’s 
<br/>economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with Government’s approach to triumph economic growth in our 
<br/>foreign policy prosperity pillar, priority will always be given towards the progression and expansion 
<br/>of key enablers, such as airport infrastructure upgrades to enhance connectivity, travel and to improve  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>competitiveness and trade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  role  of  Fiji  Airports,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly  I  would  like  to  convey  my  sincere 
<br/>appreciation to the Government of Japan and its funding agency, Japan International Cooperation 
<br/>Agency (JICA) for providing support to Fiji Airports through a $15 million grant for the improvement 
<br/>of  aviation  safety  facilities  at  major  airports  in  Fiji.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Airports  plays  a 
<br/>fundamental role in the progress of Fiji’s economy as it manages the airport operations, oversees the 
<br/>air space and undertakes the transits of goods and services that are significant to Fiji’s market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airports and JICA: The initial discussions between Fiji Airports and JICA commenced 
<br/>in  2013  under  the  FijiFirst  Government  but  was  halted  because  of  the  global  pandemic.  It 
<br/>recommenced in 2022 and continued in 2023 when JICA officially dispatched a preparatory survey 
<br/>team  to  Fiji  Airports  for  discussions  and  explanations  on  the  Draft  Preparatory  Report.    That 
<br/>culminated in the endorsement of the report by the relevant officials on 17th January, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agreement and Due Diligence:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the JICA grant assistance is focused on 
<br/>improving  safety  at  the  airports  and  the  procurement  of  hi-tech  aircraft  surveillance  systems  and 
<br/>equipment to enhance Fiji’s capabilities and capacity in that face.  As per the grant agreement, JICA 
<br/>committed to the following areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>procurement  and  installation  of  aircraft  surveillance  systems  at  the  Nadi  International 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airport and Labasa Airport; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>procurement  and  delivery  of  five  fire  trucks  for  Nausori,  Labasa,  Savusavu  and  Matei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airports; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>procurement and delivery of three rescue boats for Nadi International Airport; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>provision of consultancy services for improving aviation safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the grant documentation received from JICA consists of the Grant Agreement 
<br/>and the Exchange of Notes between the Government of Fiji and the Government of Japan.  This has 
<br/>undergone the appropriate due diligence and screened through the relevant agencies including the Office 
<br/>of the Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet  was  also  consulted  and  have  appreciatively  acknowledged  the  grants  support  by 
<br/>JICA, including the conveyance of the official endorsement towards the grant documentation on 15th 
<br/>July, 2024.  The official ceremony for the endorsement of the grant documentation is expected to 
<br/>eventuate in the coming days and will be attended by representatives from JICA, the Embassy of the 
<br/>Government of Japan and Fiji Airports, and further discussions on that were done during my visit to 
<br/>Japan for 10th Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM10). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to this support, Government has recently signed a cooperation 
<br/>agreement (it was done while I was in Japan) with the Government of Japan purposed to help improve 
<br/>our national disaster preparedness and response capacity.  Through this partnership, the Government 
<br/>of Fiji will explore the use of an advanced satellite positioning system to improve its early warning 
<br/>capabilities particularly in relation to tsunami risks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  increasing  our  access  to  satellite  data  and  cutting-edge  remote  sensing 
<br/></span><span>technology is vital for our society and well-being, and we further welcome this cooperation with the 
<br/>Government of Japan.  That was also signed while I was at PALM10. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  highlighted by these areas  of collaboration, our enduring relationship 
<br/>with Japan is marked by increasing engagement across the various critical sectors and issues, and I 
<br/>take this opportunity to thank the Government, the people of Japan and JICA for their support and

<div><span>partnership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  just  a  quick  question with  respect  to  the 
<br/>aircraft  surveillance  system.    Is  this  an  upgrade  or  complete  overall  that  will  be  procured  and 
<br/>purchased with respect to the aircraft surveillance system?  Does it entail training of our air traffic 
<br/>controllers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not  overhaul  or  overall,  it  is  just  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continuation, upgrading of the facilities we already have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Sir,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  is  related  to 
<br/>passenger experiences.  When people travel out of Labasa, there are no security checks done, but 
<br/>when people are entering Labasa through aircraft, there are all kinds of security checks done at Nadi 
<br/>and Nausori.  The aid that Fiji will be receiving, will that also include security checks? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been told that it is the World Bank project 
<br/>and I had also noticed that and I mentioned it to the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation that we 
<br/>needed to upgrade those security aspects of operations also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Especially from Labasa, Savusavu and Taveuni, cause you never know, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>drugs might be coming there too.  You do not have sniffer dogs as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Renovation of Public Toilet Facilities 
<br/>(Question No. 115/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament 
<br/>if the Government has any plans to renovate and improve the state of the public toilet facilities 
<br/>in all towns and cities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for  this  very  important  question.    The  Coalition  Government  recognises  the  essential  role  that 
<br/>public toilet facilities play in all our urban centres.  They are not only vital for public health and 
<br/>sanitation, but also contribute to overall image and functionality of our towns and cities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  responsibility  for  maintaining  and  upgrading  these  facilities  falls 
<br/>primarily on all the municipal councils of all the 13 municipalities.  The Government is committed 
<br/>to supporting these councils through various initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  we  are  provided  capital  grants  specifically  earmarked  for  the  construction  of  new 
<br/>public conveniences and the renovation of existing ones.  These grants aim to ensure that public 
<br/>toilets are clean, safe, accessible and environmentally friendly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also seen some changes and tangible 
<br/></span><span>results in some of the municipalities.  For instance, in Sigatoka Town, because they have got some 
<br/></span><span>issues with the current public convenience, as well as planning to construct a new facility with the 
<br/>construction costing around $75,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly with other small municipal councils, Suva City as well as Lautoka, there were also 
<br/>plans in place to upgrade and renovate some of these public conveniences.  Also, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, like all other 12 municipalities, there are also renovation plans for their public conveniences 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within this financial year. This renovation include tiling, painting, replacement of current as well 
<br/>as old toilet seats, cisterns and essential electoral and plant works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this new financial year 2024-2025, many councils have strategically planned to complete 
<br/>these  renovations  in  the  first  and  second  quarters  ensuring  that  facilities  are  in  optimal  condition 
<br/>during peak usage periods such as local festivals and carnivals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  large  councils  are  better  equipped  to  undertake  comprehensive 
<br/>renovations, smaller councils face constraints due to limited funding. However, these councils are 
<br/>prioritising  essential  repairs  and  maintenance  to  keep  facilities  operational.  Most  of  these  small 
<br/>municipalities have caretakers in place to open as well as close these facilities on a daily basis.  When 
<br/>there is  a need to  repair, they have  an internal  board,  and also have plans in  place to  upgrade or 
<br/>maintain these facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also encourage community engagement in the renovation 
<br/>process, public input on the design and features for renovated conveniences which can lead to more 
<br/>user friendly and appreciated facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the planned renovations and improvement to all our public 
<br/>conveniences  and  facilities  across  municipalities  demonstrates  the  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>commitment to enhancing urban infrastructure and public health. These initiatives are part of our 
<br/>broader strategy to  improve the quality  of life for all Fijians, and  also  promote sustainable urban 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, supplementary question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>bringing the subject closer to Suva City, there are three public facilities or toilets that supports the 
<br/>capital. Only three from the market to Terry Walk and one at the Botanical Garden. The one at Sukuna 
<br/>Park is closed at the moment.  All these facilities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are dirty, unhygienic and unsafe. 
<br/>May I ask the honourable Minister if close attention or he could expedite to build these facilities fit 
<br/>or good for public use and above all they could  build forward. Redirect their prioritisation of the 
<br/>work here in Suva to improving this basic, essential facility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member again for raising 
<br/>this, I think it is a very pertinent issue right now. I just alluded to earlier. For this financial year, the 
<br/>Suva City Council should be upgrading some of the other facilities that were mentioned.  We are 
<br/>hopeful that we also maintain and upgrade the facility to a standard that is user-friendly and also 
<br/>improve the sanitation as it is communally used by the public and those who visit Suva City.  The 
<br/>councils are committed, and we are looking forward to more improvements in this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, in the last parliament sitting a friend of mine sent in 
<br/>pictures of used syringes in the urinal area in one of the public conveniences. With the upgrade plans 
<br/>outlined by the honourable Minister, what security measures are in place or will be implemented to 
<br/>guarantee public safety?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Let me cut it short for you.  You indicated that the grants are there and 
<br/>everything, it is just the proper upkeep of this, so we do not get the smells.  We were talking about 
<br/>Sukuna Park yesterday, that is the very thing that is happening in Sukuna Park.  We find strangers 
<br/>there, plastic bags for drugs scattered all over the place. It is the smell as well, honourable Minister, 
<br/>sometimes it chases you when you want to visit those conveniences, especially in Labasa and other 
<br/>municipalities. I do not know whether it should do with toilet manners, et cetera, otherwise it is just

<br/>This happens in the boats as well.  I spoke to the captains and told them, “Clean these toilets, these 
<br/>are public toilets and it should not be like this.”  So, that is all we want to have that address from you, 
<br/>Sir.  How can you best give us advice on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very common issue right now in our country 
<br/>comes  down  to  the  responsibility  of  the  users  of  our  public  conveniences.    In  some  of  our 
<br/>municipalities, we have officers who are stationed as caretakers to look after these public facilities.  
<br/>Some are on a user-pay basis, you pay then you use the convenience.  Like for Sukuna Park, there 
<br/>will  be  a  security  day  and  night  to  look  after  the  whole  place  and  also  take  care  of  the  public 
<br/>convenience.  That is something that the Council will take on board to ensure that all public facilities 
<br/>and convenience are safe and also have a proper adequate securities to look after these areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  now  that  the  boundaries  are  extended  and  it  is 
<br/>included in towns and cities, my question to the honourable Minister, the honourable Minister just 
<br/>mentioned  that  the  Government  grants  are  given  to  build  toilets.    My  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, can he explain to us, how much grant is given this year and which area these toilets will be 
<br/>built? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figure right now. I can assure 
<br/>the House that we have the funds and we are also working with the councils especially the medium 
<br/>and small-size ones on the upgrading of their facilities.  Like I said, for Sigatoka Town, there is a 
<br/>grant  of  $75,000  will  be  utilised  to  construct  a  new  public  convenience  as  well  as  the  other 
<br/>municipalities around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Government  grants  have  been  provided,  that  is  the  message  from  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, but where is directed to is a matter for him to go back and check the books, it 
<br/>is not off hand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a serious issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Everything is serious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Look at him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot be building toilets in and out of cities or everywhere.  But there 
<br/>is some degree of responsibility to the shop owners, and by law, shop owners must provide those 
<br/>facilities.  But most of the time you will see on the door, it is written, ‘not in use’.  So, I ask the 
<br/>honourable Minister if the authorities can look into this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a general question.  I understand you will want to know which shop 
<br/></span><span>has a notice on its toilet, but it is up to you, honourable Minister, if you would like to answer that 
<br/></span><span>question.  As he has stated, it is a serious question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  just  wondering  why  the  honourable 
<br/>Member is raising this issue now, when it should have been raised during his term.  I am going to 
<br/>work on that, and I have just said, I think that is also a good idea.  We will  also request the shop 
<br/>owners and supermarkets to assist in this area.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have just received word that the Madam President 
<br/>of the Republic of India has left the Government House and she is on her way down to Parliament.  
<br/>As such and as alluded to in my earlier communication, the Standing Orders and Sitting will now be 
<br/>suspended, so as to allow Her Excellency the President of India to address Parliament today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  that  respect,  I  now  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Government  in  Parliament  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proceed to the Foyer to receive Her Excellency the President of India.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Leader  of  the  Government  in  Parliament  left  the  Chambers  to  greet  and  escort  Her 
<br/>Excellency the President of India into the Chambers] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as part of this programme of welcoming Her Excellency the President, 
<br/>that  is,  upon  entering  the  Parliament  Chambers,  all  honourable  Members  will  be  upstanding  to 
<br/>receive the President.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Leader of the Government in Parliament will escort Her Excellency into the Parliament 
<br/>Chambers and the order will be, the Leader of the Government in Parliament, then Her Excellency 
<br/>the President of India, and then the ADC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Leader of the Government  in  Parliament will stand next  to honourable Vosarogo and 
<br/>await Her Excellency to continue on the right to join the Speaker on the left side of the Speaker’s 
<br/>table.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Her Excellency bows to both sides of Parliament, and then I will call out for the resumption 
<br/>of seats.  ‘You may take your seats again’, when I do call that out.  That is the process that we have 
<br/>in place, and I hope we just have to follow these steps to make the entrance more interesting and 
<br/>enlightening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst I am saying that, I extend our welcome once more to the distinguished guests in the 
<br/>public gallery - the members of the Diplomatic Corp who are here, the Chairman of the GCC, the 
<br/>Permanent  Secretary  of  Foreign  Affairs,  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  Health,  our  friends  from 
<br/>Tamavua near Madam Seeto, and maybe our friends from the great Government of India, who have 
<br/>just joined us this morning. We welcome you, and we hope you will make this visit a memorable 
<br/>one, by giving  all our best  and how we listen  tentatively to  the message that Her Excellency the 
<br/>President will be sharing with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members  and  distinguished  guests,  may  I  request  that  we  be  upstanding  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>receive Her Excellency the President of India. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Government in Parliament]

<br/>Excellency the President of the Republic of India, Shreemati Droupadi Murmu, to the Parliament of 
<br/>Fiji. Welcome Your Excellency!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the honourable Members, I welcome you to the Fijian Parliament, and also to 
<br/>Fiji for that matter.  We look forward to your address to us this morning and anticipate renewed and 
<br/>stronger relations between our two Governments and Parliaments. I hope that you will fully enjoy 
<br/>your short visit to Fiji, Madam.
