<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION 2020- 2023 ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation  2020,  2021,  2022  and  2023  Annual  Reports,  which  was  tabled  on  12th  July, 
<br/>2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILEVASAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to present the overview of the 
<br/>Fiji Sugar Corporation’s 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. The Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020, 2021, 
<br/>2022 and 2023 Annual Reports on 12th July, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar Industry for submitting the 
<br/>responses to the tabled Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020-2023 Annual 
<br/>Reports. While reviewing the FSC Reports, the Committee noted that FSC is insolvent and, without 
<br/>any Government guarantee, the Corporation will be unable to continue its operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the deplorable condition of the railway system during the site visits as 
<br/>the investment made on those tracks has contributed to the deterioration of road conditions, traffic 
<br/>congestion and increased transportation cost to the farmers whereby, trucks are left idle during yjr 
<br/>non-harvesting period, wasting valuable resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the sugar industry stakeholders are territorial and working in silos. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is lack of information sharing and coordination that directly impacts sugar production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee should be empowered to conduct an inquiry to scrutinise all key 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders of the sugar sector to pinpoint the root cause of the Corporation’s continuous operating 
<br/>in deficit.  The Committee will propose remedial measures to improve the financial position of the 
<br/>Corporation with the aim of reducing its heavy reliance on Government guarantees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FSC  must  prioritize  the  development  and  implementation  of  appropriate  policies, 
<br/>strategies and plans to improve sector productivity and achieve set targets and outputs.  It is crucial 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1457 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for FSC to ensure that these policies and plans are aligned with the current challenges faced by the 
<br/>Corporation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  identified  several  factors  contributing  to  the  decline  in  sugar  production.  
<br/>These  included  the  lack  of  interest  by  farmers  who  perceive  cane  farming  as  unprofitable; 
<br/>inconsistent cane supply to the mills, resulting in under utilisation of the mill capacity; non-existence 
<br/>of KPIs, and non-renewal and absence of a strategic plan to forecast the Corporation’s future targets 
<br/>and outputs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee strongly suggests that the Corporation develops the KPIs for all sugar-related 
<br/>sectors to ensure the economic viability of the sector.  There is an urgent need to review the sugar 
<br/>sector,  in  particular,  FSC  to  improve  its  performance  through  a  more  enhanced  co-ordination, 
<br/>commitment and accountability of all stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members, and I have a list of four speakers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, before I talk on the motion, I would like to 
<br/>make an observation about what honourable Koroilavesau had said about the stakeholders and co-
<br/>operation which was lacking amongst all the stakeholders of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I came in as Minister, I did realise that these five different entities, their officers, staff 
<br/>and CEOs were not in talking terms.  I could see that there was a pull between all these entities, so 
<br/>we had to bring them in and give them a bit of a lesson, “unless you do not come together, the industry 
<br/>will fall apart.”  So, we had our stakeholders meeting, we had some conferences, and I can see that 
<br/>they are now trying to co-operate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the problems that we also found was that the FSC workers on the ground were not 
<br/>supporting the farmers.  They would go around in their vans, have grog, have chicken curry and then 
<br/>will come back, unlike in the previous years, the Farm Advisors and Field Officers used to go out to 
<br/>farmers to teach and support them.  Again, I have been warning the current FSC staff that if they are 
<br/>not working hard, if they are not doing their job, they must leave the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  reason  why  our  cane  production  has  gone  down  is  because  the  farmers  are  not 
<br/>replanting on time.  In Fiji’s history, the decline has come down from 100 tonnes per hectare to about 
<br/>47 tonnes per hectare whereas in other countries, cane production is static at around 100 tonnes per 
<br/>hectare.  We need to get the farmers, we do not need big land, and we need the production to go up 
<br/>within  that  hectare.    For  that,  we  are  trying  to  get  the  mechanisation  system,  give  support  to  the 
<br/>farmers so that we can increase production, if not 100 tonnes, at least, 75 tonnes to 80 tonnes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our farmers, in the traditional way, they are so proud to have a 50-acre farm but the cane is 
<br/>only  grown  in  10  acres.    We  are  trying  to  tell  them,  “you  do  not  need  50  acres,  you  are  paying 
<br/>unnecessary premium  for that.  Go back and produce more cane  within smaller farms but  with  a 
<br/>higher hectare.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the railway system, you are right honourable Koroilavesau, even the honourable Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister had messaged me the other day that the FSC should seriously look at bringing the railway 
<br/>system back.  One of the decisions that was made by the previous CEO, Mr. Abdul Khan, he was 
<br/>trying to get the railway system out.  If you remember, they brought in about a hundred trucks at that 
<br/>time.  Now, the railway system is still operational in some parts of Fiji, but as you may have realised 
<br/>that in the Sigatoka area, there is no railway system because of the bridge that was damaged.  The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and I had looked at the bridge.  While the bridge is being built, we can 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1458 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>go up to Sigatoka and then transport cane from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  must  realise,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  that  the  cost  of  transporting  sugarcane  from 
<br/>Sigatoka, a farmer pays about $50 per tonne.  In that way, farmers will not be encouraged to plant 
<br/>cane in  the Sigatoka area if we do not  have a railway system  there.  For that reason, honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau, we have started talking to a company in India called RITES and they will be coming 
<br/>shortly to Fiji to look at all the railway systems which are not currently in operation so that they can 
<br/>assist us to re-install all those rails. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the re-organisation of the sugar industry, as I had mentioned yesterday, through the help 
<br/>of honourable Tubuna, we have two experts who are currently in Fiji from the Food and Agriculture 
<br/>Organization. They will give a comprehensive study of the sugar industry in totality.  That is how we 
<br/>will come to know which direction we will take from thereon.  As I have said yesterday, the report 
<br/>will be handed over to us by October.  Once it comes in, then we will have a very clear picture.  Of 
<br/>course, the sugar industry is here to stay, but how and which direction it will take, is something that 
<br/>we will decide after the report is given to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the motion on the Consolidated Review Report of 
<br/>the Fiji Sugar Corporation’s 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. It was from my intervention 
<br/>that I got FSC to present all these Annual Reports because if you see, in any business, you cannot 
<br/>have reports that are four years old.  You must have report for every year so that you know what 
<br/>direction the company is heading.  When we saw the final report of 2023, that was when we realised 
<br/>that FSC is in financial trouble. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this Report, tabled as Parliamentary Paper No. 76 of 2024, provides 
<br/>a comprehensive overview of the Corporation’s performance for the past four years.  It serves as an 
<br/>essential platform that offers insights into FSC’s financial status, operational achievements and areas 
<br/>that require improvements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, I must express my appreciation for the dedication of FSC and its staff in 
<br/>compiling these detailed Annual Reports.  Their tireless efforts have culminated in this Consolidated 
<br/>Review  Report,  which  reflects  the  Corporation’s  ongoing  commitment  to  transparency  and 
<br/>accountability.  Despite the challenges and demands of the sugar industry, FSC has tried to operate 
<br/>within the constraints of its own resources - a testament of resilience and adaptability, despite many 
<br/>challenges ahead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  crucial  to  address  a  significant  challenge  highlighted  in  the 
<br/>Report - the decline in cane quality.  This issue has adversely affected the sugar production over the 
<br/>years, primarily due to increased volume of burnt cane, aging mills, infrastructure and impacts of 
<br/>climate change.  The practice of burning cane cannot only compromise soil health and environment, 
<br/>but also escalates operational and processing costs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, in collaboration with FSC, is actively working to educate farmers about the 
<br/>detrimental effects of this practice. The FSC Field Officers are regularly engaging with those across 
<br/>various sectors in partnership with the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji.  It is crucial to provide farmer 
<br/></span><span>education, conduct trial plots, implement education programmes and enhanceimprovements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, moreover, the Report emphasises the need to improve soil fertility 
<br/>to  enhance  sugarcane  production.    The  FSC  Field  Officers  are  actively  promoting  the  integrated 
<br/>nutrient management practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After the long span of time, the grant programme has included application of lime to neutralise 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>soil pH levels to prevent acidic soil in Fiji.  This measure aims to improve fertilizer use efficiency, 
<br/>promote precision nutrient application based on soil testing, and enhance soil organic matters through 
<br/>mill mud and green manuring and test conservation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FSC also faces challenges related to workforce in both, production and processing levels.  
<br/>To  address  this,  the  FSC  has  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  the  National  Sugar 
<br/>Institute of  India  to  conduct training and development  for the workforce. Furthermore, we put  in 
<br/>skilled expert trades people to strengthen its technical capabilities and excellence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the FSC’s Annual Report which has 
<br/>not been entirely satisfactory. However, I have full confidence in the current Board led by Mr. Nitya 
<br/>Reddy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Madam Deputy Speaker, I, therefore, support this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank you for giving me this 
<br/>opportunity to address this august House and give my contribution to the debate on the Consolidated 
<br/>Review Report of the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, over the four years under review, the Committee noted a significant 
<br/>decline in cane production from 2020 to 2021, followed by a 16 percent increase from 2021 to 2022.  
<br/>Despite this improvement, cane production remains below the desired level of 2.5 million tonnes, 
<br/>and continues to show a declining trend, if no concrete action is taken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  identified  several  factors  contributing  to  the  decline  in  sugar  production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These include the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inconsistent cane supply to the mill, resulting in underutilisation of mill capacity; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Lack of interest by the farmers who perceive cane farming as unprofitable. 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Decline in cane quality; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Non-existence of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); and 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Non-renewal or absence of the Strategic Plans to forecast the Corporation’s future targets 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and outputs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this is further aggravated with various underpinning issues that need 
<br/>urgent  attention,  such  as  frequent  mill  breakdowns.    Just  last  week,  there  were  at  least  two 
<br/>breakdowns, and before that, many more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mill breakdowns burden the farmers as their cost increases in terms of paying labourers for 
<br/>extra food and providing  accommodation  for  extended harvesting, which was not  planned by the 
<br/>farmers.    When  new  harvesting  season  approaches,  farmers  are  very  optimistic  that  there  will  be 
<br/>minimum, or no breakdown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that mill has an aging  infrastructure, but  offseason gives enough time to the 
<br/>management to fix all mechanical issues that cause frequent breakdown.  This, to my understanding, 
<br/></span><span>is not happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this is one area the FSC has always neglected.  I strongly urge the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Sugar Industry to look into this maintenance aspect of the mill operation. 
<br/>Someone is not doing the job properly.  I have seen truck drivers spending days at the mill area to 
<br/>deliver the cane, and I have seen trucks loaded and parked at home to be allowed to deliver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>
<div><span>1460 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report also highlighted that the decline of the cane quality has 
<br/>reduced sugar production over the years, primarily due to the increased volume of burnt canes.  This 
<br/>not  only  negatively  impacts  soil  health  and  the  environment  but  also  increases  operational  and 
<br/>processing costs, resulting in the loss of revenue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, over the years many properties have been destroyed due to cane burning. Neighbouring 
<br/>farms have been damaged, as well creating animosity amongst  farmers in the harvesting gangs. I 
<br/>would like to thank National Fire Authority for providing the services in protecting properties during 
<br/>fire.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when cane is burnt, the farmers are faced with additional burden to 
<br/>cart the cane to the mill in the allocated time, as once this surpasses, the farmers are charged a penalty. 
<br/>This,  in  the long  run, is  a direct  loss of  revenue  to  the farmers. The burnt  cane penalty  deducted 
<br/>should be refunded to the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  to  provide  incentives  to  farmers  to  harvest  green  cane 
<br/>throughout the season. In fact, the Ministry of Sugar Industry must create an awareness campaign for 
<br/>farmers to  harvest  green cane  and give incentives, for example,  an extra  $5 per tonne, if farmers 
<br/>harvest green cane.  This will, no doubt, boost farmers' confidence and create a healthy competition 
<br/>amongst cane harvesting gangs. The current arrangement with the Sugar Cane Growers Fund is not 
<br/>enough.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there are still many gangs that carry their cane via the rail system 
<br/>and tractors cart the rail trucks to the rail pickup point. Since last year, the road levy tax for tractors 
<br/>has increased, and as a result, the tractor operators have increased their per tonne cartage of cane.  
<br/>Therefore, the farmers have to pay more to cart cane to the rail pickup point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, these are trying and testing times for our sugar industry, and I would 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like to thank all the farmers who have made sacrifices to keep the industry up and running.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  would  like  to  thank  the  Government  for  providing  the  much-needed  funds  to  boost 
<br/>sugar  production.    However,  there  are  many  challenges  that  still  need  to  be  addressed.  Perhaps, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, this august House could consider empowering the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs to work on a comprehensive document that can address the issues in the sugar 
<br/>sector. This would involve talking and inspecting FSC and their mills, engaging with cane farmers, 
<br/>and consulting with all stakeholders to bring back to this House a viable solution to help revive the 
<br/>sugar sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee should focus on implementing sustainable farming practices to 
<br/>enhance cane quality and ensure the long- term viability of the industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, I 
<br/>fully support all recommendations made by the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam  Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members 
<br/>of Parliament; I rise to provide a brief contribution on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Sugar Corporation (FSC) from the year 2020-2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as I was sitting here, I was watching the light up there flashing and 
<br/>I am always one for symbolism and it kind of suggested to me that a light bulb has gone out on that 
<br/>side of the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1461 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, when we talk about sugar, we are 
<br/>talking about one of the elephants in the room when it comes to the Fijian economy. I was looking at 
<br/>a report by the same Committee before we had a change of Government, and when you looked at it, 
<br/>it did not have any critical thoughts around the sugar industry.  None, a very weak report and no 
<br/>constructive criticism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the criticisms from the other side, Madam Deputy Speaker, are very, very pointed and 
<br/>actually accurate.  And I congratulate them for their tender and honesty now since the light has come 
<br/>on. I am reminded of the words of Albert Einstein.  He says that the definition of insanity is doing 
<br/>the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.  Madam Deputy Speaker, that is 
<br/>the summary of the sugar industry. We have been doing exactly the same thing and expecting or 
<br/>hoping or praying that we get a different result. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when you look at the Fiji Sugar Corporation Report and I am just 
<br/>looking  at  the  2023  Financial  Report,  being  a  Chartered  Accountant,  you  just  look  at  it  to  get  a 
<br/>measure of a business.  So, I looked at the statistics, the 10 years statistical review on Page No. 66 of 
<br/>the Financial Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Pillay said, “We have been trying to get the sugarcane crush up to 2.5 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tonnes per year.”  For the last 10 years, we have never reached that tonnage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The last 20 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- There you go!  Well, I have just got what I have here and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am talking from what is available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The net assets, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is the amount of assets the company has versus 
<br/>the  liabilities.    Generally,  when  you  have  more  liabilities  than  assets,  you  know  that  you  are  in 
<br/>trouble.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the whole 10 years from 2014 to 2023, we have had negative net assets.  So, to the point 
<br/>raised by the honourable Tubuna, we have been accepting an insolvent company for the last 10 years, 
<br/>or 20 years if you want to believe honourable Premila Kumar, without doing anything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, just for the purpose of today’s discussion, I thought to read something, again, from 
<br/>Page No. 33, paragraph 2.1(a) – the basis of accounting which has growing concern. When this note, 
<br/>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  appears  in  audited  accounts  and  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  will 
<br/>know this, you run for the yields.  You actually run for the yields, and this is what it says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The financial statements have been prepared on a growing concern basis on the 
<br/>assumption that the Corporation will continue to receive ongoing support from the Fiji 
<br/>Government.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For argument’s sake, Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Fiji Government collapses today, there 
<br/>is a big problem with FSC. That is how serious this situation is.  We cannot allow this to continue 
<br/></span><span>any longer.  So,  I would like to  congratulate the  honourable Tubuna that  through  discussions, he 
<br/></span><span>decided to reach out to FAO, and we are now preparing a report that will allow us to have a deep 
<br/>look at sugar and try and come up with something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This side of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker, we are motivated to try and fix the sugar 
<br/>industry, and I hope that we can work together with the other side of the House.  They have so many 
<br/>good ideas, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is only a pity that they did not do anything in the last 16 years.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, this side of the House can work with that side of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>House and solve the sugar issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the other thing that is happening is that within FSC, I am aware that 
<br/>there is another review happening by a private sector entity.  Again, they are just looking at FSC 
<br/>operators.  So, between these two reports, I hope that we can get them completed before the end of 
<br/>the year, which you can certainly sit on this side of the House when it goes to Cabinet, we welcome 
<br/>the other side of the House with their ideas because this elephant in the room does not need politics. 
<br/>It needs bold, brave, courageous decisions so that we do not allow us to collapse if the sugar industry 
<br/>collapses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I fully support the findings of the Committee, we do accept that FSC 
<br/>is insolvent, it is in trouble, it needs to be fixed but I can assure the people of Fiji that we are going 
<br/>to fix it.  I hope that the other of the House, given the experience they have had over the last 16 years, 
<br/>will come alongside and work with us so that we ensure that we can, as honourable Ravunawa put it, 
<br/>hand over a better industry to our children in the future.  I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the 
<br/>Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation’s  2020,  2021,  2022  and  2023  Annual 
<br/>Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I want to congratulate the Committee on their work in putting this Report together.   I 
<br/>also want to appreciate the Committee for the report format, especially on how they came up with 
<br/>the  findings  and  the  corresponding  recommendations,  which  makes  this  Report  much  easier  to 
<br/>understand and is meaningful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to address great concerns regarding the sugar industry, 
<br/>especially the persistent issues plaguing FSC.  Despite numerous discussions and reports over the 
<br/>years,  as already been said  by the  colleagues from  the other side and  this  side of Parliament,  we 
<br/>grapple with the same challenges - declining sugar production; deteriorating soil fertility; inactive 
<br/>farmers; low sugar yield due to burnt cane; and poor cane quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the latest FSC Report to the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, the cane 
<br/>production is stagnating significantly below the desired 2.5 million tonnes, with the troubling trend 
<br/>of  declining.    Mills  that  used  to  crush  up  to  1  million  tonnes  of  cane  per  season,  are  currently 
<br/>processing only 0.5 million tonnes.  This data, Madam Deputy Speaker, is not merely numbers, it 
<br/>represents a failing industry, struggling to meet its potentials, and more critically failing those who 
<br/>depend on it for their livelihoods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have heard these issues articulated year after year.  We know 
<br/>the  problem,  we  understand  the  scope  of  the  challenges,  yet  the  question  remains,  where  are  the 
<br/>experts who should address these issues?  Where and which strategies should be revisited and revised 
<br/>when they fail to deliver?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in this day and age of strategic planning and industry advancements, 
<br/>it is incomprehensible that an industry of this magnitude does not have a robust strategic plan or key 
<br/>performance indicators to measure its performance internally, as stated in the Report’s findings in 
<br/>items 2.5 and 2.8.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the situation with the FSC requires more than just financial 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment.    It  demands  a  comprehensive  multi-disciplinary,  multi-stakeholder  and  multi-sectoral 
<br/>approach.  Helping FSC will require an overhaul of the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking  at  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  our  stakeholders  and  their  effectiveness  in 
<br/>contributing  to  the  work,  of  course  FSC,  in  partnership  with  farmers,  is  the  main  driver  of  this 
<br/>industry.  If FSC fails and farmers fail, there will be no sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we must recognise that money alone cannot resolve the decline in 
<br/>cane production.  The Government must not keep pumping money into FSC without addressing the 
<br/>fractures in the sugar industry system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government needs to address several critical areas with an integrated strategy, which include 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase cane production numbers, and incentives are needed to supply farmers in boosting 
<br/>cane production.  This includes revitalising unproductive farming areas and encouraging 
<br/>greater farmer engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Subsidise cane production costs. To make sugar farming viable, Government must find 
<br/>ways  to  reduce  production  costs.    This  could  include  financial  subsidies  or  support 
<br/>mechanisms for farmers which I know is already happening but there is a need to take this 
<br/>to another level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve cane quality – to improve sugar yields FSC must enhance the quality of cane. This 
<br/>will require research, development and implementation of best farming practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Enhance collaboration – issues within the Sugar Industry are not the sole responsibility of 
<br/>the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation.  It  is  imperative  that  all  stakeholders  including  Government 
<br/>agencies, research institutions, including experts, to work together and bring the industry 
<br/>up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Trans-institutional and trans-sectoral approach is crucial in addressing the various factors 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>impacting the industry’s viability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the sugar industry is a significant player in our economy and vital 
<br/>to the livelihood of approximately 3,000 workers and 200,000 individuals who depend on it. The 
<br/>situation  demands  urgent  action  and  re-alignment  of  strategies,  so  it  is  time  for  a  meaningful, 
<br/>impactful measures that go beyond the superficial.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Negative  implications  of  the  sugar  industry  problem  are  huge  and  far-reaching.    If  this 
<br/>industry goes down, we can witness its impacts on other industries and sectors. The sugar industry 
<br/>operates within a web of inter-connected relationships and systems.  We must work together to save 
<br/>FSC and save others and our national economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, the challenge is substantial but not insurmountable.  By fostering collaboration, 
<br/></span><span>revising strategies and focusing on Key Performance Indicators, we can revitalise the sugar industry 
<br/></span><span>and secure its future. Let  us rise to  this challenge and take the decisive steps to  save an industry 
<br/>integral to our economy and the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All those being said, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before the House.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- I noted the various comments and suggestions that have been made and 
<br/>I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions. Of course, most of these inputs 
<br/>will be part of the report that we will be presenting to the FAO Review Team that is currently in the 
<br/>country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to comment on one issue that has been raised by honourable Pillay on the mill.  The 
<br/>team will also be looking at the right size of the mill that has to be established in this country. All the 
<br/>mills that we have are more than 100 years old and we need to get new ideas, integrated mills where 
<br/>you have mills that can produce sugar, ethanol and other products. So, that is the type of mills that 
<br/>we need and, of course, the team that will be in the country will be looking at all of these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also an issue on green sugar raised by honourable Pillay to promote the purchase 
<br/>of green sugar by FSC.  As you are aware, there was a system that was established by the previous 
<br/>government, the Cane Quality Payment System. Perhaps, that was not the way forward as we had 
<br/>already spent $10 million in trying to establish that system but after a while, it was not adopted by 
<br/>FSC for one reason or the other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in the new system, we have to introduce a Cane Quality Payment System whereby 
<br/>those who are producing cane with the utmost quality are the ones that will have to be paid and those 
<br/>who are producing cane of poor quality, their payment will be based on the quality of the cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  thank  honourable  Members  for  their  contributions,  and  I  do  support  the  motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.
