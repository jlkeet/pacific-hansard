<div><span>ADDRESS BY HER EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Speaker,  Ratu  Naiqama  Lalabalavu;  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sitiveni 
<br/>Rabuka;  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Inia  Seruiratu;  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; honourable Ministers; my dear friends; </span><span>Namaskar</span><span>, </span><span>Ni sa bula.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is my great honour to  meet you all, the elected representatives of Fiji, in this temple of 
<br/>democracy.    I  bring  to  you  the  greetings  of  1.4  billion  of  your  brothers  and  sisters  in  the  largest 
<br/>democracy of the world, India. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Speaker for giving me this opportunity. This is a reflection of the close 
<br/>relations between our two countries. I am deeply honoured by the conferment of the Companion of 
<br/>the Order of Fiji this morning by His Excellency the President of Fiji. This honour is a reflection of 
<br/>the deep ties of friendship between our two countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  of  Fiji,  Ratu  Wiliame 
<br/>Katonivere, on whose kind invitation, I arrived yesterday on my first visit to Fiji.  I also have, along 
<br/>with me, our Minister of State, Shri George Kurian, as well as two Parliamentarians from our Lok 
<br/>Sabha, Shri Saumitra Khan and Shri Jugal Kishore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to express my deep appreciation for the strong democratic ethos in Fiji. Each one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of you has a very solemn responsibility of serving the people of this beautiful country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the vast difference in our size, both our countries have much in common, including 
<br/>our vibrant democracies. Almost 10 years ago, speaking in this same hall, the Prime Minister of India, 
<br/>Shri Narendra Modi, had underlined some basic values that unite India and Fiji. These includes, “our 
<br/>democracy,  the  diversity  of  our  societies,  our  creed  that  all  human  beings  are  equal  and  our 
<br/>commitment to the liberty, dignity and rights of every individual”. These shared values are eternal 
<br/>and shall continue to guide us ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to note that India has been closely associated with your democratic journey, over 
<br/>the last three parliamentary elections in Fiji. As a close friend and partner with rich experience of 
<br/>fostering democracy at the grassroots level, India stands ready to partner at all times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members of Parliament, in my short time here, I can see that the rest of the world 
<br/>has so much to learn from Fiji. The gentle Fijian way of life, the deep-rooted respect for traditions 
<br/>and  customs,  an  open  and  multicultural  environment,  makes  Fiji  so  special  in  an  increasingly 
<br/>conflict-ridden  world.  No  wonder,  Fiji  is  the  place  where  the  rest  of  the  world  come  to  find  its 
<br/>happiness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji today is recognized around the world for its growing contribution to our common efforts, 
<br/>focussed on two major global challenges - climate change and addressing human conflicts.  Whether 
<br/>it is shaping the global dialogue on climate change or voicing the concerns of the Ocean-States, Fiji 
<br/></span><span>has  been  contributing  immensely  to  the  global  good.  India  greatly  values  and  applauds  the 
<br/></span><span>increasingly prominent role played by Fiji around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have also made major contributions to global peacekeeping efforts in some of the most 
<br/>dangerous conflict areas around the world. We salute Fiji’s contribution in making the world a better 
<br/>place to live.

<div><span> Address by HE the President of India  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the field of sports, while we may have been recently crowned the T-20 World Champions 
<br/>in Cricket, I must say India has a lot to learn from Fiji in rugby. We are very happy that one of your 
<br/>legendary players, Waisale Serevi, is India’s new National Rugby Coach.  I do look forward to the 
<br/>day when our two teams will play each other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this opportunity to also convey our heartiest congratulations to the Fiji Men’s Rugby 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Team for their wonderful Silver Medal performance in the Paris Olympics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mananye sansad sadasye gan, 145 barso se adhik samay purva, nyati ne hamari dono desho 
<br/>ko ek saath joda jo girmitiyas, paheli baar Bharat se </span><span>Fiji</span><span> dvip ke taor par pahunche the.</span><span>  (I think you 
<br/>understand Hindi).   </span><span>Jitne bhi  unka yaha … jeevan khatro aur  kathinaiyo se bhara tha,  ye jankar 
<br/>khushi hoti hai ki kaese girmitiya aur unko vanshajo ko is desh ne apnaya hai.  Badle mein uhnone 
<br/>apni kadi mehnat aur parishram se apne naye matra-bhumi ke nirmaan men vyapak ypo daan diya.  
<br/>Main Fiji sarkar ko Girmitiya Diwas karyekramo ke dvara, rashtriye nirmaan ke prayasak ke liye 
<br/>girmit vanshaj ke apaar yog daan ko prakash mein lane ke liye dhanyevaad deti hoon.  1970s (unnis 
<br/>sau  sattar)  ke  baad  is  dashak  mein  hamare  dono  desho  ne  milkar  ek  adhunik  aur  bahumulye 
<br/>sanjhedhari taiyaar karne ka prayas kiya hai.  Mujhe ye jaankar prashanta ho rahi hai ki aaj hamare 
<br/>saubhagyeta rashtriye nirmaan ke sabhi pramukh shetro mein, chahe wo </span><span>sugarcane</span><span> ho ya </span><span>space</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaking of Space, I would like to particularly thank the Fijian government for its assistance 
<br/>towards Aditya-L1 Mission, to place the first Space-based solar observatory last year.  Your support 
<br/>in hosting the Temporary Telemetry Tracking and Command Centre in Suva for the historic Mission 
<br/>is greatly appreciated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  co-operation  in  agriculture,  capacity  building,  climate  change,  clean  energy,  digital 
<br/>partnership, education, healthcare, manufacturing, research, renewable energy and the SME sector, 
<br/>continues to grow from strength to strength.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the physical distance between us, we have always had a close bond.  No wonder, in 
<br/>times  of  need,  we  have  been  among  the  first  to  respond.    I  am  glad  to  note  that  the  COVID-19 
<br/>vaccines provided by India in 2021 under the Vaccine Maitri initiative played a key role in Fiji’s 
<br/>successful National Vaccination Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we celebrate the 75 years of India’s diplomatic presence in Fiji, I am pleased to see the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strong growth in our high level engagements, development projects and our people-centric activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am told that in the last 18 months alone, 15 Ministerial level visits have taken place on both 
<br/>the  sides.    The  historic  meeting  of  both  our  Prime  Ministers  in  May  2023,  during  the  FIPIC-III 
<br/>Summit has given new energy and direction to our bilateral ties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am confident that the newly announced projects, including the Super Speciality Cardiology 
<br/>Hospital to be established in Suva, would help to meet the priority needs of the people of Fiji and the 
<br/>wider Pacific region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our joint hosting of the highly successful 12th World Hindi Conference last year in Nadi and 
<br/></span><span>the high level participation in the Girmit Day National Celebrations, have further helped strengthen 
<br/></span><span>the strong bond between our two nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members of Parliament, we are also conscious of the many serious challenges 
<br/>common to us. The foremost one being the fight against climate change and rise in sea level, which 
<br/>is a threat to many Ocean States.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Address by HE the President of India 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1441 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a large developing country, frequently exposed to the uncertainties of nature, India also 
<br/>knows very well the deep impact of climate change.  That is why we are committed to doing our best 
<br/>as a responsible member of the world.  Under our G20 Presidency last year, we have high priority to 
<br/>the two topics of sustainable development and climate change.  We made, “One Earth, One Family, 
<br/>One Future”, the theme of our G20 Presidency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>India  has  considerably  reduced  its  emission  intensity  and  has  also  achieved  40  percent  of 
<br/>installed electric capacity through non-fossil fuel sources.  Between 2017 and 2023, India has added 
<br/>around 100 gigawatts of installed electric capacity of which, around 80 percent is from non-fossil 
<br/>fuel-based resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to these domestic steps, India has also taken the lead on a number of international 
<br/>platforms for climate action. We sincerely appreciate Fiji for its enthusiastic support to many of these 
<br/>initiatives,  including  International  Solar  Alliance  (ISA),  Coalition  for  Disaster  Resilient 
<br/>Infrastructure (CDRI) and Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS).  We hope Fiji will soon 
<br/>formally join the Global Biofuel Alliance as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a powerful voice of the Global South, India will keep pushing the developed countries for 
<br/>both, climate finance and climate technology. We will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 
<br/>Fiji and other Ocean States for climate justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members of Parliament, as India emerges strongly on the global stage, we stand 
<br/>ready  to  partner  with  Fiji,  according  to  your  priorities,  to  build  a  stronger,  resilient,  and  more 
<br/>prosperous nation. Let us come together to unlock the full potential in our partnership for the mutual 
<br/>benefit of people of both our beloved countries.  Thank you, </span><span>dhanyavaad, vinaka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Your Excellency the President of India, Shri Mati Droupadi Murmu, thank 
<br/>you for your most insightful Address to the Parliament of Fiji.  Your visit today has, indeed, reminded 
<br/>us of the history that binds us, as well as our common goal to prosper our nations through respecting 
<br/>the democratic process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to express my gratitude to the Government of India for its commitment to 
<br/>constructing the 100-bed super speciality hospital that you have just alluded to.  This facility will not 
<br/>only benefit us, as you have indicated Madam, but also the entire Pacific region.  Additionally, we 
<br/>are grateful to India for being one of the first countries to provide us with vaccines during the COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic. This support was critical for the re-opening of Fiji after the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam, we wish you well in the remainder of your visit in Fiji.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  now  suspend  proceedings  for  an  official 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>photo session with Her Excellency the President of India at the Parliamentary entrance.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament escorts Her Excellency the President 
<br/></span><span>of India out of the Parliament Chambers] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The House is in suspension now.  May I ask that we give a bit more time to the Secretariat 
<br/>staff to prepare for the photoshoot at the Parliamentary entrance by placing seven chairs in the front, 
<br/>and hopefully, all of us will be upstanding on the side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 11.46 a.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 12.26 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure to raise 
<br/>his question, may I seek your forbearance, honourable Members, as I shall be asking the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Speaker to preside over this session till the end of the day since I have an appointment with 
<br/>some doctors.  I hope you will bear with me on that, honourable Members.
