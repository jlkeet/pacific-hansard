<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Council 2019–2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to present the overview of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar Cane Growers Council’s 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on the 
<br/>Sugar  Cane  Growers  Council’s  2019,  2020  and  2021 Annual  Reports  on  12</span><span>th</span><span>  July,  2024.    The 
<br/>Committee is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar Industry for submitting the responses to 
<br/>the Committee’s tabled Consolidated Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Council’s 2019-
<br/>2021 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Cane Growers Council’s reporting period stated that growers recorded a notable 
<br/>18 percent decline in cane production, compared to the 2020 season. One of the major contributing 
<br/>factors was due to the massive destruction of </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> in 2020.  The reporting period in 2019 noted 
<br/>that there were 16,631 registered cane growers with only 11,902 active cane growers. This slightly 
<br/>increased in 2020, recording a total number of 16,843 registered growers in the country with 1,875 
<br/>cane harvesting gangs.  Whilst there were 16,684 registered cane growers in 2021, close to 11,622 
<br/>growers  actively  grew  cane  individually  and  run  small  to  medium  cane  farms,  with  a  majority 
<br/>producing less than 200 tonnes per year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is concerned with the slight growth of cane growers over the period and that 
<br/>80 percent of the registered farmers produce less than 200 tonnes of cane per year, which is only 20 
<br/>percent of the total cane production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  with  concern  the  lack  of  clear  KPIs  relating  to  the  objectives  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>functions of the Council against which the Council’s performance can be adequately monitored. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  our  visit  to  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Council’s  Office,  the  Committee  found  deep 
<br/>levels of mistrust amongst the farmers, as well as perceived miscommunication with iTLTB. While 
<br/>the Board assured the farmers of their commitment towards supporting the sugar industry through 
<br/>lease renewals, it was apparent that farmers remained skeptical. The Sugar Cane Growers Council 
<br/>should play a vital role in building trust in this relationship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee highlighted KPIs and urged the Sugar Cane Growers Council to develop new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>KPIs for new income streams that will enhance the economic viability of the sugar industry.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, the Committee recommended that there needs to be a greater integration of new 
<br/>technologies, interventions of specific policies, new farming methods, combined with the traditional 
<br/>knowledge of farmers.  New incentives and training  needs to  be held  by  the  Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/>Council to improve productivity that requires to reverse the declining sugarcane crop production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also recommended that the Sugar Cane Growers Council should also work in

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1451 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>building trust with all the sugar-related stakeholders, to allow serious integrated approach at all levels 
<br/>in ensuring continuous economic growth at a large scale in the sugar industry.  Therefore, it is vital 
<br/>to identify important policy and practical measures to reform the sugar industry in Fiji  and boost 
<br/>farmers’ confidence and motivation as critical ingredients for increasing sugarcane crop production 
<br/>yield and performance to continue in the sugarcane farming business. Thank you, Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for the debate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the motion.  I have a list of speakers, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S.T. Koroilavesau; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Ravunawa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  rise  to  address  the  findings  of  the 
<br/>Consolidated  Review  Report  n  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Council’s  2019,  2020  and  2021  Annual 
<br/>Reports which was tabled on 12th July, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have carefully reviewed the Reports and acknowledged the critical areas highlighted by 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, and I thank the Committee for its attention to detail 
<br/>in examining the Annual Reports of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  highlighted  in  the  2021  Annual  Report,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  sugar  industry 
<br/>endured a significant setback with an 18 percent decline in cane production, compared to the 2020 
<br/>season.    This  unfortunate  reduction  was  a  direct  consequence  of  the  unprecedented  devastation 
<br/>brought about by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> in 2020. The industry has also seen continuous decline in the number of 
<br/>active cane farmers which was attributed to the aging farmer population and the financial hurdles 
<br/>they face.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is proactively engaging in measures to attract young farmers into the sector. Our 
<br/>initiatives include promoting farm sharing agreements through the SCGC, new farmer programme 
<br/>and lease premium assistance programme and the promotion inter-cropping. Furthermore, Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, we are championing farm mechanisation to boost the efficiency in the yield, given 
<br/>the massive labour shortage in the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report highlights a concerning mistrust amongst the farmers, particularly regarding lease 
<br/>renewals. The Ministry is absolutely committed to re-building this trust.  We are working closely 
<br/>with  the  SCGC,  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund  (SCGF)  and  the  iTLTB,  to  ensure  that  all 
<br/>communications are transparent, accurate and timely. Our goal is to bring about a harmonious and 
<br/>co-operative relations between all stakeholders in the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  alignment  with  our  national  global  commitments,  we  acknowledge  the  importance  of 
<br/>integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the Council’s reporting framework.  We are 
<br/>particularly focused that the SDGs, Madam Deputy Speaker, will emphasise the gender equality. The 
<br/></span><span>Ministry pledges to ensure that future reports capture this essential elements, reflecting the dedication 
<br/></span><span>to promoting an inclusive and equitable industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  remains  steadfast  with  its 
<br/>objective to overcome the challenges faced by the sugar industry. We are committed to implementing 
<br/>strategic  measures  that  will  secure  better  a  future  for  our  farmers  and  the  industry  at  large.    Our 
<br/>collective efforts are aimed at ensuring the sustainable growth and success of Fiji’s sugar sector,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is a cornerstone of our nation’s economy and heritage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  extend  my  gratitude  to  the  Committee  Members  for  their  contribution  and  deliberation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on those remarks, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a Member of the Committee 
<br/>so  I  will  basically  be  talking  on  the  discussions  and  interventions  that  we  carried  out  during  our 
<br/>meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  historically,  the  sugar  industry  and  its  activities  has  shaped  the 
<br/>development of Fiji’s economy over decades.  However, the Committee is concerned that in the past 
<br/>15 years, cane production has been declining.  The Committee strongly feels that the sugar industry’s 
<br/>existence needs to be relooked at and a close monitoring system to be put in place to identify the 
<br/>production progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, therefore, it is vital that we identify important policies and practical 
<br/>measures to reform the sugar industry in Fiji and boost farmers’ confidence in the motivation and 
<br/>critical ingredients for increasing sugarcane crop cultivation, production, yield, and for farmers to 
<br/>continue in sugarcane farming as a business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) has the mandate to protect 
<br/>and  promote  the  livelihood  of  the  growers  through  innovative  measures,  focussing  mainly  on 
<br/>growers’ welfare, timely redress to grower grievances, negotiations, and support towards increasing 
<br/>farm yield and subsidising cost of production and advocacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee began its review in May 2024.  The review process 
<br/>adopted by the Committee was agreed upon through a consensus by the Members to review of the 
<br/>Report and a summary to be submitted as a follow-up.  At the end of the review, the Committee made 
<br/>recommendations based on the discussions with stakeholders on the Annual Report’s contents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, the issues surrounding  the sugar industry is  quite vast  and wide.  
<br/>What we had intended to do was identifying the critical areas that we can highlight in this Report and 
<br/>the Ministry of Sugar can then carry on and make changes in accordance with the findings that we 
<br/>have made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We identified that the 10-acre land that has been allocated to farmers during the colonial days 
<br/>is  not  substantial  enough  to  produce  cane  and  give  returns  to  the  farmers.    There  is  a  need  to 
<br/>consolidate these, regroup the small acreage into bigger farms so that there is a greater economic 
<br/>means to produce sugarcane that will give the benefit to the farmers for their livelihood and looking 
<br/>after their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  our  visit,  we  found  a  deep  level  of  mistrust  among  farmers,  as  well  as 
<br/>miscommunication with iTLTB.  I was quite concerned about this because within the sugar industry 
<br/>discussion, it seems that the iTLTB is always blamed for the non-continuation of sugarcane leases or 
<br/>the reduction of acreage.  In fact, when the CEO of iTLTB came and we had a general discussion, he 
<br/></span><span>was very forthcoming. He understood that to be able to bring the sugar industry back, there has to be 
<br/></span><span>an increase in sugarcane production.  He has suggested that there is a huge amount of land that is 
<br/>available in their pool that can be allocated for sugarcane farming.  So, we really need to look into 
<br/>the issues concerning the leases and then come up with some ideas of making use of these land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  other  issues,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  is  the  actual  involvement  of  traditional 
<br/>landowners for cane farming.  We have found that in Nasarayawa in Vanua Levu.  They have a new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1453 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>system where the actual landowners are farming, and it was very successful.  In fact, they are one of 
<br/>the major producers of cane to Labasa Sugar Mill.  We asked them about intercropping, they had 
<br/>carried out intercropping, but basically there was no market, so they had to leave that intercropping 
<br/>scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the need for greater integration of new technologies is something 
<br/>that has to be emphasised.  I understand that the honourable Minister has been to India where they 
<br/>had discussed about the railway system and the positives of re-inventing the railway system because 
<br/>of its emphasis to the infrastructure, and he has highlighted that he is looking at that matter, and I 
<br/>appreciate the comments that he has made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we need to have new initiatives and training, led by the SCGC.  In 
<br/>our visit both, in the Western Division and in Labasa, it seems to imply that the cane growers are 
<br/>isolated and not well connected to the agencies that are involved in the production of sugarcane and 
<br/>the milling of cane to produce sugar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need specific policies and interventions to be introduced to urgently boost farmer morale 
<br/>and confidence in the industry for growers to increase crop production.  All efforts must be directed 
<br/>in ensuring that farmers produce more than 300 tonnes to remain in the industry.  Those farmers who 
<br/>are providing less than 300 tonnes, need to be supported by the Ministry of Agriculture through their 
<br/>alternative livelihood programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I think honourable Kiran, being with FRIENDS, had indicated about 
<br/>mixed cropping.  She is looking at me suspiciously.  We had brought in the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>and sat together in one of the meeting rooms and told them - the Permanent Secretary for Agriculture 
<br/>and the Permanent Secretary for the Sugar Industry, so they have developed a huge increase in the 
<br/>production of mixed crops within their sugarcane farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are going in the right direction, but for small farmers, it is very important for intercropping 
<br/>so that the earnings they get from the other crops, will provide them substantial income during the 
<br/>offseason.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.  That is all I can contribute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me thank the Committee 
<br/>for their Report on the consolidated review of the Sugar Cane Growers Council  (SCGC) from 2019 
<br/>to 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noted also some of the recommendations they have made.  Honourable Koroilavesau 
<br/>had alluded to some of the most significant ones and the honourable Minister also mentioned a few.  
<br/>What I would like to say though is that, if you look at this Report, Madam Deputy Speaker, and if 
<br/>you look at their reports on the SCGC of the previous years and in the previous Parliament, you will 
<br/>find similarities in the recommendations that the Committees have made, which means that these 
<br/>issues that they have highlighted in the recommendations that they have made are not new in this 
<br/>House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It seems that there has been a whole lot of debate about it.  I think we all agree that sugarcane 
<br/>will continue to play a significant part in our development as a nation into the future. I know there is 
<br/>a lot of sugarcane farmers in this House too. They are sugarcane farmers because they realise how 
<br/>important it is, not only to Fiji but to their families as well, and how it is important to the growers on 
<br/>whose report we are talking about.  But the discussions has always been in comparing stakeholders, 
<br/>like the SCGC representing the farmers, the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) representing the processers 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1454 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and, of course, Government on one party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amidst all these recommendations, they are really all good. I would like to add on to another, 
<br/>maybe its high time that, apart from subsidising the industry and looking at value adding, we should 
<br/>also seriously look at some other alternative crops that could grow well in this field.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During one of my trips, I was looking at this fruit called durian.  It grows well in the Tropics.  
<br/>It earns a lot of money for Malaysia and Thailand.  This is a really good substitute, but there are many 
<br/>others as well.  The honourable Kamikamica is looking at me. He had talked about macadamia nuts 
<br/>and a whole range of other things, something that will not only entice the farmers.  But given also 
<br/>the recommendations of the Committee and finding alternative living out of these things, we could 
<br/>also really make it into a produce that people can grow, and we can export at the end of the day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, that is the one thing I would like to add.  It takes political will, and I hope that in 
<br/>whatever direction the sugar industry is going in Fiji, that we will be bold enough to make these 
<br/>tough decisions on behalf of our community, especially for our economy and our people, and the 
<br/>future of this industry as a whole. So, continue to look at it but also look at other avenues that would 
<br/>benefit us into the future.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to add my voice to this crucial 
<br/>debate, a debate that centres on the livelihood of our farmers, the health of our economy  and the 
<br/>legacy that we want to leave as stewards of this great nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  express  my  sincere  gratitude  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  for  their 
<br/>diligent study of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) Annual Reports from 2019 to 2021 and 
<br/>also their sensible recommendations.  Yet, Madam Deputy Speaker, I stand here as an Opposition 
<br/>Member, tasked with the role of providing checks and balances. It is my duty to say that while the 
<br/>Committee’s recommendations are commendable and bipartisan in nature, that alone is not enough - 
<br/>we must do more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed integration of new technologies and farming methods in the agriculture sector 
<br/>is a vital step but let us also be reminded that while we champion progress, it is the wisdom of our 
<br/>traditional farming knowledge that forms our roots, so let us not abandon them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the previous speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, we, indeed, need a new policy 
<br/>intervention to boost the farmers’ morale – it is a non-negotiable first step in transforming our sugar 
<br/>industry.    Therefore,  I  urge  the  Government  to  ensure  that  there  is  transparent  and  effective 
<br/>communication  between  all  stakeholders,  to  ensure  the  successful  implementation  of  the 
<br/>diversification strategies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SCGC was established in accordance with the Sugar Industry Act 1984 with the specific 
<br/>function to protect and further the interests of registered cane growers, grow their farming yield and 
<br/>also look after the welfare of their families.  I urge the Government not to see farmers merely as 
<br/>producers or statistics, but as the backbone of our economy as well.  So, farmers’ welfare should be 
<br/>a matter of national priority, not an industrial concern and definitely not merely used as a political 
<br/></span><span>football.  That must stop, Madam Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recommendation  for  farmers  producing  less  than  300  tonnes  to  be  supported  through 
<br/>alternative  livelihood  programmes  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  a  valuable  suggestion. 
<br/>However, let us go a step further to provide our farmers with an array of support, be it financial, 
<br/>educational or infrastructural.  We must invest in them as our future depends on it. Farmers are the 
<br/>backbone of this country, and we must ensure that they have the utmost confidence in their work and

<div><span>  Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1455 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>its outcome. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While I fully endorse the pursuit of research and development, let us not lose sight of the 
<br/>critical factors, such as soil health and environmental resilience.  These are not just nice-to-have, but 
<br/>they  are  the  bedrock  of  our  agricultural  survival.    Furthermore,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the 
<br/>importance of research and development cannot be overstated, particularly in improving productivity, 
<br/>enhance  soil  fertility  and  promoting  climate  resilience.  The  measure  that  the  Committee 
<br/>recommended in this regard are essential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recognising the need for restructuring the governance of the SCGC, I must also underline 
<br/>the necessity of accountability.  A change in structure means little, if not merit with accountability 
<br/>and transparency principle, Madam Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  encouraging  collaboration  between  the  Council  and  other  sugar 
<br/>entities is crucial for sharing knowledge.  I encourage the Council to work together with other sugar 
<br/>entities, to ensure that the growers receive correct and effective information on farming skills and 
<br/>farming methods to boost productivity.  The urgency here should lie in fostering a vibrant ecosystem 
<br/>where every grower feels nurtured, informed and are valued. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, each recommendation speaks to key transformational need that is 
<br/>needed  in  the  sugar  industry,  from  overhauling  governance  structures  to  instilling  the  growers’ 
<br/>confidence.  If followed prudently and coupled with a few additional steps, we can turn our beloved 
<br/>sugar industry into a powerhouse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reform  is  a  must  for  our  sugar  industry.  The  Committee’s  recommendation  to  identify 
<br/>necessary policy and practical measures to boost farmers’ confidence and motivation is the step in 
<br/>the  right  direction.    These  are  the  vehicles  to  propel  us  forward  towards  increased  sugarcane 
<br/>production and the farmer’s yield.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  spirit  of  collaboration,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  further  urged  that  sugar 
<br/>stakeholders develop key KPIs.  The new income streams will enhance the economic viability of the 
<br/>sugar sector and to move forward with an auditor change, to ensure independence, objectivity and 
<br/>maintenance of a robust financial control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, words are not enough, Madam Deputy Speaker.  The Government must critically 
<br/>examine these suggestions and  act  on them urgently. We owe it to the sugarcane  farmers,  to  our 
<br/>fellow citizens and the generation that will inherit either the fruits  or  failures of our actions here 
<br/>today.   The stakes are high, and the time is now. Let us act decisively. The future of one of Fiji’s 
<br/>cornerstone industry is now hanging in the balance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I take note of the various contributions that 
<br/>have been made by honourable Members and I would like to thank them for their contributions.  Of 
<br/>course, some of those issues that have been raised will be covered in the other reports that we will be 
<br/></span><span>covering in the next two days or so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  has  raised  that  a  team  from  FAO  is  currently  in  the  country 
<br/>undertaking a review of all the issues we have raised. What we will be doing is an overall review of 
<br/>the industry, as well as looking at all the institutions that are linked to the industry, whether there is 
<br/>a need to have those institutions or there is a need to look at the restructure of the industry to ensure 
<br/>that it is sustainable in the long term.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We agree that there needs to be a sugar industry, the industry has to be there, but in what size 
<br/>and what form it has to take, that has to be decided by the Report.  Of course, as has being raised by 
<br/>the other side of the House and also this side, it needs a political will from our side.  We have to take 
<br/>the hard decision to ensure that we continue with the industry, sustaining the livelihood of our people 
<br/>and, at the same time, providing income and growth to the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not have any other comments, but I would like to thank the honourable Members for their
