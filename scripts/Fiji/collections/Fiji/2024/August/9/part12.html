<div><span>Assistance to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
<br/>(Question No. 149/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament on the 
<br/></span><span>types of assistance the Ministry can provide to the public to assist in the prevention of cruelty 
<br/></span><span>to animals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  animal  ownership  comes  with  responsibility,  practised  with  the  five 
<br/>principles of animal freedom.  This was developed in 1965 by the World Organisation for Animal 
<br/>Health (WOAH) and widely recognised.  The five Freedoms described society’s expectations for the 
<br/>conditions animals should experience when under human control, namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Freedom from hunger, malnutrition and thirst;  
<br/>Freedom from fear and distress; 
<br/>Freedom from heat stress or physical discomfort; 
<br/>Freedom from pain, injury and disease; and 
<br/>Freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is rather unfortunate to observe that as a result of owner’s negligence, 
<br/>animals  are  vulnerable  to  mistreatment  by  the  public  and  often  results  in  animal  straying  on  to 
<br/>plantations,  causing  damages  to  crops,  as  well  as  getting  involved  in  vehicle  accidents  on  the 
<br/>highway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Protection of Animals Act 1954 requires a comprehensive review due 
<br/>to its outdated provisions.  For example, the minimum fine for offenders is set at $10.  Additionally, 
<br/>it is important to note that Fiji currently lacks an Animal Welfare Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry advocates responsible animal ownership by raising awareness, 
<br/>ensuring animal identification through licensing, or branding and ear tagging, as well as installing 
<br/>fencing and providing sufficient feed, water and nutrition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure the safety of the public, a programme to capture stray animals is currently underway 
<br/>by the Ministry to manage stray animals, primarily, addressing those that pose a threat to agricultural 
<br/>land, roadways and human safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry works closely and supports the Society for the Prevention of 
<br/>Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) with financial grants to handle cases that are reported to them and are 
<br/>mostly targeted at pets. These are for the treatment of sick and injured dogs and cats, as well to desex 
<br/>them, to control the population of strays. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, I would like to thank honourable Naupoto 
<br/>for raising this question.  We have SPCA, we have the Greater Good Animal Sanctuary, and we have 
<br/>another one in Nadi as well, the Animal Fiji, and they have gone around and done a lot of spay and 
<br/>neuter programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  seen  the  budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  stray  animal  campaign  has  an  increase 
<br/>allocation from $430,000 to $530,000.  Could the honourable Minister inform Parliament, and I am 
<br/>sure a lot of people are listening too, but I agree with the honourable Minister that the cruelty begins 
<br/>from  those pet  owners  when the pets  are babies, they give the babies out,  I mean, the babies are 
<br/>thrown in the rubbish dump, which has been some of the cases.  The cruelty begins from there and it 
<br/>comes down to authorities and authorities get blamed for this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, with that new allocation, can the honourable Minister highlight in Parliament on some of 
<br/></span><span>the initiatives or partnerships with these organisations in going forward to prevent cruelty to animals, 
<br/>especially stray animals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- This has been a very long and outstanding issue because most of the farmers 
<br/>out  there in  the rural  areas, they have now gone  to  the extent of buying  fences to  fence off their 
<br/>vegetable gardens, et cetera, from  stray animals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1627 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  of  those  stray  animals  started  off  as  pets  but  slowly,  they  become  a  nuisance  to  the 
<br/>people, especially in the rural areas. That is why the Government has set aside funds for them to 
<br/>shoot down all these animals. Either, they are taken to an animal pound, I hope you understand a 
<br/>pound because you come from the rural area. They put them there until the owner goes there and 
<br/>claims the animals and they have to pay a certain kind of fee to get their animals out.  So, I have 
<br/>allowed  your  supplementary  question  to  go,  but  let  us  hear  from  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of stray animals, like you have said, 
<br/>has been a longstanding one. Sometimes, I personally feel sorry for the farmers, especially livestock 
<br/>farmers, because when there is a dog attack, they lose hundreds of animals - goats, sheep or cattle.  
<br/>So, for a livestock farmer, that has been a lifetime achievement to get those numbers up to that level 
<br/>and for a few stray dogs to just to come in, attack the flock and then kill those many numbers, it is 
<br/>quite disheartening, to say the least.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question here is,  which one is  more  important,  to  protect  the stray dog or protect  the 
<br/>livestock farmers who contribute to the livelihood of this country?  The gist of the whole matter is 
<br/>that, when you own an animal, learn to be a responsible owner. That is the gist of the matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          What I have stated in my earlier answer, feed your animal, look after them because they are 
<br/>just like you.  We are all part of the animal kingdom, anyway.  When you do not look after them, 
<br/>they will go somewhere else, they will start hunting for their own food, after all, that is what they 
<br/>were made out to be, especially dogs.  So, do not get me wrong, dogs are very, very smart animals.  
<br/>We have placed cages and we have observed how dogs react to cages.  One will walk and lift up the 
<br/>back, the other one will go, bite the bait, get it out and then the big one comes up. They are very 
<br/>smart.    And  when  they  go  in  packs,  that  is  the  most  dangerous  one  because  they  will  go  into  a 
<br/>livestock farm, they will find a real nice place to observe the movement of the animals and the owners 
<br/>of the animals, then when everything is set, they will attack. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what we, in the Ministry of Agriculture, especially livestock officers go through. So I 
<br/>take my hats off to them for operating within very challenging  circumstances. Then there are the 
<br/>Acts. Most of them are archaic, and the Pound Act is one of them. We are working on the review of 
<br/>the Pounds Act and like many other Acts that contribute to the control of stray animals, we need to 
<br/>review them as fast as possible so that, at least, it can cover our backs when it comes to the stray 
<br/>animals’ issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then you have the pet lovers, animals’ rights, and I know they love their animals but at the 
<br/>end of the day, when stray animals start attacking livestock, that is when we do not see eye to eye.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I still want to elaborate more because this is honourable Naupoto’s passion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- stray animals in the urban areas.  However, out in the rural, it is a different thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are trying to encourage sheep farming, especially in Taveuni, but the problem is stray 
<br/>dogs.  Dogs are smart animals, and they operate, just like they had been taught, and that is through 
<br/>their dire need of food.  They kill the sheep, drink the blood and leave the carcass out there.  So it 
<br/></span><span>becomes a very horrific kind of way to finding food because they only drink the blood and leave the 
<br/></span><span>carcass out there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in the beef farming in Yaqara, the dogs are smart.  They know how to lead the animals 
<br/>down a steep cliff for them to fall and they pick the animal down from the bottom of the cliff.   I 
<br/>think this is the umpteenth time that you have raised this in the House, honourable Naupoto, but I 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just ask you to liaise with the relevant bodies out there  - SPCA, just to ensure that that particular 
<br/>animal that you want to be looked after is taken care of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir , if I can just ask a very quick supplementary and a 
<br/>plea; he mentioned that Fiji lacks an Animal Welfare Act, and if there is no plan to bring in that Act 
<br/>right now, I plead with the Government if you can work on an Animal Welfare Act and bring it to 
<br/>this House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, so let us leave it at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  one  question.    Given  the  responses  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture, I am wondering, is it then the Government’s position if we have 
<br/>stray animals, we should just eradicate them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- May be, if you become Minister for Agriculture someday, but 
<br/>not under my watch.  We will have to consider the animal welfare societies.  Even one time when I 
<br/>was interviewed, then out of frustration I said, “Shoot”, but that was after receiving complaints after 
<br/>complaints.  But really, we have to consider the animal welfare societies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MOU Between Fiji and International Peace Institute 
<br/>(Question No. 150/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Fiji and the 
<br/>International Peace Institute? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  I thank the honourable Vakalalabure for his question. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, Cabinet, on 15th July of this year, approved the execution of the Memorandum of Understanding 
<br/>(MOU) between the Government of Fiji, through the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, 
<br/>and International Peace Institute (IPI). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  MOU  focuses  on  building  Government  capacity  and  strengthening  its  institutional 
<br/>arrangements,  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  capacity  to  effectively  engage  in  international  climate 
<br/>change negotiations through trainings and workshops facilitated by the International Peace Institute 
<br/>in preparation for the 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) in Baku, Azerbaijan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  had  implored  us  to  do  this  week  and  to  be 
<br/>prepared  well  for  the  COP29,  I  hope  he  is  preparing  well,  because  he  will  again  be  part  of  the 
<br/>delegation or he may delegate someone to go on his behalf.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU is intended to focus on several areas of cooperation and capacity building through 
<br/></span><span>stakeholder meetings and negotiations training, including climate actions, climate change advocacy 
<br/>and communications, negotiations related to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
<br/>Change (UNFCCC), organisation support and participation in mission aligns climate action meetings 
<br/>and events, development of select communication documents and activities, provision of advice on 
<br/>ways to strengthen the response of the multilateral system to the climate emergency and institutional 
<br/>strengthening support and capacity building.

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1629 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some may ask, why IPI? Mr. Speaker, Sir, IPI has a track record in supporting Small Islands 
<br/>Developing States directly in negotiations and enable further potential to lead key elements of the 
<br/>process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPI and its academic partner - University of Pennsylvania, were involved 
<br/>supporting the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in our efforts to establish a new fund, and 
<br/>funding arrangements for Loss and Damage. One of our Ambassadors stationed in Jakarta now is 
<br/>instrumental in the formulation also for the promotion of the Loss and Damage funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a non-profit think tank closely associated with the United Nations and focus on addressing 
<br/>most pressing issues affecting international peace and security, advising both, member States and 
<br/>UN Secretariat of policy issues, and in a non-partisan way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, through the IPI, we were able to leverage our leadership and representation in climate 
<br/>international forums, for instance, Fiji was appointed Co-Chair of G-77 and China Group for Global 
<br/>Goal  on  Adaptation,  negotiate  and  track  at  COP  27,  Fiji  is  also  the  AOSIS  representative  on  the 
<br/>Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The relevance of the MOU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the continued increase in migration and 
<br/>skills shortages, the onus should always be on Government to continue training and upskilling our 
<br/>workforce.    It  is  imperative  for  the  Government  to  explore  and  consider  such  partnerships  and 
<br/>opportunities to continuously strengthen institutional knowledge and capacity of our civil servants. 
<br/>This  partnership  with  IPI  will  offer  additional  support  in  enhancing  the  knowledge,  skills  and 
<br/>capacities of our civil servants, who will represent Fiji as negotiators to extend their engagements, as 
<br/>the complexity of climate change negotiations continue to grow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a regional and global leader in addressing climate change, there is a need 
<br/>for a strengthened delegation that can meaningfully participate and engage in the negotiations process 
<br/>as well as promote national initiatives and the unified Pacific position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOU will be signed on behalf of the Fiji Government by the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change next month, September 2024. The 
<br/>MOU between Government and IPI is mutually beneficial to both parties.  Following the signing, the 
<br/>IPI will commence its work as per the MOU in assisting the Ministry of Environment and Climate 
<br/>Change. The main focus after the signing in September will be to prepare our technical negotiators 
<br/>through inter-agency collaboration in the lead up to COP29. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, up to three fully funded IPI representatives will be able to join Fiji COPs 
<br/>delegation to provide flexible support to Fiji’s climate change negotiators under guidance from the 
<br/>Ministry of Environment and Climate Change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs a strong delegation to continue building momentum 
<br/>as the regional and international leader in our effort to manage the inequality and the multitude of 
<br/>threats posed by climate change, not only to Fiji but to the Small Island States in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this MOU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government stands to benefit from an arrangement 
<br/></span><span>and relationships that has been beneficial to many governments before us, and we aim to use that 
<br/>collaboration to further advance a strong and unified Pacific voice and position at the COP29.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a supplementary question to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister. Thank you indeed, honourable Prime Minister for the MOU with International Peace 
<br/>Institute.  I understand that the IPI has been in existence since 1970. Unfortunately, they are still in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New York rather than moving  out  into the region  and that will be my  question, Sir.  If there are 
<br/>considerations for asking IPI the possibility of perhaps moving into the region either Caribbean or 
<br/>even here in the Pacific because of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) issues in as far as 
<br/>climate change is concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for that 
<br/>question.  As one who was there from the beginning of the discussions and negotiations, I believe he 
<br/>will  be  in  a  very  good  position  come  next  COP  to  be  Head  Negotiator  in  the  move  in  trying  to 
<br/>convince  them  of  the  need  to  shift  their  headquarters  from  where  they  are  into  one  of  the  areas 
<br/>covered by AOSIS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for  his  response  to  that  particular  question  and  highlighting  the  work  of  the  International  Peace 
<br/>Institute and the training of the people that negotiate at these treaties because what they negotiate, 
<br/>that ultimately will have an impact on us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am just looking at the website for the  IPI, I also noticed that they do a lot 
<br/>events and research. I am just wondering also, is that part of the understanding to try to get events 
<br/>organised by them and research that relate particularly to our climate challenges here to be conducted 
<br/>by Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  only  assume  that  they  are  part  of  the 
<br/>formulation of those events that take part around the COP Conference. This year, it is going to be a 
<br/>lot on funding so the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance will be heading 
<br/>the Fiji delegation with the support of the honourable Leader of the Opposition and those that we feel 
<br/>will be able to actively participate in those negotiations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plans to Regularise Turmeric Prices 
<br/>(Question No. 151/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on plans to regularise 
<br/>the turmeric prices so that it can be a viable commodity for the local communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will probably use it as an opportunity to 
<br/>shed the House some light on where Government decided in terms of potential  in the agricultural 
<br/>sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Firstly, Sir, the turmeric is emerging as a significant export for the country, according to the 
<br/>Bureau  of  Statistics  provisional  data.    Fiji  exports  to  United  States  of  America,  New  Zealand, 
<br/>Australia, Canada, Singapore and Tuvalu. In 2023, was around $24.8 million with an export value in 
<br/>terms of volume of 3, 216 tonnes. In 2022, it was $21.6 million with about 2,500 tonnes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  COVID-19,  this  export  was  somewhat  quiet  and  I  believe  during  COVID-19,  the 
<br/></span><span>turmeric emerged as somewhat of a lifesaver for the agricultural sector and was being exported to 
<br/>the US in quite significant volumes. The Ministry of Trade has a bit a theory in terms of agriculture, 
<br/>if we can identify 10 exports that generate about $100 million in terms of export a year, that is a 
<br/>billion dollars in terms of opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turmeric is certainly one of those products that has that opportunity. To the question that was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1631 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>raised by the honourable Tuicolo, it is a good question, Mr. Speaker, and talks to a great question 
<br/>about how we support a non-sugar industry. Right now, the challenge with the farmers is that the 
<br/>price fluctuates.  In terms of trying to maintain a living, ensuring that you get the right level of income 
<br/>from your effort, that has been a challenge with turmeric and some other product as well, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  budgetary  allocations,  I  know  there  are  some  allocations  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture for turmeric, Sir, but nothing to regularise pricing.  I am sure the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Finance will agree, going forward, it is perhaps something that the Government will need to consider, 
<br/>if we are to expand other sectors in the economy.  Sugar does get assistance in terms of pricing, and 
<br/>it  is  only  fair  that  the  other  products  particularly  products  with  good  potential  get  some  level  of 
<br/>support as well, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Certainly, in terms of the Ministry of Trade, Sir, it is definitely on the radar as one of the top 
<br/>ten products that we are trying to sort of push.  Of course, at the moment turmeric is grown wild and 
<br/>so  there  is  a  marketing  around  organic  turmeric  which  is  quite  attractive,  but  there  needs  to  be 
<br/>consideration around developing farms as well going forwards, Sir, so that we try and reach a greater 
<br/>target, say we go for $50 million and then go beyond that it terms of export potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S  KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Minister the turmeric industry as you rightfully 
<br/>pointed out is actually quite a substantial industry around the world, I think it is about  AU$75  a 
<br/>kilogramme with respect to organic turmeric. My question is, if you are going to undertake this price 
<br/>issue that is being spoken about, will it be a comprehensive study done because there is a difference 
<br/>between the organic turmeric and also just the normal turmeric, and the export market into the US 
<br/>and Australia is  actually  quite huge.  With respect  to  organic status,  we do have a Fijian organic 
<br/>labelling. The certification currently, I think, only sits with Podcom.  Will we be undertaking the 
<br/>proper certification through our own Ministry of Agriculture, I am wondering how far that has gone? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Koya raises a good point 
<br/>in terms of study.  There is now a commercial agriculture/aquaculture taskforce in the Ministry of 
<br/>Trade and what we have been doing is actually, once we identify a product that is of interest, we try 
<br/>and  move  ahead  with  some  sort  of  study  particularly  depending  on  the  products  and  turmeric  is 
<br/>certainly one of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, we are involved in a study for pineapple, we have just kick started one on kava as 
<br/>well through the assistance of Market  Development  Facility (MDF). What  we are finding is  they 
<br/>becoming  quite  a  very  good  repository  of  assistance  in  terms  of  trying  to  align  our  commercial 
<br/>ambitions with some good strategy.  It is on the card but we will circle back once the findings are  
<br/>known. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you have mentioned organic, 
<br/>efforts were made in the previous years on the development of the Fiji organic standard.  I do not 
<br/>know how far that has progressed.  For now, without the Fiji organic standard, the price is better, but 
<br/>we  are  not  hitting  the  premium  price.  One  of  the  priorities  is  the  completion  of  the  Fiji  organic 
<br/>standard so that after that,  then we can graduate  it into other standards that are recognised in  the 
<br/>world market.   So, how far have we progressed with the Fiji organic standard, honourable Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, I cannot remember the name 
<br/>of the organisation but we are using an organisation for the Fiji organic for the branding.  There is a 
<br/>Singaporean company in Fiji at the moment, they are experts in organic certification. We have had 
<br/>some initial discussions, and we will see where that progress is, but yes, the certification of organic 
<br/>is quite important.  As you correctly point out, it does attract the premium pricing.

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question, as alluded to by the 
<br/>honourable Minister that turmeric in Navosa grows wild.  Most of these areas are only accessed by 
<br/>horse and foot and women and girls are the ones who are mostly engaged in the harvesting.  When 
<br/>exporters come to buy, they only pick what they want, and the rejected ones are thrown away.  Can 
<br/>the  Ministry  assist  our  farmers  in  finding  other  markets  that  will  address  this  issue  faced  by  the 
<br/>farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will use the words of honourable Usamate, “absolutely, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir”.  N 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Not hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will connect up, honourable Tuicolo, actually you have raised quite a few good points 
<br/>there and I can tell you that the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Agriculture have 
<br/>been actually quite active in creating rural roads and moving very fast.  You would have heard the 
<br/>update by the honourable Minister for Rural Development on the significant number of roads that 
<br/>they have started doing over the last few months.  I am sure we will try and connect up and assist.  
<br/>We are happy to have a look as well in terms of the access turmeric, I am sure there might be even a 
<br/>local market for it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Taskforce on Food Safety 
<br/>(Question No. 152/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the progress and 
<br/>activities of the National Taskforce on Food Safety? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess I normally get this by the other 
<br/>side of Parliament on the number of taskforces that Ministry of Trade has created. Let me assure 
<br/>Parliament that these are not idle taskforces, they are actually a reaction to issues that we find on the 
<br/>ground.  For certain taskforces, such as the National Taskforce on Food Safety, my brief to them is, 
<br/>it is a limited timeline taskforce.  Our job is to flush out the issues that we are currently facing in Fiji 
<br/>and hopefully look at the legislations, make changes and move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just allow me to elucidate a little bit on the progress and activities.  Last 
<br/>year in October, we created the National Food Safety Taskforce which was really a reaction to a lot 
<br/>of reports that we were seeing on the ground and challenges faced by consumers.  This is regarding 
<br/>modification of labelling, sale of near expiry items, importation challenges, food handling issues, 
<br/>distribution and storage challenges as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This taskforce, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a very comprehensive taskforce.  It involves all the key 
<br/>stakeholder  agencies:  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
<br/>Waterways, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, Ministry of Local Government, Consumer Council of Fiji, 
<br/>Fiji Revenue Customs Service (FRCS) and Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) 
<br/>working together to try and flush out this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1633 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have finalised a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the agencies just to be 
<br/>very clear in terms of what we are trying to do, looking at the current legislation and promoting a lot 
<br/>more  consumer  engagement  and  collaborating  with  each  other  to  ensure  that  food  safety  is 
<br/>paramount.  Some of you might  recall, quite recently there was a lot of inaccurate and deceptive 
<br/>labelling  on  some  food  products.    So,  the  consumer  watchdogs,  which  is  FCCC  and  Consumer 
<br/>Council of Fiji have been actively talking to these misbehaving wholesalers and they are being dealt 
<br/>with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also received a lot of complaints on imported tuna.  The Pacific Fishing Company 
<br/>(PAFCO) came and met us and were quite concerned with the level of imported tuna.  Some of the 
<br/>tuna entering the country, you can almost argue that it is not fit for human consumption.  We are 
<br/>trying to target that as well through this taskforce and try and remove them off the shelves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an elevated inspection process that has been going on for a couple of months now.  
<br/>The Consumer Council of Fiji, FCCC, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government have been 
<br/>working together to start the monitoring of labelling, expiry, quality of food, and as a result, some 
<br/>shops have been reprimanded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently as well, we have started trying to engage with the private sector 
<br/>directly.  Just to sort of express the Government’s concern perhaps, in terms of the food safety and 
<br/>beyond that. We are seriously looking at how we can strengthen laws to ensure that food safety which 
<br/>is paramount for our people is protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his elaboration.  I thought we 
<br/>were going to refer to him as the Minister for Taskforces, but as I was listening, I was thinking about 
<br/>the  issues  of  food  safety  that  have  been  something  that  has  been  around  for  a  long  time.    I  was 
<br/>thinking, a lot of the issues that you are raising - food labelling, the quality of food, the handling of 
<br/>food which has been covered by programmes, like Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), 
<br/>et cetera, there are already existing legislations that cover this.  So, is a matter of lack of execution 
<br/>of those, or is it lacunas in the law themselves that are allowing these things to filter through?  What 
<br/>is the findings of the taskforce in these areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, as I have said, what we try to do immediately 
<br/>is escalate the level of scrutiny around the country which has happened just to make people aware 
<br/>that they cannot bring in substandard food into our country.  The laws are still a bit weak, for example, 
<br/>I  am  told  when  Customs  sees  expired  items  that  come  into  the  country,  they  do  not  have  any 
<br/>guidelines at the moment to stop them at the border.  That is just a simple example of what we are 
<br/>dealing with.  So, we intend to tighten up these laws and hopefully, in the next couple of months, I 
<br/>can bring forward possibly some regulatory changes or even legislative changes, to try and tighten 
<br/>up that whole area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The bulk of the food safety monitoring sits with the Ministry of Health and I would just like 
<br/>to  thank  the  Ministry  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  for  collaborating  with  the  other  agencies 
<br/>because we do have inspectors in the Ministry of Trade, the FCCC, Consumer Council of Fiji and 
<br/>also Ministry of Local Government.  Right now, we are trying to work together because obviously, 
<br/></span><span>if you hunt in a group, there is a lot more of it, so we are finding that quite effective and we will 
<br/></span><span>continue to do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I intend to have a meeting with some of the very big retail wholesale companies in Fiji soon, 
<br/>just to, sort of, continue the pressure of what we see in an endeavour to make sure that food safety 
<br/>concerns in the country are allayed.

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  My  question  to  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  for 
<br/>agricultural products, two of the key issues are in as far as food safety is concerned is on the use of 
<br/>harmful chemicals and antibiotics with livestock.  How does the taskforce look at addressing these 
<br/>issues? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for raising that, perhaps, it is something that I 
<br/>can  talk  to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  about  it.    At  the  moment,  our  concern  is  more  about  the 
<br/>imported  products  into  Fiji,  but  I  do  take  your  point  on  the  concerns  around  getting  substandard 
<br/>products from within Fiji as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Certainly, there is a significant issue around imported food items and the reason why we raise 
<br/>this question is just to ensure the House and also the people of Fiji that this Government is actually 
<br/>very serious in trying to do something about it.  I think some of the retailers and large companies 
<br/>have been getting away with it, and that is going to stop. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  remember  quite  well  when  we  were  in  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua brought up a case of tinned tuna that penetrated the market here in Fiji.  It had quite a 
<br/>terrible smell that she produced that can of tuna in the House.  Those are the examples of how there 
<br/>are existing gaps in the way we conduct ourselves by ensuring that nothing of this sort infiltrates our 
<br/>market, but there again that is a glaring example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister; what 
<br/>level of engagement do we have with the FAO, a UN agency, with respect to ensuring that we get 
<br/>this right in terms of our Food Safety Regulations, et cetera? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  We  are  not  on  the  Taskforce,  if  that  is  the  question,  but 
<br/>certainly once we crystalise some of the issues that we are trying to deal with, we will certainly reach 
<br/>out to other agencies for help.  But right now, I think we are managing well, there is a quite a bit of 
<br/>expertise on the ground  and our priority is  just to remove any inferior products  from  the shelves 
<br/>because our Fijians deserve better. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this Taskforce is operating to look into the  
<br/>safety  of the food products  that are imported in  Fiji,  there are also  a concern by wholesalers and 
<br/>retailers that there are times when their product is already in Fiji, it is held back and not just for one 
<br/>or two days, the shipment is sometimes delayed to close to around 30 to 60 days and it goes into 
<br/>bond.  When they have to pay for the bond fees and everything, the cost of the goods goes up.  So, if 
<br/>the licence or approval can be given in the timely manner, the consumers will not be affected by the 
<br/>hike up in the price that is actually caused by the delay in the process.  So, if they can also look at 
<br/>the process that is being followed to give the approvals to the wholesalers and importers in a timely 
<br/>manner would be very much appreciated, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- is that supplementary question is part of the initial one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is bordering, Sir, on a new question but what I will say is 
<br/>that, I will take that on board as noted but in terms of complaints.  What we are trying to do now is 
<br/></span><span>to  attend to  issues that are reported by the  regulators, particularly  FCCC and Consumer Council.  
<br/></span><span>That issue has not come up but we will take that on board and see what can be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will resume when the bell is sounded.  Parliament is adjourned.

<div><span>Investigation on the Ferries Wheel Incident 
<br/>(Question No. 153/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on the progress of the investigations on the ferries wheel incident a year 
<br/>ago? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  honourable  Chand  for  that 
<br/>question. Let me begin by saying that there has been a lot of public interest in this matter and there 
<br/>have been questions raised outside Parliament.  Despite us giving several progress reports, people 
<br/>have still been questioning and I am happy that it has come up here so that I can clarify this once and 
<br/>for all, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry, through the National OHS Service, completed the conduct of 
<br/>the full investigations into the ferries wheel accident that occurred on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 at the Vodafone 
<br/>Arena during the showcase event.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the full Accident Investigation Report was compiled and submitted to the 
<br/>Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 18</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2023. The Ministry had identified 
<br/>and filed the alleged breaches that contributed to the accident, in line with the Health and Safety at 
<br/>Work Act 1996 and its associated regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport also 
<br/>conducted their investigation on the mechanical components or engineering examination of the ride. 
<br/>The Fiji Police Force has been carrying out its own investigation as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the occurrence of the accident, the Ministry has given media updates 
<br/>on both, the preliminary and full investigations on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2023; 8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023; 9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023; 18</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>August, 2023; and 15</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  advised  by  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  the  Public 
<br/>Prosecutions that we cannot release the full report to the media or to the public because it is a trialable 
<br/>case.  That is why we have submitted it to the ODPP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been following up with the ODPP on the progress and have also 
<br/>followed up with the Fiji Police.  The ODPP, as of this morning, had advised that they are still waiting 
<br/>for the Police to complete their investigation and hand over their recommendations to the ODPP.  
<br/>The Police, I know, is still investigating because our staff had been interviewed just in the last few 
<br/>days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has a stringent process of carrying out all inspections for all 
<br/></span><span>plants,  equipment  and  machinery,  including  all  amusement  rides  and  structures.    Prior  to  any 
<br/></span><span>amusement ride installation, the National OHS Service Inspectors go through the standard operating 
<br/>procedures  on  the  design  and  layout  of  the  rides  at  the  proposed  sites  with  the  organisers  of  the 
<br/>amusement rides and the facility owners.  This is to ensure that proper and adequate facilities, such 
<br/>as ground levelling, water, electricity supplies, traffic and public movements are in place.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This also includes the review and evaluation of rides to be used, especially in its structures 
<br/>and operation mechanisms.  All ride owners must ensure the validity of the Non-Destructive Testing 
<br/>(NDT) certifications conducted by the Ministry prior to any installations, to ensure the integrity of 
<br/>all the load-bearing metals and structures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  OHS  Service  conducts  initial  ground  inspections  using 
<br/>standardised checklist for the right individual components, such as the transmissions, drives, seats, 
<br/>bolts and nuts, locks, pins, springs, lock washers, wires, fasteners, rollers, et cetera, to name a few.  
<br/>The  rides,  after  its  assembly,  are  then  inspected  again  to  confirm  the  functionality  of  all  the 
<br/>components whereby checks are conducted on the operations of seats, safety bars, belts, pins and 
<br/>lock  speed,  transmission  assembly,  control  devices,  breaks  and  clutches,  electrical  wiring  and 
<br/>lighting, isolation barriers, entry and exit points and emergency procedures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amusement rides are put through operational test, including load test.  
<br/>In addition to the above, relevant awareness and trainings are also conducted for the amusement ride 
<br/>owners, workers and operators.  I wish to assure that all the rides are thoroughly inspected and tested 
<br/>prior to any operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has taken preventative measures to ensure that amusement ride 
<br/>owners, as part of their duty of care, protect their patrons from reasonably foreseeable risks created 
<br/>by their amusement rides when in operation.  All rides are continued to be inspected to ensure that 
<br/>the rides are operating with all reasonable safety measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry ensures that all rides have been constructed properly and are 
<br/>in good condition.  Amusement ride owners are also obliged, under the law, to provide and maintain 
<br/>plants and systems of work that are safe and without risk to anyone’s health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  preventing  similar  accidents  and  strengthening  OHS  compliance,  the 
<br/>Ministry continues to ensure that the health and safety policies and procedures are in place to protect 
<br/>the workers and their patrons at all times, and set clear guidelines for patrons, such as any restrictions 
<br/>while on the rides and rules against reckless behaviour or any other unwarranted situation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, my Ministry continuously provides the necessary health and 
<br/>safety awareness  and training to all the amusement ride owners and their operators,  as alluded to 
<br/>earlier. Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately non-workers and in this case, the victims of the accident can 
<br/>only seek redress through civil action after the courts have convicted the persons responsible.  This 
<br/>is in accordance with the current law. They are not covered by Accident Compensation Commission 
<br/>Fiji (ACCF) because they are not workers.  We have also tried with all the insurance companies to 
<br/>get them to get insurance against accidents but unfortunately none of the insurance companies are 
<br/>prepared to ensure.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure this august House and the general public that 
<br/>the Ministry takes all possible actions to prevent mishaps of this nature within the provisions of the 
<br/>OHS laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for the comprehensive Report.  Family members of the victim and the public strongly criticise the 
<br/></span><span>manner in which this case has been handled. The family of the victim are still waiting for the justice 
<br/></span><span>and also for the report.  Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament whether the machine was 
<br/>inspected before it was allowed to be used and was a certificate to this effect issued? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- That is the normal thing to be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to earlier.

<div><span>NDMO Partnership with Japan’s QZSS  
<br/>(Question No. 154/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  update  Parliament  on  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office  partnership 
<br/>with Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System for early warning system? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to address this august 
<br/>House on the Memorandum of Cooperation that was signed on the margins of PALM 2024.  It is 
<br/>effective for three years with the National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) of Japan, a Government 
<br/>institution responsible for planning, designing and coordinating space policy and the development, 
<br/>maintenance and operation of the  Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) with  our Government  to 
<br/>improve our early warning systems. The honourable Prime Minister had stated this in his Report on 
<br/>the PALM trip earlier in the week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management through 
<br/>the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>through their Seismology Unit are the key Government agencies responsible for managing National 
<br/>Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Activities related to tsunami.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  mission  is  to  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of  our  nation  against  geological  hazards.  
<br/>These three entities, the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Disaster Management 
<br/>Office (NDMO) and Mineral Resources Department (MRD) have agreed to initiate cooperation in 
<br/>the field of emergency warning systems using the advanced QZSS technology, and through close 
<br/>consultation and collaborative activities, this partnership aims to significantly enhance our ability to 
<br/>respond to emergencies and protect our communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the QZSS is renowned for its precision and reliability in providing real time 
<br/>data  which  is  essential  for  effective  disaster  management.    This  partnership  underscores  our 
<br/>commitment to adopting innovative solutions to safeguard our nation against natural disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Early Warning System Service (EWSS) disseminates crucial disaster and 
<br/>crisis management information from disaster management organisations to help prevent disasters. 
<br/>This  include  data  on  earthquakes  and  tsunamis  transmitted  by  the  Japanese  Government’s  QZSS 
<br/>(Michibiki)  which    began  operations  in  2017.  In  2018,  the  disaster  and  crisis  report  service  was 
<br/>launched by QZSS to provide early warnings on hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis and floods 
<br/>and to address communication challenges following significant disasters. The National Space Policy 
<br/>Secretariat initiated discussions to establish a National Committee to explore QZSS applications for 
<br/>disaster risk reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Committee includes experts in satellite technology, communication, DRR and disaster 
<br/>management and international affairs. Fiji was selected for feasibility studies to understand the Early 
<br/>Warning  System  and  address  technical  challenges.  The  National  Disaster  Management  Office  is 
<br/>responsible  for  facilitating  and  managing  disaster  risk  reduction  activities,  whereas  the  Mineral 
<br/>Resources  Department  serves  as  a  National  Tsunami  Warning  Authority.  In  2019  after  extensive 
<br/>discussions  and  site  visits,  Fiji  and  Japan  agreed  to  formulate  a  Memorandum  of  Cooperation  to

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explore the use of QZSS in Fiji’s Early Warning Systems. The National Committee reviewed the 
<br/>feasibility study results and devised a strategy for implementing this technology, demonstrating its 
<br/>application in Fiji using data provided by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key activities of the National Committee are as follows - the 
<br/>NTT group will work in collaboration with NDMO and MRD to conduct demonstration campaigns, 
<br/>assessing  the  operational  effectiveness  of  the  EWSS  in  various  emergencies  scenarios.  
<br/>Responsibilities, the NTT group will conduct surveys, address technological standards and regulatory 
<br/>requirements,  develop  demonstration  scenarios  and  prototype  systems  and  cover  costs  related  to 
<br/>labour, equipment, travel and accommodation for the Japanese team involve in demonstrations. They 
<br/>will also gather feedback from relevant organisations for further improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  complementary  data  source  in  Fiji,  the  MRD  relies  heavily  on  the  Pacific  Tsunami 
<br/>Warning  Centre  for  seismic  information.  Utilising  the  QZSS  as  a  secondary  data  source  will 
<br/>complement the PTWC data enhancing our ability to pinpoint wave arrival times and impact areas. 
<br/>Sir,  MRD  will  provide  technical  advice  to  the  NDMO  allowing  for  simplified  targeted  public 
<br/>advisories or preparing for incoming tsunami hazards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The QZSS, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  a satellite system  that the Japanese Government  uses and 
<br/>which we are privileged to be part of now.  It only hovers over the Pacific, reaching only up to Japan 
<br/>and then coming back down to the Pacific, just South of Australia.  That is the extent of where  it 
<br/>goes, it does a figure eight movement around that area and that why it is very accurate in looking at 
<br/>wave patterns and all that kind of things, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The QZSS Early Warning System service, 
<br/>collaboration between the NDMO, MRD, National Space Policy Secretariat and Nippon Telegraph 
<br/>and Telephone group aims to enhance tsunami information, dissemination in Fiji through coordinated 
<br/>demonstrations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These demonstrations will use different hazard scenarios to illustrate the operation of QZSS 
<br/>in coordination with  NDMO and MRD. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership is the testament of our 
<br/>commitment to leveraging advance technology and international cooperation to protect our citizens 
<br/>and enhance our disaster management capabilities.  We all look forward to seeing the positive impacts 
<br/>of this collaboration and strengthen resilience of our two nations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister.    I  have  acknowledged  the  Japanese  Government  for  the  assistance  of  the  QZSS,  but 
<br/>honourable Minister prior to this, there has also been an arrangement with the Japanese Government 
<br/>about the siren system to extend from Suva to Lautoka and if I remember correctly, probably down 
<br/>to Rakiraki.  How far has that progressed, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the discussions regarding the extension of the early 
<br/>warning system, the sirens and the speaker system that we see up to Lami, discussions are continuing 
<br/>at the moment but there are some misgivings about the use of sirens at the moment in the national 
<br/>disaster management space.  We have been having some bad experiences in some areas in Hawaii, 
<br/>when they had the fires.  What they found was when they sounded the sirens, instead of them fleeing, 
<br/>they actually went towards the places they were not supposed to go.  So, there are some explorations 
<br/></span><span>in how that can be mitigated in the future. In the area of disaster management, this is a topical issue 
<br/></span><span>at  the  moment,  and  we are  seeing  how  other  technologies  can  be  used,  maybe  the  use  of  mobile 
<br/>phones with personal messages being sent to each one of us to warn us of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in New Zealand, that is what they are preferring to do.  We are in a flux at the moment, 
<br/>we are looking at how we are going to be progressing, but at the moment the Japanese Government 
<br/>has continued to progress the siren, the early warning system that they had committed to and it will

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for his comprehensive answer, but I believe he has missed one thing, a national phenomenon 
<br/>such as earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruptions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is,  there  will  be  many  challenges  but  the  two 
<br/>challenges  which  we  were  discussing  when  we  were  in  the  Ministry  was  environmental  and 
<br/>geographical challenges.  Can the honourable Minister explain how will NDMO address this, have 
<br/>they got any plans to address these two phenomena? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Can  the  honourable  Member  clarify  that  -  what  does  he  mean  by  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>environmental and geographical challenges?  Can you just explain that further? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  There  are  about  nine  challenges,  it  is  data  information  management, 
<br/>environment  and  geographical  challenges,  coordination  and  complication  challenges,  public 
<br/>awareness, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Question?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Geographical, Fiji is unique with its many islands and remote communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will definitely not give accurate information…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T. RAYALU.- Question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I already had asked the question, you wait, </span><span>wawa.  </span><span>Because we have many 
<br/>islands, some of the remote areas will not be covered accurately.  I am asking how will you cover 
<br/>that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a good question but it is something that we are 
<br/>all  working  towards.    It  is  going  to  be  a  fusion  of  all  these  technologies  that  we  use.    As  I  had 
<br/>mentioned, we can use mobile phones and if there are black spots that are being experienced, we can 
<br/>also use radio technology.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in just a last few sessions, we have heard of radio technology VHF and HF radios 
<br/>being used as well.  These are the kind of technologies that we will be exploring to see how we can 
<br/>reach into the geographical nature of Fiji and how all the islands are scattered around the Pacific and 
<br/>that is how we hope to deal with that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is quite difficult.  It is an act of God, and it strikes us in seconds, whether 
<br/>you are waiting for the siren to be blown across to notify you that a tsunami is coming or what, it will 
<br/>be too late.  Even coming down the steps of the three-storey building will be too late.  So that is what 
<br/>they are doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Trigger system - good.  You have asked for the whole 300 islands; it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quite a challenge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have got traditional systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Like in Yasawas, they get notified when a tsunami or earthquake is about

<div><span>Progress of the Dairy Production Facility Project  
<br/>(Question No. 155/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  Ministry  having  embarked  on  an  initiative  with  investors  from  Israel  to 
<br/>address large scale production technologies, can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and 
<br/>Waterways update Parliament on the progress of the dairy production facility project in the 
<br/>Central Division? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish the honourable Sachida Nand a quick 
<br/>recovery.    The  dairy  industry  in  Fiji  is  encountering  challenges,  like  low  milk  production,  poor 
<br/>quality feed, lack of modern technology resulting in low productivity and a shortage of fresh milk 
<br/>supply.  Moreover, there is a demographic change with numerous youths showing little interest in 
<br/>pursuing careers in Agriculture, which includes dairy farming. In addition, the dairy sector has been 
<br/>hit hard by the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis diseases, drastically reducing the numbers of dairy 
<br/>cows in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the annual milk requirement in Fiji is around 77 million litres, whereas local 
<br/>farmers manage to produce approximately six million litres per year.  The issue of low productivity 
<br/>is primarily due to the absence of modern technology and best practices.  The continued use of hand 
<br/>milking and reliance on traditional methods also contribute to low milk yield per cow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the challenges at hand, there are opportunities to improve the sector 
<br/>and cater for domestic needs and decrease reliance on imports. This  can be achieved through the 
<br/>creation  of  Public-Private  Partnerships  through  investments  of  large  producers  that  will  bring  in 
<br/>cutting edge, environmentally friendly technologies and sustainable methods for dairy production.  
<br/>Fiji’s dairy sector has the potential to become a front runner in the Pacific region, boosting our exports 
<br/>to neighbouring islands and lessening the need for imports through this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is really a large-scale production technology project proposal currently 
<br/>under discussion with the Ministry of Finance, including the Israeli Government.  However, there 
<br/>needs to be consensus on the interest rates proposed before the commercial agreement can be signed.  
<br/>The proposal is to establish an intensive dairy production facility at Navuso Agricultural Technical 
<br/>Institute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of the House, the selection of the Navuso Agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technical Institute was done in collaboration with the Israelis early this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Dairy Co-Op Integration Project in Fiji aims to enhance the local dairy 
<br/>industry, through the creation of a sustainable 200 dairy cow farm, equipped with advance technology 
<br/>from Holland, Germany and Israel.  The project includes a milking power, a 300-acre irrigated field 
<br/>for feed production and a modern milk processing plant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The farm will implement an intensive scheme using an Israeli automated model system for 
<br/>management, providing real time data on health, fertility, milk quality and productivity.  The goal is 
<br/>to  establish  a  self-sustainable  enterprise  that  produces  premium  dairy  products  for  the  local  and 
<br/>international markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, learning from past experiences with the Fiji Dairy Limited Company, we 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1641 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are of the hope to make improvements to the setup of the Israeli Dairy Facility.  The Ministry looks 
<br/>forward to your support and anticipates that this Dairy Facility will be established soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for his reply.  We are all familiar with 
<br/>the  problems  that  we  have  with  our  dairy  industry,  its  huge  potential  and  the  problems  that  had 
<br/>besotted it over the years.  This issue was first brought up in the 2023-2024 Budget discussion and 
<br/>in June 2023, the honourable Minister had mentioned that it would be finalised in the next two weeks.  
<br/>We are now in July of this year, so can we have clarity from the honourable Minister as to when it is 
<br/>likely that this deal be signed so that we can progress? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- We are already into the commercial agreement, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  and  we  are  just  ironing  out,  like  I  have  said,  the  interest  rates  to  be  employed  under  the 
<br/>commercial agreement.  The Israelis will be here by the end of the month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics is fully aware, and he is very supportive of the project.   So, we 
<br/>anticipate having it off the ground this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We are trying to do away with hand milking.  Honourable Usamate, that is 
<br/>the idea, to bring in this Israeli development to help us because hand milking is not really taking out 
<br/>the full milk from the cow. That is why we are always short of milk all the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to the dairy industry, the dairy farmers in Fiji are 
<br/>struggling to get dairy animals for their farm and we cannot get animals from Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand due to various reasons.  How is the honourable Minister planning to get dairy animals for 
<br/>this large-scale production?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member that question.  
<br/>We  have  a  number  of  ways  to  get  in  animals  and  getting  in  live  animals  is  what  the  honourable 
<br/>Member is talking about.  With Australia and New Zealand, given the disease status, we have some 
<br/>diseases that we do not want to be brought into Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will remember that the four breed that we currently have, one of them is the dairy breed, 
<br/>the Brown Swiss, and we brought those four breeds in through embryo transfer, which is quite safe 
<br/>when it comes to transferring zoonotic disease.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  skip  Oral  Question  No.  156/2024  since 
<br/>honourable Vocea has made a withdrawal on that question because that has been fully covered by 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  External  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications in his earlier statement.  We will now jump right to the  
<br/>ninth Oral Question for today, I see you smiling, honourable Premila Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR-  Sir,  I  am  just  exchanging  smile  with  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  Minister  for  External  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and

<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts  update 
<br/>Parliament on the utilisation of the $2 million allocation for the Village Improvement Scheme 
<br/>in the 2023–2024 Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government revived the Village Improvement Scheme (VIS) in the 2023-
<br/>2024 financial year.  A sum of $2 million was provided in the Budget.  The VIS has three components 
<br/>- Village Beautification, Sanitation and Community Hall.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The VIS was advertised and applications were assessed through the Cabinet-approved criteria 
<br/>by a Committee.  Under that criteria, our Ministry approved 30 out of the 283 applications that was 
<br/>submitted  to  us.    The  applications  are  required  to  provide  one  quarter  of  the  cost,  with  the 
<br/>Government giving the other three quarter.
