<h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes, with 
<br/>a 10 minute response by the Minister responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech.  No 
<br/>seconder is required and there will be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the 2013 Constitution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, before  I do deliver the Statement,  I  wish all the 
<br/>schools that are at the knockout stages for Deans, I will not mention a particular school in the interest 
<br/>of my safety, and I also would like to wish the honourable Alitia Bainivalu a happy birthday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you talking about QVS? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Maybe, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to make a statement on what I firmly believe 
<br/>is  a  priority  issue  for  Fiji  and,  that  is,  that  the  2013  Constitution  is  to  be  reviewed  as  soon  as 
<br/>practically possible.  I will take one step further and say the truth and reconciliation should only be 
<br/>attempted after the Constitution is reviewed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that this process of review will have to commence from this 
<br/>House under your leadership, as the Head of our Legislature, where we will have to agree and give 
<br/>our blessings for the review of the 2013 Constitution, of course, when the required Bill is tabled in 
<br/></span><span>this House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am of the view that this Constitution does not have a unifying effect on 
<br/>the people of Fiji.  There is a big divide, mostly along political lines, on the support or otherwise on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span> </span><span>Editor’s Note:  Reply to Written Question No. 160/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works and 
<br/>Meteorological Services and Transport under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure II.

<div><span>End of Week Statement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this  Constitution.    One  of  the  reasons  is  because  these  is  this  perception  that  this  Constitution  is 
<br/>attached or aligned to one political party.  I have held that view well before I became a Member of 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the first Elections under this Constitution in 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution 
<br/>has been the subject of criticism and, sometimes, even ridiculed in this House and outside of this 
<br/>House. There has been a constant chorus of voices from individuals and organisations to review this 
<br/>Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, a political party, not represented in this House, publicly announced that they are 
<br/>putting together a team to push for a way to change or amend this Constitution.  In the last few days, 
<br/>when the media got wind of the fact that I will be making this statement today both, criticisms and 
<br/>praise had come from the members of the public on my statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  take  advantage  of  this  privilege  given  to  MPs  to  make 
<br/>statements in this House, to add my voice to the call for a review of the 2013 Constitution and I thank 
<br/>my fellow colleagues, who also wanted to make a statement today, who are giving way to me to make 
<br/>my statement. I will provide a few reasons on why I think this Constitution needs to be reviewed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution has to be reviewed to remove its perceived connection to 
<br/>one political party. This has been a downside to this Constitution, perhaps, because of the process 
<br/>that was followed to  create it.  When there is,  at least,  a perception that this Constitution, or any 
<br/>Constitution for that matter is  connected to  a political  party, the Constitution becomes a political 
<br/>pointscoring issue.  In the last Election, the Parties on the Government side campaign on changing 
<br/>the Constitution and this side, maintained that this Constitution is good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You are one of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Yes, I was one of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am of the view that the Constitution should never be used as a political 
<br/>campaign  point  because  that  will  make  one  supporter  of  the  Constitution  contingent  on  which 
<br/>political party one supports.  In the perfect setting,  I believe that a  constitution is supposed to be 
<br/>supported and respected irrespective of political affiliation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This perception of attachment of the Constitution to one political party will only be removed 
<br/>if this Constitution is taken back to the people and it comes back to this House from the people, and 
<br/>when we and those that come after us to this august Chamber, hold our Holy Books and swear an 
<br/>Oath to uphold the Constitution, we swear an Oath to uphold the will of the people rather than the 
<br/>will of a few.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we learn that lesson, then we know that it will be a big and grave 
<br/>mistake for the Government of the day, should they lay claim to the reviewed Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the situation that this House is in right now, where we have an Opposition 
<br/>(26  in  total)  that  are  all  independent  Members  of  Parliament  and  there  is  no  political  parties  in 
<br/>Opposition, is not covered in the Constitution. The only reference in the Constitution closest to this 
<br/></span><span>situation that we are in is in Section 78(c), which refers to Independent Members of Parliament not 
<br/></span><span>in support of the Prime Minister to be included in the voting process to appoint the Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we heard your ruling this morning and the discussions that ensued.  I must 
<br/>thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  your  wisdom  and  insight  in  guiding  Parliament  to  adjust  and 
<br/>accommodate this unprecedented situation that we are in, especially given the lack of guidance  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1651 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provided in the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  upholding  the  Constitution  does  not  mean  that  we  should  not  amend  it. 
<br/>Upholding it, in my view, means that we must also ensure that the Constitution remains relevant to 
<br/>the situation that the nation encounters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Constitution’s capacities to cope with new issues and demands thrust on it is weak 
<br/>or  lacking,  there  is  an  inherent  need  to  strengthen  it,  and  that  strengthening  process  is  through  a 
<br/>review and amendment, if necessary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution is not all bad, but not all good either.  Let me quote a few 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sections to illustrate this point: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter 1, Section 6(a) and (b), in my view, is a section that is worth retaining. It reads, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any attempt to establish a Government other than in compliance with this Constitution 
<br/>shall be unlawful, and – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>anything done to further that attempt is invalid and of no force or effect; and 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>no immunities can lawfully be granted under any law to any person in respect of actions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taken or omitted in furtherance of such an attempt.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this section is what I refer to as the anti-coup clause.  It is worth keeping, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and there are many more good Sections in this Constitution that we should keep.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Clause that could be or should be amended, in my view, is in Chapter 5, Section 113(2), 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which refers to the remuneration and benefits to Judicial Officers.  It reads, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The salaries and benefits payable to the Chief Justice and the President of the 
<br/>Court of Appeal shall be determined by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister 
<br/>following consultation by the Prime Minister with the Attorney General.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me declare that I am not imputing any wrongdoing or any sinister motive 
<br/>on any of those high office holders mentioned in this section, and I respect all the past and serving 
<br/>holders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  view,  this  Clause  breaks  important  democratic  values  that  a 
<br/>constitution should protect. It breaks the very important rule of the Separation of Powers, in my view. 
<br/>It puts into question the independence of the Judiciary, at least, the Head of the Judiciary.  In my 
<br/>view, the Head of the Executive cannot and should not determine the salaries and benefits of the 
<br/>Head of the Judiciary, and this clause also, Mr. Speaker, opens up the high office in the land to unfair 
<br/>criticism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 131(2) on the role of the Military has been the subject of criticism 
<br/></span><span>and discussion. It is, in my view, as the former holder of the Head of the Military, in my view, it is 
<br/></span><span>too broad, and a lot of our hope is dependent on the character and the good judgment of the Head of 
<br/>the Military to exercise his powers correctly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those two Clauses that I had mentioned, alone warrants an amendment in 
<br/>this  Constitution  and,  sadly,  there  are  a  few  more.  I  urge  all  Members  of  this  august  House  to 
<br/>seriously think about the importance of and the urgent need to take this Constitution back to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people to be reviewed and amended as necessary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is our duty as representatives of the people to do so. It will come back to this House from 
<br/>the people and, as I have mentioned at the beginning of my statement, we and those who will be 
<br/>elected to this House in the years to come, will hold their Holy Books and swear that they will uphold 
<br/>a Constitution that truly encapsulates the will of the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2013 Constitution has brought this nation back into a democratically elected Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in 2014 until now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To review and amend this Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is never ‘anti’ anything, it is not 
<br/>anti-anyone or anti-any group or anti-any political party.  In fact, it is pro – pro-the people, it is pro-
<br/>nation building, it is pro-democracy, and this is the way we perfect our young democracy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work of perfecting our democracy is never-ending, it will continue well into the future 
<br/>by those who will come after us.  But now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our turn - the whole 56 of us on 
<br/>this floor, including you, Mr. Speaker, as the Head of the Legislature.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, to use the analogy of a potter who puts his hand on the clay to help remove its 
<br/>imperfection. It is now our time, our turn to put our hands on our imperfect democracy and remove 
<br/>its imperfection. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          MR. SPEAKER.- And I now call on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
<br/>Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to 
<br/>make his response. The floor is yours, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I reiterate my words of congratulations to all the 
<br/>indigenous peoples of the world on World Indigenous Day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  End  of  the  Week  Statement  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Naupoto, calling for review of the 2013 Constitution.   I was going to ask the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General  to  do  this  for  me,  but  I  found  that  I  still  have  time  to  contribute  before  I  go  to  the  next 
<br/>appointment with my colleagues from Tonga and the Cook Islands, and Troika of Pacific Islands 
<br/>Forum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Sir, allow me to place on record that I already have agreed to the proposition.  
<br/>I am very much in favour and also commit the Government to the various efforts that will go into 
<br/>working towards the completion of this task.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2013 Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sets out the power to the State, limitations on the 
<br/>State in relation to citizens and must protect the fundamental rights of the citizens.  Further, those 
<br/>who exercise power must be held accountable to the people they serve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is particularly important in a multiethnic, multireligious and multicultural 
<br/>nation like Fiji, to have a constitution brought about by consensus, and with consent and ownership 
<br/></span><span>from all constituent communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are seeing right now around the world, Sir, the coming into conflict, the various interests 
<br/>in the various societies and communities around the world.  Recently, we saw the disturbances in 
<br/>Bangladesh and in the United Kingdom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1653 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We could be blamed for starting all these in 1987, but since then, everyone has realised the 
<br/>dynamics of ethnicities around the world.  Wherever we are, if we are involved in the formulation of 
<br/>constitutions,  or  the  foundations  of  lawmaking  and  governing  in  all  these  communities,  none  of 
<br/>which now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is monogamous.  We are all multiethnic, there is no other monoethnic 
<br/>society in the world right now.   And we must expect that there will continue to be uprising, may be 
<br/>not violent, it will be uprising anyway.  People and groups are coming up and voicing their concerns 
<br/>- the French revolution, the war of independence in America.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  morning  in  Caucus  I  mentioned  to  my  colleagues  those  two  upheavals  happening  in 
<br/>Bangladesh and the United Kingdom.  People will continue to question, why?  Why is this happening 
<br/>in my home?  How do I define my home?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am reminded of what the late Archbishop Mataca said in the process of working towards a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>constitution after the 1997 Constitution was put out of place.  He said this, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“No matter how we come to be in Fiji, or how long we have been here, we are 
<br/>all part of this land.  It is the land of our birth or the land of our adoption, the land to 
<br/>which we belong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That brought home to me the need for national not just communal leadership. I was 
<br/>looking at communal leadership in the beginning of my journey or my venture into politics, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  My first political party was ethnicity based but since I became elected to be 
<br/>the Prime Minister for all races, all ethnicities in Fiji, my perception changed.  But since then, 
<br/>there have been other dynamics applied on our leadership role.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Naupoto mentioned this morning his role as the Commander 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces under this Constitution and what the current Commander in 
<br/>General, Ratu Jone might be thinking at this time.  There is that thought within the military, what 
<br/>about us? How will we fair in any new arrangement, probably thinking about the immunity clauses 
<br/>taken away, whether some of them or some whom they know might have been involved in those 
<br/>things that they could be brought to trial on so many years after the event.  These are things that we 
<br/>will have to think about as we grapple with the reconstruction of our Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, recently we had a Professor from the Australian National University who spoke 
<br/>to some of us who went there in a presentation that was organised by the Fiji National University at 
<br/>the  University  Campus  in  Nasinu.  He  gave  us  some  very  clear  thoughts,  but  they  were  his  own 
<br/>thoughts. Most of us were there and a lot of people noticed that I was taking down a lot of notes. The 
<br/>notes I was taking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was not for me to ask the questions later that night but for me 
<br/>to be able to use as we continue on this journey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the requirements of the Constitution, we are at leisure to look up those requirements for 
<br/>the amendments. Some of them, as he said that night, are pretty impossible to achieve.  We are talking 
<br/>about three-quarters of the membership of the House which we know we have, we easily calculate 
<br/>that. We are talking about three-quarters of the registered voters, depends on what day, what time we 
<br/>make the count. How many died since we took the count and before they cast their votes? What figure 
<br/></span><span>will we be looking at? It is so, so difficult.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am hoping that before we get to that stage, we will have worked out the formular or more 
<br/>achievable  formular  to  be  able  to  execute  the  tasks  that  we  have  given  ourselves  and  I  must 
<br/>congratulate the honourable Naupoto for bringing this up. We said that it was part of our manifesto. 
<br/>His party did not say it that they would do it but he has said this morning to this honourable House 
<br/>that the responsibility for laying the foundations of governance in any country must come from the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people themselves. It is not necessarily the duty of one political party to be defending a constitution 
<br/>nor any other political party to try and amend it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  mentioned  various  upheavals  happening  around  the  world.  As  a  former 
<br/>peacekeeper, I have seen the destruction of ethnic differences being taken out and weaponised. I hope 
<br/>we do not get to that stage, I was hoping I would be able to put a fullstop there, but this time, I cannot 
<br/>put the fullstop.  I will have to say, “we do not get to that stage again.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that is all about democracy.  We sit and listen to the 
<br/>various views whether it is for or against.  That is why we are here; to listen to this kind of opposing 
<br/>views and supporting views, just to how best we can continue to move ahead.  I thank you for that 
<br/>statement, honourable Naupoto.   It  has been a while since we have now heard this in  this august 
<br/>House and I am so happy to be part of this team.  I only hope that those who will be deciding this 
<br/>will  certainly  have  a  heart  to  hear  this  and  continue  to  hear  it  and  continue  to  prepare  to  make 
<br/>adjustments. This is all for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Grant to Tertiary Institutions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable fellow Members 
<br/>of Parliament, a very good afternoon to you all. Mr. Speaker, for many years the governments have 
<br/>been giving grants to tertiary institutes and not small amounts but figures amounting into millions of 
<br/>dollars.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when not enough scholarships were awarded to students and when the tuition 
<br/>fee was not as massive as it is today, it made prefect sense to provide grants to tertiary institutes to 
<br/>support the student in subsidising the tuition fees and paying for the salaries of lecturers and support 
<br/>staff. Mr. Speaker, the world has changed.  Since the inception of grants system to tertiary institutes, 
<br/>the demand has increased and the grounds for applying grants has changed as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I believe we need to revisit the formula and criteria that is used to determine the 
<br/>grants to tertiary institutes. If we look at the school grants given to primary and secondary schools, 
<br/>it is well defined and very clear. Where and how the money can be utilised is clearly documented. 
<br/>This  system  allows  proper scrutiny  and  leaves  no  chance  for  abuse  of  funds. Now  that  the 
<br/>Government is providing scholarships to students and paying tuition fee at a rate that is determined 
<br/>by the universities, should we continue with current grant system is my first question. I am not saying 
<br/>we should stop the grant, but what we need to do is to revisit the criteria.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investing in the education sector is one of the best investments a nation can do to improve the 
<br/>socio-economic  status  of  the  country</span><span>.  </span><span>Investing  in  education  is  investing  in  the  future. A 
<br/>knowledgeable society with a high rate of literacy allows the nation to develop at a much faster rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, during my time when I was a student at the Fiji school of Medicine, even as a 
<br/>private  student,  two-thirds  of  my  tuition  fee  was  subsidised  through  the  grant  that  was  provided 
<br/>to tertiary institutes. With an unfortunate reason, the grant is no longer used to subsidise the private 
<br/></span><span>students. We all know that there are close to 19,000 students who are studying privately and around 
<br/></span><span>15,500 students who are on scholarship.  The number of private students are as follows:</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>University of Fiji </span><span>- </span><span>1,550; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span> Fiji National University - 9,310; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>University of the South Pacific - 8,120. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1655 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  number  does  not  account  for  those  students studying  privately  or  in  other  tertiary 
<br/>institutes</span><span>, </span><span>such as technical colleges.  These statistics suggest that we have more students studying 
<br/>as private student compared to those students who are on scholarship.  This raises serious concern on 
<br/>what this Government has been preaching about making tertiary institutes free for every student. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the following words may sound very familiar to our ears, "We will remove TELS, we 
<br/>will make sure that every student studies through scholarship, we will make tertiary education free.” 
<br/>How  can  we  justify  that  there  are  more  private  students  than  those  on  scholarship  under  this 
<br/>government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One may argue that during FijiFirst’s time there were private students, but the difference is 
<br/>that at that point in time, they at least had a choice to either take loan or study privately, but now 
<br/>there is no such option. It is either one gets scholarship or forced to study privately.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that this government has removed the loan scheme, just imagine what 
<br/>parents must be going through to pay for tuition fees. The very policy that they criticized, that by 
<br/>giving loans to students, we were putting burden on the students, and now that they have removed 
<br/>TELS forcing students to study privately resulting in draining out parents of their savings and FNPF. 
<br/>What did the Government achieve by making this blunder when TELS was removed?  Where is the 
<br/>free education from pre-school to tertiary institute, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that same note we were also informed that 50 percent of the school grant 
<br/>to the primary and secondary schools is still pending, and we are almost closing second term.  Parents 
<br/>are even forced in primary and secondary schools to take part in fundraising.  They are forced to pay 
<br/>tuition fees in the name of school levy, ground fees and building fees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is, they are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you do not pay these fees or levies, students are not taken into school, and we had raised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these concerns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Stop lying! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  I  had  given  the  example  of  Mahatma  Gandhi  Memorial  School 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(MGM) whereby two students were not allowed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Which school? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- MGM.  Two students were not allowed to be enrolled because they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were not agreeing to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total tuition fee I paid to complete my four years Bachelors programme 
<br/>in pharmacy, the students now are paying the same amount as tuition fee for just a single year.  How 
<br/>can we expect the parents of these 19,000 students to all of a sudden start paying tuition fees from 
<br/></span><span>their pockets, withdrawing from their savings in the banks and FNPF that was there to secure the 
<br/></span><span>parents future.  If parents utilize their FNPF to pay for tuition fees, after retirement, they  will not 
<br/>have any option but to fall back on the Government for social assistance thus increasing the burden 
<br/>on the Ministry of Social Protection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My second question, if the taxpayers fund is not used to subsidise the students, then what is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>given for?  Is not there some kind of double dipping that the Government now provides full 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>scholarship and paying large sums as grant to tertiary institutes?  Around $160 million a year and 
<br/>then additional grants to tertiary institutes as well.  Is this justified?  These are question that we need 
<br/>to ask ourselves as we move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My third and most important question is, should we convert this grant as subsidy towards the 
<br/>private student?  The main source of revenue for tertiary institutes is through tuition fees. They must 
<br/>be having other source of income that should be used to cover operation cost, travel expense and not 
<br/>use Government grant to cover operational cost.  If we continue to provide grant, we should ensure 
<br/>that private students tuition is subsidized, lecturers’ pay is improved and those students already on 
<br/>scholarship, their allowances is readjusted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also note that use of grant is not scrutinised by Parliament, we have been 
<br/>hearing  a  lot  about  accountability  and  transparency,  so  these  grants  should  be  scrutinised  by 
<br/>Parliament.  We are dealing with public funds, and we need to be accountable as parliamentarians. 
<br/>Lecturers  in  certain  universities  are  merely  paid  peanuts.    For  example,  compare  the  salary  of  a 
<br/>lecturer with PhD at FNU to a Vice-Principal in a High School and an Assistant Lecturer’s salary to 
<br/>a High School Teacher.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tutors and support staff too are at a very low salary, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There has been a lot 
<br/>of talks that these grants are being abused, and we as legislators need to scrutinise the use of these 
<br/>grants,  the  type  of  course  offered,  the  length  of  course  offered,  the  job  market  (if  any)  when  the 
<br/>students graduate, capital projects, et cetera. These grants have been given for too long now without 
<br/>proper accountability and transparency,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  yesterday  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/>Accounts stated, “wherever taxpayer’s money is given directly or indirectly, it should be audited by 
<br/>the Office of Auditor-General.”  All grants given needs to be clearly scrutinised. If there is no abuse, 
<br/>no mismanagement of the fund, I do not think there should be any issue with these institutions in 
<br/>allowing Office of Auditor-General to audit the use of these grants. This is something that we need 
<br/>to start exploring in future and let us make an informed decision on the future of the grants given to 
<br/>tertiary institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Currently, the Higher Education Commission determines the 
<br/>amount, but the criteria used is not something that is vetted by this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suggest that we form a Parliamentary Committee to investigate the funding 
<br/>structure and criteria. Let the Committee do its report and present it back to Parliament and we as 
<br/>legislators make an informed decision.  I still stand that we need to use this grant to subsidise the 
<br/>tuition fees of close to 19,000 private students in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the End of Week Statement 
<br/>by the honourable Member in accordance with section 35(2) of the Standing Order.  Before that, I 
<br/>would just like to give a quick response on some of the issues that has been highlighted.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to clarify the 50 percent education grant, the grant has been paid of time for 100 
<br/>percent for Term 3, 100 percent for Term 1 and 50 percent up to July.  So, when the new financial 
<br/>year starts, that is when the other 50 percent, which is, August, that will be paid out. It should be paid 
<br/></span><span>out some time next week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the accountability issue, the honourable Member knows very well when 
<br/>he was part of the previous government, there was no accountability, lack of it, in terms of the funding 
<br/>from the Higher Education Grant.  I think if he had listened to my Ministerial Statement on Monday, 
<br/>he  would  have  noted  the  new  initiatives  that  were  undertaken  by  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  Loan 
<br/>Scheme (TSLS) that will capture over 10,000 students in the new initiatives and also the Hardship

<div><span>Scholarship that has been given for those students who have been studying on private arrangement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- You need to listen, there are 19,000 private students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- You should have listened on Monday to understand what was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Education  is  conscious  that  the  grants  released  to  tertiary  institutions  are 
<br/>taxpayer’s money.  As a Minister for Education, I have emphasised to all tertiary institutions to ensure 
<br/>that the funds are being used as intended and to ensure students are provided with education support.  
<br/>Fiji has a well-oiled workforce available for our future needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the 2024-2025 Financial Year, Government grants have been provided 
<br/>to 13 training institutions, three universities and 10 smaller Higher Education institutes.  The basis 
<br/>of  the  grant  assessment,  as  per  the  guidelines  of  the  Higher  Education  Commission  of  Fiji 
<br/>Regulations,  they  call  for  grants  made  each  year  and  the  training  institutions  submit  detailed 
<br/>applications including their annual costed Operating Plan, a yearly budget, current Annual Report, 
<br/>Annual Business Plan and the overall strategic plan. The Higher Education Institutions assesses the 
<br/>relevant documents and recommends the grant amount to be provided to each training institution.   
<br/>Grant request from the training institutions are usually much higher and the grants are usually given 
<br/>out based on the Higher Education Commission of Fiji’s assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the grants are approved in the National Budget, the grant agreements 
<br/>are prepared, vetted by the Solicitor-General’s Office and funds are disbursed on a quarterly basis.  
<br/>The total grant for the 2024-2025 Financial Year amounts to $90.7 million.  The grants are assessed 
<br/>based on the costs and the purposes intended. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, each tertiary institution is different from their varying courses offered and 
<br/>faculty  sizes,  so  cost  for  each  tertiary  institution  will  be  different.    This  cost  given  to  tertiary 
<br/>institutions  via  the  grant  will  always  cover  the  operational  costs,  including  salaries,  programme 
<br/>delivery, development of new programmes, research, rents, utility bills, advertisements, upgrading 
<br/>of IT systems, and the list goes on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How do we determine how much should be given to each higher education institution?  The 
<br/>process of grant is one of the Higher Education Commission Fiji’s mandated functions, as enshrined 
<br/>in  their  Regulation,  is  to  analyse  the  grant  usage  from  the  previous  year  and  following  careful 
<br/>assessment by the team, their acquittal is submitted against their costed operation plan, the strategic 
<br/>plan, the budget, and that is when they decide the grant that is given to that training institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  there  will  be  a  different  amount  given  to  higher  education 
<br/>institutions which is based on the utilisation rate and the programmes that they run.  For example, in 
<br/>the year 2024-2025, some education institutions requested higher amounts and some lower amounts.  
<br/>For example, for Fiji National University, Higher Education Commission of Fiji ascertains surplus 
<br/>funds from the analysis of their financials, then added back that surplus and then reduced the grants 
<br/>that are given to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disbursements  of  grants,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Higher  Education  of  Fiji’s  legislation  has 
<br/>provisions for fines and  suspension of registration if any Higher Education institute is  caught  for 
<br/>fraudulent act.  In terms of the calculation of grant on the fees, this can be part of the review of the 
<br/>universities that is currently conducted by the Higher Education of Fiji.

<div><span>End of Week Statement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, universities are regularly increasing their fees approved by their Councils, 
<br/>at  the  same  time,  requesting  for  grants.    This  needs  to  be  managed  better  and  hold  the  training 
<br/>institutions to be accountable and the Higher Education of Fiji, through the current review exercise, 
<br/>will ensure that strategies are identified and implemented that will have stronger accountability on 
<br/>the use of taxpayers’ funds.  The Government representatives on the respective university councils 
<br/>continue to be vigilant with the increasing fees or change in programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Higher Education Commission of Fiji’s legislation do not have the powers to monitor fee 
<br/>increase and this can be considered as a proposed way in the current review that is currently being 
<br/>conducted.  Government needs to consider investigating issues of increasing fees.  The review of the 
<br/>university is currently being conducted by external review team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  same  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  tertiary  institutions  need  to  monitor  academic 
<br/>progress  and  provide  intervention  and  learning  support  to  the  students,  as  I  have  mentioned  on 
<br/>Monday, and we all should equally share in encouraging our students to excel academically, as the 
<br/>future of our country depends on them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure this august House that the Ministry of Education, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>together with the Higher Education Commission, is more than ever vigilant about ensuring that the 
<br/>taxpayers of this country benefit from the Government Grants provided to the universities and other 
<br/>training institutions around Fiji.  </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu.

<div><span>National Statistics on Child Sex Abuse 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to pay tribute to the indigenous people 
<br/>of the world on this  International People’s Day, especially to the   </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people of the land, the 
<br/>Chiefs and its people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to talk about an issue that is difficult and has been a taboo, and I thank 
<br/>you for this time.  Sir, it is time for all of us, those of us in this House, but also our Civil Society 
<br/>Organisations, our communities, families and faith-based organisations, to confront the serious issue 
<br/>of child abuse and child sexual abuse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each month, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions release a shocking data that 
<br/>exposes the fact that we are failing our children on a daily basis.  Data from the Office of the DPP 
<br/>indicate that average age of the youngest victims of child sexual abuse in the past six years is two 
<br/>years old, and the youngest victim was six months old.  The average age of the youngest accused 
<br/>person is 12 years old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three  out  of  five  rape  cases  reported  are  against  children  and  23  births  out  of  thousand 
<br/>females are below the age of 18 years of age.  The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) data 
<br/>reveals that five out of every six children in Fiji suffer abuse or neglect by their family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me share more specific data obtained from the Fiji Police Force on child sexual abuse by 
<br/>specific offence reported in the years 2021 to 2023, including January to June 2024.  The year 2021 
<br/></span><span>recorded 729 cases, followed by an increase in 2022, with 1,034 cases, and then a decline in 2023 
<br/></span><span>with 844 cases.  The first six months of 2024 has so far recorded 324 cases, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The monthly average of recording child sexual abuse cases is 54, with rape being the most 
<br/>problem offence targeting children in Fiji.  Let me give some breakdown of the CSO’s data of the 
<br/>324 child sexual abuse cases that were reported during January to June 2024 period, that 13 to 17 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>

<div><span>1659 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years age group had the highest number of reported cases, that is 215, followed by the 6 to 12 years 
<br/>age group - 94, and the infant, Mr. Speaker, that is, zero to five years age group - 15.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rape was the most prevalent reported offence of 104 cases, followed by Indecent Assault of 
<br/>71 cases, and Sexual Assault of 60 cases.  Females were the overwhelming victims of child sexual 
<br/>abuse, accounting for 297 or 91.7 percent of the reported cases.  Male accounted for remaining 27 or 
<br/>abuse, accounting for 297 or 91.7 percent of the reported cases.  Male accounted for remaining 27 or 
<br/>8.3 percent of the cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though there appears to be a declining trend, raw statistics do not always tell the whole 
<br/>story, Mr. Speaker.  It is possible that with greater awareness of the dangers to young children, their 
<br/>parents or grandparents understand more clearly the threats to them and are exercising more care.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, any child that has to go through the trauma of abuse is one two many. 
<br/>These figures should be a source of shame and soul searching for us as a nation, and most importantly 
<br/>we must look seriously at what we are doing about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a nation we have to do better to protect our children. Fiji has rectified the Convention on 
<br/>the Rights of the Child in 1993, and more recently, is committed to National Action Plan to prevent 
<br/>violence against all women and girls.  Fiji, in 2001, has been committed to the Stockholm Declaration 
<br/>- an agenda for action against commercial sexual exploitation of children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government takes the matter of protection of our children as a high priority, 
<br/>and our Ministry has developed a separate Unit for Children.  Director and Child Protection Officers 
<br/>have been appointed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two Bills before Parliament - Child Protection Bill 2024 and Child Justice Bill 2024, 
<br/>which  will  enable  better  care  of  children  that  come  into  State  care  or  are  in  conflict  with  law. 
<br/>However, these children should not have to come through a legal system, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are a nation that prides itself in communal ties and love for our children. All our different 
<br/>traditions speak of high regard for children.  Then why, Mr. Speaker, are children suffering from 
<br/>abuse and trauma? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          We find children on the streets suffering neglect, children involved in drug trade, children as 
<br/>victims and children as perpetrators of crime. When we trace the children found on the streets, they 
<br/>are from single or broken families.  Single parentage is not a new phenomenon, but in the past, we 
<br/>saw stronger ownership from community and extended families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our society is changing rapidly, in some ways for the good and in other ways 
<br/>not so good. Many of the assumptions we make about family life are no longer whole, there are many 
<br/>single parent families passes or sometimes separated for work or other reasons, including working 
<br/>overseas.  Children are being sent to relatives in urban centres for education or back to rural areas for 
<br/>economic reasons. Sometimes to situations where unknown to them, there are sexual predators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we cannot generalise the choices some parents make or may be forced to make 
<br/></span><span>under the circumstances. There are many reasons for these choices and many parents may not realise 
<br/>the dangers which they are exposing their children to. It is the responsibility for all of us, to ensure 
<br/>children are protected from these dangers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         There are many studies that indicate that many abused children will go on to become abusers 
<br/>themselves. In a recent case, a 13 year old accused was a victim of rape at 6 years old by her own

<div><span>grandfather, who is still doing jail time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is  reported that five out  of six  children in  our community go through  abuse.   This  case 
<br/>teaches us a lesson. These children who are abused, if not rehabilitated and supported, could become 
<br/>abusers and we already see high levels of abuse in our community. While perpetrators get a second 
<br/>chance at life, a child that is abused loses his or her innocence and is traumatised for life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           It  is  most  challenging  to  counsel  and  rehabilitate  infants,  who  go  through  these  traumatic 
<br/>experiences at the hands of those who should have been their protectors. Sadly, we find that society, 
<br/>family and community members of the victims often blame them for the offence and ostracize them 
<br/>within their own homes, instead of offering them kindness, empathy and an environment of love and 
<br/>healing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each child abuse is traumatised for life.  We are dutybound to make every effort to look into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the issues surrounding the matter and to develop protection mechanisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Mr. Speaker, we have to look deep within our communities for help.  This is matter I have 
<br/>been  working  on  with  some  stakeholders  to  see  how  we  can  create  more  awareness  and  build 
<br/>protection  programmes,  and  I  am  calling  for  all  interested  people,  community  organisations  and 
<br/>agencies to assist and look for comprehensive community-based solutions, which will help protect 
<br/>our children and bring down the incidences of child sexual abuse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a great movement on creating awareness on the issue of drugs through Churches, 
<br/>through the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> and through the faith creations.  I call on all stakeholders and all religious state 
<br/>bodies to also add to the agenda the issue of child sexual abuse and create a network of protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          When we see suspicious circumstances surrounding children, it is each of our responsibility 
<br/>to take responsibility and report the matter to the Police. We also have a 24 hour toll free helpline 
<br/>number dedicated to the welfare of children.  Anyone can call and speak with professional counsellors 
<br/>who  are  ready  to  listen  to  challenges  faced  by  our  children  and  refer  for  help  and  support.  This 
<br/>number is 1325, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Children are precious gifts entrusted in our care. We owe it to the future to ensure our children 
<br/>receive the best care and protection.   I strongly believe that if we all commit, we can achieve it.  If I 
<br/>may  quote  Wesley  Kenneth  or  West  Stafford  as  he  is  known,  the  former  President  and  CEO  of 
<br/>Compassion International and an advocate for children, I quote: “If we nurture the dreams of children, 
<br/>the world will be blessed. If we destroy them the world is doomed”. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, and honourable Members of Parliament, we have heard from the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister regarding the prevalence of the abuse of children in our nation, and what it means 
<br/>for the future of this country.  Yet, we still keep going and doing the same thing day after day, or we 
<br/>can draw a line in the sand now.  We can do that by recognising that protecting children is everyone’s 
<br/>business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you have heard the statistics, five out of six children in Fiji are abused or neglected by 
<br/>their family.  Surely, every honourable Member of this Parliament cannot accept this statistic.  Every 
<br/>one of these children carries a story of lasting hurt and trauma that will impact their adult lives.  If 
<br/>we do not act urgently, we risk a deeply traumatised generation where cycles of abuse will continue 
<br/>on to their children and their children’s children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In May this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this very Parliament, as mentioned by the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister, we introduced two landmark Bills - the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024and 
<br/>the Child Justice Bill 2024.  Laws to protect children are indispensable to changing the landscape, 
<br/>but laws alone will not protect children.  Every Ministry and every member of our community needs 
<br/>to commit to this journey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot just stand by and tolerate this, because the standard we walk past 
<br/>is the standard we accept.  But it will take all Ministries working together, not just the Ministry of 
<br/>Women, Children and Social Protection.  It will take both sides of the House working together, taking 
<br/>leadership in your role in keeping our children safe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  relieved  that  finally  after  18  months,  the  Opposition  has  appointed  their  Shadow 
<br/>Ministers for the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection.  I acknowledge the honourable 
<br/>Virendra Lal from the C-16 and honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu from the C-9 plus two or three.  I 
<br/>look forward to working with you both honourable Members to advance the welfare of our children 
<br/>in our beloved Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are going to need the help of our traditional structures, the strength of our diverse cultures, 
<br/>and of the many strong faiths across our country, to help us drive this change.  This is why it is with 
<br/>great honour, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to announce to you today that the Government through the Ministry, 
<br/>plans to embark upon a National Action Plan to eliminate violence against children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The world’s largest study on Childhood Adversity shows that adults who experience abuse, 
<br/>neglect  and  traumatised  children  are  far  more  likely  to  suffer  long  term  intellectual,  behavioural, 
<br/>physical and mental health problems.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this plan is not just the Government owned action plan.  We need every 
<br/>community and every citizen to feel that it is also part of them too.  The pillars of the Action Plan 
<br/>will be strengthened by our cultures, by our identity, but its substance also needs to embody children’s 
<br/>rights, their development and their wellbeing.  We want to give all of Fiji’s children the best future 
<br/>they can possibly imagine.  The plan will be grounded in all the elements that science, our culture, 
<br/>communities, faith, tell us will support families and communities in raising children to protect them 
<br/>from harm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our National Action Plan should hold the ambition that every dimension of Fiji’s 
<br/>Government,  traditional  structures  and  community  mechanisms,  faith-based  organisations,  civil 
<br/>society organisations must see to protecting children from harm as their responsibility.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why should every part of our society want to embrace this Plan? If we support our families 
<br/>in our communities, stop abusing and neglecting children, I believe we will see a safer Fiji. It cannot

<div><span>End of Week Statement

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just be the role of the Government, of the Minister, of the Fiji Police Force, of the DPP, of Civil 
<br/>Society  Organisations  -  it  will  be  a  call  to  return  the  responsibility  back  on  our  families  and  our 
<br/>communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Plan together with the two new Bills that are being proposed will put us on the cusp of 
<br/>generational change. Children who grow are protected, nurtured, supported and loved will become 
<br/>adults who create a stronger and even more successful Fiji.  So, as I mentioned, this would need to 
<br/>be a whole of Government, whole of society and whole of community approach.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  look  forward  to  the  convening  next  month  of  our  National  Taskforce  on  Pornography 
<br/>between the Ministry of Communications and our Ministry as co-chairs, to look at the harmful effects 
<br/>of pornography and to ban the access of pornography to children as well as regulating the access of 
<br/>pornography  in  our  country.    There  is  anecdotal  evidence  of  the  will  be  connection  between 
<br/>pornography and violence against children and women.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Communications for the commitment to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to make sure that every system and workforce that deal with children everyday a 
<br/>held to account and I am not just talking about our schools, but when we are talking about our sports 
<br/>fields, communities, faith-based organisations and even families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of perpetrators against children are family members. So, the homes 
<br/>are not safe. What are we going to do about it as a nation? This is a call to action. The National Action 
<br/>Plan will need to be able to look at this and how we can support families to keep our children safer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our Child Justice Bill takes us so much closer to dealing with our children in 
<br/>conflict with the law. Looking at a diversion programme to divert our children away from the criminal 
<br/>justice  system  and  to  be  put  safely  where  they  will  be  nurtured  and  re-integrated  back  into  their 
<br/>families and communities because putting them in the criminal justice system is not working. The 
<br/>rates of recidivism and reoffending is much higher.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for a diverse unified Fiji to prosper, we cannot traumatise this generation.  I call 
<br/>on all Members to unite together in this purpose and vision to be able to help our children to be safe 
<br/>and to look at their welfare and wellbeing for a better future for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  I  am  just  wondering  what  has  happened  to  the 
<br/>cybercrime that we are signatory to?  Is that something that we have tapped into? And hearing all 
<br/>these crimes from both you and your honourable Assistant Minister, it kind of bothers me whether 
<br/>we have been taking effect of our signatory to that Budapest Convention or not. I would rather we 
<br/>hear from you  on what has happened to the reports that you have lodged, because we are signatory 
<br/>to the Budapest Convention.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, three pillars of the </span><span>vanua</span><span> are very closely laced together - the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, our 
<br/>natural resources and our culture.  Drugs have easily penetrated the </span><span>vanua </span><span>because of the cracks in 
<br/>our  societal  structure  which  have  allowed  this  to  spread  unchecked.  The  present  Government 
<br/>recognised this very early when we came into office particularly the damage it had caused, not only 
<br/>in the urban environment but also within our iTaukei communities.  This problem is further enhanced 
<br/>by the decline in traditional </span><span>vanua </span><span>governance seen in the past few years. People have accused the 
<br/></span><span>vanua</span><span> of neglect assuming it has not done or taken any action to address the drug problem. Drugs in 
<br/>the </span><span>vanua</span><span> is a massive problem and requires a comprehensive approach and we will use the tools at 
<br/>our disposal to confront the problems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done, we have taken a proactive approach with the </span><span>Veitarogi</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Vanua</span><span> visiting villages to fill vacant traditional titles.  Previously, they only entered the village when 
<br/>there  was  a  title  dispute.    This  approach  was  entirely  new  to  villages  and  was  met  with  great 
<br/>enthusiasm  and  gratitude.    We  need  to  demonstrate  that  we  are  committed  to  filling  the  vacant 
<br/>traditional titles as it is a crucial step in addressing the drug problem in Fiji, but we will not rest there. 
<br/>Our training team will follow shortly.  Traditional leaders must be capacitated.  Mr. Speaker, that is 
<br/>hands on actively for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  policy  level,  the  localisation  process  is  currently  underway  for  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Declarations on the Right of Indigenous People. The consultations are almost completed, and we will 
<br/>soon  take  it  to  Cabinet  with  the  village  guidelines.    Laws  and  legislations  will  be  reviewed 
<br/>particularly those dealing with natural resources. There is no other way to alleviate poverty for the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>  A dynamic rural economy that utilises natural resources from the land to sea will provide 
<br/>another option for our villagers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Say No to Drugs” is not just about traditional leadership, it is also about commercialising 
<br/>our  natural  resources  to  fight  poverty.  The  Government  is  already  taking  concrete  steps  towards 
<br/>achieving  it.    The  review  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  institutions  is  currently  underway  with  two  primary 
<br/>objectives being the economic empowerment and the strengthening of traditional governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, culture can play a significant role in the fight against drugs by providing a 
<br/>strong sense of identity and community.  Last year, I attended the Melanesian Arts Festival and this 
<br/>year the Festival of Pacific Arts.  It was an eye opener.  Those who underestimate the significance of 
<br/>culture  to  confront  the  serious  issues  like  drugs,  often  overlook  the  powerful  influence  it  has  on 
<br/></span><span>community resilience and individual behaviour.  While inspired by the two festivals, Fiji is already 
<br/></span><span>on  the  course  to  further  integrate  cultural  heritage  into  the  National  Development  Strategy.  
<br/>Community empowerment and iTaukei villages would be impacted the most.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, for the first time, we have been resourced with Cultural Officers for the Provinces, 
<br/>as has been addressed by the honourable Assistant Minister.  It is part of the implementation of the 
<br/>National Cultural Policy.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1665 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, filling  the vacant  traditional title is  just the beginning,  not  an end.   Our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategy must include all pillars of the </span><span>Vanua </span><span>for long term success.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ignorance has long undermined the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>which now seeks proper recognition.  From the 
<br/>Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports yesterday, we have witnessed 
<br/>the  successful  of  the  support  of  the  </span><span>Vanua  </span><span>to  the  Government,  and  we  will  continue  to  seek  the 
<br/></span><span>Vanua</span><span>’s support to the Government and also to religious organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also see that the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> takes education seriously, as that will be the way forward for 
<br/>our community.  Strengthening the three pillars of the </span><span>Vanua </span><span>is essential, otherwise, our efforts will 
<br/>merely be seen as well-intended but insufficient.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu, Turaga Sipika.
