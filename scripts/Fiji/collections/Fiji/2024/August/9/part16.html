<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  we  adjourn,  honourable  Members,  for  your  information,  the 
<br/>following  are  Back  to  Office  Reports  -  Reports  that,  kind  of,  described  the  tours  that  we  (Fiji 
<br/>Parliament) undertook to attend regional meetings.  I usually lead the delegation and then there is 
<br/>one or two from the Opposition and Government side who travels with us.  When a group makes a 
<br/>tour, it is proper that they compile a report when they come back and this report is highlighted in the 
<br/>House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two Back to Office Reports - the first one is on our Official Visit to the Parliament 
<br/>of  Victoria  and  the  second  is  on  the  Indonesia-Pacific  Parliamentary  Partnership  (IPPP)  Meeting 
<br/>which was held in Jakarta, Indonesia.  That meeting was an interesting one whereby we encountered 
<br/>a kind of preparation that was completely different because we were hoping, through Fiji’s support 
<br/>and how we were able to kind of describe it, the inroads that they have made into West Papua, so 
<br/>there was a kind of a bilateral arrangement between the MSG comprising of Fiji, Papua New Guinea 
<br/>and the Solomon Islands together with them, but the theme of the meeting was IPPP in the Pacific.  
<br/>So, we told the Madam Speaker, “This is good, but this is only to do with MSG.  The rest of the 
<br/>Pacific that you want is there, down on the ground floor.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the things that we learn as we go to these kind of meetings because of the 
<br/>heavy investment they have undertaken in the resource rich country of West Papua.  I told them that 
<br/>before coming to this meeting, we had a huge protest outside our Parliament.  It was to do with West 
<br/>Papua  and  there  are  other  countries  from  the  Pacific,  like  New  Caledonia  -  the  Kanaks,  who  are 
<br/>seeking their independence and these have been long outstanding issues.  That is why we have seen 
<br/>it fit to have these Reports be made available in the Library for reference.  So, when you go there to 
<br/>do your research, these Reports will be available to you.
