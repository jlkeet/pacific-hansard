<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for this week.  I also welcome those 
<br/>sitting in the gallery, </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>. I acknowledge the presence of Mrs. Kamikamica and Ms. Makereta 
<br/>Waqavonovono.    I  also  welcome  all  those  joining  us  in  the  gallery  and  those  watching  the 
<br/>proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings 
<br/>of Parliament.

<div><span>2024 Women’s Mock Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, last week, we conducted the 2024Fji Women’s Mock Parliament after 
<br/>a lapse of seven years.  Under the direction of the Steering Committee, 58 women were chosen from 
<br/>a total of 140 applications received. The number gave us an indication that women are eager to take 
<br/>up leadership positions and participate in our democratic processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Women’s Mock Parliament gave them the opportunity to learn more about parliament, 
<br/>its key functions and procedures, the important role of Parliamentary committees and understanding 
<br/>some key policy issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of us sat in the gallery during their debates and it was encouraging to hear the issues 
<br/>discussed and the research done by these women in the short time given to them.  I am amazed of the 
<br/>confidence that they portrayed, their poise and how they delivered. These kinds of opportunities, if 
<br/>provide, more women  will participate in the democratic and  decision-making processes, and they 
<br/>will become change makers in their communities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also acknowledge the generous support of the governments of Australian, Japan and New 
<br/>Zealand through the UNDP under the Fiji Parliament Support Project towards the Women’s Mock 
<br/>Parliament, and given that the project is not permanent, I call on the Government through the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance to acknowledge the significance and importance of such an activity and therefore support 
<br/>Parliament’s budget submission for such events in the future.

<div><span>Honourable Ratu J.B. Niudamu will replace honourable F.S. Koya 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Honourable Members and we will proceed to the next item.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. - Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to raise a Point of Order on Standing 
<br/>Order 114(4).  This is a Point of Order and also a dissenting motion.  The Standing Order 114(4) 
<br/>reads: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Each  party  is,  as  far  as  possible,  entitled to  be represented  on  each  standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committee in a way that fairly reflects that party’s representation in Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Standing Order 4, in the Definition of party, Standing Order 4(2) allows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“… three or more independent members who have formed a working relationship for 
<br/>the  purposes  of  participating  in  parliamentary  business  in  relation  to  which  these 
<br/>Standing Orders … must be treated as a party…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  for  allowing  us  to  remain  here  as  Independent  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and for allowing us to work in different blocs that we have decided to be in the bloc on 
<br/>our side, the bloc of 16 and the bloc of 9.  We really thank you from the bottom of our hearts. But in 
<br/>Standing Order 114, it is clear that it says, the intent of this is representation in Standing Committees 
<br/>should be proportional to the party’s representation in Parliament.  In this case we are not a party, we 
<br/>are just a bloc, but if you look at the totality of the Opposition Independent Members, we are a total 
<br/>of 26. If we look at the percentage in that 26 that comprises of the Group of 16, we make up 61.5 
<br/>percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would submit, Sir, in accordance with this Standing Order that the proportion of places in 
<br/>Standing Committees for this bloc of 16 should be 61.5 or close to 62 percent, and that is the ground 
<br/>on which I am making this Standing Order.  I do not know how else to suggest it in accordance with 
<br/>the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank you for raising that issue again.  That has been raised with me by 
<br/></span><span>honourable Koya several times because of the numbers, but again, let me make myself very clear 
<br/>here.  Before all this happened, I had written a letter to each and every 26 honourable Member for 
<br/>you to decide when the axe falls from the Supervisor of Elections on the deregistration, what would 
<br/>you choose yourself to be, either you become an Independent or you join other political parties.  All 
<br/>of you decided, some wrote to me, some stated during their participation of the debate in the House 
<br/>that all elected to be Independents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>By being Independent, honourable Usamate, you are not a political party.  By operation of 
<br/>law, you have decided.  You came in through the party system but by operation of law, you are now 
<br/>deemed as Independent. So as such, we have played it our level best to see how we can have you all 
<br/>participating effectively in these Standing Committees, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I have decided that you all remain Independent, and you become the blocs - Bloc 
<br/>16 and Bloc 9, and each of you select your Whip, even your Leader and most of all, it has to have 
<br/>the  written  approval  of  all  your  Members.    The  16  I  have  received  with  the  exception  of  one, 
<br/>honourable Alvick Maharaj, who is still pursuing his case of appeal with the Supervisor of Elections.  
<br/>The rest, you are all Independent and you are categorised according to your wish, you go with the 9 
<br/>or the 16, and I hope if we could stay that way until we finish this term.  It is a bit difficult for us, but 
<br/>we just have to make do with whatever is there to help us decide on the best course that you maintain 
<br/>the way you think and the way you want to decide as well as the Group of 9.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes I hear that it is  good, that you have  agreed to  come together.  You have  even 
<br/>agreed to come together during the Business Committee in sharing the questions, that is the way to 
<br/>go because effectively, you all come from one party, but as I stated, by operation of law, when the 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections has to deregister the party, it is the voters that put you in Parliament, you are 
<br/>not sacked from Parliament.  You are still a Member of Parliament, but you now work in groups 
<br/>because you cannot be working together as one, even though you came through one party, but this is 
<br/>how you operate.  That again, is democracy.  You are just showing the true colours of democracy 
<br/>that exist now, otherwise this would not have happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maybe  we  could  be  going  for  a  by-election  for  all  the  26  seats  and  that  will  not  happen 
<br/>because that is the way I see as you being deemed Independent.  When you came through, you came 
<br/>through FijiFirst Party, but the stage of events has happened, so you are now still in the House as 
<br/>Independent under the two working groups.  I hope you can continue to work together.  That is all 
<br/>my reply to you honourable Usamate and also for the queries being raised by honourable Koya to me 
<br/>after the Business Committee.  I hope that provides a satisfactory answer to all your queries about 
<br/>who you are now in the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I raise another matter?</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your explanation…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Usually  honourable  Usamate,  the  directive  given  by  the  Speaker  is  not 
<br/>questionable.  If you want to question, take it to the Courts.  I made that decision, but I am allowing 
<br/>it, since I want to encourage more conversation.  What is your next point? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Sir, for your magnanimity in allowing me to just ask this 
<br/>question.  The question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my understanding, forgive me for my ignorance if I am 
<br/>wrong, is that the honourable Leader of the Opposition would be the one that would nominate the 
<br/>people to take up the seats in the Standing Committees, so in this particular case, is that still in order 
<br/></span><span>or is that no longer in order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- In the Standing Committees, the honourable Leader of the Opposition was 
<br/>elected through the Constitution and that was done in this august House. By virtue of that, he still 
<br/>maintain his seat because none of you have come forward with the suggestion that you change it.  
<br/>That is the only way we will change it - in the House.  But inasfar as his role, that is now being kind 
<br/>of curtailed by that operation of law, you are all deemed as Independents including him, but by virtue 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1625 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of him being selected or elected in the House under the Constitution, he still maintains his Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition.  The rest, you and I can understand, it is a bit difficult for him to continue in that 
<br/>regard when the rest of the Members are all regarded as Independent.  Am I making myself clear? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Anyone else is still not clear of who they are right now in the House? 
<br/></span></div>
