<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response to 
<br/>that question.  My question is related to what he has just mentioned, that for village improvement 
<br/>and sanitation, the Team monitors until it is completed. My question to him is, once the improvements 
<br/>are made, how do you ensure that, that improvement continues and not that it reverts back to what it 
<br/>was before? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Village Improvement Scheme, what we have seen 
<br/></span><span>for the past few years is the deteriorating of the standard of our village. This programme, we will try 
<br/>and continue.  Once you are being assisted, that is not the end of it.  We will continue to make sure 
<br/>the overall village improves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro</span><span>  and  the  </span><span>Nasi  ni  Koro</span><span>,  whom  we  will  be  relying  on  to  help  us  in 
<br/>maintaining.  The actual reason behind this is, we need to improve the standard of living of our people

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last two days, we have discussed about the ablution in the city and towns.  We really 
<br/>need to look at that.  If we need for them to come and use the public toilets in the towns, we need to 
<br/>improve those that are in the village.  It is an issue for Fiji realistically.  If we go anywhere, we have 
<br/>seen how clean is the public space, especially when everyone is using it.  The Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/>wants to take it to the village level, to make sure they look after it, because that is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a question to the honourable Minister on 
<br/>community halls. Given the experience in the past, community halls are used as evacuation centres.  
<br/>My question to the honourable Minister is on the standards and the plan, whether it goes through the 
<br/>same  approval  process  in  terms  of  housing,  because  previously  we  had  community  halls  that 
<br/>collapsed, but they were used as evacuations centres?  My question is basically on the standards of 
<br/>these community halls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a good question.  We have already discussed it with 
<br/>our team.  From the next budget, we will not be touching community halls, it is just because of that.  
<br/>We need an engineer and a specialised team to look at the structure and things like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will leave the community halls to the Ministry of Rural Development, and we will just 
<br/>take care of the small ones, because we do not have the expertise.  But for the ones that we are doing 
<br/>now, we have advised the team to make sure the structure is done properly, but for the next one, we 
<br/>will leave it for the Ministry of Rural Development to take care of the community halls.  We might 
<br/>just be doing the repair to make sure it is in a good standard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  That  is  a  good  question.    In  my  village  in  Somosomo,  we  take  it  upon 
<br/>ourselves to do the maintenance of all our meeting our houses, the Church and everything, because 
<br/>help from the Government should go elsewhere because we can do it on our own.  That is how we 
<br/>should be ensuring that the small money that is set aside for such purposes is distributed to those who 
<br/>are really in need, especially when it comes to disaster centres.  It is not easy, but we have been doing 
<br/>it for the last so many years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We took a leaf from Buca Village in Natewa - Niko Nawaikula’s village, and in Drekeniwai.  
<br/>They do their own fundraising to see that these village halls and churches are fully funded, because 
<br/>they also act as disaster centres.  I think it is upon us, leaders, that we should be ensuring that we 
<br/>continue to forge ahead in this area without relying too much on Government funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Training Offered for PRB Tenants 
<br/>(Question No. 158/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, before I ask my question, I would like to wish the 
<br/>people of Fiji the Happy World Indigenous Day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the type of training offered to tenants of the Public Rental Board? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that from SDGs - the World Indigenous Day? What do you mean by this, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- United Nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is interesting. So, it is World Indigenous Day today. I think we should 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1645 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be celebrating that and be happy as well as we live in a country that recognizes indigenous freedom, 
<br/>et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Tuiwailevu  for  the 
<br/>question.    The  Public  Rental  Board  (PRB)  was  established  in  1989  to  provide  transitional  rental 
<br/>housing accommodation to low income earners around the country.  The PRB flats are rented out to 
<br/>low income earners at  a very  affordable  weekly  rate  and they  are assisted in  annual  Government 
<br/>funded rental subsidy assistance.  In the last financial year, there were 813 families or tenants that 
<br/>were assisted with the Government subsidy of $1.2. million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the purpose of the flats are to serve as transitional flat for tenants, 
<br/>occupants or tenants are expected to exit the PRB flats after six years to allow others on the waiting 
<br/>list to be accommodated.  The migrating tenants are expected to move into the new homes after six 
<br/>years in any PRB estate. Unfortunately, due the challenges of accessing affordable homes in the real 
<br/>estate market, there has been a low rate in migration to home ownership by the PRB sitting tenants.  
<br/>To  assist  and  promote  economic  and  financial  empowerment  to  the  sitting  tenants,  the  Board 
<br/>continues to liaise with financial institutions and the Ministry of Trade and Commerce to conduct 
<br/>financial literacy trainings for the past 18 months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  sole  objective  of  these  trainings  is  to  improve  budget  management  skills  as  well  as 
<br/>promote savings among the tenants. Some of the tenants that attended the trainings can access Small 
<br/>Business Grant from the Ministry of Trade and Commerce after being awarded training certificates.  
<br/>I thank the honourable Minister as well and his Ministry for assisting and also providing tenants to 
<br/>some of the sitting tenants around our PRB estates.  Such initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the PRB 
<br/>helps  in  preparing  tenants  to  access  a  stable  income  to  support  their  families  and  to  know  the 
<br/>significance of savings which will allow them to purchase their own home after migrating from the 
<br/>PRB estate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a total of four financial literacy trainings conducted by PRB on financial literacy 
<br/>training  and  small  business  in  the  Central  Division.  These  trainings  were  accommodated  by  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Trade  and  Commerce.  The  trainings  were  held  in  the  following  Estates  -  Raiwai, 
<br/>Newtown, Mead Road and McFarlane Estate with a total of 123 tenants attending the training and 
<br/>around 60 percent of the tenants applied for the grant and awaiting outcome of their applications. 
<br/>The  effectiveness  of  these  trainings  has  led  four  tenants  from  Mead  Road  Estate  to  receive 
<br/>Government grants and are currently running their own small businesses; two of the four tenants have 
<br/>their own vegetables and fruits stalls along Mead Road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Board  has  also  a  PRB  office  in  the  North  and  also  conducted  eight 
<br/>financial  leaderships  trainings  which  were  hosted  by  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  and  Consumer 
<br/>Council. A total of 323 tenants participated in these trainings in four estates. They are in Tuatua in 
<br/>Labasa, Naqere in Savusavu, as well as Naodamu and Vunimoli Estates. The result of these trainings 
<br/>has shown in the number of tenants that have started their own small businesses such as planting, 
<br/>selling produce in the market to assist in their rent payments and women’s clubs also being formed 
<br/>in Naodamu Estate in Labasa that allowed women in this estate to sell their farm produce, mats, food 
<br/>packs and also assist them in their savings for their respective families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Development  Bank  and  Unit  Trust  of  Fiji  have  also  carried  awareness  in  several 
<br/>estates in the Western Division. Various programmes include assistance that institutions are willing 
<br/>to offer to the tenants. The Public Rental Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue its work to assist 
<br/>their tenants in practicing skills related to budgeting, savings and to prepare them for uncertain times 
<br/>consequently enabling them to achieve important financial goals.

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  and  I  also  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>response. Honourable Minister my question to you is related to the programmes that you deliver in 
<br/>the Public Rental Board. How do you gauge the change in financial behaviour of the tenants who 
<br/>have received this training? you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>An interesting feature about families or tenants that live in these Public Rental Board Estates, these 
<br/>are all low income earners and some do not have fixed employment and …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  There is running commentary going on in front of me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- The programme  that has been initiated by Public Rental Board 
<br/>is  a  new  initiative  and  because  they  are  mostly  low  income  earners,  some  are  just  single  income 
<br/>earners  with  their  families,  some  have  struggled  and  with  this  type  of  assistance,  especially  the 
<br/>women, they have gone further after obtaining certificates.  They have assisted their families, not 
<br/>only in the repayment of their monthly rental, they have also assisted in other family needs in their 
<br/>respective families.  So overall, there is financial as well as economic empowerment to all those who 
<br/>have attended the trainings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank    the  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/>information that is provided about the training of tenants at PRB. The question is, during COVID 
<br/>some  of  the  tenants  had  accumulated  in  arrears  and  if  the  Ministry  or  Government  can  consider 
<br/>forgiving those arrears, given most of them are low income earners - security guards, elderly women 
<br/>and some are single mothers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is a very valid statement that has 
<br/>been provided to us this afternoon by the honourable Member. Because of the financial background 
<br/>of these sitting tenants, majority of them faced financial difficulties in trying to pay or meet their 
<br/>monthly  repayments  and  some  of  their  payments  have  gone  into  arrears.    The  Board  in  the  last 
<br/>financial year have also assisted in forgiving some of the arrears that were accrued by some of the 
<br/>sitting tenants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will press on, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Thank you.  Some have requested to  attend their midday  prayers, and  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have allowed that as well.

<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>The project benefits and beneficiaries of each project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask for permission to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some general comments before I answer the written question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Alright, you do not like the question or what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>
<br/>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I do have the answer.  The pattern of the questioning in terms 
<br/>of what the Opposition has been asking, so throughout my Ministry, we have provided the details to-
<br/>date of the breakdowns.  I am thinking about the separation of powers of the Executive, Parliament 
<br/>and the Judiciary.  In the last Parliament when we were in the Opposition…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is full of wisdom, what you have stated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- When we were in Opposition, these kinds of questions never 
<br/>got through from our side in the Business Committee.  I know that you are not the individuals you 
<br/>were at that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are now reformed.  I noticed a big change have overcome you so the whole nation is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grateful for that, but still I am …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- They have seen the light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Even though the light has resulted in sort of disintegration but 
<br/>still we have seen the light. That is the question.  Just from my perspective as a Minister in terms of 
<br/>Parliament  and  the  Executive,  the  principle  there  is  as  a  government,  we  are  elected  and  the 
<br/>Parliament oversees, but we run, I suppose uninterferred as the Executive or the management of the 
<br/>ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, when we are given the authority to operationalise the budget into programmes and 
<br/>implementation, we do it on the assumption that there would not be any political interference, but 
<br/>with  the  provision  of  these  kinds  of  detailed  information,  there  is  the  danger  in  that,  that  the 
<br/>prioritisation according to what the civil servants have given us in the budget can be politicised in 
<br/>this Parliament with …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Be transparent, don’t worry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what he is trying to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not saying that it will happen, what I am saying is there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the danger of that. It relates back to the separation of powers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point, as the Executive, in any organisation structure you report as a manager to the 
<br/>Chief Executive.  So, I report to my Chief Executive who is the honourable Prime Minister, but now 
<br/>I feel I have two Chief Executives - the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span> Editor’s Note:  Reply to Written Question No. 159/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meteorological Services and Transport under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure I.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- This is Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is what I am saying, exactly that is what I am saying.  
<br/>Now the Parliament is infringing on my reporting line because of the provision of this information 
<br/>which can result in them doing that.  So, these are just some general observations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Now, you are begging us even to ask more questions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am just making some general observations in terms of the 
<br/>management  of  the  State  as  per  the  Judiciary,  the  Executive  and  Parliament. The  demarcation  is 
<br/>becoming  confused  because  now  I  feel  that  someone  else  is  monitoring  my  performance  when 
<br/>Parliament should really be referring to the Annual Report of the Ministry to oversee and the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Reports.  When those reports on the Ministry and the Auditor-General’s Reports comes in, 
<br/>that is when the Opposition comes in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- But now with that information, it is like …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- How do we hold you accountable? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  given  me  the  right  to  raise  these 
<br/>fundamental issues of democracy.  The demarcation is there but we are crossing the lines, and it can 
<br/>result in confusion, which is what is happening now.  Because we are a Government with a good 
<br/>heart, we are not like the last government which did not provide information and blocked things at 
<br/>the Business Committee, I hereby give you the information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have stated this on more than one occasion and 
<br/>that  is  for  the  Opposition,  the  only  punch  that  they  can  score  with  is  on  questions.    For  the 
<br/>Government side, whether we like it or not, we just have to ensure that we have everything on the 
<br/>fingertips so when question time arises, that is when they throw everything at us.  I remember when 
<br/>we were in the Opposition, the Government needs to change their tactics in answering questions. 
<br/>They did not want to ask specifically for roads from our constituents but rather for the whole of the 
<br/>nation roads, it is quite difficult but that is the game that they played in the past government. We had 
<br/>to follow, but it kept us raising questions all the time.  So, honourable Minister, with due respect to 
<br/>your answers being supplied on time, I humbly ask you that you please take on the questions, come 
<br/>what may and just reply; that is all.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Before I ask the question, may I congratulate the Baby Bula Boys Under 
<br/>16 soccer team and the management for their fine performance against Tahiti.  This is the first time 
<br/>in history they have qualified to play the Under 17 World Cup in 2025. I was watching Junior Shankar 
<br/></span><span>playing and it really inspired my son, Krish who is at Nehru Primary School.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Were you watching soccer during Parliamentary hours?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1649 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH. – No, this game was yesterday.  I was not watching today but I did watch it 
<br/>yesterday evening and I enjoyed the game.  So, I would like to congratulate the coach, the managers 
<br/>and the players as well.  Fine job boys, keep it up!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I ask my question, I was just hoping that the honourable Minister will not argue, like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how he argued with his Lelean OB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of Lighthouses Around Fiji  
<br/>(Question No. 160/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform  Parliament  on  the  status  of  the  various  lighthouses  around  Fiji,  how  many  are 
<br/>operational and how many are not, and what are the plans to repair, replace and maintain the 
<br/>lighthouses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Just to clarify, I was not arguing with honourable Usamate, it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>was just some observation.  Sir, I have the answer to the written question, and I have been very 
<br/>cooperative.  The next time, I will not give it when it comes to this session. 
<br/></span></div>
