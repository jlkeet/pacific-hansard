<br/>therefore it is more feasible to just replace them. 
<br/>This  outboard  engine  is  for  Lautoka  Oil  Spill 
<br/>response boat, which needs to be a reliable and 
<br/>efficient engine to be on standby 24/7.

<div><span>ANNEXURE II 
<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/>Reply to Written Question No. 160/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works, 
<br/>Meteorological Services and Transport (Ref. Pages: 1649)  
<br/></span><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS, METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES  
<br/>AND TRANSPORT  
<br/>(Hon. Ro F.Q. Tuisawau) 
<br/></span><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/>Response to Question No. 160/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has a total of 69 lighthouses located across its various islands and coastal regions, serving as 
<br/>critical aids for maritime navigation and safety. Out of these, 51 lighthouses which equates to 73 
<br/>percent, are currently operational. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 18 non-operational lighthouses, representing 17 percent of the total lighthouses. Most 
<br/>of these lighthouses were damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, which was one of the 
<br/>most powerful cyclones  to  ever hit  Fiji, causing  widespread  devastation.  The force of  the 
<br/>cyclone  resulted  in  significant  structural  damage  to  many  of  these  vital  navigational  aids, 
<br/>rendering them inoperative and highlighting the urgent need for repair and restoration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out  of  the  18  non-operational  lighthouses,  the  Maritime  Safety  Authority  of  Fiji  (MSAF) 
<br/>successfully  repaired and brought back into operation three lighthouses in  the last financial 
<br/>year (2023/2024). These lighthouses are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Lautoka Harbour - Pinder Reef Light; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Beqa Island - South West Reef  Light; and 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Suva Harbour - North East End Light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MSAF has a comprehensive plan to commit, through its budgetary allocations, to repair and make 
<br/>operational a total of three lighthouses per year over the next five years, from 2024 to 2029. The 
<br/>three lighthouses scheduled for the 2024/2025 financial year are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Beqa Island - Nawamati Point  Light; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Makogai Island Light; and 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Lau Group - Vatoa Island Light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  in  the  2024/2025  financial  year,  Government  has  allocated  budget  to  MSAF, 
<br/>through its Aids to Navigation Capital Allocation, to construct 21 Light Beacons from Natovi to 
<br/>Ovalau  and  Natovi  to  Nabouwalu,  which  are  among  the  most  congested  and  frequently  used 
<br/>navigational passages in Fiji, operating 24/7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond lighthouses, the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) also maintains various other 
<br/></span><span>Aids to Navigation (ATONS) structures to ensure safe maritime travel. These include Light 
<br/>Beacons, Leading Beacons, and Navigation Buoys. Currently, there are a total of 14 Light 
<br/>Beacons, of which 13 are operational and one is non-operational. 
<br/></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>Additionally, there are 4 Leading Beacons, with 3 being operational and one non-operational. 
<br/>Furthermore, there are 13 Navigation Buoys, with 10 operational and 3 non-operational. These 
<br/>ATONS structures are crucial for guiding vessels safely through Fiji's waters, and MSAF  is 
<br/>committed to their ongoing maintenance and repair to uphold maritime safety standards.
