<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40, the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Justice; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; and 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. I will 
<br/>also invite the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his designate, to speak for five minutes. There will 
<br/>be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  now  call  on  the  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  to  deliver  his 
<br/>Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, honourable Usamate stood up to point 
<br/>out that a Ministerial Statement presented yesterday was possibly an attempt to cut out a question 
<br/>that was going to come.  This one is also the same, and I apologise to honourable Koya, this is in 
<br/>response or in relation to the question he was going to ask at question time.  I have sent in my apology 
<br/>that I may not be present during question time in the afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that has given 
<br/>me time to give honourable Koya the information he is seeking in his oral question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Measures and Initiatives to Promote Productivity in the Civil Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen, and I also welcome the students and teachers who are with us this morning in 
<br/>the gallery; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka, </span><span>good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to make this Statement, and as I have said, it 
<br/>is in response to one of the questions that was relisted to be asked for oral response this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, I will not be available.  I will ask for your leave to be absent from the afternoon 
<br/>session to be with the Right Honourable Senator Penny Wong, looking over the Hospital under the 
<br/>guidance of the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, and working on how we are 
<br/>going to renovate the Hospital.  It is very fitting that the Government of Australia will be helping us 
<br/></span><span>in this, as it is the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, and the war in which many Fijians left our shores 
<br/></span><span>and joined the Australian, British and the New Zealand Army. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Civil  Service  is  the  key  arm  of  the  Government  machinery  and  is 
<br/>essential  for  the  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of  Government  services  and  work  programmes 
<br/>approved in the budget to our citizens.  The question today is justified, so it demands a good response 
<br/>from Government to keep the people informed of what the biggest allocation in our Budget, those 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that come under that allocation are doing for the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of the Civil Service is committed to enhancing productivity across the whole of 
<br/>the Civil Service. While recognising the critical link between employee satisfaction and productivity, 
<br/>the Ministry is implementing a series of initiatives aimed at improving productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  employer,  the  Government  continues  to  provide  the  necessary  support  and 
<br/>opportunities to our civil servants.  The labour market has evolved beyond the nation's boundaries, 
<br/>and significant efforts  have been made to  increase the value of the work undertaken by our civil 
<br/>servants. Many of the honourable Members here have had a stint with the Civil Service and they 
<br/>know how hard they work and how important their work is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Civil Service is committed to creating a workplace where individuals feel 
<br/>valued, they take pride in their work, they are encouraged to be innovative without fear and provide 
<br/>an environment that the Civil Service is an employer of choice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By fostering an environment that encourages growth, development and recognition, we hope 
<br/>to attract and retain a dedicated workforce that is motivated to deliver high-quality services to our 
<br/>people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent salary adjustment is linked to complex issues affecting the public 
<br/>sector workforce that impact the service delivery and welfare of our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  several  Whole  of  Government  initiatives  aimed  at  enhancing  productivity, 
<br/>standardising  processes  and  adopting  common  enabling  tools  and  services  to  support  efficiency, 
<br/>collaboration,  and  better  coordination.  These  initiatives,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  are  part  of  a  broader 
<br/>strategy to ensure that our Civil Service operates at the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to begin with, we continue to  experience labour shortages due to labour 
<br/>mobility  and  demand  from  developed  economies  particularly  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand. The 
<br/>Civil Service has not been immune to this; an ongoing loss of skills in the Civil Service has led to a 
<br/>large  number  of  vacancies  in  most  specialised  government  agencies.  This  in  turn  affects  service 
<br/>delivery and, in some instances, leads to existing staff carrying extra workloads to fill the gaps due 
<br/>to increased migration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Minister responsible for Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to extend our 
<br/>deep appreciation to those hardworking civil servants who at times have borne the extra workload as 
<br/>a  result  of  vacancies.  Government  has  also  introduced  an  Internship  and  Graduate  Trainee 
<br/>Programme (GTP) to enable graduating students from the various tertiary institutions to join the Civil 
<br/>Service as an employer of choice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry intends to provide opportunities to at least 50 graduates on a yearly basis to join 
<br/>the  Civil  Service  under  that  programme,  in  addition  to  many others  who  responded  to  advertised 
<br/>positions from time to time on placement basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the recent salary increase is a strategic employee retention measure as well, 
<br/>aimed at retaining our most talented and experienced civil servants.  We understand that a lot of those 
<br/></span><span>who are receiving our migrating civil servants offer higher salaries than we can even afford.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Competitive remuneration is essential for maintaining a motivated and committed workforce. 
<br/>By providing fair and attractive compensation, we are better positioned to retain skilled employees 
<br/>who are critical to the effective functioning of Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The salary adjustment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, acknowledges the hard work and dedication of our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1549 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil servants, thereby enhancing their sense of value and also job satisfaction. A satisfied and well-
<br/>compensated workforce is more likely to be productive and committed to their roles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recruitment is also a crucial part of our workforce strategy.  Government has been working 
<br/>through dialogue with the public sector unions to address concerns across different sectors, including 
<br/>recruitment practices. This collaboration is welcomed by the unions, and the opportunity for dialogue 
<br/>are conducted in good faith.  By working closely with unions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can ensure that 
<br/>the needs and concerns of our workforce are addressed, leading to a more harmonious and productive 
<br/>work environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  aware  of  workplace  trends  and  the  anticipated  business 
<br/>transformations  that  will  develop  over  time.    Several  initiatives  have  been  identified  to  promote 
<br/>productivity.  We are exploring flexible working hours arrangements within government agencies to 
<br/>manage the various challenges while balancing work responsibilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Flexible  working  arrangements  can  help  employees  achieve  a  better  balance  working 
<br/>environment,  leading  to  increase  job  satisfaction  and  productivity.  You  saw  an  example  or  a 
<br/>demonstration of that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when civil servants were 
<br/>allowed to work from home.  These arrangements can also make the Civil Service a more attractive 
<br/>employer, particularly for younger workers who value flexibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recent  Civil  Service  Day  celebrated  the  achievements  of  our  civil 
<br/>servants  and  provided  an  opportunity  to  engage  with  the  citizens.    Their  views  and  ideas  for 
<br/>improving service delivery have been considered.  This event will now become an annual occasion 
<br/>for reflection and improvement and overtime hopefully our detractors will accept.  Civil Service Day 
<br/>is an important event that allows us to recognise the hard work and dedication of our civil servants 
<br/>and to gather valuable feedback from the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this year, Cabinet approved the establishment of the Fiji Learning 
<br/>Institute of Public Service (FLIPS).  This Institute will create high-quality, future focused, learning 
<br/>opportunities to ensure that civil servants are skilled and be productive, thereby also helping to build 
<br/>an experienced workforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FLIPS will be a centre of excellence for sharing best practices in a modern 
<br/>robust Civil Service through programmes tailor-made to the need of our Civil Service. This initiative 
<br/>is  part  of  our  commitment  to  continuous  professional  development  and  lifelong  learning  and  a 
<br/>dynamic changing environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The establishment of FLIPS within this financial year will be a significant milestone for the 
<br/>Civil  Service.    The  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  has  initiated  collaborations  with  the  Public  Service 
<br/>Commission within the region to explore capacity-building opportunities that will further improve 
<br/>performance.  There is a constant need to innovate, encourage the workforce to challenge the status 
<br/>quo, push boundaries and excel. Investing in training and continuous retraining of our workforce and 
<br/>providing civil servants with future skills is crucial for efficient and effective delivery of services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, training and development programmes offered by FLIPS will cover a wider 
<br/></span><span>range of topics. These programmes will be designed to  meet  the specific needs of the  Fiji’s civil 
<br/>servants  at  different  stages  of  their  careers,  ensuring  that  they  have  the  skills  and  knowledge 
<br/>necessary to excel in their roles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be bringing back Induction Training.  You and I remember the days 
<br/>of Induction Training when we went straight from school into the Government Training Centre to be 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>somehow prepared for the Civil Service and we went in as cadets into the various departments.  That 
<br/>will be brought back, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Customer services training, middle management and senior 
<br/>level leadership development programme, international relations and diplomacy training, teaching in 
<br/>ethics, governance and eradication of abuse and corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  key  strategy  for  achieving  greater  efficiency  in  delivering 
<br/>Government  services  cost  effectively  while  cutting  bureaucracies,  red  tape  and  standardising 
<br/>procedures.  These measures aim not only to improve productivity, but also to create a more dynamic 
<br/>and responsive Civil Service that can better meet the needs of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community of Practice Business Process Improvement (BPI) forums are being conducted to 
<br/>streamline  processes,  align  procedures,  reduce  gaps  and  evaluate  processes  for  improved  service 
<br/>delivery,  cost  reduction  and  better  utilisation  of  resources.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  BPI  forums  bring 
<br/>together technical advisors and representatives from different Ministries to share best practices and 
<br/>develop streamline processes.  By reducing duplication and inefficiencies, we can improve service 
<br/>delivery and ensure that resources are used more effectively that will increase productivity.  These 
<br/>forums  also  provide  an  opportunity  for  civil  servants  to  collaborate  and  learn  from  each  other, 
<br/>fostering a culture of continuous improvements and emphasising the need for working together as a 
<br/>team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recent challenges have highlighted the need for a comprehensive functional 
<br/>review of the Civil Service to ensure operational efficiency and effectiveness.  With the support from 
<br/>the Australian Government, a functional review will be undertaken to identify a better performance 
<br/>management  system  and  increase  productivity.    I  wish  to  acknowledge  and  thank  the  Australian 
<br/>Government for their continuing support for capacity building in the public service.  I believe that 
<br/>this approach will surely optimise workforce efficiency and effectiveness, establish clear metrics for 
<br/>accountability, and promote continuous improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, performance metrics will also serve as a basis for recognising and rewarding 
<br/>high performing civil servants, fostering a culture of excellence and motivating them to deliver their 
<br/>best impacts and results consistently. The review will provide recommendations for short term, mid-
<br/>term  and  long-term  improvements.    The  performance  management  system  will  include  regular 
<br/>performance appraisals, clear objectives and goals and opportunities for feedback and development. 
<br/>By setting clear expectations and providing ongoing support, we can ensure that civil servants are 
<br/>motivated to  perform at  their best.   The system will also  include mechanisms for identifying and 
<br/>addressing  performance  issues,  ensuring  that  all  employees  are  held  accountable  for  their 
<br/>contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, our approach includes measures designed not only to improve 
<br/>productivity, but also to retain our most talented and experienced employees, most importantly, to 
<br/>remove fear and give back confidence to our civil servants.  By creating a supportive and engaging 
<br/>work  environment,  we  aim  to  ensure  that  increased  salary  investments  translate  directly  into 
<br/>improved service delivery.  The Ministry is confident that these initiatives will drive improvements, 
<br/>ultimately benefitting our citizens and supporting the overall development of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is committed to providing the support and resources necessary 
<br/></span><span>to  help  our  civil  servants  succeed.    By  fostering  a  culture  of  collaboration,  learning  and 
<br/>accountability, we can create a Civil Service that is capable of meeting the challenges of the future 
<br/>and delivering high quality services to the public.  The Ministry of Civil Service will continue to 
<br/>work closely with other agencies, public sector unions and international partners to implement these 
<br/>initiatives.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  grateful  for  the  support  and  collaboration  of  all  stakeholders,  particularly  our 
<br/>development partners, and look forward working together to achieve our goals. The journey towards 
<br/>a  more  productive,  sufficient  and  responsive  Civil  Service  is  ongoing  and  we  are  committed  to 
<br/>making continuous and continuing improvements to better serve the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his 
<br/>designate, I would like to acknowledge the presence of the Chairman of Post Fiji and the CEO, who 
<br/>have just entered the Chambers. He is a former MP and Minister as well.  Welcome, Chairman of 
<br/>Post Fiji Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Members of  
<br/>Cabinet, honourable Members of Parliament, I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for a 
<br/>comprehensive update on the upgrade of the Civil Service.  I have five minutes, so I am going to get 
<br/>straight to the point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the Civil Service, we must respond to the challenges of today, if 
<br/>we are going to improve on our public sector productivity. This helps any Government that is in place 
<br/>because it shows you how productive they are at the end of the day, and in terms of efficiency of the 
<br/>Government. But what are the measurement methods that we have in place with respect to checking 
<br/>on this productivity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  currently,  Government  is  engaged  in  digital  transformation,  and  that  digital 
<br/>transformation stands at the core of a very productive Civil Service. Successive governments have 
<br/>faced huge problems in terms of productivity, but this is not due to the civil servants, it is also due to 
<br/>our inability  to  get  ourselves a proper digital platform.  I will give you  an example, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>Currently, the Ministry of Lands is not connected to the Registrar of Titles.  The Ministry of Lands 
<br/>is  not  even  connected  to  Fiji  Roads  Authority  (FRA)  to  upgrade  their  system  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>VanuaGIS.  So,  if  FRA  puts  up  a  new  road  and  gives  it  a  new  name,  that  does  not  reflect  in  our 
<br/>VanuaGIS</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many facets of Government that are still disconnected, and this is not a complaint 
<br/>but is a word of advice, that the faster we get our digital transformation done, the faster we can get a 
<br/>Civil  Service  that  is  productive.  We  must  redefine  the  public  sector,  we  must  move  away  from 
<br/>bureaucracy that still exists in 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  a  lot  of  bureaucratic  things  that  actually  exist  within  Ministries.  We  must  also 
<br/>ensure that we engage the new and the old public servants with respect to stopping this building of 
<br/>their own little castles within the Ministries – that needs to stop. We must engage and collaborate 
<br/>more and more within the Ministries, and I think the one thing that does all these for us is digitisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we must also look at outcomes rather outputs.  It is a very important aspect of 
<br/>it.  An outcome is an impact of that particular product on the people to whom the product is intended 
<br/>for, and how it changes the lives of our communities for the better and this should be the focus of our 
<br/>Civil Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all understand that this will not happen overnight, it will take time to happen, 
<br/></span><span>but as I have said, it has to be through a proper digital platform. We have spoken about this earlier.  
<br/>The honourable Minister for Trade is hard at work, trying to dot all the i’s and cross all the t’s, et 
<br/>cetera, and get every single Ministry connected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it would be insane to call for our Civil Service to raise their level of performance 
<br/>if Government does not provide that particular support. It is imperative that we concentrate, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urge  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  to  give  as  much  funding  as  possible  to  ensure  that  the 
<br/>digitisation of Government is actually at the top of the calendar with respect to getting things done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have very good capable workers. I know we have problems with respect to migration. 
<br/>Many of our young Civil Servants have also migrated, that is also a problem.  But we also have very 
<br/>good capable workers who have not achieved their full potential because we expect too much from 
<br/>them.  Education also is a huge thing that we need to ensure that we upgrade on with respect to all 
<br/>our Civil Servants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As with all services, monetary reward, Mr. Speaker, should not only be the source of that 
<br/>particular  incentive.    Deriving  satisfaction  from  knowing  that  you  are  actually  providing  your 
<br/>services to the general public, Mr. Speaker, is a much higher reward. That should also be built in into 
<br/>our Civil Service culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Human Resource Management is the second part of the equation, and that is 
<br/>something  that  needs  to  be  looked  at  very  carefully  with  respect  to  how  we  actually  get  the 
<br/>productivity that we want out of our Civil Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is pivotal - we must engage in motivational practices within the Civil Service 
<br/>so that it actually comes to the fore. We must look at serious performance management, which is 
<br/>actually a very complex issue, is not easily measurable and, again, we also must remember that this 
<br/>is an ongoing issue and it will not be a close chapter once this Government says, “Alright, we have 
<br/>done this now.” It will always be an open book for us to look at on another day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir I rise to deliver my response to the Ministerial 
<br/>Statement by the honourable Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Civil Service this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  totally  agree  with  the  honourable  Prime  Minister’s  Statement  on  the  measures  that  have 
<br/>been taken to increase productivity and performance of our Civil Servants. It was long overdue, given 
<br/>the measures that have been announced in the recent Budget where there is a 7 to 10 percent increase 
<br/>for salary earners and also 7 to 20 percent increase for wage earners. It affects over 42,000 public 
<br/>servants employed in the Civil Service. It is about $85 million allocation given, depending on their 
<br/>salary band. I thank the Government for recognising that, given that this was long overdue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, making the Civil Service an employer of choice, as alluded to by the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  and  a  measure  also  that  will  not  only  increase  productivity  but  also  a  retention 
<br/>measure where we can retain our senior Civil Servants, especially those whom we are losing out for 
<br/>overseas work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  welcome  the  increase  of  the  retirement  age  from  55  years  to  60  years  and  if  the 
<br/>Government can also consider increasing that to 65, given that many at that particular age can still 
<br/>deliver and are more productive in their service delivery.  Also, given the wealth of knowledge that 
<br/>they have, we should also consider increasing that from 60 years to 65 years old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the issue that was raised by honourable Koya in terms of their training and 
<br/>digitisation, I think that has also been covered by the honourable Prime Minister when speaking on 
<br/>the Fiji Learning Institute for Public Service (FLIPS).  They will be trained according to the need 
<br/>that is there, according to the work and job description that they have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also welcome the induction training that will also bring back cadetships, which the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1553 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prime also mentioned. That will also improve the customer service and service delivery 
<br/>of our civil servants, especially at the divisional level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The idea of bringing back the Civil Service Day will also bring in a new culture and has also 
<br/>brought in that freedom within the Civil Service where they are able to strengthen their bonds with 
<br/>other Civil Servants, especially working with other Ministries and knowing each other well, which 
<br/>will help in the service delivery as per Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the Performance Management System has been brought back and the removal of the 
<br/>Open  Merit  Recruitment  and  Selection.    The  contract  system  has  been  removed  and  permanent 
<br/>employment has given confidence to civil servants, especially going into banks to take loans and 
<br/>other things that gives them security at their work, and they need not fear for any renewal of contract 
<br/>or expiry of contract, and this also improves their performance in their work as they deliver to our 
<br/>people.  This particular increase, as rightly mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister, will increase 
<br/>productivity and also service delivery.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In most of our debates during the week and even in previous sittings, we always talk about 
<br/>the review of Annual Reports for various Ministries. We always tend to blame previous governments 
<br/>or previous administrations, but it comes down to the civil servants who deliver and implement those 
<br/>policies. So, in providing these incentives and proper working conditions, plus other training, it will 
<br/>help them perform well and also deliver to the people of Fiji what has been passed by this Parliament, 
<br/>especially in the Budget allocation in the years to come and also in this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr, Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your indulgence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  as  a  result  of  the  Ministerial  Statement    by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, please, take note, as he has alluded to, that Oral Question No. 140/2024 
<br/>on today’s Order Paper will now be dropped.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the Minister of Health and Medical Services to deliver his Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing the Burden of NCDs in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.– Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; </span><span>ni bula vina'a’ </span><span>and good morning to you</span><span> </span><span>all, and to our visitors in the gallery 
<br/>today,  and  those  watching  from  home  and  places  of  work.    I  rise  to  deliver  my  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement today  with  a  focus  on  the  efforts  that  the Ministry,  through  the  Wellness  Division, 
<br/>is undertaking to address the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) continue to be the main disease burden for our people, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributing to 80 percent of all deaths in the country and 40 percent of premature deaths.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the recently published ‘Republic of Fiji Vital Statistics Report 2016 to 2021’, circulatory 
<br/>diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and stroke, diabetes and cancers were the leading causes 
<br/></span><span>of death in Fiji in both, male and female in all ages combined. For adults aged 35 years to 59 years, 
<br/></span><span>the leading causes of death in men and women were NCDs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCDs also pose a significant burden on our health system and our society. 
<br/>The  majority  of  admissions  and treatment  at  our  health  facilities  are  due  to NCDs  and  its 
<br/>complications.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Complications  such  as  coronary  artery disease  or  heart  attacks,  stroke,  kidney diseases  or 
<br/>kidney failure, vision impairment or vision loss and peripheral vessel disease that require surgical 
<br/>interventions including  amputations,  bring  patients  to  our hospitals  every  day,  and  require 
<br/>ongoing care in our health facilities and in our homes and communities. In 2019, healthcare costs for 
<br/>deaths and  disability  from  NCDs  such  as  diabetes and  obesity-related  illnesses  was  estimated at 
<br/>FJ$591million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir, 95  percent  of  NCDs  are  due  to  lifestyle  choices, and  the  four  main 
<br/>modifiable risk factors of NCDs are tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet that is high in 
<br/>salt, sugar, fat and processed foods, and excessive alcohol consumption. These unhealthy lifestyle 
<br/>habits lead to four key changes in our body that increase our risk of NCDs, and they are a raised 
<br/>blood pressure, high blood sugars, high blood cholesterol or fat levels, and obesity or overweight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  2021  Multiple  Indicator  Cluster Survey  showed  a  significant  level  of unhealthy 
<br/>dietary practices in older children, adolescents and adults, which featured the low consumption of 
<br/>nutritious  foods,  and a  high  intake  of  sugar  and  sweetened beverages.  The  survey  also  noted 
<br/>that about one-third of children in Fiji between the ages of 5 years to 19 years were overweight. When 
<br/>uncorrected, the presence of these intermediate risk factors leads to the development of NCDs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  response  to  the  NCD  situation  in  Fiji,  the Wellness  Division  of  the 
<br/>Ministry  is  tasked, amongst  its  many  roles,  with  undertaking population  surveys,  often  with  the 
<br/>support of our partners, to assess the prevalence of risk factors of NCD and its complications in the 
<br/>community.   Information  gathered  from  these  population surveys  guide  the  strategies  of 
<br/>health promotion  and  NCD prevention programmes  that  are  implemented  by  the Ministry  and  the 
<br/>Government to address NCD in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recent examples of such interventions include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Cabinet endorsed the ‘National Policy on Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and 
<br/>Beverages  for  Government Ministries  and  Institutions’,  which  was launched  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister in February this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The increased tax on sugar and sweetened beverages and tobacco which Government 
<br/>had implemented in the last financial year and, again, in this new financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been pleasing to note that many Government institutions are taking positive actions to 
<br/>adhere to the healthy catering policy, such as Vunidawa Hospital in the Naitasiri Province, whose 
<br/>pictures of deliciously colourful and balanced meals provided at the Hospital are currently trending 
<br/>on social media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important NCD population survey that the Ministry has embarked on 
<br/>since June 2024 is the STEPS survey. This survey is a World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise 
<br/>approach 
<br/>is  a  simple, standardized method  of 
<br/>collecting, analysing and disseminating data on key NCD risk factors in countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>factor surveillance,  which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  NCD 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>risk 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The survey has been implemented in over 120 countries and it gathers information on risk 
<br/></span><span>factors  with  a  questionnaire,  followed  by simple physical  measurements of respondents,  which  is 
<br/></span><span>then followed by the more complex collection of urine and blood samples for biochemical analysis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the third time for the STEPS Survey in Fiji, the first one was carried out in 2002, and 
<br/>the second survey in 2011. Ideally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, STEPS Survey should be done in every five 
<br/>years. The 2011 STEPS Survey was a nationally representative population-based survey of 25 years 
<br/>to 64-year-old Fijians, covering 2,586 individuals across Fiji.

<div><span>The results of the 2011 STEPS survey showed that:

<div><span>30 percent of adults smoked tobacco daily; 
<br/>15.7 percent of adults consumed alcohol within the past 30 days; 
<br/>15 percent of adults do not meet the WHO recommendations on the minimum level of 
<br/>physical activity for health; and  
<br/>85 percent of adults ate less than five servings of fruits and/or vegetables on average 
<br/>per day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the intermediate risk factors:

<div><span>32 percent of the respondents were obese while 70 percent were overweight and obese;  
<br/>31 percent had raised blood pressure;  
<br/>15.2 percent had raised blood glucose; and  
<br/>35.8 percent had three or more risk factors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The STEPS survey is among a number of important population health surveys that have been 
<br/></span><span>pending over the last decade which the Ministry is keen to undertake to guide its health strategies in 
<br/></span><span>the next five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  support  of  the  Australian  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and 
<br/>Trade (DFAT) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the Ministry has commenced the 
<br/>third STEP Survey for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The survey is in line with our National Health Strategic Plan and the Annual Operational Plan. 
<br/>For the first time ever, the Ministry has engaged the assistance and expertise of the Fiji Bureau of 
<br/>Statistics in carrying out the survey on risk factor behaviours among male and female aged between 
<br/>18 years to 69 years.  Also, for the first time, during the survey, Fiji will be introducing for the rest 
<br/>of the world -

<div><span>a cervical cancer module; 
<br/>a suki and tobacco module; 
<br/>an oral health module 
<br/>an extended nutrition questions; 
<br/>a mental health module and urinalysis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are all new modules under the STEPS survey and Fiji is proud to be involved in drafting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and piloting these assessment modules under this comprehensive survey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  the  end  of  the  last  financial  year,  the survey  for  the  Eastern  Division were nearing 
<br/>completion, with surveys conducted in Kadavu, Ovalau, Rotuma, and Lakeba in the Lau Group.  In 
<br/>this financial year, funds totalling $480,000 have been allocated from the Wellness Division for the 
<br/>completion of the STEPS survey in the Northern, Western and Central Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the benefits of the survey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the results from the STEPS survey will inform 
<br/></span><span>on the impact of the population-based interventions for our people over the last 10 years.  The result 
<br/></span><span>will help  the Ministry to  track its progress  towards the  Global  NCD Action Plan of a 25 percent 
<br/>reduction of premature mortality from NCDs by 2025, as well as SDG target 3.4, which calls for 
<br/>reducing premature death from NCDs, including diabetes, by 30 percent by 2030. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The survey results will provide further guidance on a number of current NCD strategies by 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by reiterating what I have said previously in this august 
<br/>Parliament, in that, NCDs do not start when one is diagnosed inside our hospitals and nursing stations. 
<br/>They start with the living and eating habits that are nurtured at a young age in our homes, schools, 
<br/>villages, workplaces, offices and in the deliberations of this august Parliament.  The NCD burden we 
<br/>have will require our collective effort and determination to control and stop. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to encourage all Fijians around the country who are approached to participate in the 
<br/>STEPS survey, to fully participate and complete all the steps of the survey. I wish to acknowledge 
<br/>and thank all our partners who are supporting the Ministry in completing the survey in 2024.  I thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.00 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition, or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Health and thank him for his Ministerial Statement, especially on a very burning issue, that is, 
<br/>NCDs in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we say, prevention is better than cure.  For any country to prosper, it will 
<br/>need a healthy population. Unfortunately, in Fiji, it is not the case, and it is very shocking that more 
<br/>than 80 percent of deaths in Fiji is because of NCDs.  These are very worrying numbers; both for the 
<br/>general populous as well for us, as policy makers.  Mr. Speaker, a large chunk of National Budget is 
<br/>devoted towards treatment of NCDs when rightfully, more funding needs to be provided towards the 
<br/>prevention of NCDs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  NCD  places  a  huge  burden  on  our  already  strained  healthcare  system.    The 
<br/>Ministry of Health, for years, has devoted money, time and effort towards treating patients suffering 
<br/>from NCDs rather than focusing on building state-of-the-art facilities that can provide special service.  
<br/>Fijians have to fly out of the country to get treatment that is not available in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we cannot and should not blame the Ministry of Health for not providing these 
<br/>special services.  One must look at the core problem that has led to a situation that is at hand at the 
<br/>moment.  As citizens of this country, we need to take responsibility for our health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCDs can be prevented.  We do not have to end up in a hospital once we 
<br/>have acquired diseases such as diabetes, kidney failure, heart-related issues, et cetera.  If only we 
<br/>control what goes into our tummy through our mouth, we would not be caught in the web of NCDs.  
<br/>We need to ensure that it is everyone’s responsibility to live a healthy life.  We need to take our 30 
<br/>minutes’ walk on daily basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Fiji has a very active young population.  Almost anywhere, you will see young 
<br/>Fijians out on the field but, unfortunately, our life has come to a standstill when we reach the age of 
<br/>30.  This can be due to many reasons such as work, family commitment and being career focused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijians at the age of 30 and above tend to get busy with work as they become career-oriented 
<br/>or get busy with their family life and children, and without realising it, physical activity which was 
<br/>almost 100 percent on daily basis during their high school and tertiary institute days has declined 
<br/>drastically or zero percent over a number of years.  This is the time when NCDs start to knock on our 
<br/>doors at this stage of our life.  By the time we realise it, it is too late, and we are already diagnosed 
<br/>with NCDs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not just the above, but we need to focus on our family members and provide 
<br/>guidance to those who are involved in drugs, and I must say this, </span><span>yaqona </span><span>as well.  We can see how 
<br/>our young generation are spoiling their future by spending their entire nights having grog.  This does 
<br/></span><span>not only deteriorate their health conditions, but also affects their social and family life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the major reasons of families getting split up is because the husbands are 
<br/>having grog sessions the whole night and not devoting time towards their families. It is a social issue 
<br/>that is creeping into our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           Mr. Speaker, we need to even bring in new medications and not the outdated ones that are 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>existing in our Essential Drug List (EDL). We need to review our EDL that is used by the Ministry 
<br/>of Health so that we can have new medications that are available in the market to treat NCDs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we need to work together to combat NCDs in Fiji and I urge us, as leaders, to 
<br/>take the lead role. One of the things to change in this Parliament is, we need to move away from 
<br/>morning tea to healthy break.  Now, we are having two tea breaks and one lunch break. We can have 
<br/>morning tea and fruits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Healthy break.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, healthy breaks, as they do in other  jurisdictions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I also urge us, as leaders, to take the lead role and devote, at least, one hour 
<br/>during  Parliament  session  and  lead  by  example,  so  having  a  touch  rugby  match  between  the 
<br/>Government and Opposition side during lunch break.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is not something to laugh about.  If we laugh here, people will not take us 
<br/>seriously outside and that is why this burden is on our healthcare system. We need to lead by example, 
<br/>we cannot be sitting idle and expecting the general populace to be looking after their health when we 
<br/>do not do anything. So, from September, Mr. Speaker, I urge the Government and Opposition MPs, 
<br/>let us have a friendly touch rugby game for, at least, one hour per week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think you should speak to your colleague there, honourable Ketan Lal. He 
<br/>was  the  one  who  pleaded  in  the  House  Committee  that  we  bring  back  the  lunch  and  everything. 
<br/>Maybe, he is getting good advice from honourable Koya. They want to have lunch again in the House 
<br/>and all that, and now you are saying ‘no’ to morning tea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Fruits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Only fruits?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No tea, no coffee? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Tea, coffee and fruits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Healthy, healthy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is still the same. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is still sugar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We reduce sugar and carbs content.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You can make a separate submission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to respond to the

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1559 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement from the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. I appreciate the honourable 
<br/>Minister's attention to NCD and the insights provided by the STEPS Survey that was conducted.  I 
<br/>believe the last one was in 2011 when honourable Usamate was the Minister for Health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the data presented this morning is, indeed, alarming and our health system 
<br/>needs restructuring to meet the present health challenges and to create legislation that aids the process 
<br/>is undeniably a step in the right direction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  reviewing  legislations  and  reviewing  health  promotion  is  merely  part  of  the 
<br/>solutions required.  Health system evaluation is a complex undertaking, and a detailed multi-pronged 
<br/>approach  is  required.  The  evaluation  must  not  only  involve  health  outcomes,  but  also  take  into 
<br/>account  professional  viewpoint,  our patients’ experience and the influence on the systemic social 
<br/>issues - the real issues affecting our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importantly,  health  promotions  should  not  just  be  about  circulating  message  of  healthy 
<br/>practices but should also address the social determinants of health, and this is where legislative and 
<br/>intellectual play a vital role in a formative policy development. We must consider vital factors, like 
<br/>the income level of our people, the effects of raising VAT on ordinary Fijians, the level of education, 
<br/>employment status and the acceptable minimum wage, also with housing condition and the access to 
<br/>a balanced nutritional diet which is mostly expensive, all of which influence our physical, mental and 
<br/>our spiritual health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to neglect these factors, we would be failing to address the root cause of 
<br/>many health problems in our nation.  Furthermore, the focus should not be only battling the disease 
<br/>but also investing in preventive strategies. I strongly believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a 
<br/>pound of cure.  So, let us put our answers in the right place.  By encouraging early screening, regular 
<br/>health  check  and  promoting  healthy  lifestyle,  we  can  help  prevent  NCD  and  improve  the  health 
<br/>outcome of our citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, the data presented this morning by the honourable Minister through the STEP survey 
<br/>should form a bedrock of our policy decision. It  is essential that the survey findings are not only 
<br/>considered and appreciated but to be effectively integrated into our national health intervention (as 
<br/>alluded to by the honourable Minister), the National Wellness Strategic Plan. So, having that strategic 
<br/>plan and the right resource level is required, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While I commend the honourable Minister for Health’s effort to tackle NCDs, let us not lose 
<br/>sight of the bigger picture.  It is not just about improving our health system or creating legislation, 
<br/>but about building a healthier Fiji. It is a mammoth task but can be achieved if we start now.  Our 
<br/>people are dying prematurely - wives, husbands, with their children left behind. It is a heart-breaking 
<br/>experience, and in many cases, children go astray in the wrong path in search for the love they lost 
<br/>permanently due to their loss. I encourage each honourable Member and every Fijian alike, let us 
<br/>work together towards a vision of a healthy Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, in listening to your debate on this issue of health, 
<br/>we should all be proud that today sees to the coming in of the new Emoluments Agreement, especially 
<br/></span><span>to do with health cover.  This was one of the things that interested me in the way you were discussing 
<br/></span><span>the  Emoluments  Programme  and,  especially,  where  I  came  across  two  cases  where  two  of  our 
<br/>honourable colleagues almost died here - honourable Prakash and honourable Joseph Nand, who was 
<br/>sent on a separate case to the hospital and had to pay from his own pocket about more than $3,000 
<br/>because he was not covered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the previous Parliament, we used to be covered and that kind of protected us.  So, please, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as from today, make an effort in trying to find the group that best suits your individual party sides, 
<br/>or come to an agreement that you have a common policy that covers all of you, honourable Members.  
<br/>I am not covered, as well as others who are not Members of this Parliament, but for Members of 
<br/>Parliament, you are covered under this new agreement that comes into effect this week or today. That 
<br/>is also something that I want to share.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members of the public will not realise what is happening here.  We have very serious cases 
<br/>of people collapsing, severely suffering and taken to the hospital.  They are already sick, and they 
<br/>have to pay extra expenses again.  To have test results, tests undertaken at the CWM Hospital, you 
<br/>have  to  pay  from  your  own  pockets,  like  honourable  Joseph  Nand  and  our  colleague  honourable 
<br/>Prakash, who is recuperating in prison somewhere in Fiji.  They suffered as well, but they had to pay 
<br/>from their own pockets for the tests, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you do not realise this until you are admitted. You have to pay for 
<br/>everything, and if you are covered, be grateful to the honourable Minister for Finance that this has 
<br/>come through.  This is to take care of you.  I hope I am clear on this.  There is a big work to be 
<br/>undertaken by each and every one of you in trying to identify what product that will work well for 
<br/>you and also for your own pocket.

<div><span>Back-to-Back Meetings - Pacific Women Leaders Meetings in the Marshall Islands  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament and our viewers who are watching online; </span><span>muru le’a</span><span> </span><span>bula, namaste</span><span>, </span><span>noa’ia e mauri</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to share today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the highlights of Fiji’s participation in the 15</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>Triennial Conference of Pacific Women, the 8</span><span>th</span><span> Meeting of Pacific Ministers for Women and the 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>Pacific Islands Forum Women Leaders Meeting.  These significant events happened  back-to-back 
<br/>from 22</span><span>nd</span><span> July, 2024 to 26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024 in Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  I attended 
<br/>these forums, along with our Acting Director for Women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to share a personal reflection.  This being the first 
<br/>time I have set foot in the Marshall Islands, I have only read about it, I have only heard about it, but 
<br/>to be present and to somewhat comprehend it, it is nothing short of emotionally overwhelming. And 
<br/>I am referring to the nuclear legacy that the Marshall Islands have endured and continue to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Americans tested a total of 67 nuclear bombs in Bikini Atoll, and to this 
<br/>day,  there  is  a  concrete  nuclear  waste  storage  facility,  which  is  apparently  leaking.    This  is  the 
<br/>backdrop, Mr. Speaker, to understand the context of the repercussions on the health, the livelihoods 
<br/>and the very survival of the people of the Marshall Islands.  I wish to take this time to remember 
<br/>those who lost their lives in a most horrific way, and the families who continue to endure the effects 
<br/>of the fallout for the last few decades.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  stories  are  told  about  the  first  nuclear  bomb  being  detonated  and  the 
<br/>immediate fallout, and the villagers in the nearby atoll ran out as they saw what they called, “snow 
<br/></span><span>falling from the sky.”  They had never seen it before.  They played in the “snow”, only to experience 
<br/></span><span>the burning effects a few minutes later.  From there, they were taken to ships where they were then 
<br/>observed and stayed on for months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with the people of the Marshall Islands as they continue to 
<br/>advocate against the injustices they face and the fight for climate justice, not just for the people of 
<br/>the Marshall Islands, but for our entire Blue Pacific.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1561 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Triennial  Conference  of  Pacific  Women,  which  was  funded  by  the 
<br/>Pacific Community (SPC) is a remarkable assembly that brings together policy makers, women’s 
<br/>rights and civil society organisations, development partners and relevant institutions from across our 
<br/>region.  Since its inception more than 40 years ago, this Triennial Conference has been a cornerstone 
<br/>in our pursuit of gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls.  Every three years, we 
<br/>come together to assess our progress and advance our efforts towards gender equality.  Of course, 
<br/>the adoption of the Pacific Platform for Action for Gender Equality and Women’s Human Rights 
<br/>2018-2030 has provided a clear roadmap for our efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year’s conference was especially significant as it coincided with the 
<br/>global commemoration of the 30</span><span>th</span><span> anniversary and review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform 
<br/>for Action (Beijing +30).   This highlights the importance of this Triennial Conference as the primary 
<br/>mechanism  for  monitoring  our  progress  of  the  Beijing  Declaration  and  the  Pacific  Platform  for 
<br/>Action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will share with this august House that this momentum will continue building 
<br/>through to November 2024, as I have mentioned, in support of the moving of the Parliament Sitting 
<br/>from  November  to  December.  This  is  happening  in  Thailand  for  the  Asia  and  Pacific  Regional 
<br/>review, leading up to the Commission on the Status of Women in New York in March next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on that note, I am pleased to report that Fiji actively participated in this Triennial 
<br/>Conference through engagement at multiple high level plenary sessions on relevant topics, bilateral 
<br/>meetings and, of course, interventions during the Pacific Women’s’ Ministers Forum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, notable was the attendance of the only Pacific Head of State, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Feleti Teo, who is also the Minister for Women. On this note, I thank our 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister for agreeing to act in my absence as the Minister for Women, Children 
<br/>and Social Protection, showing his continued commitment to gender equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  collective  discussions,  Mr.  Speaker,  confirmed  that,  of  course,  gender-based  violence 
<br/>continues to be a great issue for all of us.  We continue to have the same statistics of two out of three 
<br/>women, compared to the global average of only one out of three women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is deeply concerning that we are underrepresented in leadership roles across all sectors in 
<br/>our political systems. Mr. Speaker, on this note, I wish to thank you and thank the Parliament of Fiji 
<br/>for  hosting  the  Women  Mock  Parliament  over  a  week  ago,  that  saw  55  women  from  across  the 
<br/>country, here, convening the second only Women Mock Parliament in the history of Fiji, the first 
<br/>being in 2016, Mr. Speaker.  I am the only alumni that is in Parliament today and I challenge the 
<br/>women who attended the Women Mock Parliament that, hopefully, there will be more of them who 
<br/>will join us in this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also battling the high rate of reproductive cancers, as well as ongoing issues related 
<br/>to HIV and AIDS and teenage pregnancy. All these challenges are happening against the backdrop 
<br/>of a climate crisis, which always disproportionately affect women and girls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as part of Fiji’s Country Statement, we underline our progress in preparing for 
<br/></span><span>Beijing+30. Strong policies and legal frameworks have been crucial in safeguarding women’s rights 
<br/>here in Fiji, and creating an environment where Fijian women and girls can thrive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notably, female students now make up 57 percent of our graduates in tertiary institutions, 
<br/>outplaying male students at 43 percent. However, as we all know, women are still under-represented 
<br/>in  labour  force,  so  it  is  not  converting  into  jobs,  even  though  we  outnumber  males  in  graduates. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although  we  celebrate  this  educational  achievement,  we  need  equal  participation  in  the  formal 
<br/>economy, access to financial resources, and leadership roles in both, public and private spheres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, we underscored Fiji’s commitment to our continued work on a 
<br/>whole of Government evidence-based and transformative approach. As you know, we continue to 
<br/>implement the National Action Plan to Prevent Gender-Based Violence against All Women and Girls 
<br/>in developing the upcoming Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment National Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share that following the Country Statement, Fiji also took several 
<br/>important  interventions.  So,  at  this  Conference,  there  was  the  introduction  of  a  Monitoring, 
<br/>Evaluation and Learning Framework so that we can monitor and evaluate the work to advance gender 
<br/>equality  in  the region.  And we asked that there be a creation of a knowledge hub, where we can 
<br/>access information, as Women Ministers do not continue forever but when there are new Ministers 
<br/>that come in, they can access this information and be updated as to what is happening in the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, additionally, we advocated and proposed for the creation of a regional working 
<br/>group to specifically focus on technology facilitated gender-based violence or online which, as we 
<br/>know,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  now  the  crime  of  the  21</span><span>st</span><span>  century.    We  emphasise  the  importance  of 
<br/>collaborative approaches so that we have laws and policies that hold to account not only perpetrators, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, but also technology companies - large tech companies, that profit from online activity.  
<br/>We also need to look at our regulatory bodies, Mr. Speaker, and our laws to be reviewed so that we 
<br/>can protect our people from technology facilitated gender-based violence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if our honourable Members have not heard a word I have said up to this point, 
<br/>I would like to proudly  share that for the very first time, after we lobbied last year at the Pacific 
<br/>Women Ministers Meeting, the Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of 
<br/>Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is leaving Geneva for the first time. They have always 
<br/>met in Geneva, but upon Fiji’s lobbying, they have agreed to not only leave Geneva but to come to 
<br/>the Pacific to convene an extraordinary session, and this will be taking place in Fiji in April next 
<br/>year.  We announced this at the Women Ministers Forum in the Marshall Islands. This proposal, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, allows us to host this special session in Fiji and, of course, preparatory work will commence 
<br/>with  SPC,  the  relevant Government  agencies  and  other  partners,  to  ensure  that  this  extraordinary 
<br/>session is successful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The CEDAW Committee, Mr. Speaker, comprises of 23 independent experts and women’s 
<br/>rights  from  around  the  world,  and  they  are  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  Convention  on 
<br/>CEDAW, which 12 Pacific Islands Countries have ratified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is really significant, following the endorsement by our Pacific Leaders on 
<br/>the Gender Equality Declaration and, of course, the launch of our 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific 
<br/>Continent in which gender equality and social inclusion are regional priorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  concluded,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  conferences  and  Ministers  meetings  with  outcomes 
<br/>documents that encompasses reflecting on how far we have come and what are our unique challenges 
<br/>that we now face in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this  period, Mr. Speaker, we, the Ministers for Women, on behalf of  our  governments, 
<br/>affirm our commitment to the effective implementation of the Pacific Gender Equality Pledge and 
<br/>Beijing  Declaration  and  Platforms  for  Action.    And  we  did  get  personal  commitment  from  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister of Tuvalu, that as he attends the Leaders Meeting this month, that he will 
<br/>certainly be our advocate to present our outcomes document.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s participation and engagement at the Triennial Conference, as well as the Pacific Women 
<br/>Ministers’  Meeting,  underscores  the  importance  of  our  collective  efforts  in  achieving  our  gender 
<br/>equality goals.  Of course, the historic event of hosting the CEDAW Committee next year here in 
<br/>Fiji, shows Fiji’s active involvement in continued advocacy and dedication to addressing the critical 
<br/>issues - gender-based violence, women economic empowerment, women in climate justice and, of 
<br/>course, women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights and women’s health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue to do so, Sir, as a flagship initiative and an example to the Pacific because 
<br/>we do a key whole of Government and whole of society evidence-based approach which our Pacific 
<br/>Island countries wish to learn from and, of course, fostering partnerships with our Pacific Women 
<br/>Ministers and Civil Society Organisations to continue progress in this regard.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen; I would like to first, 
<br/>thank, the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection for your comprehensive 
<br/>update on the Triennial Conference of Pacific Women in the eighth Pacific Women’s meeting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The convening of this significant events in the Republic of Marshall Islands underscores the 
<br/>collective commitment of our region to advancing gender equality and human rights. The Triennial 
<br/>Conference of Pacific Women has long been a cornerstone for evaluating our progress and addressing 
<br/>the persistent challenges in achieving gender equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The adoption of the Pacific Platform for Action for Gender Equality and Humans Rights has 
<br/>provided  us  with  a  robust  framework  to  guide  our  efforts.    This  year’s  conference  is  particularly 
<br/>momentous as it aligns with the global review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, 
<br/>re-enforcing our dedication to these critical issues. Despite the progress made over the past decade, 
<br/>it is evident that gender discrimination and equalities remain deeply entrenched in our societies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  women  in  the  Pacific  continue  to  face  significant  barriers,  including 
<br/>disproportionate representation in low wage jobs, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, high rates 
<br/>of  violence  and  low  political  representation.    These  challenges  are  complex  and  multifaceted, 
<br/>requiring a concerted and sustained effort from all sectors of society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we know, violence against women and girls is one of the world’s gravest 
<br/>human rights  violations. As alluded to  by the honourable Minister, globally, one in  three women 
<br/>experience physical and sexual violence from a partner in their lifetime.  Fiji has some of the highest 
<br/>rates  of  violence  against  women  in  the  world.  We  know  that  two  in  three  women  in  Fiji  have 
<br/>experienced physical or sexual violence from a male intimate partner in their lifetime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address this alarming rates of violence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needed to take a bold step to 
<br/></span><span>accelerate prevention efforts already underway. In 2020, we embarked on the historical journey as a 
<br/></span><span>nation to become the first Pacific Island country to have a National Action Plan to prevent violence 
<br/>against women and girls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  look  forward  to  the  comprehensive  outcomes  document  from  the 
<br/>Conference, it is imperatives that we consolidate the critical priorities and commitments identified. 
<br/>This  document  will  serve  as  a  strategic  guide  for  our  regional  efforts  over  the  next  three  years,

<div><span>shaping our priorities, leading up to the 69</span><span>th</span><span> Session of the Commission on the Status of Women, and 
<br/>informing our statements in both Bangkok and New York. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are talking about improving the lives of our women, children and 
<br/>girls, I am a bit disappointed with the recent delays in the social welfare allowances recently, Sir, 
<br/>especially to those elderly who are vulnerable citizens who entirely rely on the allowances for their 
<br/>daily needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry’s  statement  attributing  the  delay  to  the  transition  of  the  Government’s  new 
<br/>financial  year  is  not  sufficient  to  alleviate  the  frustration  and  inconvenience  caused.  While  we 
<br/>appreciate the Ministry’s apology and efforts to expedite the process, it is crucial that such delays do 
<br/>not occur in the future.  Our people deserve better, and it is imperative that the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>improves its systems and communication to ensure timely and reliable disbursement of funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We ask the Ministry to prioritise the needs of our social welfare recipients and take immediate 
<br/>action to prevent any further delays. The wellbeing of our citizens should always be the top priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  the  efforts  of  all  delegates,  civil  society 
<br/>organisations, development partners and UN agencies for their unwavering commitment to gender 
<br/>equality.  Together, we can foster sustained progress towards achieving gender parity in the Pacific, 
<br/>ensuring that every woman and girl can exercise their human rights and live up to her full potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  Ministerial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statement by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  at  the  outset,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  a  thorough  and 
<br/>comprehensive update on her Report on the 15th Triennial Conference of Pacific Women and the 
<br/>Pacific Women Ministers’ Meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this gathering marks a crucial milestone in the region’s ongoing pursuit of 
<br/>gender parity.  Sir, I fully agree with the honourable Minister on the importance of this meeting and 
<br/>how vital it is towards providing empowerment and equal opportunities for women in Fiji and around 
<br/>the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do understand that in 1994, the Triennial Conference adopted the Pacific 
<br/>Platform for Action (PPA) for the advancement of women, and given Fiji’s position in the Pacific, 
<br/>we play a key role in taking key actions regarding the PPA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this PPA we, as a nation, still have a lot of work to do, to ensure the 
<br/>equal  participation  of  women  in  aspects  of  development  and  decision-making  in  workplaces  and 
<br/>other areas of life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must take a lead role in empowering women in the Pacific 
<br/></span><span>and in the Oceania Region, and Government should be at the forefront of playing an active role in 
<br/></span><span>providing a safe environment for our women to prosper.  Sir, a woman will only prosper if we work 
<br/>together as a nation, the leaders and community to provide an environment that is very conducive for 
<br/>our women and, at the same time, boost their confidence and excel in all areas of life in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can have as many conferences as we can, engage people in numerous 
<br/>awareness  sessions  for  equality  towards  women  participation,  but  if  we  do  not  provide  the  right

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection

<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Group of  9 Block and its leader and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka, Saka</span><span>.  </span><span>Bula</span><span> </span><span>vinaka</span><span> to those of you who are 
<br/>listening from the comfort of your homes and around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is with profound honour and a deep sense of responsibility that I address 
<br/>this august Assembly today.  As the custodian of justice in our beloved nation, the Ministry of Justice 
<br/>has been steadfast in its mission to uphold the principles of justice, integrity and accountability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry’s  accomplishment  over  the  past  months  are  not  merely  milestones,  but 
<br/>indicative of our relentless pursuit of excellence in the public service.  Unwavering commitment to 
<br/>the rule of law and our dedication to serving the people of Fiji underpin the very initiative and every 
<br/>effort that we undertake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The realm of public governance - the Ministry of Justice, stands as a beacon of hope and a 
<br/>pillar of democracy. Our endeavours are guided by the strategic vision.  It seeks to harmonise the 
<br/>inspirations of our citizens with the imperative of justice and the rule of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me outline the initiatives undertaken by the Fiji Corrections Service. The 
<br/>Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service has unveiled a robust reform plan, aimed at transforming 
<br/>the Fiji Corrections Service organisation structure and operations.  This initiative addresses critical 
<br/>challenges relating to leadership, staffing and procedural alignment with the budgetary allocations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fifth focus of the reform include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The organisational restructuring - the organisation will review and restructure to align with 
<br/>the  budgetary  allocation  approved  by  Parliament,  addressing  issues  of  overstaffing  and 
<br/>leadership gaps. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Capacity building - an assessment and enhancement of capacity of Senior Managers and 
<br/>Corrections Officers will be conducted to support and drive the necessary reforms. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Staff  training  -  ongoing  training  programmes  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  staff  are 
<br/>equipped with up-to-date correctional practices, keeping pace with the evolving profiles of 
<br/>offenders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Safety and rehabilitation - Fiji Corrections Service will strengthen the core functions of 
<br/>safety and security within the facilities while integrating effective rehabilitation processes. 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Principle  of  Accountability  Measures  -  there  will  be  rigorous  accountability  measures 
<br/></span><span>which  will  be  enforced  on  all  levels  of  the  service  to  ensure  adherence  to  policies  and 
<br/></span><span>procedures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to guide this reform over the next year, a transitional team comprising of 
<br/>experienced former Fiji Corrections Officers has been established.  The mandate includes developing 
<br/>a detailed reform agenda and a proposed staff establishment, which will be submitted to the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance for consideration.  At the end of the transition period, a new management team will take

<div><span>On the realignment of security and standard of discipline, this concerns the enforcement of 
<br/>discipline  to  inculcate  the  habits  of  good  behaviour,  more  accountable  and  transparent  in  the 
<br/>treatment  of  offenders,  especially  the  provision  of  safe,  secure  and  humane  facilities  in  line  with 
<br/>international best practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service is also undertaking its legislative reform and review of its own 
<br/>legislations.  There have been discussions with the honourable Attorney-General on the review of 
<br/>the Corrections Act.  Also, a key part of this overview is the review of the prison industries.  This 
<br/>has been pursued to propose commercialisation of Fiji Corrections industries, transitioning them into 
<br/>public enterprises managed by a Board of Directors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, the Fiji Corrections Service operates several industries including 
<br/>joinery, tailoring, piggery, poultry and farm produce, generating about $100,000 per month.  Due to 
<br/>Government  controlled  pricing  and outdated machinery, there are  constraints on productivity and 
<br/>quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rationale of commercialisation stems from the financial stability and profit retention.  To 
<br/>increase profitability, commercialisation will allow Fiji Corrections Service to operate with greater 
<br/>financial autonomy, setting competitive prices and expanding market reach.  We will also talk about 
<br/>re-investment and rehabilitation. Profits can be retained and re-invested into Corrections facilities to 
<br/>enhance rehabilitation programmes, update machinery and provide post-release support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the expected outcomes?  First and foremost are the financial benefits – increased 
<br/>revenue  and  cost  saving.    The  commercial  prison  is  expected  to  significantly  boost  revenue  and 
<br/>enhance efficiency, contributing to national economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On social and rehabilitative impacts, it is important that we enhance rehabilitation and job 
<br/>creation.  Improved training facilities and expanded service will lead to better reintegration outcomes 
<br/>for inmates and increase employment opportunities within the Corrections system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  commercialisation  of  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  industries  presents  a  strategic 
<br/>opportunity  to  boost  financial  stability,  improve  rehabilitative  outcomes  and  expand  services  of 
<br/>offering.  Consultations will be with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Trade will proceed in 
<br/>the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  major  initiatives  that  has  been  proposed  is  to  convert  the  Rakiraki  Temporary 
<br/>Corrections  Centre  into  a  permanent  rehabilitation  centre.    The  practised  temporary  deployment 
<br/>during the cane cutting season places a lot of demand on our resources.  This conversion focussed on 
<br/>the  implementation  of  comprehensive  farming  programmes  designed  to  provide  inmates  with 
<br/>available skills and facilities and their integration into society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from cane cutting, the inmates can be engaged for planting throughout the year.  They 
<br/>have engaged with key stakeholders, and we are working on a joint Cabinet paper with the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of  Sugar  to  secure  government  approval  of  this  initiative.  This  project  is  a  testament  of  our 
<br/></span><span>commitment  to  create  a  sustainable  and  effective  rehabilitation  opportunities  for  those  in  the 
<br/>correctional system as well as contributing to national economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I touch on the challenges posed by hard drugs.  The drug trade in Fiji 
<br/>involves  two  main  groups  -  drug  trafficking  and  drug  users.    Drug  trafficking  typically  have  the 
<br/>financial means to establish and maintain supply lines from source countries to Fiji. Meanwhile, the

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>user base, predominantly consist of young people including students who fall into the addiction and 
<br/>often  become  distributors  themselves  to  support  their  drug  use.    This  cycle  of  dependency  and 
<br/>distribution is particularly alarming.  One of the most concerning outcomes of this cycle is the rise 
<br/>in HIV positive cases directly linked to the sharing of needles amongst drug users.  This practice 
<br/>exacerbates the public health crisis we are facing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within our correctional facilities, we are struggling to maintain the use of smuggling of drugs.   
<br/>Our remand centres  in  particular, face significant challenges due to  the high  turnover population.  
<br/>Inmates  under  the  influence  of  hard  drugs  often  exhibit  aggressive  behaviour,  creating  a  volatile 
<br/>environment for both, staff and other inmates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite stringent security measures, drugs continue to be confiscated from various drop off 
<br/>points around our facilities. The increasing use of needles for drug injection is primarily contributed 
<br/>to the spike of HIV among inmates. This, coupled with the deterioration of mental faculties among 
<br/>drug users presents a substantial challenge for the Fiji Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We remain committed to addressing these issues through rigorous measures and heightened 
<br/>vigilance but recognise the need for border community support.  We call upon parents, educators, 
<br/>community leaders to join in combating this crisis. Preventing drug abuse begins with education and 
<br/>awareness.    By  working  together,  we  can  help  prevent  the  spread  of  addiction  and  its  associated 
<br/>harms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may highlight and acknowledge the hard work done by few individuals 
<br/>in the organisation namely Kalesi Volatabu, Drug Free World in Fiji.  I also endorse the community 
<br/>leaders, church leaders for honest conversation of this issue.  I also endorse the hard work done by 
<br/>Raymond Tabuya Foundation, who works with young drug users in Nabua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the collaboration with development partners, in our continued efforts to enhance 
<br/>the Fiji Corrections Service, we have sought collaboration with international development partners.  
<br/>We are in discussion with the Australian High Commission and other stakeholders to secure support 
<br/>for  constructing  a  specialised  rehabilitation  facility.    This  facility  will  cater  for  drug  and  sexual 
<br/>offenders, mentally ill inmates and provide skilled-based training programmes.  We are also seeking 
<br/>a secondment of an expert from our development partners to assist in the scoping phase of this project, 
<br/>ensuring that we align with the global best practices in corrections and rehabilitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the future development plans for the Fiji Corrections Service? The development of 
<br/>a drug rehabilitation centre, the establishment of the proposed Rakiraki Corrections Centre, extension 
<br/>of  the  Levuka  land  boundary,  establishing  partnership  with  New  Zealand  to  support  sniffer  dog 
<br/>capability and to restrain control training, the commercialisation and partnership with private entities, 
<br/>the digitisation of staff and prison records, staff training and resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to continue my Ministerial Statement but outlining some of the 
<br/>success stories in terms of the service by the Ministry of Justice. In 2013, a lady born on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 
<br/>1958 became bedridden at the age of 55. By 2018, when she turned 60, her family sought financial 
<br/>assistance  from  Social  Welfare.   However,  they  faced  a  significant  hurdle,  the  need  for  her  birth 
<br/></span><span>certificate. Despite visiting the Ministry of Justice’s office five times, they received no response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous government continually turned them away, this family had travelled all the way 
<br/>from a maritime island making their plight even more challenging. During one of my </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session 
<br/>at Raiwai Community Hall, the family brought this issue to our attention. The Coalition Government 
<br/>committed  to  addressing  such  injustices  took  immediate  innovative  action  to  assist  the  family. 
<br/>Through the concerted efforts of my Ministry, we ensured that the lady finally received her birth

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>certificate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  proud  to  report  that  she  is  now  one  of  our  social  welfare  recipients.  This  story  is  a 
<br/>testament  of  our  Government's  dedication  to  serving  the  people,  especially  those  who  have  been 
<br/>neglected  for  far  too  long.  It  highlights  the  positive  changes  we  can  achieve  through  empathy, 
<br/>commitment and proactive governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is another story, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share.  A compelling story that illustrates 
<br/>the dedication, innovative approach of our current Government in serving the people of Fiji. A male 
<br/>child born in Fiji on 27th March, 1975, tragically passed away in Ethiopia in November 1984 at a 
<br/>young  age  of  nine.  His  body  was  brought  to  Fiji  for  burial.    Since  2014,  his  relatives  have  been 
<br/>travelling from overseas at a great expense to obtain official confirmation from our government that 
<br/>his birth record is now marked as deceased. Despite their efforts, the previous administration failed 
<br/>to take any innovative steps to assist them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During one of my </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions in Koronivia on the 3rd Sunday of July last month, the 
<br/>relatives shared their heartbreaking story, they expressed that they had lost all hope. I advised them 
<br/>to visit the Registrar General’s Office assuring them that our current officers are capable of thinking 
<br/>outside the box and willing to assist.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  my  advice,  my  officers  at  Registrar  General’s  Office  took  immediate  action  to 
<br/>assist the family. They were able to confirm the deceased status of the birth record through liaison 
<br/>with the Fiji Corrections Service, brining immense relief and joy to the relatives.  This crucial step 
<br/>now allows them to proceed with the necessary legal process for their family properties in court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this story highlights our Ministry’s commitment to creating meaningful change. 
<br/>We  are  dedicated  to  ensuring  that  all  Fijians  can  witness  the  positive  transformation  from  being 
<br/>implemented by this Coalition Government.  Our innovative and compassionate approach is making 
<br/>a real difference in the lives of citizens, restoring their faith in the system, enabling them to move 
<br/>forward with their lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Feel good speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- There is another interesting story, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I would like 
<br/>to  share.  During  my  </span><span>talanoa</span><span>  session  at  Kilikali  this  year,  a  distressing  case  was  brought  to  my 
<br/>attention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  A  10  year  old  male  child  had  been  unable  to  enrol  in  any  school 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because he did not have any birth certificate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I did this, I did that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- For the past eight years, his family had been trying desperately to 
<br/></span><span>obtain his crucial document. As a result, they missed out on all the grants provided for the students 
<br/></span><span>by the previous FijiFirst Government.
