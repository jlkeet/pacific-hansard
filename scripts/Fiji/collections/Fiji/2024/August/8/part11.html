<div><span>Consolidated Review Report –  
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to 
<br/>present this Consolidated Committee Report for the review of the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 Audit 
<br/>Reports on public enterprises and other entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2019-2020 Report covers audits of 11 Financial Statements of eight public enterprises 
<br/>and  three  other  entities.    Out  of  the  11  audit  opinions  that  were  issued,  one  was  from  the  2015 
<br/></span><span>Financial  Statements,  two  from  the  2018  Financial  Statements,  five  were  from  2019  Financial 
<br/></span><span>Statements and three from the 2020 Financial Statements for the various entities. The Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General had issued 10 unmodified audit opinions and one modified or qualified opinion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2021-2022 Report covers audits of 30 Financial Statements for 10 public enterprises and 
<br/>four other entities.  Twenty-five were issued with unmodified audit opinions and five were issued 
<br/>with modified or qualified opinions.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1545 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee deliberated and noted some of the significant matters that need to be brought 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the attention of the House for consideration and these include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing significant delays in submission of quality draft financial statements for audit 
<br/>which is warranted by those respective Boards and those charged with governance of State-
<br/>owned enterprises, including the Permanent Secretary and the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>❖</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>❖</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2019-2020 Report, the quality of four entities out of eleven, were found to be 
<br/>ineffective, while for timeliness, seven entities out of 11 were ineffective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  2021-2022  Report,  the  quality  of  two  entities  out  of  30,  were  found  to  be 
<br/>ineffective, while for timeliness, seven entities out of 30 were ineffective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Modified audit opinion issued for the Financial Statements audited every year on public 
<br/>enterprises and other entities reflected negatively on the entities concerned, its Board, the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for Public Enterprises and the Minister responsible.  Urgent and close 
<br/>attention needs to be given to address matters which have been highlighted in the Auditor’s 
<br/>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General also needs to be the external auditor for all State-Owned Entities and 
<br/>should  have  the  power  to  carry  out  audit,  whether  financial  or  performance,  on  those 
<br/>organisations that directly or indirectly receive funding from Government, to ensure that 
<br/>the findings can be reported to Parliament.  Therefore, those falling outside the ambit the 
<br/>Auditor-General should review the decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  long-term  financial  sustainability  of  some  of  the  entities  without  Government 
<br/>assistance continued to be questioned, let alone the ability to provide an acceptable return 
<br/>(dividend  and/or  growth)  per  annum  to  Government.  Hence,  Management  and  Board 
<br/>should ensure to provide strategic direction for long-term financial stability of entities to 
<br/>minimise the heavy reliance on Government grant or assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving risk assessment processes to achieve the entity’s objectives and forming a clear 
<br/>basis for determining how risks are managed and needs to be strengthened as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Public Enterprises need to improve overall monitoring of the entities, including 
<br/>the establishment of independent internal audit functions and  a Board Audit Committee, 
<br/></span><span>which could assist in identifying the gaps in controls for necessary action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  also  potential  for  these  public  enterprises  and  State-Owned  Entities  to  be  a 
<br/>development agent and earning sector of its own, like the Local Governments, to support 
<br/>development  and  investment  targets  for  Fiji.    In  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  latest 
<br/>Report, ‘Finding Balance 2023 Key Findings for Fiji’, the following was noted which, we 
<br/>believe, can be improved substantially: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Number of State-Owned Entities:  20 
<br/></span><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Dominant industries: power, aviation and banking 
<br/></span><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Book value of assets:  $4.2 billion 
<br/></span><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Total fixed assets in the economy: 16 percent to 22 percent of GDP 
<br/></span><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Average portfolio contribution to GDP: 3.7 percent 
<br/></span><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Average return on assets: 2.1 percent 
<br/></span><span>❖</span><span> </span><span>Average return on equity: 4 percent 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>With a $4.2 billion in assets and average return on equity around 4 percent, again, there is 
<br/>potential  and  what  we  saw  was  that  these  enterprises  were  not  strategically  governed, 
<br/>managed and supervised in the last 10 years to 15 years, and we believe it needs a Ministry 
<br/>of its own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also potential for these public enterprises to be the prime contributor to our planned 
<br/>sovereign wealth fund, apart from our natural resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  strongly  encourages  the  current  Executive  Management  and  Board  of 
<br/>relevant public enterprises and other entities to take responsibility for the deficiencies that have been 
<br/>found and identified, even though most of the audited reports are old and were under the auspices of 
<br/>the previous Minister and Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the clarifications provided, forward commitment expressed by the current 
<br/>Management and the Board, and improvements seen by the Committee, revealed that these entities 
<br/>have  taken  the  Auditor-General’s  recommendation  positively  and  are  taking  necessary  actions  to 
<br/>resolve significant matters that were highlighted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  wish  to  thank the Executives of the 17  public  enterprises and 
<br/>other entities for providing its written responses to the audit issues that were raised and measures that 
<br/>have been put in place to resolve the issues identified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I wish to commend the staff of the Office of Auditor-General for providing technical 
<br/>clarifications on those issues, as well as accompanying the Committee to all the consultations around 
<br/>the  country.    A  special  thanks  goes  out  to  the  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  and  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary, for the provision of updated figures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to extend my appreciation as well to the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Committee who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report, namely: honourable 
<br/>Sakiusa Tubuna - Deputy Chairperson, honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and 
<br/>honourable Hem Chand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  thank  honourable  Ratu  Isikeli  Tuiwailevu,  honourable  Vijay  Nath  and 
<br/>honourable Taito Matasawalevu, who stood in as Alternative Members, pursuant to Standing Order 
<br/>115(5), and participated in the Committee consultations.  
<br/></span></div>
