<div><span>Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Measures for MSMEs 
<br/>(Question No. 118/2024)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation measures in place for the micro, small and medium enterprises 
<br/>that have received assistance and funding? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Tubuna 
<br/>for the question. Firstly, I am happy to report that the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small 
<br/>and Medium Enterprises and Communications does conduct regular monitoring and evaluation of 
<br/>grant recipients.  It is interesting to note that since inception of its current programme, there has been 
<br/>about $107 million invested in MSMEs in terms of the broad spectrum from young entrepreneurs, 
<br/>women, co-operatives and the like.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  developed  quite  a  comprehensive  programme  that  actually  monitors  the 
<br/>progress of MSMEs.  The framework is, obviously, data driven - it works on data analysis, doing 
<br/>visitations  and  tries  to  measure  the  grant  impacts  in  terms  of  employment  created,  livelihood 
<br/>supported, growth in revenue, increase export markets, for example, for the National Export Strategy 
<br/>(NES) and contribution to the SDGs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  last  two  years,  Sir,  there  has  been  about  almost  2,000  visits  covering  various 
<br/>assistance programmes.  They use a software called Kobo Toolbox to do the analysis and there are 
<br/>some interesting statistics or findings from the reports, for example, in terms of the Integrated Human 
<br/>Resource Development Programme (IHRDP) and Northern Development Programme (NDP) which 
<br/>have a success rate of 90 percent and 95 percent respectively.  That is quite pleasing to note because 
<br/>they are quite popular programmes and particularly the fact that they reach right into the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On average, IHRDP recipients creates about nine jobs whereas the NES creates about 13 jobs 
<br/>and NDP three jobs.  On average, for the NES recipients, some of them are generating up to $65,000 
<br/>in sales and should be noted, of course, that this varies by sector as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thought  I  just  share  some  specific  examples,  just  to  demonstrate  how  impactful  these 
<br/>programmes are.  Of course, it was started by the previous Government.  In 2021-2022, Mr. Samisoni 
<br/>Manewa was supported by IHRDP for a three-tonne manual truck. This assistance has allowed him 
<br/>to improve his product.  A recent visit to Mr. Manewa’s farm has shown a 12 percent increase in 
<br/>sales, which is great and it is, of course, demonstrating the impact of the funding on the farm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ms.  Alumita  Tuila  of  Goodness  Investment  was  supported  through  IHRDP  with  baking 
<br/>equipment and is from Galoa Village in Kadavu. Through the baking equipment, she was able to 
<br/>produce about three batches of freshly baked loaves of bread in a day for 150 households.  From that, 
<br/>she was then able to secure a loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) of about $5,000 to expand 
<br/>her business. The business expansion, of course, has been made possible through her sales. I am told 
<br/>she is now selling to Vunisea Secondary School as well, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I guess the monitoring of these businesses is showing that a lot of the money is being put to 
<br/>good use, Sir, which is positive and right now, we are trying to, sort of, create a database for the 
<br/>national MSMEs around Fiji.  With that database, we can actually then much closely track on an 
<br/></span><span>automated basis the MSMEs and ensure that the money that we are investing in MSMEs is well spent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I understand that you would be doing monitoring 
<br/>and evaluation of these MSMEs. In terms of evaluation, their effectiveness and their success is one 
<br/>of the things that you would be able to ascertain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we have found ones that are effective and we ascertain that they can do better, what are we 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actually doing in terms of redirecting or directing them to take them to the next level in terms of 
<br/>growing as a business?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question, honourable Member.  The story 
<br/>about Mrs. Tuila is a good sort of example of that kind of process where we inject some initial funding 
<br/>and  because  the  business  is  doing  well,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  generate  more  funding 
<br/>opportunities, for example, through concessional loans through FDB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we are trying to do, Sir, is to guide the SMEs as they develop. Right now, one of the 
<br/>things  that  we  are  blessed  with  is  that  there  is  starting  to  be  a  lot  more options  for  financing  for 
<br/>MSMEs. Fijian Holdings has come up with two products, the Vanua Financing and also the Marama 
<br/>Financing.  Before for SMEs, you have to do equity contributions. There is a product now at HFC 
<br/>that they just launched last week where you do not need equity. You can actually go and provide a 
<br/>proposal if the proposal is good, then you actually just lend the money. There is a guarantee that is 
<br/>in place with BLP that actually covers the equity component. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we are trying to do is to handhold the businesses from the beginning.  
<br/>There are some that are just so good, they actually take off quite well. A lot of time we encourage 
<br/>diversification of income. So, you are actually looking at other opportunities, particularly, in a village 
<br/>setting.  You can be doing bread, like in Mrs. Tuila’s case.  She actually owns the shops that sells 
<br/>everything else in the village. So, it is sort of a progressive evolution of the business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, what kind 
<br/>of support and guidance is provided to MSMEs to help them meet the monitoring and evaluation 
<br/>requirements? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  terms  of the current monitoring and 
<br/>evaluation methodology that is in place, that was in place when I got there. From what I have seen 
<br/>of it, it is quite robust. I think what is desperately needed at the moment there is, an actual proper 
<br/>tracker  so  we  can  actually  know,  like  for  example,  if  you  ask  me,  how many  MSMEs  are  in  the 
<br/>country, I have no idea. I think that should be the starting point as we try and develop the new MSME 
<br/>ecosystem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, then we will be able to track each business, and would it not be wonderful to be able to 
<br/>track something from micro and you can see it become a small business and then it keeps growing.  
<br/>We are starting to see a lot more interest coming into the office.  There are some businesses that are 
<br/>doing juice are doing it very well. Now they are saying they want to do restaurants, so it is how do 
<br/>we handhold them through that process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some very good expertise, a lot of staff particularly the MSMEs space are being 
<br/>well experienced.  They do a good job of handholding a lot of our aspiring entrepreneurs through that 
<br/>process.    Right  now,  there  is  probably  not  a  need  to  review  but  certainly  as  we  need  to  create  a 
<br/>database. I believe there might be a need to relook at the valuation methodology again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, just on the back of your answer earlier on, I see all 
<br/></span><span>the institutions that you mentioned were basically its our own FDB, our own HFC. The question is, 
<br/></span><span>have you been able to get some traction from the other commercial banks et cetera because this is a 
<br/>huge area for us the MSMEs.  We all know what they do for a country and its development.  For 
<br/>many years, I think a lot of the commercial banks have steered clear of that particular issue. Have 
<br/>you been able to get some traction with these other commercial banks apart from our own HFCs and 
<br/>FDBs because we simply to be forever left with the burden (not a burden) but at least getting the 
<br/>assistance to these MSMEs. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1584 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question, honourable Koya. Put it this 
<br/>way, it is an ongoing discussion, clearly each bank has their own risk appetite, Mr. Speaker, and that 
<br/>dictates what to serve the market. From what I can see, HFC and FDB have actually started escalating 
<br/>their desire to participate in those markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously FDB traditionally has been the mainstay of MSME support, HFC is there. It is an 
<br/>ongoing discussion with some of the other banks, I know BSP is very good in the MSME space.  I 
<br/>think  there  is  a  rural  banking  subsidy  that  we  provide  to  them  so  that  they  can  create  the  rural 
<br/>presence.  So even with BSP, for example, they already have an accelerator incubator programme.  
<br/>In a year, they will put three lots of 25 businesses through formal training from financial reporting, 
<br/>how to manage your business and costs.  The bigger Australian banks tend to work with the larger 
<br/>MSMEs, so it is really down to their appetite, but it is just an ongoing discussion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clearly you have to do more. I think the numbers that I saw, there is about, if I am not wrong 
<br/>about a pent-up demand of about $200 million or $300 million of desire for MSME funding.  It does 
<br/>not have a place to go. Some of the things that are happening  in the marketplace, will create that 
<br/>opportunity for more funding and therefore more business by default an economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- On the issue of incubators, that was something that struck the group that 
<br/>recently  visited  Indonesia.    It  was  the  universities  that  drove  the  project  of  young  entrepreneur 
<br/>bachelor  students.    They  registered  themselves  and  they  register  what  they  want  to  do.    It  is  the 
<br/>university that carries them, and they are selling wonders from the various kind of things that you 
<br/>drink  to  take  away  your  sickness  by  mixing  herbs,  ginger  and  things  of  that  nature  that  is  in  the 
<br/>market. The only issue there is they have a very big population and they are a market to themselves, 
<br/>about 300 million and they are doing very well in MSMEs.  I do not know if we can learn to take a 
<br/>leaf out from that. Perhaps on your next visit to Indonesia, I would strongly advice that you liaise 
<br/>with the areas that we visited, and our Ambassador in Indonesia is very knowledgeable of what is 
<br/>happening there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress of Registration - Traditional Title Holders 
<br/>(Question No. 120/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts 
<br/>update Parliament on the progress of the registration of vacant traditional title holder(s)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 6,216 traditional </span><span>vanua</span><span> positions, 214 </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>iTaukei</span><span>, 1,375 </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> and 4,627 </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span>.  As at January 2024, 90 </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>itaukei</span><span> positions were filled or 42 percent, 670 </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> were filled or 49 percent and 2,305 
<br/></span><span>Turaga  ni  Mataqali</span><span>  were  filled  or  50  percent.  Therefore,  about  3,065  positions  were  filled  or  49 
<br/>percent of the positions.  The vacancy rate was 51 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a long time the vacancy rate in traditional titles, positions was about 50 
<br/>percent.  More than half of the </span><span>vanua</span><span> structure lacked leadership.  A major reason was because the 
<br/></span><span>procedure  for  filling vacant  positions is  always led by the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>.   There is  no movement  if they 
<br/></span><span>decide not to act.  When a vacancy arises, members of the </span><span>Tokatoka, Mataqali</span><span> or </span><span>Yavusa</span><span> decides 
<br/>who the next title holder should be, then they inform the relevant provincial council office which in 
<br/>turn notifies the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year the Gret Council of Chiefs (GCC) changed that procedure.  After 
<br/>choosing Rewa as the pilot province for poverty alleviation, the GCC instructed the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1585 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  visit  the  villages  in  Rewa  where  vacancies  existed.    Development  would  be  effective  and 
<br/>meaningful only if the </span><span>vanua</span><span> leadership is strengthened by filling the vacant posts and providing the 
<br/>awareness and training to the title holders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Rewa Province vacancy rate was 57 percent, with 43 percent of positions being 
<br/>filled.  The </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> visited 50 of Rewa’s 55 villages.  The visit reduced the vacancy rate 
<br/>from  57 percent  to  29 percent  or 71 percent  of all positions are now filled. The success  in  Rewa 
<br/>prompt the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> to visit Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove. The first was Bua, which had a 
<br/>44 percent vacancy rate, but by the end of the exercise, the vacancy rate decreased to 16 percent, with 
<br/>84 percent of all positions in Bua now filled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Macuata  initially  had  a  39  percent  vacancy  rate,  which  decreased  to  12 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent resulting in 88 percent of the positions being filled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Cakaudrove had  a 59 percent  vacancy rate which decreased to  12 percent  with  88 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent of the positions now filled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  week,  the  </span><span>Veitarogi  Vanua  </span><span>visited  Serua.    Before  the  visit,  Serua  had  48  out  of  81 
<br/>positions vacant or 59 percent vacancy rate.  After the visit, 67 positions are now filled with Serua 
<br/>vacancy rate reduced to 18 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary 258 out of 343 positions in Rewa are now filled; 331 out of 391 
<br/>positions are now filled in Bua; 414 out of 470 positions in Macuata are now filled; 439 out of 499 
<br/>positions in Cakaudrove are now filled; and 67 out of 81 positions in Serua are now filled.   Following 
<br/>the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) intervention, the overall vacancy rate decreased from 49 percent 
<br/>to 44 percent, with 56 percent of all positions now being filled.  For the first time in a long time, we 
<br/>have now surpassed the 51 percent mark.  This was our target before the end of the last financial 
<br/>year, which we have achieved.  We plan to visit all the provinces by the end of this financial year.  
<br/>At the current rate, we project that 88 percent of all positions will be filled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC reinstatement has been less than a year, yet its profound wisdom 
<br/>and guidance are already felt.  We have seen the success of taking the services to the community 
<br/>instead of waiting for them up here in our office.  We will work with the </span><span>vanua</span><span> to ensure that most 
<br/>of the 6,216 traditional title positions are filled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, thank you indeed for the response and let 
<br/>me congratulate your Ministry and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs for the progress made, and we all 
<br/>know how important this is.  Just a quick question, in the numbers that have been filled, you have 
<br/>detailed the different positions; </span><span>Turaga i Taukei, Turaga ni Yavusa </span><span>and </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali. </span><span>With 
<br/>those that have been confirmed now, is it more with the </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali </span><span>or </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa 
<br/></span><span>because sometimes the higher up we go, the more the complication is in our communities.  Out of 
<br/>those numbers, is it more on </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa </span><span>or </span><span>Turaga i Taukei </span><span>or </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, the latest one that we have received is mostly the </span><span>Turaga ni 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mataqali </span><span>that has been filled and we are working on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister 
<br/>on the huge progress that is being made.  This has been a long-standing issue that people have talked 
<br/>about at great length, and I know it also affects me from Lakeba and what happens in there in our 
<br/></span><span>mataqali, na yavusa.</span><span>  But if I heard correctly, the statement that you made was that the instruction 
<br/>was given by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) to the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua.  </span><span>If that is correct, then to 
<br/>my mind, it seems that the GCC is having a direct impact on operational matters, or was that a my

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>misstatement on your behalf?  If that could be just clarified? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Honourable Usamate, that has been the resolution from the GCC.  When 
<br/>we took the reports of the China trip to the GCC, the plan was to trial in Rewa.  When we took Rewa 
<br/>to be the pilot province, then they advised us if the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span>, instead of waiting for the </span><span>vnua 
<br/></span><span>to come, if we can take the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua </span><span>to the Rewa province. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could we have something on  that, honourable Attorney-General  or you 
<br/>want to shed some more light on that?  The honourable Usamate is concerned of the role that GCC 
<br/>plays here to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.E.  LEUNG.-  Mr.  Speaker,  thank  you  for  the  question.  As  far  as  I  am  aware 
<br/>honourable Member, it is well within the remit and the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Chiefs to 
<br/>give advisory opinions or recommendations with respect to matters pertaining to Fijian culture and 
<br/>customary practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, just a supplementary question through you, I 
<br/>would like to  thank the honourable Minister for  his  submission to  the House this afternoon.  We 
<br/>usually know that the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua </span><span>comes where there is a dispute, but I am grateful to the Great 
<br/>Council Chiefs that now they have come to the </span><span>vanua.  </span><span>I just want to know Mr. Speaker, what sort 
<br/>of programmes they normally do when they come and visit the </span><span>vanua?  </span><span>Do they hear disputes, or 
<br/>they clarify titled positions as to who should be the holder, just for the Fijians who are listening to 
<br/>our conservation this afternoon? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, what the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> will always do is, receives all the 
<br/>records of those who have got the request for the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua </span><span>to look after the issues in regards  
<br/>to the Vanua.  Then we liaise with the Roko and the timeframe that the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> wants to 
<br/>visit each province, then the Roko will organise with the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> the list that they have got, 
<br/>if  they  can  advise  them  that  they  are  coming.  At  the  same  time,  they  can  look  at  the  disputed 
<br/>boundaries  and  other  things  like  that,  they  cover  all  those.  Next  week,  they  will  be  travelling  to 
<br/>Kadavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu,</span><span> honourable Minister.  I must thank and congratulate you 
<br/>and your Ministry for the great work that has been undertaken.  Again, I kind of kept to myself when 
<br/>I look towards the Attorney-General since he was a member of the review team of the GCC before 
<br/>he became the AG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The actual role is of the Chiefs collectively.  When they come together, they sit, discuss and 
<br/>come up with these kinds of resolutions. There is a speedy way of finding a way through the hard 
<br/>yards, especially in the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> and I am so thankful for that since you have reduced everything down 
<br/>to about 18 percent or something. That is a huge achievement, and I must congratulate you and your 
<br/>staff for that. Thank you very much.

<div><span>Payment of Additional VAT on Imported Goods 
<br/>(Question No. 121/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament on the additional VAT 
<br/>on goods received from overseas?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1587 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  that 
<br/>question. I was thinking of giving one very simple answer because I think the question itself is a bit 
<br/>flawed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no such thing as additional VAT, but I know the intent of the question, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  I think the intent of the question appears to be on the recent policy changes on personal imports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget, the threshold for personal imports under Code 212 has been 
<br/>reduced from $2,000 to $1,000 and 15 percent VAT is now levied on that effective from 28th June.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, personal importations were treated under Concession Code 212 
<br/>under Customs Tariff Act whereby the importer did not pay fiscal duty, Import Excise duty and VAT 
<br/>on all personal imports up to a value of $2,000.  This, Sir, before the threshold was $500. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During Covid it was moved to $2,000.  So, what we have done Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to reduce 
<br/>that from $2,000 to $1,000, which is still much higher than the $400 that existed prior to the COVID 
<br/>pandemic.  So, the intention of that measure during COVID was to provide a temporary relief to 
<br/>those who wanted to import at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue with respect to this was that we found a lot of instances of 
<br/>misuse  where  certain  individuals,  retailers  had  imported  and  sold  goods  avoiding  VAT,  creating 
<br/>unfair advantage.  So, you could import every week if you had the money, and some people were 
<br/>running  businesses  from  home.  It  is  not  fair  to  those  who  cannot  import  online  and  use  other 
<br/>mechanisms because they have the money. Those who go and buy locally, would obviously have to 
<br/>pay the VAT. So, it is a measure that will bring about equity, it is not going to treat others unfairly. 
<br/>That is the rationale for closing that loophole and removing that COVID measure that there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we understand the rationale that he has given, but 
<br/>the concern is, on one hand the Government talks about the remittances they received and on the 
<br/>other hand, the people who live abroad have been supplementing families’ income by sending food 
<br/>items which they cannot afford, whether it is a wedding, whether it is a funeral or whatever, whatever. 
<br/>But my question to the honourable Minister is which he has just said now that the VAT came into 
<br/>effect on 28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is the Budget  Book which is  an official  document  and on Page No. 30 it says, and I 
<br/>quote: “VAT comes into effect on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024”.  Which one is correct, honourable Minister? Is 
<br/>it this book or what you are saying in Parliament?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My second question is, how are you going to provide that remedy now to the consumers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  honourable  Premila  Kumar’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understanding of the way in which the VAT is applied...

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...and the way in which Customs duty comes into effect is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>day the Budget is announced 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Why did you write 1</span><span>st</span><span> August?

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Obviously, she does not understand what..., 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It’s 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, here! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I said very clearly, under the Customs Tariff Act where the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importer did not pay fiscal duty, import excise duty... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Admit you made a mistake. It is an official document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...that comes into effect on the day the Budget is announced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Why did you write 1</span><span>st</span><span> August? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that  honourable Premila 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kumar’s understanding of how VAT is applying... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I do not know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …is  actually  quite  bad.  This  is  an  example  to  prove  her 
<br/>understanding of how VAT is applied, which is actually wrong.  She put out a </span><span>Facebook</span><span> post on 26</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>July, 2024, “this is an example to proof her understanding of how VAT is applying... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Is actually wrong. She puts this </span><span>Facebook</span><span> post “Unbelievable 
<br/>butter price has the result of 15 percent VAT.  500 gramme butter is almost the price of chicken.  
<br/>Everyday  consumers  are  struggling  to  put  food  on  the  table,  promises  were  made  by  NFP,  PAP, 
<br/>SODELPA that they will reduce the cost of living.  Unfortunately, there was nothing in the Budget 
<br/>towards changes here for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very poor!. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  VAT  is  a  one-  off  thing.  When  it  was 
<br/>introduced last year, first of all, it was not a 15 percent, it was moved from 9 percent to 15 percent... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! You asked the question, and you want to provide the answer too? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I just explain, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He is beating around the bush. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- It is not beating around the bush because now, she is caught.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She is caught lying as a Member of Parliament as to how VAT is applied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when VAT was increased last year, it takes effect, after that, the increase or

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1589 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decrease in the prices is not based on VAT, is based on other factors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The prices, for example, in October 2023,  the landed cost 
<br/>went down by 12.83 (16 percent).  Would she said that this was caused by increase or decrease in 
<br/>VAT?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And for an honourable Member to go out and put a misleading 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>post ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely wrong! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … this is the kind of lies they tell, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, when 
<br/>she was  asking the question, the question itself  was flawed, because she does not  understand the 
<br/>VAT.  There is no such thing as additional VAT, but it is the VAT at a point in time.  Anything that 
<br/>happens in terms of the fluctuation in prices, thereafter, is dependent on other factors, whether it is 
<br/>freight cost, whether it is the cost of raw materials, that is how VAT is applied.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, coming back to the question, I have answered that, customs duty and import duty 
<br/>come into effect the day the Budget is announced, and I have explained this in Parliament previously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether it came on 20</span><span>th</span><span> or 1</span><span>st</span><span>, it really does not 
<br/>matter to me but what actually does matter now at the moment is, after this policy was implemented, 
<br/>what this courier company started doing, and this is what they are telling people, is that they did not 
<br/>have anyone to process the VAT in their company.  Now, it is an additional burden.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have a common example, if you actually import something, on $100, if you are paying $15 
<br/>as VAT component, there is an additional charge of $20 as agency fee or administration fee.  So there 
<br/>is an additional $20 being charged by the courier companies on top of the VAT, which is a burden.  
<br/>It is there, I am requesting the honourable Minister for Finance to, please, investigate and if this is 
<br/>true, please, get the courier companies to stop charging this additional $20.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other misconception is, if they actually open a particular consignment, they also need a 
<br/>Biosecurity Officer to come and inspect with an additional $5.25.  So, they are paying much more to 
<br/>the courier company at this point in time to what they are paying as a VAT component, if they are 
<br/>actually buying something worth FJ$100.   If the honourable Minister for Finance can look into this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to facilitate VAT payments, electronic pay 
<br/>systems,  like  M-PAiSA,  MyCash  and  internet  banking  can  be  utilised.    Freight  companies  are 
<br/>seamlessly managing this through freight companies, ensuring that  there  is  a streamlined process 
<br/></span><span>without additional burden.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also asked the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service to deploy additional staff to assist 
<br/>freight companies.  Options like, pre-clearance and pre-payment are available for courier companies 
<br/>and freight stations to enhance operational efficiency.  But we will also check on what additional 
<br/>charges they are putting on.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for a lengthy no good 
<br/>answer.    He  has  mentioned  that  customs  duty  and  fiscal  duty  comes  into  play,  in  fact,  it  went 
<br/>immediately.  I totally agree with it.  But the question was on VAT.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VAT, as per the blue book, states that it will come into effect from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August.  When the 
<br/>Budget  was  announced  the  VAT  on  personal  imports  came  into  effect  immediately.    That  is  the 
<br/>clarification we want and that is what you need to answer.  Do not go beating around the bush, get to 
<br/>the point and answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He has answered that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He did not answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, he has answered your questions by stating what you have just said, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Sachida Nand.  So, let us move on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the blue book is very clear.  What he said, is not 
<br/>what he has answered.  The honourable Deputy Prime Minister needs to learn when he answers a 
<br/>question, just answer it.  Stop depreciating and making personal attacks on people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, have a bit of decorum.  Have a bit of decorum! 
<br/>Have  some  spine  and  be  strong  and  be  still.    Here  is  the  question,  has  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/>consulted freight companies and recipients about the challenge they face due to the new personal 
<br/>import requirements? Because they have things cluttering up their warehouses, people are not being 
<br/>able to take them out because of these changes that you have made. If so, what feedback has been 
<br/>received on how this has been addressed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just informed them that FRCS has deployed 
<br/>additional staff. They are working with freight companies and there would have been initial teething 
<br/>problems as you introduce new systems. They are working on the freight companies, and I am sure 
<br/>those problems are sorted out.

<div><span>Installation of Telecommunications Towers 
<br/>(Question No. 122/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament of the process 
<br/>that was undertaken to facilitate the installation of telecommunication towers in our rural 
<br/>and maritime areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr. Speaker, to be honest this is probably one area where 
<br/>we are really keen to get going but let me just to explain where we have gotten to. Basically, when I 
<br/>took over the Ministry of Communications, the whole Department was gutted, Telecommunications 
<br/></span><span>Authority of Fiji (TAF) was really in disarray, so we had to start rebuilding those institutions. So, we 
<br/></span><span>went out and selected the right people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a very capable Chairman, Mr. David Eyre, who is a former Telecom Senior Manager 
<br/>and he is there with some other well-known telecommunications people, such as Tomasi Vakatora, 
<br/>who was a long time Executive of ATH. They have now started to progress this exercise well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1591 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to assure the House that we are very committed to actually get the rest of the 
<br/>country connected.  We are going to use the universal service fee which is available and there is quite 
<br/>a bit of money there, and we are also having conversation with some donor agencies to see whether 
<br/>we can top that up so we can move through very quickly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically,  we  actually  had  to  go  out  to  do  an  Expression  of  Interest  or  tender  to  the 
<br/>telecommunications industry.  That is now done. There is now conversation where we had to actually 
<br/>solicit some expertise from  the USAid  - their Digital  Connectivity and Cybersecurity  Partnership 
<br/>(DCCP) programme, which provide us with some expertise in terms of financial modelling to decide 
<br/>where we put that infrastructure.  That is now all in place and I can confirm that towards the end of 
<br/>December, we will start deploying the towers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, because of Starlink, Sir, it has created another option for the Ministry in terms 
<br/>options for connectivity, so we are looking at that as well. But rest assured, Sir, I am really trying to 
<br/>ensure that before the end of this year we start connecting up. The idea is to connect the maritime 
<br/>region first and at the same time look at some of the more marginalised provinces such as Ra, Bua, 
<br/>so that is the kind of progress we are trying to make.   This will be quite a wonderful thing to do and 
<br/>I just like to assure both sides of the House that are working very hard to get this done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Honourable Minister, with respect to the installation of these particular 
<br/>towers,  will  we  also  be  allowing  the  commercial  companies  that  currently  exists  in  the 
<br/>telecommunications industry to piggyback onto these towers and provide the particular services that 
<br/>are required for FMA, et cetera, all the kind of stuff in the rural maritime areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, yes, we are looking at some other options as 
<br/>well. Pacific, for example, has a full solution that includes a solar system that actually powers up the 
<br/>tower. So that is another option as well that has been looked at.  The options that can be looked at, 
<br/>the team  is  working  very hard to  ensure that  we get  to  the right landing  point and to  honourable 
<br/>Usamate’s point about  execution, that is going to be quite important to  make sure we get it done 
<br/>correctly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for 
<br/>the work that he is doing in addressing this issue. It has been a longstanding issue, and Ministers will 
<br/>have realised as you go around for your </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session this is what people perennially talk about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to hear also that the focus is on the rural and maritime, places where companies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been reluctant to set up towers because of the huge cost and the low returns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of the around when we were doing the assessments, there are about 300 blackspots all around 
<br/>Fiji. So, roughly in terms of the rural and maritime the blackspot areas, what percentage do you think 
<br/>you will be able to cover within this financial year and the next financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, that is quite a good question. I do not have that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>data one me to be honest, but I will get that and provide it to honourable Usamate.

<div><span>International Standards - Building and Construction Sector 
<br/>(Question No. 137/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>1592 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>Ministry’s plans to adopt more international standards and guidelines in the Building and 
<br/>Construction Sector to make the industry more effective and efficient? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems like I am monopolising question 
<br/>time today but it is really because I did not have the chance to answer the questions from Tuesday.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree that the building and construction industry is one of the 
<br/>most  vital  industries  to  the  country  and  the  need  to  continue  to  have  sustainable  practices  and 
<br/>standards is very important in ensuring, you recall that I have been talking a lot about investment and 
<br/>the need to have good standards to be able to support the construction is quite important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Historically, there was a guideline for improving building safety and resilience for new single 
<br/>storey houses and schools in the rural areas that was launched by with the World Bank.  Also, more 
<br/>recently there has been standards such as the standard on re-enforcing materials which is AS/NZS 
<br/>4671 that was introduced and that was just to look at reinforcement standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, there is a discussion going on in terms of wind load standards, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>and that will be quite important in terms of the ability to have insurance cover in the future.  There 
<br/>are some activities going on with the engineers and also the stakeholders at the moment, in terms of 
<br/>that particular proposed standard and once we are in a position to bring that forward, we will. Some 
<br/>of  the  other  standards  that  we  are  looking  at  include  plywood  standards,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  even 
<br/>bamboo standards.  That is just to create more options in terms of construction, particularly in terms 
<br/>of the bamboo standard.  So that is being looked at the moment and I think overall, as we continue 
<br/>to evolve as an economy, the need for good building standards will become more and more important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Trade Measurements and Standards, I call them the silent heroes in the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade.  We do not hear them that much in terms of visibility like other fancy areas like 
<br/>Trade and Investment, but they are doing quite a bit of work in trying to ensure that standards in the 
<br/>country continue to be of a good level, good standard, because it does ensure that we have, not only 
<br/>resilient construction but also buildings that last.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, just a note of interest, I guess the attempt to regionalise a lot of these issues, Fiji now 
<br/>Co-Chairs the Pacific Islands Standards Committee, which is another avenue to discuss standards 
<br/>and  ventilate  standards  across  the  region.    The  Department  of  Measurement  and  Standards  will 
<br/>continue to work with the rest of the Pacific in terms of supporting standards, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>obviously the need for improving our standards to make sure that we have good buildings that are 
<br/>effective and the manner in which we build buildings are effective and efficient is highly laudatory.  
<br/>As I was listening, Mr. Speaker Sir, I was wondering establishing the standards, there has been a lot 
<br/>of work done recently on the National Building Code.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Building Code has always been under the Minister for of Health.  Over the past few 
<br/></span><span>years, the Ministry for Public Works has taken the lead on this. I am just wondering as you look into 
<br/></span><span>the standards, how is that integration with the building code, how is that working at the moment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Thank  you  for  that  question.    In  terms  of  when  the 
<br/>consultation  on  the  standards  happen,  I  am  trying  to  remember  the  position,  but  the  Government 
<br/>architect gets involved in actually the establishment of the standards, he is also a member of the Fiji 
<br/>Institute of Engineers Association.  That cross check and discission is currently happening. There is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1593 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>another discussion that is probably going to happen very soon on the Building Code as we go forward 
<br/>because  of  some  of  the  automation  requirements  we  will  require  next  year,  but  that  is  a  separate 
<br/>exercise.  For now, there is cross consultation in terms of ensuring that the standards are robust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, it is great to see that the honourable Minister is actually 
<br/>going  to  improve  the  international  standards  and  guidelines  that  are  going  to  be  used  within  the 
<br/>building industry. One of the most important parts of all of this is the Department of National Trade 
<br/>Measurement and Standards as you have mentioned rightfully, Sir, critical component; very silent 
<br/>but very critical component. Will you be fortifying the department so that we can actually monitor 
<br/>properly what comes into the country and we are compliant in terms of the materials brought to the 
<br/>country?  Will you also be ensuring that the authorities concerned that are involved in this particular 
<br/>process (I am talking about the necessary councils) are brought up to speed quickly about what can 
<br/>be done, what can be used and what cannot be used?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The short answer is, yes ,we are trying to sort of fortify the 
<br/>department and that is involving reaching out to some development partners to assist strengthen the 
<br/>expertise which is quite important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, one of the other things that is being done to actually fortify is actually trying to partner 
<br/>up with some of our donors partners in terms of standards.  As you know, we rely a lot on the New 
<br/>Zealand standards and that will continue.  And now we are actually in the process, now that we are 
<br/>actually in the process of creating a bit more of a closer relationship with the New Zealand standards 
<br/>one just to ensure that we are on the right track. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/>I  raised  this  issue  too  earlier  during  the  week  about  the  legislations  that  we  have  because  the 
<br/>honourable Usamate stated that the building code, although they have assigned the responsibility to 
<br/>the Director Building but in our legislation it is still with and from NDMO perspective, this is one of 
<br/>the problems as well particularly with the standards not only in the schools, but housing in the rural 
<br/>areas and even some in the urban areas.  So, will that be something that will be part of the changes 
<br/>that will be considered honourable Deputy Prime Minister?  The changes in the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not going to open up that discussion 
<br/>because I had not had the conversation with the honourable Minister for Infrastructure who looks 
<br/>after the national building code particularly.  But there are some things that are possibly going to 
<br/>change but what we are doing at the moment is trying to align up the standards first, make sure that 
<br/>they are clear.  As you will recall, we have been talking about the automation of the building permit 
<br/>process and what we are trying to ensure is the building code and whatever requirements in there are 
<br/>actually  aligned  closely  to  the  automation  that  we  are  trying  to  do.    So,  there  is  going  to  be  a 
<br/>conversation, but I just have not had the chance to talk to the honourable Minister yet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has mentioned most of the things 
<br/>but the component of a building code, there are two very important things which I feel should be 
<br/>included in there.  One is water, as you know that water is very important and, in any disaster, or 
<br/>there is a water cut but we experience a lot of water cuts.  If that happens then you will find the whole 
<br/></span><span>building needs to be closed because of health and safety, he did not mention that.  Solar light is very 
<br/></span><span>important now.  I hope these two components are included in the code.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request 
<br/>the honourable Minister to please elaborate on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure whether that is a question or 
<br/>a statement but I will just say that we note the comments of honourable Nath and we will make sure 
<br/>that we have the appropriate discussions.
