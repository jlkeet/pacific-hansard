<br/>MINISTRY OF FORESTRY 2019-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>2019-2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12th July, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1613 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key achievements 2019 – 2020 afforestation projects, successful planting of new forest land 
<br/>contributing to increase forest cover. The implementation of measures to protect endangered species 
<br/>and their habitats, and on community engagement, launching of community-based forestry initiatives 
<br/>to involve local population in conservation efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  in  2020-2021  on  forest  management,  development  and  implementation  of  improved 
<br/>forest  management practices to  enhance  and sustainability  and resilience. On illegal logging, Sir,  
<br/>increase enforcement and monitoring to combat illegal logging activities resulting in reduction of 
<br/>illegal operations. Through climate actions, the initiative to align forest practices with climate action 
<br/>goals including carbon sequestration projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021-2022 reforestation success, the expansion of reforestation efforts with the focus on 
<br/>degrade land and rehabilitation.  For sustainable practices, the introduction of new sustainable forest 
<br/>practices and certification to promote responsible forest management.  In technology integration, the 
<br/>adoption of advanced technology such as satellite monitoring to improve forest management and the 
<br/>conservation strategies which includes the use of drones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  there  were  challenges  faced  in  the  period  under  review  from  2019-2020  as  far  as 
<br/>reforestation continued issues with deforestation of forest degraded impacting biodiversity and eco-
<br/>system services. We also had funding limitations as far as budget constraints with the scale which 
<br/>affected the scale and scope of conservation projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2020-2021 the pandemic impact of COVID-19 disrupt and led to the delay in some of the 
<br/>projects and the challenges in the field operations. As far as resources management, Sir, the difficulty 
<br/>in managing the allocated resources efficiently due to increase demand and reduce funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in 2021-2022 adverse effect on climate change including increasing frequency of forest 
<br/>fires and pest outbreaks. Coordination issues, there were needs for improved coordination between 
<br/>different stakeholders and agencies involved in forestry management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  financial  overview,  the  Committee  noted  with  appreciation  that  the  Ministry  had 
<br/>unqualified audited opinions throughout the years of the Annual Report. Overview of the Ministry’s 
<br/>Budget allocation that expanded across the three fiscal years was also affected by COVID-19. Key 
<br/>areas  of  expenditures  included  forest  conservation  programmes,  reforestation  programmes  and 
<br/>community outreach.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Way  Forward,  Sir,  enhanced  funding,  seek  additional  funding  with  the  resources  to 
<br/>support the expansion, to expend successful programmes and initiatives, to strengthen enforcement, 
<br/>to improve enforcement of forestry laws and regulation to combat illegal activities and protect forest 
<br/>resources, provision of technical expertise and equipment for value adding products to make use of 
<br/>timber  residues  and  reduce  mill  wastage.    The  initiatives  provided  by  the  Ministry  in  providing 
<br/>technical and skilled training on carpentry and joinery for resource owners is highly recommended. 
<br/>Youth groups who are resource owners benefit from this income generated programmes through sales 
<br/>of furniture and artefacts made from timber residues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee strongly recommends that this initiative expanded to other divisions and also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>benefit other resource owners and provide income to the individual families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, the Ministry of Forestry had made significant strides in forest conservation and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>management for the past three years.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Chairperson.  The floor is now open for debate on 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion, and I have the list of speakers provided by the Whips, is follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. J.N. Nand; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Naupoto; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister’s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in my capacity as being one of the Members of the Natural Resources Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a  five-day site visit to the Central, Western and Northern Divisions was 
<br/>undertaken in May to provide insights into the challenges the Ministry faced, the achievements of 
<br/>the  targeted  programmes,  the  issues  faced  by  the  Divisions  and  the  overall  performance  of  the 
<br/>Ministry during the period under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will briefly discuss the sites that we visited, the discussions that took place 
<br/>there and what were some of the pertinent issues that need addressing and some of the issues that has 
<br/>been addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first site visited was the Research and Training Division in 9 Miles, Nasinu.  We managed 
<br/>to find out that there are 14 mahogany stations, and the sector is focused on making use of the residues 
<br/>of timber after it has been processed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Forestry deals with the forests that are licensed to be harvested.  In 2024, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, there was 48 percent sawmill recovery.  This had improved from 41 percent that was 
<br/>achieved in 2019.  It is encouraging to note that the Government and the Ministry has a desire to 
<br/>build a mahogany town at  the Saivou  Junction.  We also  found out  that the Research staff needs 
<br/>further training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  next  visit  was  to  the  Forestry  Research  Unit  in  Colo-i-Suva.    We 
<br/>managed to  find out that research in the Ministry is not at the desired  level due to the laboratory 
<br/>facilities  there.    At  the  moment,  this  is  not  suitable  to  achieve  its  high  level  potential,  but  it  is 
<br/>encouraging to note that the Government is trying to construct a research lab in Colo-i-Suva, to ease 
<br/>the problem of laboratory testing and lab work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also found out that the more mahogany and pine needs to be planted.  At the moment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there are 81.9 percent of natural forest which covers about 1.1 million hectares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on to the Ministry of Forestry Headquarters at Takayawa Building, 
<br/>we  had  a  good  discussion  there  and  found  out  that  the  forest  reserves  need  assessments.    It  was 
<br/>suggested that the community should receive direct fees from the investors and the Government funds 
<br/>to be issued to the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also visited the Vunimaqo Forestry Station, and we gathered information 
<br/>that two out of three staff positions at the Station were filled.  We were informed that the station used 
<br/></span><span>to have a total of six staff.  This indicates a shortage of personnel physically present in the field to 
<br/></span><span>conduct monitoring activities.  Insufficient staff on the ground can hinder the Department’s ability to 
<br/>oversee  operations  effectively,  leading  to  potential  gaps  in  the  monitoring  compliance  with  the 
<br/>regulation or addressing environmental concerns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  there  were  some  concerns  raised  by  the  Forester.    The  Forester  expressed  worries 
<br/>regarding  the  monitoring  of  native  trees,  particularly  the  mahogany  field  designated  for  Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1615 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hardwood Corporation.  The primary concern revolves around the alleged non-payment of stumpage 
<br/>rate, royalty and also associated fees.  This raises issues of compliance with financial obligation and 
<br/>potential, which signifies a breach contractual or regulatory agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, we managed to find out that there is also a need to look into the mahogany industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regulation policy and implementation.  We note that the Ministry is working towards that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also visited the Fiji Pine Limited and we managed to find out that Fiji Pine is owned 90 
<br/>percent  by  the  Fijian  Government  and  less  than  1  percent  of  shareholding  is  owned  by  the 
<br/>landowners, that is, the Pine Trust.  It is encouraging to see that the dividends are paid only to the 
<br/>landowners  and  landowners  get  money  from  the  stumpage,  that  is,  5.5  percent,  plus  two  other 
<br/>payment types.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The biggest worry and problem there is the lack of trees.  We found out that Tropik Woods 
<br/>is owned by the Fiji Pine Limited.  Fiji Pine Limited almost went bankrupt post-2000, and at that 
<br/>time  Tropik  Woods  had  to  basically  run  out  of  Fiji  Pine,  but  it  has  now  recovered.    The  major 
<br/>payments were done during the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government at that time, and that rescued 
<br/>the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nowadays, we do not have logs in Viti Levu to run Tropik Woods so they are sourcing from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua Levu, and looking forward to get materials from the maritime zone mostly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also managed to find out that there is no matured forest in Viti Levu.  This situation arises 
<br/>because there was no planting of trees done 20 years ago.  As a result, there is lack of mature forests 
<br/>in Viti Levu, which is Fiji’s largest island, which could have provided a sustainable timber resource. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  the  plantation  in  Viti  Levu,  is  unable  to  meet  the  mill  demands.    Despite  existing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plantations in Viti Levu, they are insufficient to meet the demands of the mill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sawn logs in Viti Levu are unable to sustain mills.  The sawn logs available in Viti Levu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are inadequate and it is hard to sustain the operations of the mill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  setting  up  carriage  sawmill  and  harvesting  other  species,  in  response  to  these 
<br/>challenges, the company is considering establishing a carriage sawmill and harvesting other species 
<br/>of trees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also visited the Forestry Office in Rakiraki where there are two staff 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>manning the office. They feel that they need one or two more staff there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also managed to find out that they have the highest number of seedlings produced in the 
<br/>communities  in  Ra.  Some  of  the  challenging  issues  identified  was  that  the  landowners  were  not 
<br/>consulting the Ministry on licencing issues and procedures.  This indicates the lack of communication 
<br/>and  collaboration  between  the  landowners  and  the  Ministry  responsible  for  issuing  licences  and 
<br/>regulatory procedures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also the awareness on the impact of illegal activities.  This refers to efforts 
<br/></span><span>aimed at educating communities and stakeholders about the negative consequences of engaging in 
<br/>illegal activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also visited Taveuni and had a good discussion with the Forest Guard there.  We found 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out that no forest harvesting is taking place in Taveuni, at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there is a very big project going on, the reafforestation in Bouma, where each </span><span>mataqali</span><span>
<br/>is planting 2,000 trees.  Their aim is to get more </span><span>yavusa</span><span> and </span><span>mataqali</span><span> involved in their replanting of 
<br/>trees.  There was a very good discussion about the blue line, which is the line that demarcates the 
<br/>place where tree felling should stop. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the forestry sector has vast areas of operation and needs more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resources such as technical expertise in the outer stations, transportation and staff quarters. Some 
<br/>machines are very old and they need new machinery to ease the workload.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Acts are old and need to be fast-tracked and reviewed, and more awareness on the full 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>utilisation of the funds for Land Owning Units.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More police engagements is needed because of thefts of logs in the forest.  The Ministry to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthen monitoring on the cutting of timber in the forest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairperson, honourable Tunabuna, and 
<br/>all the honourable Members of the Committee and the Secretariat Team led by Madam Akanisi for 
<br/>the preparation of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to visit these sites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  Honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, and ladies and gentlemen; firstly, I would like to thank the Chairperson and 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for the Consolidated Review Report on 
<br/>the Ministry of Forestry 2019-2022 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has continued to  deliver on its mandate over the past  three 
<br/>years,  despite  the  challenging  circumstances  that  Fiji  has  faced.  I  would  like  to  take  this  time  to 
<br/>highlight some of the Ministry’s important achievements, which is a testament of the hard work of 
<br/>the Ministry and its collaboration with our stakeholders and landowners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, the continuation of the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years Programme, 
<br/>which  was  officially  introduced  in  January  2019,  in  the  2022-2023  financial  year,  a  total  of  4.8 
<br/>million seedlings were planted. The seedlings planted included native species, pine, mahogany, teak, 
<br/>sandalwood, mangroves and fruit trees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the beginning of the Programme, Mr. Speaker, more than 19.1 million trees have been 
<br/>planted, including almost a million mangroves within more than 17,200 hectares of land. This means 
<br/>that we have planted more than 60 percent of our target in less than six years of the total 15 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  tree  planting  initiative  contributes  to  Fiji’s  green  economy  and  recovery  from  the 
<br/>ongoing impacts of climate change and is helping the country meet its international commitments 
<br/>through the REDD+ initiative and the World Bank’s Emission Reduction Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, through this programme, we are also contributing to reforestation of degraded 
<br/>forest.  This is an attempt to utilise degraded forests to address broad thematic areas of need in Fiji, 
<br/>including carbon stock enhancement, connecting forest corridors, coastal restoration, food security, 
<br/>flood  mitigations,  stabilisation  in  riparian  systems,  catchment  restoration,  enrichment  planting, 
<br/>community woodlots, and industrial planting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1617 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the numbers achieved are a positive testament to the diligent work being carried 
<br/>out by the Ministry with the support of our communities and also our partners - Fiji Pine Limited, 
<br/>Fiji Pine Trust, Fiji Hardwood Corporation and the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight, again, the Ministry’s work on our Maritime Pine 
<br/>Schemes.  The Maritime Pine Project has supported communities to develop their pine resources, as 
<br/>well as processing timber for houses across Fiji’s maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  investments  in  machines,  skills  training  and  an  inventory  of  pine  resources,  the 
<br/>project  aims  to  ensure  the  sustainable  utilisation  and  management  of  maritime  pine  resources, 
<br/>generating  significant  value  and  volume  of  wood  products  and  improving  the  livelihoods  of  our 
<br/>maritime communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  has  continued  to  make  excellent  progress  on  Fiji’s  Emission 
<br/>Reduction Programme.  Fiji’s Emission Reduction Payment Agreement is a pledge to reduce Green 
<br/>House Gases (GHS) emission from within the agriculture, forests and other land use sector by 2.5 
<br/>million  tonnes,  as  its  contribution  to  the  global  target  of  reducing  global  surface  warming  of  1.5 
<br/>degree Celsius above pre-industrial temperature under the Paris Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our REDD+ readiness assessment was completed in 2022 and this supported 
<br/>the  Fiji  Government’s  engagement  in  a  carbon  trade  agreement  under  the  Emission  Reduction 
<br/>Payment Agreement.  Our team has identified 15 different sites that could be used in the Emission 
<br/>Reduction Programme, as well as plantation areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Forestry has completed our National Forest Inventory, and this 
<br/>will provide policy on sustainable use of forest resources.  In light of this, the growth of forestry-
<br/>related exports in particular, has been optimistic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry moved from a manual system to an online digital licencing system for exports 
<br/>and imports.  In 2021, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics data showed that wood related exports exceeded 
<br/>$100 million for the first time, with the value more than doubling between 2019 and 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  note  that  the  contribution  of  the  Forestry  sector  extends 
<br/>beyond  forestry  and  logging  itself,  including  other  value  adding  processes.    The  total  economic 
<br/>contribution of the Forestry Sector is $140.4 million, which is equivalent to 1.4 percent of Fiji’s real 
<br/>Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry also continues to support the development of small-scale cottage 
<br/>industries in Fiji.  This has included the registration of a cooperative in Sote - Gaunavou, which has 
<br/>also received approval from the Ministry of Trade to use the Fijian Made Brand.  This co-operative, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, manufactures beds made from mahogany for Courts Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to congratulate the Ministry in obtaining an unqualified audit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opinion for all their reporting years in the Consolidated Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not the least, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the former Minister, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Ravu,  for  his  guidance  and  leadership.    I  would  like  to  thank  our  development  partners,  the 
<br/></span><span>Government, for their continued support in assisting the Ministry to continue to work towards the 
<br/>sustainable management of Fiji’s forests.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my short contribution to the motion at hand.  The 
<br/>Forestry  Sector  is  a  very  important  sector  for  Small  Island  Nations  like  ours.    There  is  a  big 
<br/>connection from the forest right up to the reef, with the Ridge to Reef Programme that I see in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>
<div><span>1618 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. I would like to congratulate the Committee for this Report and is also available to the public. 
<br/>It contains a lot of very good information for those that want to delve deeper into the Forestry Sector. 
<br/>And there is always competition, if you like, between trying to earn money out of our forest and, at 
<br/>the same time, conserve it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is because of our forest that we have very clean drinking water, and we leave those forests 
<br/>to stand so that they preserve our water sources. I would just like to float this idea that in order to 
<br/>compensate those that allow their forests to stand so that we can enjoy clean drinking water, I hear 
<br/>the WAF is going to be a commercial company and, perhaps, if two cents from every dollar that we 
<br/>pay for water bill goes into some sort of a fund to compensate the forest owners who will have to 
<br/>leave their forests to stand so that we can enjoy clean water in Fiji, would be an idea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          We thank those forest owners who allow their forests to stand so that we can enjoy the clean 
<br/>water that we do. If we value our forests, yes, we earn money from our exports but if we also put a 
<br/>dollar value to all the services that our forests provide - protecting our land, climate change, keeping 
<br/>our water sources clean, the dollar value goes very high. So, we should not be too disappointed when 
<br/>we see the amount of money that we get from what we sell out of our forests products.  But if we put 
<br/>money into the other services that our forests provide for a small island nation where the ecosystem 
<br/>is so fragile, the dollar value is so high.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Ministry for the big work that they do in looking after this very critical sector for 
<br/>our  nation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  thank  the  Committee  for  this  Report.  I  like  the  wealth  of 
<br/>information that is in there, which is not only for us here in Parliament, but it is also available to the 
<br/>public. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for the excellent 
<br/>Report  that  they  have  presented.  Basically,  I  would  just  like  to  cover  three  areas  that  have  been 
<br/>highlighted in the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  recommendations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 
<br/>legislation/regulation/policies.    Given  the  overarching  ambit  of  the  Ministry  covering  so  many 
<br/>legislation, perhaps, they need to strengthen the legal aspect and may be appoint a legal officer to 
<br/>specifically address some of the legislation that needs to be amended within or under the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that  has  been  made 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  review  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  noted  some  of  the  achievements  that  have  been  made.  One  of  the  activities,  one  of  the 
<br/>projects that I saw here is ‘say no to legal logging’ pledge, which was initiated by the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary  in  2022,  aimed  to  curb  illegal  logging  through  community  and  public  awareness  in 
<br/>collaboration with the Fiji Police Force. By the end of 2022, 324 pledges were received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was another project, the planting of 30 million trees.  I think that has been alluded to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the honourable Minister. So far, they have planted 18 million trees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry plans to re-strategise its forest beat process and community engagement through 
<br/>plantation establishment, their protection and community initiatives. I noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>lack of evidence in the linkage between some of these projects, perhaps, that is an area that needs to 
<br/></span><span>be strengthened.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another area that has been highlighted was empowering the landowners. I think that has been 
<br/>also alluded to by the honourable Minister - empowering landowners and support cottage industries 
<br/>for </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  In the 2023-2024 Budget, the Ministry of Forestry was allocated a budget of $200,000 
<br/>to support forest businesses. The lessons that we have to learn from the failures in the past was the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to have someone to be undertaking business management particularly </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and those people 
<br/>who are wanting to go into business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been the call for the involvement of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> in business, but I think with the need 
<br/>to ensure that we have adequate technical capacity to manage this. I think honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  Minister  for  External  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communication has already talked about MSMEs, BAF has an important role, but you need to have 
<br/>adequate technical and financial capacity to manage some of these new initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was looking through the report and one of the areas that I was 
<br/>always interested in is, agroforestry.  I think I have already mentioned this in the past.  Agroforestry 
<br/>combines growing trees with other food crops and cash crops. It is an approach that communities can 
<br/>use for better managing their </span><span>vanua</span><span> from ridge to reef for the benefit of everyone.  Agroforestry is 
<br/>not a prescription or formula that is developed and imposed from outside, it is an approach where 
<br/>people can learn the principles and develop their own system, their own special combination of trees 
<br/>and other crops that is suitable for the environment and meets the needs and aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agroforestry does not take away the best land that farmers are already using successfully to 
<br/>grow their crops. Agroforestry can be used to restore degraded land which has been exhausted by too 
<br/>much  burning  or  taking  away  too  many  crops  without  replenishing  the  soil  with  fertiliser  crops, 
<br/>rotation  of  fallow  period.  Agroforestry  can  help  to  bring  marginal  and  underutilised  land  into 
<br/>profitable production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The trees in agroforestry do various useful things. At the beginning, we plant fast growing 
<br/>trees like </span><span>vaivai</span><span> which helps to stop the soil erosion. They improve the soil with nitrogen and organic 
<br/>matter and they provide shade to protect the other trees, seedlings, and crops as well as supressing 
<br/>lushes and other weeds.  Next come fast growing hardwood trees like teak and tavola that provide 
<br/>fence post and building post for houses and other buildings.  After a few years, the main trees like 
<br/></span><span>vesi</span><span> and </span><span>tavola</span><span> become mature providing permanent shade and protection as well as timber for local 
<br/>use or for sale.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not need to wait for the trees to grow large, in the gaps between the trees, we grow 
<br/>crops that will give quick returns in the market like cassava, sweet potatoes and pineapple.  As the 
<br/>soil becomes better, we can produce </span><span>dalo</span><span> and </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, as well as fast growing fruit trees like </span><span>papaya</span><span>, 
<br/>banana and </span><span>vudi</span><span>.  The next trees start to produce fruits and nuts, we can initiate other crops such as 
<br/>avocado, </span><span>vutinikana</span><span> and noni.  Then we can get other products from </span><span>ivi, tavola, dilo</span><span>, et cetera.  There 
<br/>will be sustainable income from Agroforest at all stages as it grows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not a new thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Our grandfathers used to practice this.  This is the 
<br/>farming systems but now we are facing so many challenges, maybe this is the time to adopt some of 
<br/>these traditional knowledge.  An important strategy in agroforestry development is to ensure markets 
<br/>and market chain connections for all the products as the system is established.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We already have buyers for main agroforest products, such as coffee, cocoa, vanilla, noni</span><span>, 
<br/>dilo,</span><span> et cetera.  Coffee and cocoa can provide the foundation for the system with large established 
<br/></span><span>markets  available  that  can  be  relied  on  for  many  years.    Some  of  these  products  can  be  partially 
<br/></span><span>processed in the community, adding value for extra income to their community members, because 
<br/>agroforestry involves selecting many possible trees and products.  There is less risk of saturating any 
<br/>market  and  the  prices  do  fall  because  of  the  changes  in  the  market.    Producers  can  change  to 
<br/>alternatives.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has a growing domestic market as well as different export destinations 
<br/>which  increases  options  and  resilience.    The  new  opportunity  for  farmers  and  community  is 
<br/>developing with the carbon markets.  The companies around the world produce a lot of greenhouse 
<br/>gases, especially carbon dioxide will pay farmers and communities who have land available to plant 
<br/>trees.  These trees capture the carbon dioxide and turn it into wood and carbon in the soil.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once  a  long-term  agreement  is  set  up  with  the  help  of  the  Government,  the  overseas 
<br/>companies  will  pay  communities  who  undertake  agroforestry  get  some  money  each  year  for  the 
<br/>carbon they have captured in their trees.  In this way, agroforestry offer farmers and communities a 
<br/>new way to farm that improves their environment and assures diverse source of income for the entire 
<br/>community.
