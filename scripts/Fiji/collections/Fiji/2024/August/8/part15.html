<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.30 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State of Infrastructure – Sigatoka Valley Road 
<br/>(Question No. 138/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister update Parliament on the state of the infrastructure 
<br/>regarding the bridges and roads in remote areas, in particular, the Sigatoka Valley Road? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sigatoka Valley Road is 77.16 kilometres  
<br/>in length, of which, 24.8 kilometres has been sealed in multiple sections. The seal starts from Sigatoka 
<br/>Town  till  Dreke  Village  Road  Junction,  which  is  approximately  23.1  kilometres.  The  Raunitogo 
<br/>School,  Naviyago,  Nalebaleba  villages  and  Keyasi  Government  Station  sections  have  also  been 
<br/>sealed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are nine bridges and 17 crossings along the Valley Road.  It includes 
<br/>the newly constructed and commissioned Matawale Bridge.  Recently, works have been completed 
<br/>in upgrading the Tokotokoniga Crossing and repairs to Draiba Crossing, as most of these structures 
<br/>have exceeded the 50 years design and repairs and replacements are being planned to be included.  
<br/>In  the  budget  for  the  current  financial  year,  sealing  works  have  been  planned  or  earmarked  for 
<br/>Koronisagana Village frontage.  Survey and design for seal extension works will also be undertaken 
<br/>from Dreke to Nabaka (3 kilometres) section and Nabaka to Raunitogo (3 kilometres) in the current 
<br/>financial year.  Renewal of Vatanabalavu Crossing has also been planned for this financial year or 
<br/>earmarked.  The approach deck overlay is required to extend the structural integrity of the existing 
<br/>crossing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the design and specification works of Naqalo Crossing near to Nalebaleba 
<br/>Village on the way to Keyasi has been included in this year’s programme.  The replacement of this 
<br/>crossing is required as the existing structure is not able to accommodate storm surges. During floods, 
<br/>there are no alternate routes, therefore, people are forced to wait until the water recedes. Logging and 
<br/>gravel extraction haulage in the area during the rainy weather gives more stress to the current road 
<br/>infrastructure.  We will review the timelines for this Naqalo Crossing as appropriate given its critical 
<br/>role as far as the people of Navosa are concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the current financial year, Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) has 
<br/>budgeted $120 million for the progressive cycle and periodic maintenance of road, bridges and jetties 
<br/>infrastructure; and $114.5 million for renewal of roads and services, bridges and crossings throughout 
<br/>the four divisions where part of this will cover the development of the Sigatoka Valley Road.   In 
<br/>addition, $5 million has also been allocated to the Public Works Department to compliment the FRA 
<br/>on rural roads, institutional and community roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is regarding the road condition in some 
<br/>rural remote areas in Lautoka.  I will name the areas; Viseisei Back Road, Vuda Back Road, Vaivai, 
<br/>Navula, Wairabetia and Paipai.  There is also one bridge which is in very bad condition, that is, Vuda 
<br/></span><span>Back Road.  It is dry season in the West, and I believe time is right to carry out the maintenance work 
<br/></span><span>because  this  road  is  used  by  the  students,  the  farmers,  the  old  people  and  the  workers.  What  is 
<br/>stopping the maintenance of road in these areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you honourable Member, I had prepared the answer 
<br/>specifically for Sigatoka Valley as per the question.  That is a new question, and I have not got an 
<br/>update for that one in terms of the information, but definitely, that is included in the cyclical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1596 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme and maintenance.  I have to admit that it is not perfect and in terms of the delivery of the 
<br/>rural roads currently handled by the private contractors with the Divisional Engineer West, which I 
<br/>met last week, and I also went through some of the areas to plug those gaps. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per the budget last year, we have started to receive the equipment for PWD and moving 
<br/>forward, definitely there will be improvements in the gaps between the current private contracts and 
<br/>what PWD will cover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, this is not a question but just a comment.  The Ratu Dovi 
<br/>Road from Coca Cola Factory to Sekoula Road, it is almost a perfect road, but FRA was repairing it 
<br/>and they left it in the middle of the works, therefore, causing a lot of havoc to the public and delays 
<br/>traffic and prone to accident.  Can the honourable Minister look  at that road and ensure that it is 
<br/>sorted out as soon as possible, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Is that the one in front of the Coca Cola factory onwards? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I have expressed my disappointment with them and, definitely, 
<br/>not only you but other members of the public have expressed their concern.  We have an issue with 
<br/>the supplier of the materials essential for making roads which is bitumen and asphalt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sole supplier of bitumen in Fiji and some Pacific Islands is Technix Pacific (Pte) Limited.  
<br/>Priority of supply depends on the volume and demand from clients.  He has ran out of bitumen for 
<br/>the last three weeks and expect to restore supply in the next three weeks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA has directed its contractors to source their own bitumen and some have 
<br/>ordered  stocks  to  be  shipped  here.    Long  term  solution,  we  are  tendering  into  the  local  and 
<br/>international market. Currently, we are maintaining our sealed roads with other alternative materials.  
<br/>In the meantime, Ratu Dovi Road will be temporarily fixed with some asphalt overlay but will be 
<br/>completed when the new stock arrives in three weeks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  comprehensive  answer.  
<br/>Honourable  Minister,  there  was  a  plan  for  Nabaka  bridge  and  the  road  from  Valley  junction  to 
<br/>Nabaka Primary School.  I believe it was a priority when FijiFirst Government was there, but you 
<br/>have re-prioritised your plans on that.  Of course, another bridge is Waya Bridge where during heavy 
<br/>rain, it does get flooded.  What are your plans on these two bridges and road? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, we have moved from Sigatoka Valley to all over Fiji, 
<br/>but I do not have details for that.  We have provided as an answer to the written questions the plans. 
<br/>I mean, plans are plans, if there are you know urgencies in terms of changing situations or inclement 
<br/>weather, that definitely will be looked at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Take him for a road tour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yeah, that is right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The honourable Minister is 
<br/>beating around the bush. These two Bridges that I have mentioned it is on Valley Road. Nabaka is 
<br/>along Valley Road, as well as Waya Bridge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- He doesn’t know. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1597 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yes, he doesn’t know.  Do not beat around the bush!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is all over Fiji now, honourable Nath.  The way the questions have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>put to the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- As already explained, I will look into that too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in Valley Road, Sigatoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before that, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought you were moving to Labasa now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  upgrading  the 
<br/>Caralevu/Kawakawa/Nabekavu/ Dogorua Road, thank you, honourable Minister.  I would also like 
<br/>to thank the h1 Minister for Sugar for upgrading and fixing the Caralevu FSC Bridge in Labasa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kavanagasau Road which is on the East Bank of the Valley Road and runs 
<br/>from  Laselase  to  Nabitu,  and  it  goes  through  the  settlement  of  Naroro,  Yelava,  Somosomo, 
<br/>Nawamagi,  Nalagi,  Narata,  Nadrala,  Kaisau,  Mauvua,  Raiwaqa  and  Nabitu.  In  these  settlements, 
<br/>there are 32 vegetable farmers, 80 i-Taukei villagers, five primary schools, one secondary school and 
<br/>one health centre, hence with a population of more than 2,000 people</span><span>.</span><span> My question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister is that when will these roads be upgraded properly with proper drainage and at the sametime, 
<br/>in near future, if this road can be tarsealed? Thank you.  </span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO.  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Yes,  the  short  answer  is  that,  it  is  included  in  the 
<br/>programmatic maintenance, as I have already explained.   It is also in our list of roads as per the 
<br/>maintenance programme. as I have mentioned, it might probably be late or not up to what is normally 
<br/>expected and that is something we will work to address. Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MOU with Peace Corps Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 139/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  update  Parliament  on  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  the 
<br/>Peace Corps Fiji and the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his  question. 
<br/>Firstly, allow me to provide some background information about the partnership with Peace Corps 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), following the approval by Cabinet on 
<br/>15th July, 2024 and the signing ceremony will be done next week on 16th August, 2024. The signing 
<br/>coincides with the visit by the US Peace Corps Executive Leadership next week from 13th August 
<br/>to 19th August, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me provide some background information.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Peace Corps was established 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>1598 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in  1961  by  the  then  President  John  Peace  Gerald  Kennedy,  six  weeks  after  his  inauguration  as 
<br/>President. On the back of two World Wars, America was yearning for peace and President Kennedy, 
<br/>by a Presidential  Order,  established the Peace Corps.  The  Government  of Fiji  and  United States 
<br/>signed an agreement on 25th June, 1968 regarding the Peace Corps programme in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe many of us here know about the Peace Corps.  Many of us have had the experiences 
<br/>with the Peace Corps.  Some of us have had teachers who have been in Peace Corps and others like 
<br/>us in Verata, during the Verata Beef Scheme, we had Peace Corps volunteers helping us with the 
<br/>Verata Beef Scheme at the time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is an organisation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that coordinates United States of America volunteers 
<br/>in Fiji to work with rural communities on projects that are focussed on economic development.  The 
<br/>Peace Corps volunteers have worked in a variety of sectors including forestry, fisheries, agriculture, 
<br/>business development, health, education, technology, water and sanitation and youth development, 
<br/>to name a few.  Their goal is to support community organisations, such as women and youth groups, 
<br/>to improve their project design and management skills.  They have had a long, active and rich history 
<br/>of collaboration with the Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the last three years, the Ministry has been a member of their Project Advisory Committee 
<br/>which meets  quarterly and helps  drive the direction  of their volunteer service  and relevant Peace 
<br/>Corps programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The partnership arrangement between us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here are three main categories of 
<br/>the work that they are going to do.  The first is they have response volunteers. They are under the 
<br/>Response  Volunteer  Programme.  There  is  a  pool  of  experienced  professionals  and  former  Peace 
<br/>Corps volunteers. There are seasoned professionals who come for a shorter term and can serve up to 
<br/>three to 12 months in high impact assignments identified by the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, is the Virtual Peace Corps volunteers.  They are experienced professionals who can 
<br/>spent  five  to  15  hours  per  week,  virtually  supporting  the  Ministry’s  teams  and  participants  on 
<br/>improving economic empowerment initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An area that the Ministry is keen to tap into is the digitalisation of our project proposal online 
<br/>system where project proposals initiated from the District levels are automated and mainstreamed through 
<br/>various approving officers in the Division to the Ministry’s Headquarters, and then to the Office of the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for endorsement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  this  plan  has  been  long  overdue.    Past  management  have 
<br/>deliberated on it but, unfortunately, due to certain reasons, did not eventuate but now, we could see that 
<br/>it could foster an enabling environment for this initiative to come to fruition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the Peace Corps shares a common issue of co-operation with the Ministry on their 
<br/>community economic empowerment programme.  While the Ministry’s income generating project 
<br/>has been in existence for a long time, it lacks many supportive mechanisms to ensure sustainability 
<br/>and  scaling  to  gradually  progress  from  subsistence  to  semi-commercial  and  then  to  commercial 
<br/></span><span>status.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  see  the  Peace  Corps  volunteers  having  a  great  part  in  doing  this  with  supporting  the 
<br/>Ministry in project management training, income generation, financial literacy and personal money 
<br/>management through this partnership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through these proposed agreements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1599 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>community  economic  empowerment,  driven  by  a  Peace  Corps  volunteer  in  a  particular  rural 
<br/>community through the Self-Help Funding Programme.  That Peace Corps volunteer with provide 
<br/>the necessary capacity building, project management training and financial literacy, and monitor and 
<br/>report back to the Ministry of the progress of this business initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the Ministry is achieving its intention of Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goal 17 which is partnerships for the goals, that implementation of MOU between the 
<br/>Ministry and Peace Corps will certainly contribute to improving socio-economic opportunities and 
<br/>quality of life of our rural and maritime communities.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  a  supplementary  question.    Some 
<br/>communities  did  have  volunteers  until  COVID-19,  their  volunteers  were  withdrawn.  Are  there 
<br/>opportunities that they will be provided with Peace Corps volunteer since now, the  MOU will be 
<br/>signed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will certainly have a look at those communities 
<br/>that had their Peace Corps volunteers withdrawn and see how far the programme has progressed, and 
<br/>will take it on from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Also including Australia, I think? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, I think a 
<br/>lot of us have had experience with Peace Corps in the past.  We have been taught by Peace Corps.  I 
<br/>had the pleasure of teaching with one when I was still a school teacher for two years.  I am wondering 
<br/>honourable Minister and you might be aware whether it is limited to your Ministry or this advent of 
<br/>Peace Corps is across all other sectors? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there are some arrangements there that they 
<br/>can work with other Ministries as well, but this MOU is in particular to the programmes that we run 
<br/>in the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the nineth Oral Question has been dropped in view 
<br/>of the Statement that was made earlier this morning.  We will now move to the next Oral.  You will 
<br/>notice, honourable Members, that there are lot more questions for today, given that we had a very 
<br/>short day on the visit of Her Excellency the President of the Republic of India.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 140/2024) withdrawn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s Sustainable and Resilient Recovery Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 141/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Fiji Sustainable and 
<br/></span><span>Resilient Recovery Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  The Sustainable and Resilient Recovery Programme was supported by Asian Development 
<br/>Bank (ADB) from 2021 to 2022, and this Programme has continued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ADB has been a key strategic partner for development for Fiji for a very, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>1600 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very long time since 1970 and Fiji has partnered in numerous projects including roads, water, climate 
<br/>change  related  projects,  budget  support  operations,  and  liquidity  support  for  the  national  airline 
<br/>during COVID-19 and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ADB for core leading Budget 
<br/>Support Reform operations together with the World Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are other possibilities now with the ADB and the World Bank and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>working with other development partners as well on some of the major projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  you  are  aware,  the  Government,  on  last  Thursday,  signed  a  loan 
<br/>agreement that will enable Government to receive a very concessional financing of US$70million 
<br/>from the ADB through the Budget Support Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget support financing is a new modality for accessing finance from 
<br/>development partners.  This has been a great support for the Government after COVID-19, and in the 
<br/>last so many fiscal years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of these concessional  financing,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir, and budget  support also  refers to 
<br/>policy reform and it is useful for Government and for the country as a whole to use these budget 
<br/>support opportunities to undertake key policy reforms.  In the last 18 months we have completed a 
<br/>number of policy reforms across different Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, supports Fiji’s efforts to restore fiscal sustainability and 
<br/>inclusive climate resilient growth, both undermined by COVID-19 pandemic and disasters.  While 
<br/>building fiscal community and climate resilience to climate change and global shocks, it builds on 
<br/>the achievements of the  reform  programme,  and  one aspect  of this programme was  completed in 
<br/>2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government policy reforms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, falls in three areas.  I will quickly and very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>briefly talk about those three reform areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Public Financial Management for fiscal resilience and debt sustainability.  This includes 
<br/>review of the Financial Management Act, formulation of the Mid-Term Debt Management 
<br/>Strategy as part of the Fiscal Strategy which is presented to Parliament.  Of course we had 
<br/>the  Climate  Change  Act,  the  implementation  and  perhaps  review  of  that  Act  and 
<br/>establishment of new tax information system for FRCS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Public Policy for Community Resilience included gender-responsive budgeting which has 
<br/>been rolled-out to all Ministries as part of the budget process. The Social Assistance Policy 
<br/>was also part of this public policy for community resilience reform area and also the launch 
<br/>of the new market-based climate risk parametric, microinsurance project which is the first 
<br/>for the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Enabling environment for resilience, private sector recovery.  This supported the recovery 
<br/>of businesses and fostered a creation of new enterprises including the establishment of a 
<br/>two-year subsidy loan through the RBF, new regulations under the Companies Act and 
<br/></span><span>National Payment Systems Act.

<div><span>Some  of  the  other  details  of  the  Budget  support  programme,  for  the  Government  is  in

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1601 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister for his elaboration on the Fiji Sustainable Resilient Recovery Programme.  I think there has 
<br/>been a lot of good work done. I am particularly interested on the Public Policy for Community, the 
<br/>issues that you mentioned about gender-responsive budgeting, micro-insurance and the social system 
<br/>policy. I am just wondering, are there any plans, one of the things that we find sometimes in the past 
<br/>when you do something, when the good donor goes away, it tends to die down. I am just wondering 
<br/>whether all those things which are very important, are there plans to progress it further if it is going 
<br/>to be done internally within Government and how do you plan be able to do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  it  is  a  very  important  point  that 
<br/>honourable Usamate has made that sometimes you have donors come in with a policy agenda, policy 
<br/>reform and once that is done, the sustainability is questioned, even with the projects that are funded 
<br/>by donors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can assure honourable Usamate that the on-going programme includes building on some of 
<br/>those policy reforms and when we complete the policy reforms as part of the budget support, we 
<br/>make  sure  that  it  remains  part  of  the  agenda  for  future  budgets.  For  example,  since  last  year  we 
<br/>produced the citizens budget.  It is part of the reform agenda to provide readily available information 
<br/>demystified from the budget language and estimates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- There are there before as well! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The first time we started last year as far as this Government is 
<br/>concern. To honourable Usamate, these are continuation of some of the policy reforms that had been 
<br/>undertaken. But it is important as you said quite rightly that we do not just leave it once the reform 
<br/>is completed as part of the budget support.

<div><span>Budget Support for Small-Scale Sugarcane Farmers 
<br/>(Question No. 142/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform 
<br/>Parliament on the specific details on how the budget will support small-scale sugarcane 
<br/>farmers from larger producers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, before I reply properly to honourable Pillay, I would like 
<br/>to go back to last night’s contribution by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in the two motions 
<br/>about the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji and Sugar Industry Tribunal.  I am very impressed with the 
<br/>honourable Leader of Opposition that he had spoken on one particular subject that the sugar industry, 
<br/>although his bleeding and has been bleeding for so many years, but there is a social responsibility on 
<br/>the part of Government to keep this industry going because we have got 200,000 plus people who 
<br/>are directly and indirectly dependent on this industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, but on the other side, if the sugar industry collapses, I will be out of job. One of 
<br/></span><span>the things that I did discuss with the honourable Prime Minister last night that we need a bipartisan 
<br/></span><span>approach on this industry. The honourable Prime Minister has agreed that down the line we can put 
<br/>up  a  Committee  which  we  will  be  proposing  shortly  to  Cabinet  and  we  want  both  sides  to  work 
<br/>together for the sake of this industry.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Of course, we will have one each from the other side (the two blocs) 
<br/>unless you want to be the third one because you are saying you are independent but you do not have 
<br/>any sugarcane farm.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We used to have that in the past, I used to Chair the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Well, I will check the register with the Tribunal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question by honourable Pillay regarding the budget 
<br/>support for our small-scale sugarcane farmers, I want to offer my deepest condolence to the family 
<br/>of the locomotive pointsman from Tavua who lost his life yesterday after serving with FSC for more 
<br/>than three decades and a senior locomotive driver is admitted to the hospital in a critical condition. I 
<br/>wish  him  full  and  speedy  recovery.    The  unfortunate  accident  happened  in  Tavua,  Bridge  No.15 
<br/>where the locomotive derailed from the bridge and fell in the creek.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to thank the brave firefighters and the hardworking medical teams and each and 
<br/>every one who provided assistance and support that was needed at the time of the accident and I am 
<br/>indeed grateful to them and I thank them and the whole team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question, I want to assure the honourable Member that 
<br/>we value all farmers equally irrespective of the volume of cane they produce. We are committed to 
<br/>supporting  all  sugarcane  farmers  with  detailed  attention  to  small  scale  producers  who  make  up  a 
<br/>majority of our industry.  It is imperative to acknowledge that approximately 75 percent of the 10,800 
<br/>active farmers in Fiji are classified as small-scale farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our programmes are crafted to be inclusive and accessible to every farmer regardless of their 
<br/>production scale. This inclusivity is not just a principle but a practice that we uphold with unwavering 
<br/>dedication.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  strategic  focus  of  supporting  small  scale  farmers  ensures  a  credible 
<br/>assistance  particularly  for  those  who  lack  resources  of  their  own  as  compared  to  their  larger 
<br/>counterparts. For example, the majority of our farmers do not own tractors and implements necessary 
<br/>for  sugarcane  planting.  To  address,  this  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  has  established  tractor  service 
<br/>providers in all the mill areas who assist farmers with planting without requiring an upfront payment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  service  providers  are  later  compensated  under  the  Sugarcane 
<br/>Development and Farmers Assistance Programme implemented by the Ministry.  Furthermore, the 
<br/>programme includes a cap limited access to grants for up to five acres per farmer.  This restriction 
<br/>prioritise  small  scale  producers,  preventing  the  large  scale  producers  from  disproportionately 
<br/>benefitting from the grant.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is fundamental to be practical.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  fundamental  to  be  practical.  To  promote  the 
<br/>commercialisation  of  the  farms,  we  have  developed  policies  that  continue  to  support  small  scale 
<br/>farmers whilst also focussing on large scale farmers as we move towards a more commercialised 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We accept  the recommendation by the Standing  Committee for Economic Affairs in  their 
<br/>Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  FSC  Annual  Reports  which  underscores  the  necessity  of 
<br/>achieving commercial viability in the sugar industry. The traditional 10 acres farm model establish 
<br/>by  the  CSR  in  the  1960’s  is  increasingly  outdated  in  today’s  dynamic  economic  landscape.  The 
<br/>Committee  recommends  formation  of  small-scale  farms  into  larger  farming  units  to  enhance 
<br/>efficiency and productivity. While the Ministry agrees with the recommendation, we recognise the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>practical  and  legal  challenges  involved.  Therefore,  we  proactively  introduced  a  farm  sharing 
<br/>agreement as a temporary measure. These agreements enable larger farmers equipped with necessary 
<br/>resources to manage smaller surrounding farms under the profit-sharing agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sharing agreement offers significant benefits to both larger and smaller producers.  The 
<br/>larger producers having  achieved a total scale in exchange efficiency to  smaller producers to this 
<br/>profit-sharing  model.  This  symbolic  relation  not  only  optimises  the  resources  utilization  but  also 
<br/>ensures  that  advantages  of  scale  equitability  distributed  enhancing  the  overall  productivity, 
<br/>profitability of the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  proud  to  share  that  I  have  personally  pioneered  these  initiatives, 
<br/>managing  additional  11  farms  alongside  my  farm  in  Labasa.  This  hands-on  it  involvement 
<br/>demonstrates my commitment and our commitment to the practical solution that will alleviate the 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  our  programme  remains  equally  accessible  to  all 
<br/>farmers, we acknowledge the necessity  of eventually commercialising the sugar industry. We are 
<br/>committed to working towards this goal, ensuring the farmers are equipped to complete and succeed 
<br/>in the global market. This transition is critical for the future sustainability and prosperity of our sugar 
<br/>industry, and we are dedicated to making it a reality. Let us all work together, embrace these plans 
<br/>and confidently strive towards securing a sustainable and prosperous future for the sugar industry of 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this  season,  farmers  have  seen  a  huge  drop  in  cane 
<br/>production  for  both  small  and  large  scale  farmers,  mainly  due  to  continuous  heavy  rain  in  the 
<br/>beginning and later on continuous dry weather. My supplementary question is, what are the required 
<br/>support or what plans does the Ministry of Sugar have to bring back the production to 2023 levels or 
<br/>higher than that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have firstly  allocated a big chunk of money from 
<br/>the budget proposal.  That programme was there last year, and that programme continues this year 
<br/>as well. As we understand that we have got a special advisor in FSC, Mr. Lakshman from India.  He 
<br/>had predicted that we will have an increase in cane production.  Because of drought and from the 
<br/>latest figures, we may even lose a few hundred thousand tonnes of cane.  This is his prediction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us hope that good weather comes back and we are currently, honourable Pillay bringing 
<br/>in some new technologies from China. There was a team of people who came and gave us some new 
<br/>form of fertilizers and chemicals.  They are saying that it could probably increase production if we 
<br/>used their chemicals, it could increase our production by 30 percent. So we brought them in and we 
<br/>are testing on a few farms and if it works well, then we will be in good shape. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Sir, on my own farm I have experienced  a drop of 70 tonnes and I have 
<br/>seen small scale farmers harvesting about 70 to 80 tonnes and this year, they have gone below 50. I 
<br/>just hope they will be provided the required amount of fertilizers, chemical and also the order they 
<br/>give for rice and sugar will be given to them so that they can bring back the production next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is  a plead.  He is pleading with the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure the honourable Member that we will look after 
<br/>all the sugarcane  farmer in  Fiji  and as you know that we have got  this  new CEO with  the Sugar 
<br/>Research,  Dr.  Vinesh  Kumar  who  is  very  active.    The  last  trial  that  he  has  done  with  the  Sugar 
<br/>Research  on  Mr.  George  Shiu  Raj’s  farm  with  the  new  variety  of  cane  and  new  fertilizer  and  in

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labasa they have done on my farm.  Because what is happening Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farmers do not 
<br/>want to move away from the normal fertilizer that they have been putting, they are a bit scared.  So, 
<br/>Mr. George Shiu Raj has volunteered to give his farm, and I have volunteered to give my farm to do 
<br/>the trials. If it works well, it goes for everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the area of supporting small scale farmers, there 
<br/>is  support for new farmers as well. So, I would just like to ask the honourable Minister to inform 
<br/>Parliament within his term of two years, what are the numbers of new farmers that have taken up the 
<br/>initiative of sugarcane farming in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the exact number but we have incentives 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the new farmers to come in and we provide them with the additional premium 
<br/>up $7,500 or 30 percent whichever is lower.  We have given almost to 900 farmers but to give you 
<br/>an exact number of how many new farmers have come in, that number I can provide later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Co-operative Development Fund  
<br/> (Question No. 143/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small  and  Medium Enterprises  and Communications update Parliament on the 
<br/>Co-operative Development Fund and its execution? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be very brief.  Basically, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the Co-operative Development Fund is a new initiative from the Ministry of Trade.  It 
<br/>is specifically trying to target assistance to co-operatives particularly and try and ensure that there is 
<br/>specific focus given to co-operatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The CDF works within the guidelines, it essentially involves the maximum grant or funding 
<br/>that can be provided, it is up to $100,000. For businesses or co-operatives that are less than three 
<br/>years, the funding is limited to $20,000 and of course the established co-operatives must show the 
<br/>normal compliance that is required in terms of tax compliance and other requirements and of course 
<br/>are required to provide financial statements.  For newer co-operatives, the requirements are not as 
<br/>onerous but obviously the threshold of funding dictates what is available to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  just  about  to  advertise  the  grants  online  and  through  the  dailies,  we  have  already 
<br/>advertised all the other MSME Grants and that is already available.  For those who are listening in 
<br/>today,  please  ensure  that  you  apply,  and  of  course,  as  usual  the  applications  will  go  through  the 
<br/>normal screening process and generally it involves an assessment committee that is chaired by the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for Trade, that is, after the initial screening process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the interesting things that has come out of this grant is the Ministry, through its IT 
<br/>Department, is trying to develop a software that can be used to process grants a lot faster, and should 
<br/>that be successful, we will roll it out with the other grant programmes as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, normally with cooperatives, there is a high failure 
<br/>rate, for many reasons.  Normally, the reasons are related to management skills, handling money, et 
<br/>cetera.    My  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is,  what  measures  are  being  taken  to  ensure 
<br/>sustainability of cooperatives, now that they will receive this funding? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1605 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any cooperatives receiving grants, we 
<br/>generally take them through the normal business financial literacy training just to ensure that they 
<br/>are, sort of, ready to utilise the grant.  That is normally one of the main things we insist on to give 
<br/>their new businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot more monitoring that is now happening, even though, I think I suspect the way 
<br/>the cooperative movement is growing right now in the country, we will probably need a bit more 
<br/>resources soon.  However, right now, there is enough resource on the ground to continue to do the 
<br/>monitoring - the handholding, counselling and advising in terms of ensuring that the grant is used 
<br/>properly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.–  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  just  been  expressed  before,  the  grant,  we 
<br/>understand, is for diversification from what cooperatives are currently doing to move into new fields. 
<br/>Just a simple question, what criteria do the cooperatives need to qualify, in order to be able to access 
<br/>the funds? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA.–Clearly because the thresholds, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is an 
<br/>existing cooperative, which has been operating for more than three years, obviously, they can provide 
<br/>more information in terms of their operations. So, they will have well-prepared financial statements, 
<br/>tax compliance is normally insisted upon and any other compliance that is required for that particular 
<br/>business to operate.  So, those are really the criteria that is generally used for the types of assessments, 
<br/>and there is also interaction with the applicant, if required, to actually assess the business a bit more 
<br/>closely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.– Honourable Minister, in your response to the previous question, 
<br/>you did mention about handholding and capacity development.  Is this something that is provided 
<br/>from  within the Ministry, or is  it outsourced?  We have talked about  how  Bank of South  Pacific 
<br/>(BSP) provides this for their clients.  So, in terms of the cooperatives, could you, please, elaborate 
<br/>on this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA. – Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do have our own resources in the 
<br/>Ministry  that  does  the  training  for  cooperatives,  in  terms  of  the  initial  awareness  and  training  on 
<br/>financial awareness.  The good thing now is that there are other support mechanisms.  So, sometimes, 
<br/>some cooperatives might need some more training around marketing, for example, and generally, the 
<br/>Business  Assistance  Fiji  has  been  helping  as  well  in  that  regard.    So,  it  just  depends  on  website 
<br/>development and those kinds of things.  But in terms of the hard-core initial training to be able to be 
<br/>a grant recipient, that is normally handled by the Ministry Officials, who are quite experienced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Solutions to Mill Breakdown Issues 
<br/>(Question No. 144/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on how the mill breakdown issues are being addressed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I know honourable Bala was busy yesterday in Nadi, but 
<br/>had he been around in Parliament last night, he would have heard the explanations that I gave about 
<br/>Ba Mill.  However, for the benefit of the honourable Member, I shall also let him know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Bala’s  inquiring  about  measures  taken  to  address  the  mill 
<br/>breakdown issues.  Before we go into detail, it is crucial to understand the context in which these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>1606 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mills operate.  All our mills are over 70 years old and face a number of challenges, including the 
<br/>persistent effects of the Sugar Technical Missions, the projects which were incomplete.  The presence 
<br/>of the excessive trash and materials on the cane and a high percentage of burnt cane and the persistent 
<br/>of boiler issues and the loss of technical skills are the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the observations that FSC has reported to us is the burnt cane.  When 
<br/>these original mills were planned and designed, they were designed with a carrier to carry long stocks 
<br/>but with this burnt canes, they carry a lot of trash with the cane and when the canes are dropped in 
<br/>the carrier, it clogs the carrier itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular, at Ba Mill, that has been a problem for quite a while, and we have to upgrade 
<br/>the carrier itself.  Of course, the second upgrading will be to get a new boiler because the boiler has 
<br/>done its age.  That is the initial problem there, but much of these issues, as I have explained in the 
<br/>last two days, despite these impediments, the FSC Mills are passed with operating continuously for 
<br/>24 hours during the crushing season, inevitably leading to mechanical problems and breakdowns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Mills are probably the oldest in the world, as I have said yesterday.  In my earlier written 
<br/>response to Question No. 123/2024 by honourable Pillay, I had emphasised that FSC has invested 
<br/>about $29 million over the past five years, to ensure the Mills are operational.  These investments 
<br/>aim to minimise inside stops and improve the overall efficiency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I emphasised that the number of inside stops, more commonly 
<br/>known as breakdowns, was 2,163.6 hours in 2019 and the lowest point was in 2023 to 1,558 hours, 
<br/>which  has  substantial  reduction  of  605  hours  or  28  percent  which  is  a  notable  improvement.  
<br/>However, the figures are still significant, and we are committed to continually reducing the down 
<br/>time,  acknowledging  the  challenges  posed  by  our  Mills  which  is,  as  I  have  said,  essentially  old 
<br/>infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  also  acknowledge  the  issue  of  insufficient  cane  supply,  as 
<br/>previously highlighted, hampers our efforts.  More cane means more revenue, allowing us to plan for 
<br/>the establishment of the new factories and plants, be it secondhand at an approximate cost of $125 
<br/>million, or if you get a new one which will cost about $250 million.  These plants are contingent and 
<br/>on a sufficient cane supply, underscoring the need for FSC and the farmers to collaborate closely to 
<br/>meet the growth objectives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  address  the  Mill  breakdown  issue,  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  has 
<br/>implemented  strategies  concentrated  on  preventative  maintenance,  inventory  management  and 
<br/>continuous  improvement.    Critical  spare  parts  are  procured  and  stored  at  our  local  mill  centres, 
<br/>ensuring immediate availability to minimise down time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before crushing commences, FSC conducts thorough planned activities based on condition 
<br/>monitoring reports and physical analysis and it notifies potential issues earlier, allowing for timely 
<br/>interventions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC consults, expressed for highly technical issues, applying 
<br/></span><span>temporary  solutions  while  permanent  resolutions  are  developed.  A  comprehensive  listing  and 
<br/></span><span>replacement schedule for essential machineries are maintained, with replacement typically acquiring 
<br/>after five or seven years or sooner, if necessary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Corporation  properly  assesses  and  defines  the  processors,  effectively  addressing 
<br/>challenges and enhancing mill efficiency.  These combined efforts underscore FSC’s commitment to 
<br/>minimising operational disruptions and ensuring the sustainable growth of the sugar industry.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently my Ministry had engaged a professional Indian company known 
<br/>as Indian Sugar Engineering Corporation (ISGEC) to carry out a comprehensive review on the three 
<br/>Mills. The consultants have been instrumental in providing strategic guidance, proposing remedies 
<br/>and conducting technical audits to optimise the milling process. Their expertise has been invaluable 
<br/>in enhancing operational capabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  these  measures,  we  will  ensure  that  FSC  is  dedicated  to  minimising  downtime, 
<br/>ensuring personal safety and maintaining continuous mill operations. This unwavering commitment 
<br/>not only supports the sustainable growth of the sugar industry, but also benefits the communities in 
<br/>Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the beginning of the crushing season, nearly every 
<br/>week, there is a breakdown and machines are machines we know there will be breakdowns.  But my 
<br/>question is when there is a breakdown, why are the lorry drivers not informed about it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have to wait for days.  Some cane lorry drivers cart their cane from 
<br/>Vunikavikaloa to Rarawai, which is about 150 kilometres away, and once they reach Rarawai, they 
<br/>find that the Mill is not working. So they have to spend days there without proper facilities.  So why 
<br/>are  these  drivers  not  informed  that  there  is  a  breakdown  so  that  they  can  make  necessary 
<br/>arrangements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, well I sympathise with the drivers and I sympathise 
<br/>with  the farmers.   have been getting  a lot of calls myself from  the drivers and farmers  and they 
<br/>complain. But what I am saying is that when the mill is crushing, obviously, the engine does not 
<br/>know that something is going to breakdown right and by that time, the driver leaves his house.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was saying last night here that the machines do not have a mouth to speak.  If it is a human 
<br/>being, he will say my stomach is paining or my head is paining. With the machine, if you fix one 
<br/>thing today, you will not know what will happen to it tomorrow.  What I am saying is this, somehow 
<br/>down the line, we will have a robot which can fix the machine from inside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it is really a critical issue. I mean, it is good for the honourable Minister to explain in 
<br/>detail the plans but, currently, what the farmers and lorry drivers are facing is really in a bad situation. 
<br/>I would say from bad to worse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  three  things  that  happen  when  the  mill  breakdown. One  is,  less  quota  given  to 
<br/>farmers,  so  there  is  delay  in  harvesting.    Lorry  drivers  had  to  sleep  at  the  Mill,  as  stated  by  my 
<br/>colleague, the honourable Member, and then farmers had to transport their cane from the Ba Mill 
<br/>area to Lautoka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with some of the explanations by the honourable Minister and also his explanation in 
<br/>terms of plans. I mean, jokes aside, for Government, it may be funny but those farmers and lorry 
<br/>drivers who sleep at the Mill, they know what is happening.  So, is there any definite plan or any 
<br/>timeframe? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  we  not  close  the  Rakiraki  Mill,  at  least,  the 
<br/>farmers could have a certain Mill to deliver their cane.    The problem started when the Rakiraki Mill 
<br/>closed.  Before, when the Ba Mill closes, they take their cane to Rakiraki Mill.  Now, the Ba Mill 
<br/>closes, you take the cane all to Lautoka Mill.  So, the problem started from that side.  Now, we are 
<br/>going to rectify, so give us some time.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, on this side, are very serious about the sugar industry.  
<br/>That is what I am saying, we are getting the bipartisan thing now so that we can work together.  What 
<br/>else you want? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the performance of Rarawai Mill and Lautoka Mill is 
<br/>the worst this year, compared to previous years.  My question is, what level of assurance is there to 
<br/>the farmers?  Looking at the performance of the two Mills, that all harvested cane will be taken by 
<br/>the Mills this season? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can give assurance that the Mills will only close once 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all the canes are harvested.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for his very good answers. I just ask 
<br/>him not to follow the example of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance 
<br/>and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, the question comes here, and he talks 
<br/>about something else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  mill  breakdowns,  the  processes  are 
<br/>interrupted, so sometimes there is a lot of sugar juice that is left there.  If my understanding is correct, 
<br/>sometimes  those  sugar  juices  are  dumped.    So  how  is  it  that  we  are  taken  into  account  the 
<br/>environmental considerations, the consequences of doing that sort of thing and how is Government 
<br/>and FSC trying to address this issue to minimise the impact on the environment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  lately,  there  was  an  article  or  perhaps  the  Farmers 
<br/>Union had put a complaint to say that the juice were dumped.  But, in fact, if you have been reading 
<br/>the comments of the Chairman and the FSC CEO, that was not the case. It was something, not the 
<br/>actual juice, it was something different that was there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What were they? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You read it, it’s in the paper.  I will bring the paper tomorrow, you read 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Don’t lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not want to see the juice flowing  into the river, 
<br/>we do not want to see the losses, and we are responsible about it.  Whatever had happened was totally 
<br/>a different thing altogether.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are too young.  You do not know politics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are fully responsible to see that the Mill and products amount are well 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>specialised, and we give the money to the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a very good supplementary question 
<br/>asked by my colleague, honourable Bala, about the timeframe that would be taken to resolve all these 
<br/>issues.   He, in a very sarcastic way, ignored that issue by saying that we closed the Mill in Rakiraki.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1609 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The similar situation is faced by the lorry drivers and the farmers up in Vanua Levu.  Can he 
<br/>use the same excuse to explain to the farmers in Vanua Levu that we closed the Mill in Rakiraki.  
<br/>That is why you are supposed to suffer this side.  Is this the level of answers coming from by the 
<br/>honourable Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Maharaj has not been Labasa for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some time.  I get reports every day, the Labasa Mill is the best Mill running so far.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is very busy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Very busy in the Labour Ward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, he is very busy with this young …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should retract that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  He said he was busy in the Labour Ward.  What is he trying to prove? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  It is unparliamentary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is unparliamentary and it is personal, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attending to my family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yellow card.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- He should get a card.

<div><span>Establishment of USAID Office in Suva 
<br/>(Question No. 145/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the establishment of 
<br/>the United States Agency for International Development Office in Suva? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the United States Agency for International 
<br/>Development (USAID) is an independent agency of the US Federal Government that is primarily 
<br/>responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance.  As was pointed out, 
<br/>this was formed around the same time as the Peace Corps by the same President Kennedy in 1961, 
<br/>who thought to unite several existing foreign assistance organisations and programmes under one 
<br/></span><span>agency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, USAID became the first US foreign assistance organisation who primary focus was the 
<br/>long term socio-economic development.  Sir, USAID is one of the largest official aid agencies in the 
<br/>world and accounts for more than half of all US foreign assistance.  As an official component of US 
<br/>Foreign Policy, USAID operates subject to the guidance of the President, Secretary of State and the 
<br/>National Security Council.  It has missions in over 100 countries, primarily in Africa, Asia, Latin

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  July  the  Biden-Harris  Administration  announced  the  US 
<br/>Government‘s commitment to deepen its cooperation in the Pacific region.  One of the commitments 
<br/>included the opening of the USAID Pacific Regional Mission in Suva by 2023.   On 15</span><span>th</span><span> August, 
<br/>2023, during the visit of USAID Administrator, Mrs. Samantha Power, a soft launch of the USAID 
<br/>office was held at the US Embassy pending the finalisation of the Bilateral Framework Agreement, 
<br/>which formally establishes the USAID.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  organisation  has  ongoing  engagements  with  various  Government  agencies  and  local 
<br/>partners on initiatives such as providing support for municipal elections, technical support on climate 
<br/>change, meeting obligations under Paris Agreement, expansion of digital connectivity, cyber security 
<br/>partnership,  modernising  Fiji’s  digital  policies  and  cybersecurity  measures  and  supporting  loan 
<br/>facility to finance MSMEs to further stimulate sustainable economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally notified the Unites States via 
<br/>a Diplomatic Note of Cabinet’s approval for the Fiji Government to enter into the USAID Bilateral 
<br/>Framework Agreement  with  the US  for the establishment of the USAID Office.  The Ministry is 
<br/>currently  awaiting  the  USAID’s  availability  to  discuss  the  signing  of  the  above-mentioned 
<br/>agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bilateral  Framework  Agreement  is  the  standard  agreement  the  US  enters  into  with 
<br/>countries that host USAID Offices around the world.  The agreement contains provisions pertaining 
<br/>to  the  granting  of  diplomatic  immunities  and  privileges  to  US  personnel,  their  family  members 
<br/>employed by the USAID, including exemptions from tax, customs duties and other similar charges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Benefits of hosting the USAID office, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is obvious.  It opens up opportunities 
<br/>to enhance the level of bilateral co-operation between US and Fiji and improves Fiji’s access to US 
<br/>development  assistance.  The office is  going  to  be the Pacific  Office, and it would serve Kiribati, 
<br/>Nauru, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, RMI, FSM and Palau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, as the honourable Prime Minister said sometimes ago that with this, Fiji’s role 
<br/>and  status  as  the  hub  of  the  Pacific  is  going  to  be  further  enhanced.    Fiji’s  support  towards  the 
<br/>establishment of the USAID Office also shows the strength of Fiji’s relationship with the US, it will 
<br/>demonstrate the importance Fiji places on the commitment shown by the US Government to deepen 
<br/>its level of cooperation and engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also, want to take this opportunity to thank the United States of America for supporting Fiji 
<br/>through the Multilateral Development Banks such the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and 
<br/>IFC  because  their  support  including  the  support  of  Australia  and  other  countries  for  Fiji  and  the 
<br/>Pacific in these multilateral institutions is very, very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of potential that Fiji can draw on from this move to strengthen 
<br/>our engagements and the establishment of the USAID Office is going to not only benefit Fiji in a big 
<br/>way but also benefit all the Pacific Island countries that will be served by the Pacific USAID Office 
<br/></span><span>here in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, my question may be a little bit forensic, I am not sure if the 
<br/>Minister might be able to answer or not.  Some of us here may have been recipients of teachings from 
<br/>Peace Corps teachers. My question is honourable Minister, will our Education Ministry be benefiting 
<br/>from the USA with respect to some Peace Corps teachers being made available to our own schools  
<br/>in Fiji?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1611 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the programme  is  going  to  be all 
<br/>encompassing.  It depends on the individual needs and request from different countries, and I do not 
<br/>to rule out any particular type of assistance that we could get.  As the honourable Minister for Rural 
<br/>Development indicated earlier, there are specific projects-based support, but it does not exclude us 
<br/>going through USAID Office to look for assistance in other areas as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We appreciate the assistance that the USA will provide but we 
<br/>understand  the  geopolitics  behind  all  these.  Most  of  our  friends  are  coming  back  into  the  region 
<br/>because of China, this is the reality.  It is the geopolitics that is bringing back our partners in there. 
<br/>So, the honourable Minister playing smart within this, what specific areas are we looking at?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>China is giving us $300 million to assist us in our infrastructure development, Australia is 
<br/>giving us so many others including budget support. Let us be specific, which specific areas are you 
<br/>looking at in terms of getting these assistance from them? Hopefully, it is not just flying the flag for 
<br/>the sake of being here in the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes for those who engage with these 
<br/>development partners, the motivations can always be a matter of debate as part of the Indo-Pacific 
<br/>Strategy as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade has explained many times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have signed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, there are obviously potential to get 
<br/>a  lot  of  benefits  in  terms  of  trade.  So,  geopolitics  was  always  there  in  different  forms  as  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister says, metamorphosis does takes place even in those relationships as well 
<br/>but  as  I  said  to  you,  there  are  specific  areas,  for  example,  initiatives  in  municipalities,  technical 
<br/>support on climate change, meeting obligations under the Paris Agreement and expansion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The US Aid itself has certain areas but as I have said, it does not stop us not being able to put 
<br/>our proposals, look at specific areas but the areas that I have pointed out, these are important areas 
<br/>for Fiji as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also said, Mr. Speaker, that the support that we get from the US and other partners within 
<br/>the international or multilateral banks such as the ADB, World Bank and IFC as well is important 
<br/>because  a  lot  of  the  funding,  particularly  grant  funding,  concessional  funding  is  contingent  upon 
<br/>competition  amongst  different  countries.  It  is  always  good  to  have  major  development  partners 
<br/>support us in that. So, honourable Leader of the Opposition these are the areas, but it does not stop 
<br/>us from looking for other areas as well.
