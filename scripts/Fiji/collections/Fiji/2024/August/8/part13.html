<div><span>assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thank you Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Recognising the importance of education and the right of every child 
<br/>to receive it, we took swift action. I am pleased to announce that the child has now received his birth 
<br/>certificate  and  he  has  enrolled  in  Year  One  at  Saint  John  Bosco  Primary  School,  Nepani.  This 
<br/>achievement not only marks the beginning of an educational journey but also restores hope for his 
<br/>future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this story exemplifies our commitment to ensuring that every Fijian has access 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to their fundamental rights and opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Vinaka ex-AG! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Our  Government's  dedication  to  addressing  the  needs  of  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>citizens… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- … especially the most vulnerable is transforming the life, enforcing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a bright future for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this morning, we heard the honourable Prime Minister, measures being taken to 
<br/>uplift the service commitment of our Civil Service.  All we are saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of 
<br/>execution, you just have to be humane, nothing more, nothing less.  Respect your officers, give them 
<br/>the dignity and that includes inmates who are in prison because one day they will be released.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to share too, that I have had a wonderful opportunity of exchanges with some of 
<br/>our inmates who had spent over 20 to 23 years in prison. There are plans in terms of going into a 
<br/>farming project in Naitasiri and my Ministry is committed to assisting them because all we want is 
<br/>to see change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recall reading through the speech of the Prime Minister of United Kingdom.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, he brought in as his Minister for Justice a businessman who had a business of employing ex-
<br/>offenders.  What  they  shared  is,  “we  are  so  committed  into  the  issue  of  sentencing,  punishment, 
<br/>punishment, punishment.  It is time to look the other way around and that is what we are committed 
<br/>to do at the Ministry of Justice and this Government is to care for those members of the society, the 
<br/>young, the old, the sickly who are in prison and provide them another opportunity. Once again, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  highlight  some  of  the  activities  undertaken  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Justice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am representing the Opposition Bloc 16, that includes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the plus two. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Minus two.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  …  I  acknowledge  the  Government’s  recent  efforts  to  introduce  new 
<br/>policies within the Fiji Corrections Service.  While, Mr. Speaker, these initiatives are commendable, 
<br/>it is  crucial to  ensure that they uphold  the fundamental  rights  and dignity of all individuals, both 
<br/>within and outside the prison system.  Recent events and incidents such as the unauthorised release 
<br/>of a photo involving the suspended of Commissioner of Police ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  ...by  a  Corrections  Officer  underscores  significant  concerns  regarding 
<br/>privacy, dignity and human rights.  These incidents, Mr. Speaker, Sir, although investigated by the 
<br/>Corrections facility, highlights a broader issue of respecting the privacy, rights of all Fijians.  It is 
<br/>imperative that the Government implements robust measures to prevent such breaches and to ensure 
<br/>accountability when they occur.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr.  Speaker, Sir, privacy is  a fundamental human  right and it is  not  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enshrined  in  international  human  rights  standards  and  must  be  respected  for  all  Fijians 
<br/>whether they are incarcerated or living freely in society, it is vital that our Corrections policies reflect 
<br/>this  commitment  to  human  rights  and  privacy  protection  ensuring  that  every  citizen’s  dignity  is 
<br/>upheld.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, any new policy must, therefore, prioritise the well-being and rehabilitation 
<br/>efforts of prisoners, ensuring they are treated with  dignity  and respect.    Also, reports of violence 
<br/>perpetrated by a Prison Officer and overcrowding in Remand Centres demand urgent attention.  The 
<br/>use of violence within Correctional facilities is unacceptable and undermines the very purpose of this 
<br/>institution which is to rehabilitate and reform individuals.  It is vital that we establish and enforce 
<br/>strict guidelines to prevent such occurrences and hold those responsible accountable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister for Justice, overcrowding is another critical issue that 
<br/>exacerbates the challenges faced by our Correctional system. It poses significant risk to health and 
<br/>safety of both inmates and staff while also hindering the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes. 
<br/>We  need  comprehensive  strategies  to  address  this  issue  including  exploring  alternatives  to 
<br/>incarceration for non-violent offences and investing in infrastructure to accommodate the growing 
<br/>prison population.  It is incumbent upon the Minister for Justice to ensure that justice is served to all 
<br/>citizens of Fiji, regardless of their circumstances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent shortcomings within the Fiji Corrections Service highlights a failure in leadership 
<br/>and  oversight.    It  is  the  honourable  Minister’s  responsibility  to  guarantee  that  every  individual’s 
<br/>rights are observed and protected whether they are free citizens or incarcerated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  lack  of  action  in  addressing  these  issues,  such  as  privacy  breaches, 
<br/></span><span>violence  and  overcrowding  in  our  correctional  facilities,  reflects  a  troubling  disregard  for  human 
<br/>rights and justice.  The honourable Minister must be held accountable, ensuring that the Corrections 
<br/>system  operates  with  integrity  and  in  alignment  with  our  nation’s  commitment  to  upholding  the 
<br/>dignity and rights of every individual.  Failure to do so, undermines public confidence in our justice 
<br/>system and the Government’s ability to administer fair and just policies.

<div><span>1571 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I support initiatives aimed at improving our Corrections Service, I 
<br/>urge  the  Coalition  Government  to  place  a  stronger  emphasis  on  safeguarding  privacy  and  human 
<br/>rights.  Let us ensure that our policies, not only manage correctional facilities efficiently, but also 
<br/>uphold the values of justice and human dignity for all Fijians.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No wonder, I see your picture in the court house everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is difficult to be speaking after the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Justice and his Shadow Minister here because all that needs to be said on the matter at 
<br/>hand, I think has already been discussed by both of them.  But I will just offer very short remarks on 
<br/>the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all striving to do business better, work better, be more efficient, do 
<br/>more  with  less,  and  in  the  Corrections  Service,  their  return  of  investment  or  profit  is  about  a 
<br/>successful  rehabilitation  and  the  release  of  inmates  for  a  successful  re-integration  back  into  their 
<br/>homes and into the community.  That is really the ROI for the organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The functions of the organisation is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the safe and secure custody and care of those who are incarcerated in prisons; 
<br/>a very effective and humane rehabilitation programme; and 
<br/>is really an organisation that is not only a professional organisation, but an organisation that 
<br/>is staffed or have people who have the heart to change the lives of others who have gone 
<br/>offtrack.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By this, I mean, they are really captains of lives - captains of lives that inmates would see, 
<br/>trust,  believe and have the confidence to  hear them and, perhaps, be influenced so that there is  a 
<br/>change that takes place in their lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, these captains of lives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a key character is really to be ethic solid.  You 
<br/>cannot be the captain of lives of others if you cannot be the captain of your own life.  So, I am happy 
<br/>to  hear  there  is  a  now  a  bigger  effort  in  capacity  building,  in  the  training  of  staff,  in  these  new 
<br/>reformed journeys that have been initiated by the new Commissioner and the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Corrections, from my very limited experience, we can have all the best 
<br/>laws, we can have all the best people, but at the end of the day, it is that element of humanity  - a 
<br/>respect for those who have gone offtrack and are given an opportunity to be taught, cared for and 
<br/>returned back to their homes and to their families, and they do not re-offend or come back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  would  be  the  biggest  challenge  for  any  Corrections  organisation  including  Fiji,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  So, my appeal to the honourable Minister is that as we journey to improve the way we 
<br/>do business, we care for those who are under our care inside the walls. It is very important that we 
<br/></span><span>keep  to  the  very  basic  fundamental  principles  of:  (1)  that  there  is  greater  humanity  within  the 
<br/></span><span>Corrections Service.  We have the right people who are put in place as good captains of lives who 
<br/>are ethic solid and can change the lives of those who are under their care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  applaud  the  honourable  Minister  and  the  new  Commissioner  for  the  work  that  they  are 
<br/>undertaking to reform, change and move the organisation forward.  I am a simple believer in changes 
<br/>- changes that are propelled forward, and it is about moving forward and doing things better.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know any changes that takes us back, so it is very important that we have the right 
<br/>people in place that can drive these changes within the Corrections Service. That is the key for a 
<br/>professional organisation that can change the lives of others and return them back into the community 
<br/>successfully.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, viewers 
<br/>who are watching this television broadcast live from their comfort zones; we stand at a crossroads.  
<br/>The great Martin Luther King Junior often spoke about institutional and systemic racism, saying that 
<br/>“true racial equality cannot be reached without radical structural changes in society”. However, if we 
<br/>are to unpack this in our context, whether it be race, religion, provincialism or whatever we use to 
<br/>segment ourselves, first and foremost, of the need for all our people to agree on what equality actually 
<br/>means, this was the key in the involvement of the Ministry of Youth and Sports in supporting the Ba 
<br/>Provincial Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival can be best described as a transformative 
<br/>event that brought together the vibrant and diverse youth of the Ba Province, allowing them to emerge 
<br/>into a unified force for positive change. Just as a caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis to become a 
<br/>butterfly, this Festival served as a pivotal moment of transformation for our young people. It was a 
<br/>resounding success, showcasing the resilience, creativity, unity and potential of the youth in the Ba 
<br/>community.  The  Festival  provided  a  platform  for  young  people  to  showcase  their  talents,  build 
<br/>connections and contribute to the development of their communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the primary objectives of this Festival is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Promote social cohesion and unity. By celebrating our cultural diversity, we aim to foster 
<br/>mutual respect and understanding among our youth, which is essential for a harmonious 
<br/>society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Encourage active participation in sports.  Physical activity is crucial for the wellbeing of 
<br/>our youth, and through these festivals, we are promoting healthy lifestyles while instilling 
<br/>values such as teamwork, leadership and discipline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Provide  a  platform  for  artistic  and  cultural  expression.  Our  youth  festivals  are  an 
<br/>opportunity for young people to showcase their talents in dance, music and arts, thereby, 
<br/>preserving and promoting our rich cultural heritage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthen the respective Provincial and District Youth Councils. These festivals serve to 
<br/>rekindle the flames of youth development that has been dormant for the past many years, 
<br/>ensuring that youth become a force to reckon for community development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Engage  youth  with  stakeholders.  The  festivals  service  as  a  bridge  between  youth  and 
<br/>various  Government  Ministries,  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders,  providing  access  to 
<br/>resources and support on education, health, employment and social services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In alignment to the Ministry’s strategic direction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth festivals are a 
<br/>direct  response  to  the  National  Youth  Policy  and  the  National  Sports  Physical  Activity  and 
<br/></span><span>Recreational Policy, which emphasises the importance of inclusive development, empowerment and 
<br/></span><span>active participation of young people in nation building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  policy  outlines  several  strategic  goals,  including  promoting  healthy  lifestyles  through 
<br/>sports,  encouraging  artistic  and  cultural  expression,  and  ensuring  that  youth  from  all  ethnic 
<br/>backgrounds have equal opportunities to thrive. These festivals serve as a platform to actualise these 
<br/>goals by bringing together youth from diverse communities, engaging them in sports, arts, and  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exhibitions, and providing them with the tools and opportunities to showcase their talents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the Festival, the Ministry also organised a youth symposium focussed on unity, 
<br/>diversity  and  inclusivity.  This  symposium  provided  a  forum  for  young  people  to  discuss  the 
<br/>challenges and opportunities related to these crucial themes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  participants  engaged  in  thought-provoking  discussions,  shared  their 
<br/>perspectives, and worked collaboratively to identify solutions that would enhance social cohesion 
<br/>and inclusivity in our communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Festival featured a variety of events, including the Government Ministries 
<br/>and company roadshow, traditional music and dance performances, and a youth symposium focussed 
<br/>on important issues facing today’s youth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  participants  engaged  in  discussions,  workshops  and  activities  aimed  at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promoting understanding, respect and unity among individuals from different backgrounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, to address the issue of drugs in our community, the Ministry of Youth and Sports 
<br/>is  now  ensuring  that  contents  of  Youth  Festivals  conducted  in  every  Province  to  incorporate 
<br/>crosscutting objectives and the discussion of important issues that cut across our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the festivals will include sports  activities for youth  to involve themselves in 
<br/>sports,  showcasing  their  talents  and  urging  them  to  participate  in  sports  rather  than  involving 
<br/>themselves in illegal activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a good testament to this was the Vueti Kadavu Youth Festival that was held in 
<br/>Vunisea in December last year and opened by the honourable Prime Minister.  In the same event, Sir, 
<br/>Kadavu Rugby Union was officially launched with the honourable Minister for Women, Children 
<br/>and Poverty Alleviation being the first woman president.  From then, we have witnessed that a lot of 
<br/>our youth in Kadavu are now greatly engaged in rugby and other sports with the support of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very excited to report that the Vunisea Police Station has indicated 
<br/>yesterday a decline of 59 percent in the cultivation of marijuana and those caught in possession of 
<br/>marijuana. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival also included exciting competitions such as 
<br/>netball,  rugby  and  volleyball  tournaments,  where  teams  competed  fiercely  for  the  top  spots.  The 
<br/>winners were awarded prizes and accolades for their outstanding performances and sportsmanship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival concluded with a symposium that brought together youth 
<br/>from diverse backgrounds to discuss and address issues related to unity, diversity and inclusivity. 
<br/>Participants  engaged  in  meaningful  discussions,  workshops  and  activities  aimed  at  promoting 
<br/>understanding and acceptance of diversity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the three-day workshop, Mr. Speaker, Sir, participants of the Ba Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Youth  Festival  symposium  handed  over  their  declaration  to  the  Government  of  Fiji  and  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Province  of  Ba.  This  declaration  was  carried  out  by  all  the  youth  of  Ba  who  participated  in  this 
<br/></span><span>symposium, put into paper by the different races in the Ba Province.  An emotional moment occurred 
<br/>when a young Ms. Lorenza Prakash, fluent in the Ba dialect and dressed in traditional iTaukei wear 
<br/>handed over their declaration to the Government and to the Province on Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  impact  of  the  Ba  multiethnic  youth  festival,  like  the  others  before  it,  has  been 
<br/>overwhelmingly  positive.  The  festival  succeeded  in  bringing  together  youth  from  diverse

<div><span>backgrounds, fostering a sense of unity and mutual respect.  It provided an inclusive platform for 
<br/>youth to engage in sports, express their creativity, and access valuable resources and information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Feedback from participants and stakeholders has been encouraging, with  many expressing 
<br/>their appreciation for the opportunity to be part of such a vibrant and inclusive event. The Festival 
<br/>has also sparked new initiatives and collaborations among youth groups, Government Ministries and 
<br/>NGOs, all aimed at furthering the development and empowerment of our young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The success of the Ba festival is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the Ministry 
<br/>of Youth and Sports, as well as the support and co-operation of our partners and stakeholders.  It is 
<br/>also a reflection of the potential of our youth to contribute to the development and progress of our 
<br/>nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the Festival, the Ministry donated more than $8,000 to the Ba Youth Council to 
<br/>help them in their operations. All this money was collected during the event from gate takings and 
<br/>other events during the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival was a celebration of unity, diversity and 
<br/>talent, bringing together young people from different backgrounds to create positive change in their 
<br/>communities. The Ministry extends its gratitude to all the teams, players, sponsors and supporters for 
<br/>making this event a memorable one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to extend my deepest gratitude to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, for graciously officiating the first ever Ba Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Youth Festival in Lautoka. With a significant portion of the population falling between the ages of 
<br/>15 and 35, the Festival celebrated the diverse cultures and talents of the youth in the Ba Province. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supporting the event in my absence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My heartfelt appreciation also goes out to the dedicated staff of the Ministry of Youth and 
<br/>Sports  for  their  exceptional  efforts  in  organising  the  Ba  Multi-Ethnic  Youth  Festival.  Their 
<br/>unwavering  dedication  to  fostering  unity  and  celebrating  diversity  among  our  youth  is  truly 
<br/>commendable, and I am proud to have such a devoted team working towards the betterment of our 
<br/>nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, moving forward, the Ministry of Youth and Sports is committed to continuing 
<br/>the Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival across Fiji. We recognize the importance of this event in promoting 
<br/>social cohesion,  fostering talent  and providing youth  with  the resources and support they need to 
<br/>succeed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also exploring ways to expand and enhance the Festival, including introducing new 
<br/>sports and activities, increasing the involvement of stakeholders, and providing more opportunities 
<br/>for youth to engage in meaningful dialogue on issues that affect them. The Ministry is also committed 
<br/>to ensuring that this Festival is accessible to all youth, regardless of their background or location, and 
<br/></span><span>we are working to bring this event even to the most remote areas of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival being conducted across Fiji, 
<br/>is a vital part of our efforts to empower our young people and promote unity and inclusiveness in our 
<br/>society. The Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival,  like those before it, has demonstrated the power of 
<br/>these events to bring people together, celebrate diversity, and provide youth with the opportunities 
<br/>they need to thrive.

<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Youth  and 
<br/>Sports for highlighting the events at the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival.  Definitely, the thematic 
<br/>area was Honouring Ancestral Wisdom and Empowering Women and Children, and it was a platform 
<br/>for  youth  to  display  their  talents,  resilience,  creativity  and  potential  to  showcase  their  abilities  to 
<br/>boost their networking  and build potential collaboration with  other like-minded youth, as well as 
<br/>work towards the development and betterment of society and our nation as a whole.  Such platforms 
<br/>are critical to also boost the awareness of critical issues faced by our youth, such as the rise in criminal 
<br/>activities, drug use, human trafficking and the spread of HIV which is, sort of, on the rise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ba Province alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has a youth population of around 84,751 and this 
<br/>has shown participation of youth from the rural and the urban and had various ethnic groups involved.  
<br/>We can talk a lot about policies, festivals but the real demand is the call to action.  If you look at it 
<br/>from a macro perspective about the youth, we, as legislators, cannot turn a blind eye to the issues 
<br/>currently faced by our youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight in Parliament the complaints of violent behaviours 
<br/>in schools and school students who are seen in public places in their uniforms up to 8.00 p.m. till 
<br/>9.00 p.m. as well.  There are youth who have been victims of drugs.  I am glad to see that the question 
<br/>I raised in Parliament about the drugs test kits has made headlines, with the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education responding to some of the questions coming to him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, youth are also victims of being harassed and blackmailed on social media 
<br/>and I have raised this with the honourable Attorney-General as well on how we need to secure and 
<br/>restrict some of our networks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  earlier  last  week,  I  visited  Naloto  District  School.  They  had  water 
<br/>contamination issue, and I would like to thank the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services and our honourable Prime Minister for his very prompt response to my email.  He 
<br/>reached out to the school and assured the school to look into the critical issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, suicide cases for the youths are high as well.  Two days ago, someone had 
<br/>sent me a screenshot of a message of a Form 4 student, the late Mr. Terence Powell who committed 
<br/>suicide as what the message states.  The youth death toll on our roads is also a concern as a 21-year-
<br/>old from Tavua has been the recent victim.  The youths want an education system that is not enslaved 
<br/>to political agenda.  There were complaints about the TELS 50 percent penalty as well.  The youths 
<br/>wanted an increase in allowance to be able to meet their daily expenses, and they are calling on the 
<br/></span><span>Government for urgent and strict measures with the drug issue and crime rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youths demand a better healthcare system.  I am sure the whole of Fiji 
<br/>was aware of the recent case of the late Miss Harshika Devi.  Youths have raised concerns about 
<br/>youth unemployment as well.  Majority of the youth have left for greener pastures, and we need to 
<br/>overturn this brain drain into brain gain.  One of the recommendations for Government is to host a 
<br/>Youth  Innovation  Summit  that  pioneers  innovation  for  a  sustainable  future,  bringing  together

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thousands of participants from around Fiji; a platform that engages to bring outstanding young minds 
<br/>of Fiji to address some of the most pressing issues and challenges and propose innovative solutions.  
<br/>We need to empower the youth, provide them with the toolset and engage them in impactful projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  to  promote  dialogue  between  youth,  Government  departments, 
<br/>NGOs, CSOs and other stakeholders.  Provide them with awards and grants to make their visions 
<br/>come to reality.  I believe in the potential of our young people to transform our beloved nation for 
<br/>the better.  I believe in our young people, so should all of us as legislators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, are we doing enough for our youths?  That is the question we need to ask 
<br/>ourselves.  If this Government does not do it, we will do it in time to come.  In a nutshell, young 
<br/>people everywhere deserve the power to get information, to connect and ask hard questions about 
<br/>justice, equality and opportunity and it is our job to listen to the youths and answer their concerns 
<br/>about education, employment and empowerment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the honourable Minister’s inclusive approach towards ethnic unity for all Fijians, 
<br/>and  I  assure the youths  we are here to  raise your voices  and concerns and together we can work 
<br/>towards a transformative change for the betterment of our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Youth and Sports’ Ministerial Statement on the Ba Provincial Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival that was 
<br/>held in Lautoka on the 25</span><span>th</span><span> to 27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I must commend the Ministry’s initiative in organising such an event 
<br/>and especially in bringing together the youths from various ethnic backgrounds in the Ba Province.  
<br/>Ba Province is perhaps the largest Province in Fiji, which occupies the North-West segment of the 
<br/>main island of Viti Levu and such event will enable the Ba youth to emerge into a unified force for 
<br/>a positive change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by the honourable Minister that the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth 
<br/>Festival aims to address the rise in criminal activities, such as drug abuse, human trafficking and the 
<br/>spread of HIV/AIDS among youths in the Ba Province.  With all that is happening in our beloved 
<br/>Fiji today, I strongly believe that these social issues must continue to be addressed amongst our Fijian 
<br/>youths and children as it hinders the progress of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded by the honourable Minister, the festival also provided a platform for youths to 
<br/>showcase their talents, build connections and contribute to the development of their communities.  
<br/>We need more of such events that will bring forth a change in the mindsets of our youths and enable 
<br/>them to work with groups from different ethnic backgrounds and contribute positively towards nation 
<br/>building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one important  topic, apart from  just promoting healthy lifestyle through 
<br/>sports that is often being overlooked is on healthy living lifestyle, simply promoting a well-balanced 
<br/></span><span>lifestyle to our youths.  I urge the honourable Minister to include this topic in their workshops and 
<br/></span><span>any upcoming youth festival or event.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  must  take  the  lead  role  in  advocating  on  healthy  living.    When  youths  take 
<br/>charge of their health, it will bring forth positive changes to our homes, communities and the nation.  
<br/>As mentioned by the honourable Minister, the extending of such festivals to other provinces is greatly 
<br/>welcomed.

<div><span>Signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on US Tuna Treaty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker,  honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I  rise to  deliver my  Statement on the recent  signing of the  Memorandum  of 
<br/>Understanding  among  the  governments  of  certain  Pacific  Islands  States  including  Fiji  and  the 
<br/>Government of the United States of America regarding fishing access terms for 2024; better known 
<br/>as the US Tuna Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in  1987, the Pacific  Island Parties (PIPs) and the United States Government 
<br/>engaged in the 1987 Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States 
<br/>and  the  Government  of  the  United  States  of  America.    Currently,  parties  to  the  treaty  have  been 
<br/>voluntarily applying the 2016 Amendments to the Treaty, which was developed in  Fiji on the 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>December, 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Treaty was built on the aspects of fisheries access to the US per se in tuna 
<br/>fishing fleet in the Pacific Island countries and was reciprocated with financial distributions towards 
<br/>the promotion of economic development in the Pacific region.  These Pacific Island Parties are the 
<br/>Governments of Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of 
<br/>Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, 
<br/>Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Treaty was primarily developed on the concepts of regional solidarity under 
<br/>the  membership  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Fisheries  Agency  (FFA).    With  the  FFA  being  the 
<br/>Treaty’s administrator and PNG, being the depository. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all of the members benefitted based on the abundance of the highly migratory 
<br/>tuna  stocks  within  their  waters  and  the  relative  US  purse  seine,  associated  with  fishing  activities 
<br/>therein.  It should be noted that within the FFA membership, exists the members of the Parties to the 
<br/>Nauru Agreement (PNA) where the greatest fishing densities occur, and where there is more to gain 
<br/>from the Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, please allow me to elaborate on the Memorandum of Understanding signed and 
<br/>agreed amendments to the Treaty.  Under Article 9 of the Treaty titled the “Amendment of the Treaty” 
<br/>references that an amendment to the Treaty must be adopted on the approval of the parties and shall 
<br/>come into force upon receipt of the depository. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in order to allow for the fishing arrangement for the year 2024 to proceed, six 
<br/>amendments have been made and have to be signed off by the FFA membership.  The amendments 
<br/>cater to the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Facilitation of observer services which allows for Pacific Island Parties to provide observers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>directly to the US purse seine fleet; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Agreement on adjusted fishing days which shall have an Upfront Days payment for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) and can be negotiated later; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Adjustment of the Exploratory Pool of which Fiji is a member shall be paid US$6,000 for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each fishing day;

<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Standard text that nothing in the MOU shall prejudice the participants to the Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in order to fully appreciate this and the benefits to Fiji in real terms and noting 
<br/>Fiji’s pivotal involvement in the US Treaty negotiations, through the honourable Semi Koroilavesau, 
<br/>we saw US$16 million being provided each year to the FFA membership over the next 10 years based 
<br/>on the US Purse Seine activity in their waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the present formula for distribution is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>$315,000 is paid as a management fee to the Secretariat, that being the FFA. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>$950,000 is paid to the Secretariat to cover administration costs.  Any unused funds are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>returned to Members with each Member receiving an equal share of any funds returned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>$2.5  million  was  held  by  the  Secretariat  for  Project  Development  Fund  payments  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each Pacific Island Party receiving $156,250 under the last extension.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>A payment of US$8,469 per day paid upfront to Pacific Islands Parties that contribute days 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Vessel Day Scheme (VDS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The remaining funds are distributed equally among the Pacific Island Parties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to advise that on 24th July, 2024, having acquired Cabinet's 
<br/>endorsement, I had signed amended texts within the margin of the 23rd Annual Ministerial Forum 
<br/>Fisheries Committee at the FFA Headquarters in Honiara, Solomon Islands. The Ministry of Foreign 
<br/>Affairs has been advised with the process and to provide the same to the Treaty's depository in Papua 
<br/>New Guinea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to-date, Fiji has received a total of US$1.7 million, monies received to close 
<br/>off the last six-year licensing period which was from 15th June, 2017 to 14th June, 2023.  Note that 
<br/>the signing event will open the way to Fiji's share of the US$60 million, over the next 10 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  high  turnover  in  the  Ministry,  these  funds shall  be  allocated to 
<br/>upskill and capacity build incoming staff, and develop e-systems and reportings to allow for more 
<br/>ease of doing business in fisheries to our valued stakeholders and allow for an effective monitoring 
<br/>and evaluation system that shall properly identify the Ministry's contribution to GDP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in noting that this support, under the US Tuna Treaty, shall continue over 
<br/>the next 10 years, I will ensure that the necessary technical and structural supports are provided to 
<br/>our people, in relation to fisheries, reinforcing the concepts of supporting established Private Public 
<br/>Partnerships and co-operatives with the aim of commercialisation, whilst ensuring the sustainable 
<br/>development and the provision of alternate sources of protein to the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first I wish to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>the Ministerial Statement concerning the US Tuna Treaty that was signed recently.   As alluded to 
<br/></span><span>by the honourable Minister, the honourable Koroilavesau was given the responsibility to lead the 
<br/></span><span>negotiation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was at a very difficult time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it was during COVID-19 when they 
<br/>started and most of the updates to the other member countries were done virtually because of the 
<br/>restrictions in  travel  back then. Of course, the subsequent  meetings  that  was held  in  Denarau in 
<br/>2021,  that  brought  for  the  first  time  (while  the  negotiations  were  ongoing)  all  the  parties 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>beneficiaries, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, the members of the Forum Fisheries Agency 
<br/>which has its headquarters in Honiara.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what was interesting in that meeting in Denarau was the request made by 
<br/>the member countries for the increase in allocation and that led to more intense negotiation.  But 
<br/>thankfully in the 2022 meeting in Palau, they were able to come to a comprise.  Instead of $100 
<br/>million, they came down to $60 million but perhaps the big challenge then (and I am thankful to the 
<br/>honourable Minister for clarifying this), was in the proportion of the distribution of the funds once 
<br/>it is secured.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  a  lot  of  demand  from  the  Parties  to  the  Nauru  Agreement  (PNA)  member 
<br/>countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of their argument that most of the purse seine fisheries activities 
<br/>were happening in their fisheries area. They were demanding for more of the allocation and that 
<br/>was  one  of  the  very  sensitive  issues  in  the  negotiations.    But  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, regional solidarity is so important and that was the lead role that Fiji took in trying to bring 
<br/>everyone together, even to a stage where they considered having the old formula for what was the 
<br/>previous rate and then later on, they can sort that out, but I am thankful that this has been sorted out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Minister,  you  have  highlighted  how  these  funds  will  be  utilised  in  the  Ministry.  
<br/>Perhaps, just an advice or recommendation, as a former Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>appreciate  the  funding,  but  it  is  given  to  the  member  States  for  a  purpose,  particularly  for  the 
<br/>development of the fisheries sector.  When I was the Minister, I used to wonder how the funding for 
<br/>the Fisheries staff was sourced from because they were attending almost meeting in the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I later found out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that instead of using these funds for the utilisation of the 
<br/>development of the fisheries sector, most of these funds were just utilised for the travel purposes of 
<br/>the staff.  I put a stop to that. I asked the Permanent Secretary who is responsible for the finance, 
<br/>every time there is a request for these funds, we need to discuss it because we need a lot of funding 
<br/>to develop the seaweed, aquaculture and mariculture.  This is the purpose in which it was given, and 
<br/>I hope, honourable Madam Minister, that you will have a tight control over this because it will benefit 
<br/>us a lot in the long term, particularly in development of the fisheries sector.  Thank you, Madam 
<br/>Minister for the statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you honourable Minister for the Statement 
<br/>this afternoon. This Treaty is one that is always difficult to negotiate, the 17 Member States of FFA 
<br/>with United States of America.  The Treaty, for those who do not know, it is a treaty where we allow 
<br/>the US purse seine vessels to come in and fish in FFA member country waters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Purse seine vessels, their target species is skipjack, and skipjack like in warmer waters, which 
<br/>means they fish more in the equatorial regions at the big EEZ of PNG, Kiribati and the Micronesian 
<br/>countries.  Our target tuna species in Fiji is Albacore, it is deeper.  Albacore likes a little bit more 
<br/>colder water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the negotiations, it is usually difficult because those that have skipjack in abundance in 
<br/></span><span>their waters usually asked for more, but it benefits in Fiji in a sense that that chunk of money that is 
<br/>distributed equally, we get a share of it because we are members of FFA, even though they do not 
<br/>come down to our waters to fish because our target species is Albacore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to congratulate the Ministry and FFA in general for negotiating this increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is always this big argument that the fish that the US purse seiners take out of our waters is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>much, much more than what they are giving us as a fee for their access to our waters. And tuna is a 
<br/>commodity, it is almost like whale when you think about how tuna is traded around the world.  Tuna 
<br/>is  a  lucrative  market  because  it  is  considered  as a  much  healthier  protein  option than  meat.    The 
<br/>Pacific region, especially the FFA member countries’ waters is abundant in this tuna supply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been part of the negotiation a few years, when I was in the Ministry of Fisheries and 
<br/>Forests and I understand very much the difficulty, one, in negotiating with the United States, and 
<br/>two, because there are the other groupings within FFA and PNA members, and those countries like 
<br/>Fiji who do not have Skipjack, they do not come in and fish, but we still want to have our voice in 
<br/>there, but we are thankful that we get a share of the funds that are distributed equally to the Member 
<br/>States, even though we do not get funds from the fishing base because they do not come in and fish 
<br/>in our waters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have one suggestion or request to the Ministry, that in the money that is 
<br/>allocated to Fiji, that you should think about the Maritime Surveillance Centre.  It requires a lot of 
<br/>money to buy the software, and a lot of the surveillance now for fisheries in our waters is done from 
<br/>there electronically.  It is much cheaper but very effective.  All the vessels that come in and fish in 
<br/>the  FFA  waters  have  vessel  monitoring  systems  and  it  will  be  good  if  you  can  think  about  also 
<br/>assisting that Surveillance Centre with the money that we get.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Congratulations on that negotiation and that increase is very much overdue.  I am sure the 
<br/>negotiations in future, we will still try and get value for the amount of tuna that they take out of our 
<br/>waters, which is always difficult but not impossible negotiation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the point provided by the Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>I think it is very important to us here, to redirect the funds to other activities.  It does, kind of, touch 
<br/>on  the  very  idea  that  it  was  supposed  to  be  used  for.    We  saw  the  glaring  example  in  the  COP 
<br/>meetings.  When you sit around, they will ask, “Where are you from?”  We say, “We are from Fiji.”  
<br/>Then you ask around and found out they were funded by some groups in Fiji, SPREP, et cetera, or in 
<br/>the Pacific.  So, we are not talking to each other, yet we are finding lots of people there.  Even some 
<br/>have gone to the COP meeting by paying their own air fare.  There is this gentleman in charge of the 
<br/>IRB.  He paid his air fare there, he was not part of the Ministry’s delegation, but he went to there to 
<br/>try and learn as much as possible, and we were trying to help him since he was there.  I really do not 
<br/>know, Deputy Prime Minister, how you will scrutinise all these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Really,  it  is  a  fairly  new  thing,  having  served  for  some  time.    You  fully  understand  the 
<br/>protocol if go through, even if you want to attend this kind of meetings.  If it is not part of your job 
<br/>description, then just stay out, let the others who should be there to be there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just kind of adding to the sentiments raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/>You  have  the  fund,  let  us  hope  it  is  not  misdirected.    We  do  respect  your  decision  and  your 
<br/>appointment in that position as Minister for Fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
