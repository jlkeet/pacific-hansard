<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting.  I also welcome all who are joining us 
<br/>in the gallery.  On that note we acknowledge the presence of our sprint queen (the one in the blue 
<br/>top) Miss Kesaia Boletakanakadavu.  We also have Mr. Tevita Korodrau, he hails from Rewa but he 
<br/>has been in the United States of America all this while.  We are glad to see you in this Chamber.  And 
<br/>Madam, I really do not know, you are from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VISITOR.- Me, Mr. Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, Madam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VISITOR.- I am from the French Embassy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Welcome once more to  the Parliament of Fiji  and the two young ladies 
<br/>sitting right at the back.  We always like to acknowledge your presence in the gallery, sitting amongst 
<br/>us because we know you are also, as part of those watching the livestream, part of the population that 
<br/>is always interested in the daily sittings of Parliament.  We wish you well.  </span><span>

<div><span>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights – Heritage Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of all honourable Members, I received a request  from the Chairperson of the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  for  the  Committee  to  report  back  to 
<br/>Parliament on the Heritage Bill at a later sitting of Parliament. The Committee requests to undertake 
<br/>further  public  consultations  on  the  Bill  and  I  seek  the  indulgence  of  Parliament  to  approve  the 
<br/>Committee’s request. Is there any opposition?
