<h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3>
<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order – Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad and Hon. S. Nand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members,  at  this juncture,  I now wish to  address  the Point of Order that was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>raised on 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can confirm that I have reviewed the relevant excerpts of the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily</span><span> </span><span>Hansard</span><span>
<br/>of that sitting day. The honourable Sachida Nand was reporting to the Minister for Agriculture and 
<br/>Waterways. The excerpts read as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “HON. S. NAND.- I would highly recommend our Minister of Finance to get off 
<br/>from his four wheel drive, get out of his overseas trips and go to the farm and talk to the 
<br/>farmers.  It is no good sitting here and saying, ‘we give subsidy, we give fertiliser subsidy, 
<br/>seed subsidy’ - no, talk to the farmers.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Go and talk to the farmers and then you will understand the plight 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not do BBQ from the road like you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- That statement is uncalled for and I must remind the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance, I do not do that.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members,  there were exchanges during the day  and  I now refer to  the earlier 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exchange from the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily</span><span> </span><span>Hansard</span><span> of the same day which reads as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just this morning the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance and Deputy Prime Minister stated, “go and do roadside BBQ”. I do not do roadside 
<br/></span><span>BBQ.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response from honourable Professor Biman Prasad, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. – I did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  S.  NAND.  –  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  It  is  a  usual  trend  of  the  honourable 
<br/>Member to backtrack what he is saying. This is an insult to the hundreds of people who 
<br/>sell roadside BBQs to make ends meet. These are the people who do hard work to feed the 
<br/></span><span>people. These are not the people who go around texting other people’s wives, inviting them 
<br/></span><span>over; these are not the people. It is important that these people should be, we are talking 
<br/>about poverty alleviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD </span><span>– </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is imputing 
<br/>improper motive. He knows what happened and he knows how that matter was disposed</span><span>
<br/></span><span>of.  I think he is totally going down to gutter level and insulting, hurling insults using this

<div><span>Speaker’s Ruling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>parliamentary Chamber.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, having reviewed the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily</span><span> </span><span>Hansard </span><span>for that particular 
<br/>day, I confirm that there were exchanges from both honourable Members that were unbecoming and 
<br/>disorderly. I am satisfied that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister used offensive words against 
<br/>the honourable Sachida Nand in contravention of Standing Order 62(4)(a). I am also satisfied that 
<br/>the honourable Sachida Nand had indeed imputed improper motives to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister in contravention of Standing Order 62(1). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a previous Ruling, I had stated that friendly banter is always welcomed but stooping low 
<br/>and playing gutter level attack on each other does not augur well in maintaining the decorum, honour 
<br/>and dignity of our Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, I hereby rule that the two honourable Members must withdraw their disorderly 
<br/>statements. I will ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to withdraw his 
<br/>statement on, “I do not do BBQ from the road like you.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I withdraw that statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will ask honourable Sachida Nand to withdraw his statement on, “These 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are not the people who go around texting other people’s wives, inviting them over.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw that statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order – Hon. Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will now move on and, that is, on the second Point of Order that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  a  Point  of  Order  was  raised  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition whereby he called the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, Professor Biman Prasad, to bring proof to 
<br/>Parliament about the allegations that he had made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I have duly perused the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily</span><span> </span><span>Hansard</span><span> of Wednesday, 22nd November, 
<br/></span><span>2023, specifically on pages 2171 and 2172, the honourable Professor Biman Prasad said and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The use of Section 127(8) of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked 
<br/>about  that.  It  is  in  the  Constitution,  there  is  nothing  we  can  do  about  it,  but  this 
<br/>Government moved the Ministry of Public Service under the Prime Minister, under whom 
<br/>the Public Service Commission is also based.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Public Service Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is only responsible for appointing the 
<br/></span><span>Permanent  Secretaries,  but  under  the  Constitution,  the  Permanent  Secretaries  have 
<br/></span><span>absolute power but with the agreement of the Ministers. What was happening in the past, 
<br/>the  Ministers  were  making  appointments  and  it  happened,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  in  many 
<br/>cases.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members,  the honourable Leader of the Opposition  then raised a Point of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order pursuant to Standing Order 74 asking that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister bring
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proof  about  appointments  being  made  that  were  made  by  Ministers  and  not  according  to  the 
<br/>processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I am satisfied that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was referring 
<br/>to the provisions of the Constitution and therefore I hereby rule that there was no misrepresentation 
<br/>of information nor breach of the Standing Orders. On that Point of Order by the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition yesterday on the issue of “loot”, I will deliver my ruling at a later date. 
<br/></span></div>
