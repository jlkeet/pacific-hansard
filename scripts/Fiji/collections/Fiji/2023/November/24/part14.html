<div><span>Empowering Youth for a Prosperous Future in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Honourable Members, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our nation, known for its vibrant 
<br/></span><span>culture and warm-hearted people, has always been blessed with an abundance of youthful energy and 
<br/>potential.  It is these very youths that represent the future of our nation; a future we all cherish and 
<br/>work tirelessly to build.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  this  week  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  gathered  here  to  deliberate,  discuss  and  make 
<br/>decisions that will shape our beloved nation.  The issues we have grappled with have been many and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the debates have been fierce, but today as we draw this parliamentary week to a close, I want to focus 
<br/>on a subject that I believe should be at the forefront of our political discourse - the empowerment of 
<br/>our youth for a prosperous future in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we discuss this critical issue, I have to draw our attention to the challenges 
<br/>that  impede  the  realisation  of  this  mission,  challenges  that  demand  our  immediate  attention  and 
<br/>collective efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most glaring issues is the state of education in our country.   The promise of free 
<br/>education is a big Election promise of the Coalition Government’s agenda seems to have vanished 
<br/>into thin air.  It is disheartening Mr. Speaker, Sir, to note that students are being burdened with the 
<br/>weight of fees required to pay before they can even sit for their exams in certain tertiary programmes.  
<br/>This  not  only  contradicts  the  commitment  made  by  the  Coalition  Government  but  also  places  an 
<br/>unjust barrier to their educational pursuits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, equally concerning is the decline in youth-focused policies by the Coalition 
<br/>Government.   It  appears that the ship of our nation the Government  is  sailing  without a compass 
<br/>lacking a clear direction for Fiji’s youths.  The lack for new initiatives and projects means a less 
<br/>employment opportunities for our young people further adding to the challenges they face in building 
<br/>a prosperous future including trying to overcome the high cost of living due to the increase in VAT. 
<br/>Moreover, the recent Government reshuffle and decisions taken therein have left the nation in a state 
<br/>of confusion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Only you are confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Such actions including the lack of transparency surrounding them erode 
<br/>the  trust  and  faith  that  our  young  people  place  in  the  Government.    We  cannot  afford  to  have  a 
<br/>generation unsure about the government’s decisions shaping their future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, another cause for concern is the regular breach of the 
<br/>Constitution by the Coalition Government.  The very foundation that guarantees the rights of our 
<br/>citizens is being questioned leaving our youth wondering about transparency, democracy that was 
<br/>promised to them before Elections Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is crucial that the Coalition Government must 
<br/>uphold  the  principles  enshrined  in  our  2013  Constitution  to  protect  the  rights  of  the  younger 
<br/></span><span>generation and preserve the democratic values we hold dear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to put on record Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Grace Road workers especially the 
<br/>female workers who were harassed by the police, there are videos that were viral on social media.  
<br/>None of the Coalition Government Ministers, even  the Home Affairs Minister did not even make a 
<br/>comment about how the Grace Road workers were harassed.  I also note that in today’s Order Paper, 
<br/>honourable Ratu Rakuita (my OB from Savusavu) is also making a Statement on the Adherence of 
<br/>Rule of Law.  It is quite surprising when you talk about rule of law and something else is happening 
<br/>on the other side as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, the Koreans were youth as well? You mentioned the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Koreans or something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- They are Grace Road workers, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are they youth? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes Sir, some of our youth workers are working in that company, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were concerned how the Grace Road workers were treated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  we  continue  to  breach  the  2013  Constitution,  it  is 
<br/>setting a bad example to our younger Fijians.  As a saying goes in </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> “ni</span><span> sa vuvu na vuna sa na 
<br/>vuvu kece mai na uciwai</span><span>”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat that again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sorry, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat that again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Time is up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, “ </span><span>ni sa vuvu na vuna sa na vuvu kece mai na uciwai</span><span>”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is disheartening to note that during times of crisis such as 
<br/>cyclone affecting our nation, some Ministers was seemingly preoccupied with activities that are not 
<br/>aligned with their responsibilities, Like drinking grog while our Fijian police officers and our fellow 
<br/>Fijians ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-... were grappling with the cyclone and the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- ... aftermath and during the gust winds of </span><span>TC Mal</span><span> that was affecting Fiji. 
<br/>Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  absence  of  the  Prime  Minister  during  critical  moments  raises 
<br/>questions about this Government’s priorities and commitment to the wellbeing of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The Minister is  there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- While youths and SMEs hold immense promise, Mr .Speaker, Sir, it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unfortunate that some may overlook or underestimate their contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Monday the honourable Minister for Finance &amp; Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stood up in this same august Parliament and responded to a honourable Member, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I do not do the BBQ from the roadside like you.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- ... he has withdrawn that statement. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2325 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He has withdrawn that.  They have withdrawn it, honourable Member. No 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to bring it back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LA.- Noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What he quoted is already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resolved. He should not quote it again. He should clearly state that I have withdrawn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have already... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- … already explained.  Are your deaf or what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  It  has  been  taken  care  of.    So,  they  have  withdrawn  those  remarks  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please do not reignite the fire again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that comment was withdrawn by the Minister for 
<br/>Finance and Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Minister for Finance that he should recognise and promote 
<br/>the invaluable role that these BBQ stalls played during night life in urban areas and in our economy.  
<br/>Some of them are young people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I normally go and buy BBQs from them 
<br/>as well.  These are people trying to make best living, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and create better life for them 
<br/>and their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that we are at a crossroad, faced with challenges that demand 
<br/>our  attention  and  resolute  action.    The  promises  made  to  our  youth,  especially  in  the  realm  of 
<br/>education, must not be hollow words but tangible commitments that uplift the aspirations of every 
<br/>Fijian.  It  is  time  for  the  Government  to  reflect  on  its  course  and  re-evaluate  its  priorities  for  the 
<br/>collective wellbeing of our young generation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  reignite  the  flame,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  hope  for  our  young  people,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government must reaffirm its commitment to free education ensuring that financial constraints do 
<br/>not hinder the academic pursuits of students and the young people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  stagnant  economy  leads  to  a 
<br/>stagnant future, and we cannot afford to let our young minds remain idle and please Minister for 
<br/></span><span>Employment,  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Minister  of  Finance,  reduce  your  overseas 
<br/></span><span>travels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the Government I say this “FijiFirst has left you with a modern Fiji” Our 
<br/>young people deserve a Government like FijiFirst that they can trust and believe in.  One that stands 
<br/>firm on the principles of democracy and transparency as enshrined in our 2013 Constitution just how 
<br/>FijiFirst followed it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we navigate the challenges before us, the Coalition Government must 
<br/></span><span>remember that the true measure of a nation’s strength lies in the wellbeing and the aspirations of the 
<br/></span><span>young people. I demand that the Coalition Government gets back on its track to work tirelessly for 
<br/>the future of our young people and to craft policies and initiatives that pave the way for a prosperous 
<br/>and promising tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a future that irrespective if I am an Indo-Fijian or not, I am considered a 
<br/>Fijian under the 2013 Constitution.  That is the modern Fiji that the Bainimarama Government and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the FijiFirst Government has definitely. In the same verse of honourable Tabuya - </span><span>ciqoma, tiloma qai 
<br/>mokota ena marau.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  invite  honourable  Lynda  Tabuya.  She  is  standing  in  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Youth and Sports who is being displaced at this point in time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to respond 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the End of Week Statement by my colleague, honourable Ketan Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection in  Fiji,  I do stand before you 
<br/>today to address this critical issue that resonates deeply within the fabric of our nation’s future - the 
<br/>empowerment of our youth for a prosperous tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The youth of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, represent the lifeblood of our nation - holding the promise 
<br/>and potential to drive our economy, innovate industries and shape the social landscape of our country.  
<br/>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  their  journey  towards  success  is  often  impeded  by  various  challenges, 
<br/>hindering their ability to fully realise their potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The need to empower youth is a critical issue for the Coalition Government. In the last 10 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>months,  Mr.  Speaker,  since  we  have  come  into  Government,  youth  focussed  policies  have  been 
<br/>implemented in various Ministries, mostly focussed on youth economic empowerment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Youth, through the reopening of our Youth Training Centres in rural and 
<br/>maritime areas which were closed by the previous Government, is a welcome initiative, as well as 
<br/>the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs stepping up their training opportunities in Nadave, and  education 
<br/>and training Initiatives by the Ministry of Education through the Fiji National University. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you have heard in the Parliament previously, the offer made to our young 
<br/>people living in informal and squatter settlements and those who are unemployed or are on the streets 
<br/>received training opportunities through the Fiji National University and they continue to upskill in 
<br/>their stages of training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just this morning, Mr. Speaker, Pacific Polytech commenced its free courses in their location 
<br/>in Nabua - courses in Carpentry, Joinery, Plumbing, Auto Penal, Mechanics, Engineering, Tourism 
<br/>and Hospitality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I visited Pacific Polytech and met with Dr. Ganesh Chand and his team, as well 
<br/></span><span>as the students currently enrolled there. It was an atmosphere of smiles, joy, enthusiasm and hope.  
<br/>As  young  people,  they  are  mostly  from  informal  and  squatter  settlements  in  the  Suva-Nausori 
<br/>corridor.  Young  single  mums  and  dads  included  with  an  eagerness  to  learn  and  eagerness  to  be 
<br/>productive and eagerness to be empowered, and the eagerness and hope for the future.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>a dignity in their life, learning the value of work. This is what this Government is committed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  all  know  the  previous  Government  that  stopped  Pacific  Polytech  from 
<br/>opening, did not give them the funding to open.  For a number of years, building the complexes that 
<br/></span><span>were  never  used  around  the  country.  They  closed  the  vocational  colleges,  they  closed  the  Youth 
<br/></span><span>Centres without our youth being empowered. That was the legacy of the previous Government, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.   So, honourable Ketan Lal, who has disappeared and has left the Chambers, and is talking 
<br/>about youth focussed policies … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Call him, call him! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2327 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- …he is obviously new in Parliament. He is new to this Chambers, 
<br/>but he should just look left and right, ask his leader, ask his colleagues, what did they do to bring 
<br/>youth focussed policies? What did they do to empower our youth?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is their legacy, Mr. Speaker, this is their legacy, and I will remind them of this.  We have 
<br/>about 800 to 3,000 young people on the social welfare system who should not be on it.  They have 
<br/>been there for years.  Social welfare is supposed to be for temporary shocks, not for years.  We are 
<br/>talking about three years, four years or five years of young people in the system.  What has their 
<br/>government  done  to  graduate  them  out  of  the  system?    What  happened  to  the  Welfare  Graduate 
<br/>Programme that is a mandate for the Ministry of Women and Social Protection, that they should be 
<br/>graduated out of?  Nothing done, Mr. Speaker, no programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, they had the Jobs for Nature, but it was a half attempt, just to buffer the big loans that 
<br/>they were getting from the World Bank.  It was just sort of a concessional or consolation prize, they 
<br/>call it, just to make it look like they are engaging young people and women.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these 
<br/>were not sustainable projects.  We need to get into sustainable projects for our young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have the legacy of wrecking up the largest  burden for youth  in the 
<br/>history of Fiji.  They were prepared to give $650 million to our youth in terms of Tertiary Scholarship 
<br/>Loans.  What did this Government do – the Coalition Government?  We have removed and forgiven 
<br/>this debt.  That is empowering.  We have removed this debt, we are empowering our youth to move 
<br/>forward without a debt.  So, when they start working, they can actually afford to buy a house, they 
<br/>can afford to sustain and support their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  want  to  address  what  honourable  Ketan  Lal  said.    I  want  to 
<br/>congratulate him for being a youth MP in Parliament.  I want to congratulate honourable Ketan Lal 
<br/>and  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma  for  making  it  into  Parliament  as  youth  Members  And,  of  course, 
<br/>honourable Aliki Bia, from our area of New Town.  Congratulations as new MPs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  That side no youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- But, Mr. Speaker, I fail to see how grogging, and he has mentioned 
<br/>“grogging” of honourable Members on this side has to do with this topic of youth empowerment.  In 
<br/>fact, the kava industry is thriving because of youth, so there is no connection there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he really do his homework and ask his leaders and colleagues, what did they 
<br/>do?  The youth were not a priority for the FijiFirst Government in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>They have created a welfare state for our young people.  We want to graduate our youth from welfare 
<br/>to well-being, from poverty to productivity, and that is the commitment of this Coalition Government, 
<br/>we are doing it and we will continue to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No running commentary and no debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this relevant topic.  Standing 
<br/></span><span>Order 62(4)(a) – Prohibited references: “Offensive words against a Parliament or another Member.” 
<br/>The newly appointed Leader of the Government in Business looked at me and referred to me and 
<br/>said, “Are you deaf, or what?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  request  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  him  to  withdraw  the  statement  because  we 
<br/>follow the rules you set in this Parliament, and when we raise a Point of Order, we quote the number

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It’s too late. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- It’s not too late, we are still on the matter.  Please, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if he can withdraw his statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, would you like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdraw those comments? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  it  was  supposed  to  be  raised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>immediately after that, but in respect of the youth, I withdraw that and I know that he is not deaf.

<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  comment  to  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Women, Children and Social Protection, whenever we were in Government…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that part of your End of  Week Statement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning as I drove into Parliament from Nakasi 
<br/>and as I approached the Laqere Bridge, my mind thought back to 22</span><span>nd</span><span> January, 1973. I was then 11 
<br/>years old, attending what was then called the Kalabu Fijian School.  It was a Sunday after midday, if 
<br/>I recall correctly, and there was a loud noise from the King’s Road.  Soon after this there was an 
<br/>intense commotion filtering through our settlement in Wakanisila and people started running down 
<br/>the gravel road to the then two-lane Laqere Bridge and it was the most traumatic site; a collision of 
<br/>two buses just before the old Laqere Bridge from the Nausori end, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tui Davuilevu bus, this bus company is no longer with us, an old wooden bus was coming 
<br/>down from Nausori.  It was full of women and children who had been celebrating a wedding, in a 
<br/></span><span>celebratory mode, they were singing, playing instruments in the bus.  They were on their way to Suva 
<br/></span><span>Point to put flowers into the seas as part of the wedding rituals that they have just been to.  It was an 
<br/>old wooden bus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it was a time of joy for everyone on that bus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming in the opposite direction was a Chieftain bus that was used by the tourists.  There 
<br/>were no passengers on board, only the driver was on board, and it was a steel structured bus.  It was 
<br/>a huge tragedy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 15 people on that wooden Tui Davuilevu bus lost their lives there 
<br/>and one more passed away the next day; 16 lives were lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The impact of this on the families was intense, catastrophic and immense.  The driver of the 
<br/></span><span>Chieftain bus could be later taken to task for this disaster and to my mind, as I reflect back, two major 
<br/>things contributed to that disaster.  First of all, driver carelessness, the way that driver drove the bus; 
<br/>and secondly, the condition in which the other bus was.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That traffic accident is forever etched in my memory.  It is a graphic reminder and when I 
<br/>think of safety on public transport, those are the memories that come back and for a long time in our 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>area there in Wakanisila and Laqere, we were always haunted.  People said that that end of the bridge 
<br/>used to be haunted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, public transport includes buses, taxis, minibuses, carriers and rental cars 
<br/>and already this year we have had 73 fatalities on the roads, 12 of these were from public service 
<br/>vehicles.  Some of the data shared by honourable Tuinaceva last night was quite shocking and I think, 
<br/>for us, demonstrates another crisis that we are in.  He told us last night that until last week, there had 
<br/>been 72 deaths compared to 38 the same period last year - a 90 percent increase, almost doubled.  I 
<br/>think that is a crisis for us, something that we really have to address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other data that he shared, 80 percent of accidents are caused by overspeeding, 70 percent 
<br/>of deaths are caused by overspeeding, and in November alone of this year, within two weeks, there 
<br/>have been 161 accidents and eight fatalities. For the buses, in October of this year (2023), there have 
<br/>been four accidents involving buses and three of these were fatal where people passed away and all 
<br/>of these happened just within 10 days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be speaking a lot more for the rest of my speech and using the bus 
<br/>industry as a proxy for the whole of the public transport sector.   But there are a number of factors 
<br/>that are affecting this reduction in safety on public transport, and one is the condition of buses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The conditions of buses that we have and you can use that for condition of the minibuses, 
<br/>condition of rental cars and taxis, et cetera.  Already, we have had four cases of burning of buses 
<br/>where buses stopped, people have to jump out because it starts burning. Obviously, there are some 
<br/>defects with the buses themselves that would have been the cause of burning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyday around Fiji, there must be, at least, 10 bus breakdowns, where buses have to stop, 
<br/>people have to get out, they have to call another bus to put people on board.  Obviously, there is 
<br/>something wrong with those buses that led to those bus breakdowns.  That is hinting at the state of 
<br/>some buses, not all buses.  We can see a lot of good buses around Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was a Minister, I used to ride around in the black car that you are now enjoying, but 
<br/>this year, I have had the luxury and the time to be able to every now and then ride buses back to 
<br/>Nakasi,  or  from  Nakasi  to  here.  I  can  tell  you  that  riding  on  these  public  buses,  there  is  a  lot  of 
<br/>extreme discomfort.  I once sat on a bus, there was place for two people, one person was sitting there 
<br/>and for me when I sat on the seat only one quarter of me could fit, so I had to turn this way and sit.  
<br/>It is extremely discomforting riding in our buses today.  Something happened, even the buses have 
<br/></span><span>gone smaller, or our people have gone much bigger or both, but it is extremely uncomfortable.  I 
<br/></span><span>have been riding buses this year and I can tell you, there is a lot of overcrowding.  The condition of 
<br/>these buses are such, the way people are crammed together, if there was an accident, there would be 
<br/>a lot of injuries and even possibly fatalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA)  has  quality  assurance  processes  for  buses,  and  this  is 
<br/>designed  to  ensure  that  the  quality  of  buses  are  maintained  after  they  have  received  their  fitness 
<br/>certificate.  They normally do this twice a year, so it is very important for us to make sure that the 
<br/>soundness of the buses, that these quality assurance mechanisms are being implemented well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These mechanisms look into fleet management, they have daily checks.  A big question for 
<br/>us is, how sure are we that it is being done well because all those indicators of buses breaking down 
<br/>and about 30 percent of buses in Fiji are more than 20 years old.  When you have very old buses, you 
<br/>cannot get the replacement parts, what they do, they modify parts to put that in and the quality of 
<br/>those modified parts – we do not know.  Maybe that is part of the issue too.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  introduced  e-ticketing  was  to  get  rid  of  the 
<br/>leakage that was happening in the bus industry so that the companies could increase their income and 
<br/>perhaps, buy new buses.  I think we have seen that over the past few years, we have seen quite a 
<br/>number of new buses that are on the roads; much safer and better for the people who travel on them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the whole idea of putting the e-ticketing is to allow the buses to save 30 percent of their 
<br/>income that used to be leakage and use this for re-fleeting of the buses in Fiji.  The Government also 
<br/>is trying to help bus companies introduce fuel rebates and reduction in duty.  All of these, trying to 
<br/>encourage bus companies to get new buses.  The whole idea of buses running on our roads, need to 
<br/>be in good condition so we can maintain the safety of the people who travel in these buses all over 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second major criteria that I think is an issue here is driving skills and driving standards.  
<br/>As I have said in the past, most of the fatalities are because of overspeeding and it seems we have 
<br/>put in some good measures.  We have got the defensive driving training programme.  You can get 
<br/>training, you can get certification, but it seems this is not working so well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last major accident that we had at Lomawai, I attended the funeral and 
<br/>some of the people  working  in  the industry were saying  that the bus was travelling  at  around 90 
<br/>kilometres per hour when public service vehicles are supposed to be travelling at 60 kilometres per 
<br/>hour.  So that is one issue, driver standards and how they drive and how they do their business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third might be the road conditions, there is a bumper sticker going around - as you see me 
<br/>weaving, do not think I am drunk, no I am just avoiding the potholes.  The current Minister and I 
<br/>know that it is not easy to address potholes, but it is now his responsibility to be able to fix those 
<br/>potholes.  They can be a major consideration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things that we need to do well is the road safety audits.  We know where the 
<br/>black spots are, these black spots need to be audited, to see what can be done to fix those areas so 
<br/>that accidents can be reduced.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just have a number of suggestions.  I will not talk about policing, that was discussed at length 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>last night, but I think I still have a number of suggestions that we should consider.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, is to strengthen the quality assurance of buses, especially the old ones.  The new ones 
<br/>are much better. How can we strengthen that quality assurance with the system that we currently 
<br/></span><span>have?  Sometimes when you have a very old bus and when they come for fitness, they take out the 
<br/></span><span>old tyres and all the old stuff and they put on the new stuff.  It goes in for fitness, comes back and 
<br/>maybe they take out the new tyres and fit the old things back on.  How do we control that much 
<br/>better?  We have systems and processes in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are very good with your body language, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is just the </span><span>meke,</span><span> Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And how also can we introduce this quality assurance mechanisms in other forms of public 
<br/>transport - carriers, taxis, rental cars so we can assure the public that when you travel in these public 
<br/>vessels that you are safe.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>camera,  strengthen  the  road  safety  audits  and  consider  whether  a  reallocation  of  roads  might  be 
<br/>necessary to address this crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should LTA release some power to other agencies …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have reached your end of time, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you for the opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the End of Week Statement 
<br/>which definitely is an issue. There is no doubt that maintaining the safety of all those on our roads is 
<br/>a critical concern, as I have already alluded to. Safety is everyone’s responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  to  put  things  in  perspective,  Fiji  has  a  population  of  over  900,000  and  the  vehicle 
<br/>population is 144,000 with more than 14,000 PSV registered vehicles, and public transport make up 
<br/>99.83  percent.  There  are  more  than  320,000  registered  drivers,  with  9  classifications  of  driver 
<br/>licensing categories. Of these 320,000, approximately 50,000 are registered PSV drivers, including 
<br/>taxis, carriers, mini-buses and omni-buses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are only 95 enforcement officers in LTA nationwide that assist the Police. Let me repeat 
<br/>that, there are only 95 enforcement officers and the Coalition Government understands this, and we 
<br/>have  been  working  to  address  this  in  the  financial  year.  Land  Transport  Authority  is  working  to 
<br/>recruit more officers.  Unfortunately, in the last Government, 104 positions and 33 of which were for 
<br/>public  transport  officers,  and  enforcement  officers  were  shelved  by  LTA.  We  are  working  on 
<br/>rebuilding this as a priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to road safety and the LTA and police working together, we can only do so much 
<br/>and the onus is on the creation of a safety conscious environment. So if we look at the ratio, currently, 
<br/>it is one LTA enforcement officer to 3,400 drivers and 1,500 vehicles. Yes, there has been a spike in 
<br/>road deaths, and LTA is pleading with members of the public to slow down and adhere to road rules. 
<br/>That is just the simple message which LTA is emphasising now, and working with our stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Member  had  raised  speed  cameras  and  other  devices  to  assist  us.  We  are 
<br/>working  with  our  development  partners  right  now,  in  terms  of  having  speed  cameras  and  better 
<br/>equipment for LTA and our traffic officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst PSV represents a small fraction 
<br/>of the overall vehicle population, it is true that a lot of the accidents involve PSVs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing this is a critical component of what the LTA is doing now.  We have commenced 
<br/>rigorous,  for  example,  for  rentals,  some  of  these  vehicles  involved  in  accidents  have  written-off, 
<br/>rigorous  audits,  and we have audited 163 rental  companies out  of a total  of 412. The honourable 
<br/>Member had mentioned the Quality Assurance Systems (QAMs) and over the last four months, 18 
<br/>out of 61 bus companies underwent rigorous QAMs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the measures, which we are currently undertaking. I would like to also 
<br/>raise a few points regarding the freeze on the Public Service Vehicle permits, which we feel has led 
<br/></span><span>to sub-standard services given the rise of monopolistic behaviour. In terms of the sale of PSV permits, 
<br/></span><span>that is something also, which is an issue because the sale or the transfer of those permits have not 
<br/>undergone  the  rigorous  assessments  which  we  normally  do  for  those  who  are  applying  for  new 
<br/>permits. So, the reduction of the minimum age of PSV drivers, this was done, I think to curb the 
<br/>outward  movement  of  bus  drivers.    In  2017  again,  a  lot  of  those  who  have  been  involved  in  bus 
<br/>accidents have been our young bus drivers.  So, we are relooking at that criteria.

<div><span>The Coalition Government has started to address the above anomalies and we will continue 
<br/>to do so.  We are working closely in conjunction with other stakeholders including the police in terms 
<br/>of having  nationwide campaign throughout this holiday period which you will notice in  terms of 
<br/>addressing the situation as highlighted by honourable Usamate.  With those words, Sir, I note, and 
<br/>with these issues raised, we will be working rigorously on addressing those.

<div><span>Best Practices for Cattle Farming in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to present to this august Parliament my 
<br/>End of the Week Statement which will be focusing on Best Practices for Cattle Farming here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cattle is a source of high-quality protein, both from milk and meat. It is of very high demand 
<br/>here in Fiji, and also around the world. Even non-beef-consuming nations, like India are amongst the 
<br/>top producers vying for export markets, due to the increasing worldwide demand on cattle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cattle provides us with:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Beef and milk; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hides and Leather; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Bi-products (livestock feed and fertiliser); 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Employment and source of revenue; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Labour for control of weeds under tree cropping system; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Power for animal drawn implements; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Energy from methane digestion; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Meeting our traditional and religious obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, cattle farming in Fiji is widely believed to have been introduced by Christian 
<br/>missionaries  in  the  early  1830s.  Cattle  were  only  owned  by  early  missionaries  and  the  European 
<br/>estate owners, which at that time, were very limited to ownership of Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, cattle  farming then progressed from  estates, from  rearing under coconut 
<br/>plantations  to  bigger  private  farms.  Later,  it  expanded  to  other  geographical  locations,  especially 
<br/>Taveuni, Vanua Levu and Viti Levu. After a few decades, cattle farming expanded to other farming 
<br/>communities  in  the  sugarcane,  copra  and  rice  plantations,  where  sufficient  grazing  land  were 
<br/>available, especially in rural settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Records  show  that,  we  at  one  time  exported  processed  beef  and  milk  products  to  Samoa, 
<br/>Tonga and New Zealand. Fiji had also in the past, exported live cattle to other Pacific countries. By 
<br/>the 1930s, a notable American had a 100,000 acres ranch operating in Tova in the Ra Province which 
<br/>maintained 31,478 heads of cattle. This was considered the biggest cattle farm at that time.  However, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, Fiji is still heavily reliant on imported dairy products and beef prime cuts to 
<br/>meet our local demand and the tourist market. In 2022, Fiji imported $29.9 million worth of beef and 
<br/>$16.3 million worth of milk which signifies greater local demand and opportunities to invest in the 
<br/>cattle industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also address the concern raised by honourable Sachida Nand in 
<br/>his response to the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways’ Ministerial Statement on 
<br/>Wednesday with regards to milk production in Fiji.  I confirm that Fiji’s total milk production in 
<br/>2022 was around 12 million litres.  Of these, 6.07 million litres of milk was produced for the Fiji 
<br/>Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL), which accounts for the formal market and around 6 
<br/>million  litres  of  milk  was  produced  by  the  informal  sector,  those  that  did  not  go  through  the 
<br/>processing facility in Nabua. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2333 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, cattle production had been limited by a number factors, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Lack of available improved cattle breeds; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Animal health issues; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Poor plant and animal nutrition; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Changing climatic condition; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Reducing grazing land areas; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>High input costs; and  
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Global requirement and policies, for example, a reduction in methane emission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Efforts  to  increase  the  productivity  of  the  Fijian  cattle  industry  such  as  importing  and 
<br/>distributing breeding stock to farmers had been in place with the Ministry for a few decades.  The 
<br/>success of these strategies is, however, low as evidenced by the persisting low off-take and market 
<br/>gap.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering  the  status  of  cattle  genetics  in  Fiji,  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  improving 
<br/>genetics through embryo transfer technology and artificial insemination.  Therefore, Fiji envisions 
<br/>producing its own semen straws and embryos from Sigatoka Research Station, which will support 
<br/>the mass dissemination of improved genetics.  This ensures the supply of quality breeding cattle for 
<br/>farms,  for  the  improvement  of  genetics  which  will  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  quality  and 
<br/>increase the volume of beef and dairy in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  address  the  losses  through  diseases  such  as  bovine  tuberculosis  and 
<br/>brucellosis,  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  its  national  testing  and  removal  of  infected  cattle  from 
<br/>farms.  This is a government funded project that will be coordinated with other stakeholders.  Poor 
<br/>plant and animal nutrition affects animal production by reducing productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government,  through  its  farmers  support  programmes,  will  pay  more  emphasis  in 
<br/>improving animal nutrition.  The Ministry had identified a land for the production of planting material 
<br/>that will provide planting  material  for  farmers.   The unavailability of land had been identified as 
<br/>another  major  livestock  restriction.    The  competition  for  land  amongst  other  infrastructural 
<br/>development,  alongside  population  pressure  puts  the  limiting  cap  on  expanding  the  livestock 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, high input cost and reducing land area of production had been addressed 
<br/>through the Government support on funded programmes to improve infrastructure, construction of 
<br/></span><span>farm roads, provision of drinking water and introduction of technologies that will help assist improve 
<br/></span><span>animal production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  is  committed  through  its  programmes,  will  address  methane  emission 
<br/>through  appropriate  technologies  of  methane  digestion  for  home  use  and  for  soil  improvement 
<br/>purposes.  Research and development will continue in terms of alternative livestock feed sources that 
<br/>will yield with the reduced of methane emission rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry prioritises the importance of animal  welfare  and, therefore, 
<br/></span><span>always promote good husbandry management practices.  The best practices includes selection of best 
<br/></span><span>breeds with sound breeding plans, maintain healthy stock in good stockmanship, proper fencing and 
<br/>drinking  practices,  maintaining  good  grazing  system  with  stock  proof  fences,  sustainable  and 
<br/>management practices and proper land care, maintenance and management of farm infrastructure, 
<br/>maintain proper hygiene practices and good waste management system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said the above, farmers are required to be in close contact with the

<div><span>livestock officers.  Capacity building  will be conducted  regularly,  and farm  visit  will  be done by 
<br/>livestock officers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to support the livestock industry in 
<br/>Fiji as it plays a significant role with developing the other agriculture sector and it is contributing to 
<br/>the national economy.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importance of Protecting our Borders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a statement on 
<br/>the importance of protecting our borders and the adherence to the rule of law.  At the outset, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all Fijians for their confidence in the Coalition administration and their 
<br/>dedication to advancing and maintaining Fiji’s transformation into a more secure, tranquil country 
<br/>that maintain strict adherence to the law and its security measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  protecting  our  boarders  from  the  illicit  movement  of  weapons,  drugs, 
<br/>contraband and people while promoting lawful entry and exit and lawful trade is essential to Fiji’s 
<br/>security, economic prosperity and national  sovereignty.  The problem of protecting our country’s 
<br/>borders is without question one of the most highly debated issues we face today in the rise of trans- 
<br/>-national  boarder  crimes.    The  complexity  of  protecting  our  boarders  while  not  infringing  on 
<br/>individual  rights  or  negatively  impacting  global  trade  should  not  be  underestimated.    Of  equal 
<br/>importance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  our  ability  to  move  quickly,  to  reinforce  the  current  security 
<br/>measures with enhanced measures properly supported by our regulations and our policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the attacks on the twin towers in New York the emphasis of boarder 
<br/>security has been put on an access control and identification. Positive identification is more critical 
<br/>now than ever before.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Immigration Officers must stay up to date with changes 
<br/>in policy, legislation, internal procedures and ICT systems such as integrated boarder management 
<br/>system as well as the shifting migration trends in the region.  Immigration plays a critical role in 
<br/>travel  facilitation, border protection  and revenue  generation  for the nation. Thus, training plays a 
<br/>crucial role in the immigration offices.  As a result, the Department is working hard to strengthen the 
<br/>capacity building for developing policies and laws including areas that the capacity needs assessment 
<br/>highlighted and analysis in reporting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, securing our boarders is imperative and this must be done without disrupting 
<br/>the movement of people and goods. The fundamental change to the approach that the Fiji Immigration 
<br/>Department  has  taken  is  a  model  based  on  information,  intelligence  and  integration  which  will 
<br/>address the issue of border security far more holistically than ever before. This has been achievable 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the help and coordination from our neighbours namely Australia through 
<br/></span><span>the </span><span>Vuvale </span><span>Partnership and New Zealand through the </span><span>Hakil Matai Accord</span><span> and also through the United 
<br/>Nations International Organisation of Migration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving and modernising Fiji’s boarders is a top priority and in light of 
<br/>the  lesson  learned  from  the  Coronavirus  pandemic  and  the  emerging  </span><span>Variola</span><span>  virus  there  is  an 
<br/>immediate  need  for  a  more  efficient  and  well-coordinated  border  approach  management.    Since 
<br/>health  risk  has  virtually  replaced  border  risk,  it  will  be  considered  for  any  border  upgrades.  We 
<br/>recognise the significance of striking a balance between boarder security and facilitation to promote 
<br/></span><span>our  industry  such  as  tourism.    A  strategy  has  already  been  put  in  place  to  improve  the  border  to 
<br/></span><span>efficiently  facilitate  passenger  flow  and  guarantee  smooth  travel  for  every  individual  visiting  our 
<br/>shores. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  at  present  Fiji  Immigration  Department  is  facing  a  surge  in  the  number  of 
<br/>applications of investor permits due to the frequent renewals by major holding corporations and the 
<br/>influx of new interested investors who have showed interest in investing in Fiji. This is because Fiji’s

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current legal work framework Mr. Speaker, the Investment Fiji Act 2022 protects investors rights 
<br/>and interests as they do business within the country.  Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, in light of this, some 
<br/>investment firms have abused these rights and privileges and have a tendency to find ways around 
<br/>the law that are already in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I wish make it clear that Fiji’s doors are open to all who 
<br/>wish to visit or intend to invest in Fiji but make no mistake, when they come to Fiji they must follow 
<br/>our laws and the Fiji Immigration Department and all law enforcement agencies will stay vigilant to 
<br/>protect our borders but most importantly, the adherence to the rule of law of our country and a good 
<br/>example of this Mr. Speaker, is the Grace Road Group in Fiji and to enlighten honourable Ketan Lal, 
<br/>this is the adherence of the rule of law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will not be tolerating criminals in our country or harbouring them in our country. On that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>latter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to inform this august House  about … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Police brutality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU. R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- … Fiji’s stance for digitization solution based on 
<br/>trends and emerging security threats, identified from the increasing influx of people into the country 
<br/>as in transnational border activities are now centred in Fiji which has become the hub of the region. 
<br/>Therefore, enhancements to improve early detection work at the borders will focus on technology 
<br/>innovation and digitization to allow better co-ordination between our border agencies, including the 
<br/>Police and the Ministry of Health and with prompt assistance from our partners, Fiji Immigration 
<br/>Department will undoubtedly modernize Fiji’s border. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding our global responsibilities Fiji has succeeded to our international treaties and this 
<br/>is reflected in the Immigration Act 2003, in particular the enhancement of Part 6, determination of 
<br/>refugee status and the Immigration Regulation 2007 which together Mr. Speaker, established a clear 
<br/>legal framework to assess claims of asylum. The department works hard to complete its standard 
<br/>operating procedure in order to support and maintain a balance between available resources, security 
<br/>and facilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  circumstances  Mr. Speaker, of the standing operating procedure determine how we 
<br/>handle mass migrations and displacements like those of refugees and asylum seekers.  To be able to 
<br/>map  our  responses  we  must  assess  the  quality  of  the  data,  create  an  insightful  analysis  and 
<br/>comprehend the changing migratory trends.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a budget of $8.6 million in the 2023/2024 fiscal year, Fiji Immigration 
<br/>Department is mindful of the mammoth task that it bears and wishes to inform the House that our 
<br/>borders are very important and more so the adherence of the rule of law and needs the support of this 
<br/>august  Parliament.    In  addition,  Fiji  Immigration  Department  is  committed  to  working  with 
<br/>businesses and investor to ensure we are striking the right balance between security and facilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the dedication and commitment 
<br/>of the hardworking men and women of the Fiji Immigration Department who are here with us this 
<br/></span><span>afternoon and law enforcement agencies who also play a major role in the protection of our borders 
<br/></span><span>and wish them well as they continue to deliver in the midst of high demand for immigration and 
<br/>border services domestically and globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, you may have been wondering why I did not offer 
<br/>the floor to the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  He did highlight in his Statement yesterday that 
<br/>his Assistant Minister would be delivering in the End of Week Statement issues regarding their  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>2336 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular field in terms of cattle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two honourable Members are well known and are popular in the Pacific as they have 
<br/>indicated.   Cattle has been traded from Fiji everywhere, sheep, goats, they even bring bulls from 
<br/>Australia to here. So that is why I did not give the opportunity for the honourable Minister to reply 
<br/>or make a response to the Statement made by his Assistant Minister.  Both are highly qualified in the 
<br/>field of agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for this one, let me put it this way.  The End of the Week Statement is usually given to the 
<br/>Opposition but the past government changed all that and they were even making End of the Week 
<br/>Statements as well. So, this is another avenue available to the Opposition to be providing that. But to 
<br/>go that way again, I leave that to the government of the day to decide whether they allow to use that 
<br/>opportunity for the Opposition only or is it to be continued as done by the previous government.  But 
<br/>for the reply or the response, it is up the honourable Minister for Home Affairs whether he wants to 
<br/>make a response to his Assistant Minister’s End of the Week Statement or not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, you never refuse a good offer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-    First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Minister in my Office, Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure for the sentiments that he has echoed on the subject 
<br/>on which he has already spoken on the End of the Week Statement on the Rule of Law particularly 
<br/>protecting our borders.  I also would like to acknowledge the presence of members of the Department 
<br/>that are here and I thank them for the work that they do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Immigration interchange of portfolios of this Government has now come 
<br/>under  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  as  you  know,  Sir.  It  is  the  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration, 
<br/>something that was either independent or under the portfolio of another Minister in the past.  We 
<br/>cannot emphasise any more the importance and the criticalness of the work that the Department does, 
<br/>and that is keeping our borders safe particularly controlling the people that we allow into Fiji and 
<br/>also controlling the people that get out of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, they provide an essential part of our development through the issuing of work permit 
<br/>and passports and all other services related to that but it has not been easy, Mr. Speaker.  This year 
<br/>the Department of Immigration is moving into our new headquarters here in Suva.  We also need to 
<br/></span><span>look at other facilities that are available particularly in the West in terms of those officers too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An issue that came up with the National Security Council Meeting is actually the functions 
<br/>of immigration at the border. I know that the honourable Naupoto when he was Director and Member 
<br/>of Parliament later on had argued many cases about this where Customs under FRCS performed the 
<br/>functions of an Immigration Officer. This has its benefits as well as  risks. This is something that 
<br/>Government is reconsidering, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole intention is actually to strengthen the capability of the Department in order to keep 
<br/></span><span>our borders safe particularly when they man our gates when people come into Fiji and otherwise.  I 
<br/></span><span>also take this opportunity for all the other departments that perform the functions of the Immigration 
<br/>Officers in the Navy and in the Police at times when it is required. From where you are sitting, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, you will see that majority of the people who work in the Immigration Office are actually 
<br/>youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we do take cognizance of the fact that the youth are important to our development but I
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adjournment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would just like to say perhaps (I see the honourable Ketan Lal is laughing), this is not against you 
<br/>but I think the youth have actually lost faith in FijiFirst, honourable Ketan Lal, because you did not 
<br/>support the reduction of travel allowances earlier on.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot re-emphasize further the 
<br/>safety of border, we talked about drugs earlier on and keeping Fiji safe and keeping Fijians safe is 
<br/>the function of our Office particularly the Office of the Immigration to make sure that only good 
<br/>people  come  here  and  to  keep  away  those  who  are  not  supposed  to  come  here  and  threaten  our 
<br/>livelihood.
