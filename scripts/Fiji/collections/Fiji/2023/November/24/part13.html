<div><span>Forum Fisheries Committee Members – Distribution of Funds  
<br/>(Question No. 195/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry  inform  Parliament  if  the 
<br/>distribution  of  the  US$60  million  among  Forum  Fisheries  Committee  members  has  been 
<br/>agreed upon?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. For 
<br/>better understanding of the question, please, allow me to provide some background information on 
<br/>the Foreign Fisheries Committee setup at the US Treaty Agreement for which the $60 million funding 
<br/>is attached to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- $60 million?  I think he is getting there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Carry on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Fiji along with the 16 Pacific Island nations is a member of the Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is in charge of fisheries.  They bait the thing, and then they throw it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right out and then they pull it in slowly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Yes,  Sir.    I  want  you  to  understand  where  it  comes  from  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>utilisation of this $60 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I am still talking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Alright, you may continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  The  Forum  Fisheries  Committee  (FFC)  Ministerial  is  the  decision-
<br/>making body for the membership, and that being the governing body of the FFA.  The FFC Official 
<br/></span><span>meeting ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Standing Order 60 on relevance.  The question is ….

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2307 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  When there is a Point of Order, honourable Minister, you take your seat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we will listen to the Order being raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Standing Order 60 on relevance, the question is very simple.  All we 
<br/>want to know, what is the distribution of the US$60 million.  We do not want to hear the big story 
<br/>about these agencies, we know what it is.  Just answer the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  thought  I  added  my  statement  on  how  the 
<br/>honourable Minister looks at answering his questions, because by profession he is a fisherman.  They 
<br/>just do not go and bait the hook and throw it in the water and pull the fish out.  They will have to 
<br/>drag it for quite some distance.  But I hope, you will not be dragging it too long; that is the concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC) Ministerial is 
<br/>the decision-making body for the membership, and that being the governing body of the FFA.  The 
<br/>FFC official meeting is where the senior officials discuss the technical matters which are then referred 
<br/>to the FFC Ministers for a decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  is  the  purpose  of  the  US  Treaty  Agreement?  Whilst  this  Treaty  acknowledges  the 
<br/>sovereignty of the coastal states under international law for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, 
<br/>conserving and managing fisheries resources in their EEZs.  This Treaty pursues the maximisation 
<br/>of  benefits  to  coastal  states,  via  the  provision  of  fishing  access  to  the  United  States  purse  seiner 
<br/>vessels  to  waters  under  the  Pacific  Island  nations  jurisdiction  and  areas  beyond  their  national 
<br/>jurisdictions, and therein provides a platform of corporation between the parties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this point, I would like to make mention that Fiji was Chair to the FFC 
<br/>during 2021-2022.  I, therefore, pay tribute to my predecessor, honourable Koroilavesau who was 
<br/>the  FFC  Chairman  for  the  period  for  his  stern  and  visionary  leadership  in  the  FFC  Ministers 
<br/>negotiation process along with other Fisheries Ministers in the Pacific.  Their collective effort saw 
<br/>the tripling of the USD funds from US$21 million to US$60 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the 20</span><span>th</span><span> FFC Ministerial Meeting in the Republic of the  Marshall 
<br/>Islands early this year, the issue of distribution of the US$60 million funding was not resolved.  Two 
<br/></span><span>special  FFC  meetings  were  called  by  FFA,  here  in  Fiji  and  Papua  New  Guinea  in  August  and 
<br/></span><span>September  2023  respectively.    In  the  spirit  of  regional  solidarity,  the  Pacific  Fisheries  Ministers 
<br/>finally resolved the USD funding distribution in October after the PNG meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The distribution have given recognition to all issues that were debated on  - fishing access 
<br/>agreement  versus  geopolitical  positioning,  financial  risks  and  burdens  carried  out  by  the  Pacific 
<br/>nations under the Vessel Day Scheme/PNA Pool, even to the extent  of Australia and Papua New 
<br/>Guinea giving their full shares to the five Pacific nations under the Exploratory Pool (Fiji, Tonga, 
<br/>Samoa, Niue and Vanuatu) to close up the great disparity in the distribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three categories for the distribution formula: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Payment for upfront days - this is determined by the members who have US vessels fishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in their waters; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Project Development  Fund  - this is  given to  each  member to supplement their national 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget provisions to fund fisheries related projects; and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Equal Share - this is the portion of funds that is equally shared to all members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the formula above, the funds distributed this year is US$31 million 
<br/>(that  is  the  US$21  million  plus  US$10  million)  funds  for  climate  change,  $60  million  will  be 
<br/>distributed from 2024 to 2033. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the distribution  formula is  very technical  in  nature, it took the Fisheries 
<br/>Ministers four negotiation meetings to come to a solution. So, in the interest of time and with your 
<br/>concurrence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the detail can be provided at a later date, if still required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you  honourable  Minister  and  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  the 
<br/>honourable Rinesh Sharma, honourable Members it pays to be patient, especially with the Fisheries 
<br/>Minister.  Otherwise, we would not have heard that very positive compliment made to the former 
<br/>Minister, honourable Semi Koroilavesau for the great work he had undertaken.  So, thank you very 
<br/>much honourable Minister.  In future, can we ask that you just shorten your answers, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do agree with you, less of a reply and more of a 
<br/>Ministerial Statement.  Question to the honourable Minister for Fisheries in terms of ownership of 
<br/>marine commodity. Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries inform Parliament and the people of 
<br/>this country, can a Minister be the owner of a company that deals with the buying and selling of 
<br/>beche-de-mer and is this legal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, I will allow that supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question and I cannot answer it now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You heard me saying, I will allow that question to be raised with you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  So  you  do  not  have  any  answer  to  that?    Will  you  be  coming  back  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament with a reply? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, what honourable Minister?  </span><span>Vakamacalataka nomui sau ni taro, o na 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lesu tale mai ke</span><span>? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question, I will come back at a later 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, it is not a new question, I have allowed it to proceed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- I will come back, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 196/2023 withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  want  to  make  a  comment,  this  is  the  second  time  you  have  done  this 
<br/>honourable Assistant Minister, on just the approach you have taken as the Assistant Minister and

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then the kind of questions you are raising here, to ensure that we are consistent in the role we play 
<br/>and who is the leader of your side of the Government and what he plays and where do we take our 
<br/>queue from.  I hope it could be a learning item for you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trafficking and Usage of Hard Drugs in Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 197/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  the  major  increase  in  the  trafficking  and  use  of  hard  drugs  in  Fiji  in  recent 
<br/>months, can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament 
<br/>what steps the Government is taking to address this issue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>Fiji is encountering a serious drug problem. This has not only evolved over the last month perhaps 
<br/>as the question seems to suggest, it has come like for a very long time now. I just want to share some 
<br/>statistics  with  Parliament,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  highlight  for  us  the  significance  of  this  issue  and  the 
<br/>problem that it is causing our society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not something that we must deny because this is in the midst of our community and 
<br/>the responsibility here is national, Mr. Speaker. The Coalition Government will do their bit under 
<br/>what is allowed but we must take cognizance of this as a nation and work together in all facets of 
<br/>society and I think that has been the sentiments echoed throughout in terms of addressing this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, over the past 12 months, Mr. Speaker, police have recorded a total of 1,564 drug-related 
<br/>cases, averaging 130 cases per month. Within this total, 128 cases involving methamphetamine, 1 
<br/>case involving cocaine, 141 were related to </span><span>marijuana</span><span> cultivation and the majority of 1,294 cases 
<br/>involving the unlawful possession of </span><span>marijuana</span><span>.  This is very unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, because it is 
<br/>a reflection of our society and what we do, and as I have said, this is something that has been ongoing 
<br/>and this is a familiar issue from this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  been  talking  about  this  forever  which  requires  a  dedicated  effort  and  a  national 
<br/>solution but as on the part of government, Mr. Speaker, we have ratified the Single Convention on 
<br/>Narcotic Drugs of 1961, in 1971 the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic 
<br/>Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and this demonstrates our national commitment to dealing with 
<br/>the drug issues under national arrangement or international arrangement.  As far as the government 
<br/></span><span>is concerned and for our perspective because this is not only police work, we only do a very small 
<br/></span><span>part of it in terms of prevention and also prosecution and investigation, that is part of our work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So we deal with the community in every facet, we talk to faith-based organisations, to the 
<br/></span><span>vanua</span><span>,  to  communities,  to  schools  which  are  presently  under  threat  and  through  the  Fiji  Police  -  
<br/>Narcotics Bureau talking to our community about the effects of drugs and what it does to us, and the 
<br/>police through its operations are just trying very hard to control this.  We all understand in the past 
<br/>about police going out, up-rooting </span><span>marijuana </span><span>plants, raiding places where drug has been trafficked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we are also partnering with major nations of the world to try and look after this, so we 
<br/></span><span>have signed an agreement with the United States Narcotics Bureau in terms of the provision of funds, 
<br/>perhaps similar to what the US is giving to the region.  We signed this agreement about two months 
<br/>ago  here.  Fiji  will  benefit  from  this  in  terms  of  intelligence  gathering,  collation  of  intelligence, 
<br/>receiving of funds particularly for prevention and also in other areas where Fiji could benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this is not something that we are doing alone. We are working with stakeholders and our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partners because this is something that affects everyone, not only Fiji but Fiji, in our position, is the 
<br/>centre in which people try to push drugs.  This is something that we have been trying to do for a very 
<br/>long time, not only this Government over the last nine months, but previously everyone has been 
<br/>trying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But what I am trying to say here, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to maybe suggest this again, I 
<br/>had  raised  this  in  2019  in  this  House,  this  problem  needs  a  national  solution  that  starts  with  this 
<br/>House.    I  will  raise  it  again  because  this  is  what  we  have  been  raising  with  Government  as  the 
<br/>Opposition for a very, very long time.  Now we have the political will to do it, we want to do it and 
<br/>we would like to bring the House together for something that should benefit our community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not denying this at all because it is a reality on the ground that needs to be done, but we 
<br/>need to do it together because not Government alone or the Police can do it, we all have to do it as a 
<br/>nation.  We need to look after our children.  This has been ongoing for a long, long time, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>To deny it means the diminishing of our values. This is something that this House must take into 
<br/>cognisance together and work together and get a solution so that is perhaps the challenge that I am 
<br/>putting to the House today whilst we ask ourselves, we should be part of the solution too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I wanted to ask the 
<br/>honourable Minister, are we at a national crisis point or bordering or nearing a national crisis point 
<br/>on this issue?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  as  far  as  I  am  concerned  we  reached  a 
<br/>national crisis in 2019. I raised it here on the day and my good friend the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition understood this.  I raised it in this House. I sought a bilateral solution. Drugs, I said is 
<br/>overwhelming in this country, it is well before. Only the tip of the iceberg is becoming bigger and 
<br/>bigger. In this very House, I understood when we did this debate and my good friend understood this.  
<br/>He gave a solution in terms of using manoeuvre warfare theory and I said in Parliament, the problem 
<br/>is no longer in the deep battle, it is not even in the close, it is in our rear, I used it here, but this House 
<br/>did not have the motivation, the courage to deal with this. So, in answer to the honourable Member’s 
<br/>question, it culminated a long time ago. We are only feeling the effects now. I am not denying it has 
<br/>happened during my term but what I am saying, this is the overload of what we are getting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  I  am  no  trying  to  point  a  finger  at  anyone,  I  am  just  trying  to  share  the  reality  with 
<br/>everyone and I am warning that problem and I am asking the House, let us rise up to this.  I am going 
<br/>to propose to Cabinet that it moves into Parliament in the next sitting a bilateral Committee of this 
<br/></span><span>House that deals with this and cause the resource in the Budget to deal with it because otherwise, our 
<br/></span><span>children, we do not know what is going to become of them.  That is the point I am trying to say, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, but this has been long coming, it is not culminated now.  It is a crisis on our hands, and we 
<br/>need a solution beginning with this House.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Before I offer the floor to honourable Naupoto, may I just add a few lines 
<br/>here regarding the problem that has been described.  We have these kinds of drugs in my province.  
<br/>It is not the </span><span>marijuana </span><span>that we are talking about, no these are the hard drugs.  We even have it in my 
<br/>village in Somosomo and honourable Members, the honourable Minister had raised this way back in 
<br/></span><span>2019.  What have we done to try and ensure that we take care to eradicate this?  It would be difficult 
<br/></span><span>to eradicate it, maybe to try and alleviate it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  why  I was describing it last night on the way  forward for parliamentarians if it is 
<br/>possible because we had just discussed it this morning with the Executive of the Legislature as to 
<br/>how best we can continue and not wait for the trip to Australia to have a look see at what they are 
<br/>doing to enhance the role of Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2311 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Instead  of  just  looking  at  the  annual  reports  that  was  attacked  very  strongly  by  their 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  yesterday,  what  can  we  do?    Parliament  is  already 
<br/>looking at this.  Standing Order 110 allows sub-committees of the Standing Committees to be formed, 
<br/>but it is the terms of reference that is given and all that, that will need to come from the support of 
<br/>the Government and through the Business Committee, we will try and raise that and hopefully we 
<br/>can sit in between now and the recess period so as to enable us to prepare ourselves on this particular 
<br/>role that we need to play. This would be an additional role of MPs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the roles that they are undertaking in Australia and New Zealand.  They have an 
<br/>oversight role into the policies.  To look into the government policies is not easy because you are 
<br/>kind of unruffling feathers here, you are interfering with government work but hopefully if it is all 
<br/>taken in a good sense, yes, we will be answering the honourable Minister for Home Affairs’ problem 
<br/>on what are we doing.  I am concerned with that comment because so far I have also been raising 
<br/>this, but this morning, we have decided to go ahead, get the Standing Orders Committee and see how 
<br/>best we can address this whilst garnishing the support of the government of the day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Naupoto, you have a supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is more operational or technical.  It has 
<br/>to do with Vanua Levu, especially Taveuni, Sir, with regards to drug trafficking.  The Committee 
<br/>visited Vanua Levu and Taveuni and we were briefed that the drug problem is really increasing.  As 
<br/>we were sitting at Matei Airport (you see people going out of Matei and people coming in) there is a 
<br/>dog kennel, but you have two tracker dogs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taveuni offers that very weak link in terms of trafficking when it comes to the airport because 
<br/>when you come in, if you are moving from Taveuni to Suva, your luggage is not screened.  There is 
<br/>no sniffer dog, you just come in, they take it and put it into the carousel and then it goes into the 
<br/>aircraft, and from Nausori that bag is from the aircraft straight to the baggage carousel outside.  So 
<br/>if someone is wanting to traffic, you can fly in from Suva, pick up a bag in Taveuni, there are a lot 
<br/>of yachts that come to Taveuni, pick it over there, it would not be checked at the airport, you will 
<br/>arrive in Nausori and it would not be checked again because it goes straight to the carousel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Taveuni, you have those two tracker dogs, maybe an idea if you would consider having a 
<br/>sniffer dog instead of two tracker dogs that can work at the airport. In Labasa, Sir, we were told by 
<br/>the Police that there used to be a Canine Unit there, no longer now and perhaps for Labasa Airport 
<br/>the same.  Maybe a comment as to whether you would consider a sniffer dog instead of the tracker 
<br/></span><span>dog. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  
<br/>Canine capability is actually quite good, a very effective way not only to track down but also to sniff 
<br/>out drugs. Given this suggestion, I am going to raise this with the Commissioner of Police in terms 
<br/>of how they redeploy these assets. We have very limited dogs, we have got some new dogs, both 
<br/>sniffers and also trackers - if they could take this matter into account and then maybe send one extra 
<br/>sniffer dog to Taveuni or Labasa also for that matter, I will look at that too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Supplementary question, Sir.  Thank you, honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>for your response and the explanation, I totally agree with you. It is big work there and a challenge 
<br/>for everyone in this House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the only concern I have is the use of our children for drug trafficking right now.  Going 
<br/>back to a report that came in some months ago, it is happening in schools, it is happening everywhere.  
<br/>While waiting for all these committees and whatever the next process that we are going to take to try 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and curb this problem, do we have measures in place right now to look after our children from being 
<br/>used as drug traffickers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  
<br/>This is something that the Ministry of Education is working very hard at with the Police in particular, 
<br/>and also Social Welfare to deal with that.  But I think at the end of the day, this really goes back to 
<br/>parenting and I cannot deny that anymore.  I allude to the same things that I had raised earlier, the 
<br/>whole of our society needs to help parents look after their children.  These children do come from 
<br/>home, at some point they pick up these things and then they take them to school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Education  will  do  their  bit  and  also  through  Social  Welfare,  we  are  also 
<br/>looking at strengthening the laws to be able to look at that.  Our schools are pretty much free for our 
<br/>children - a free environment for education.  We do not want to do in our schools what they do in 
<br/>America or in other nations to try and control drugs especially in public schools but I think it calls at 
<br/>the end of the day all of our responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  that  note,  I  would  just  like  to  share  with  Parliament  some  of  my 
<br/>observations.  I am sure for all of us that were, particularly the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and I am sure also our Indo-
<br/>Fijian brothers and sisters also experience this, when we were raised in a village environment, not 
<br/>only  were our parents  responsible for our upbringing  but  everyone else  was concerned  about  our 
<br/>upbringing - </span><span>tamada levu, nana levu</span><span>, uncle or our grandparents also </span><span>vata kei na </span><span>lotu; they played a 
<br/>big part in trying to build our character.  It is very unfortunate that has now gone.  Actually, it is 
<br/>really, really sad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is dwelling into other areas so when we have people who assist the parent to make the 
<br/>child become a better child, there is going to be less of this happening.  I mean I am just throwing 
<br/>that in again here because that is a very good point you raised there, honourable Member, but then it 
<br/>goes back to the same old thing which I can only think of one solution, and it needs to start from 
<br/>here.  If we set the policies, Parliament work with government, get out the resources, get out there 
<br/>and reach out to the community, come up with the right solutions as I have said, this has culminated 
<br/>a long time. We have to do something now.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  will  allow  two  more  supplementary  questions.    The  first  one  is  from 
<br/>honourable  Matasawalevu  before  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  and  then  honourable 
<br/>Niudamu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.R.  MATASAWALEVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for his statement on drugs. It is not only the </span><span>marijuana</span><span> that is here in Fiji, we have different 
<br/>types of drugs now in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, does the Force know about cybercrime or cybersecurity because most of the 
<br/>drugs coming to our shores now is from the use of apps when dealing with drugs with people from 
<br/>overseas. They are using </span><span>WhatsApp</span><span> now but </span><span>Viber</span><span> before. They are now using different types of 
<br/>apps,  like  video  games  when  talking  and  dealing  with  drugs.    Has  the  Force  learnt  more  about 
<br/>cybercrime or cybersecurity to track down drugs coming to our shores? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>Absolutely.   We are building capacity and cybercrime is probably one of our biggest threats.  I was 
<br/>with the NYPD a couple of months ago and we talked about the complexities of how they get drugs 
<br/>from South America through Fiji because the electromagnetic spectrum is so big and wide. They use 
<br/>the internet and every other means of communication through satellite, well beyond our capacity to 
<br/>be able to even monitor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2313 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  only  have  so  many  patrol  boats,  we  share  intelligence  with  DEA,  Interpol  and  other 
<br/>agencies of security throughout the world, even through ustate.com, et cetera.  We try to track drugs 
<br/>down and we are dealing with people who have a lot of money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Police, unfortunately, right now, Mr. Speaker, needs the capacity to be able to fight that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anything on the electromagnetic spectrum is very hard to detect with the kind of resources that we 
<br/>have.  We need partners to do this. We have partners that are helping us right now to do that as well, 
<br/>but it is a major challenge, I understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  working  with  our  partners  trying  to  keep  our  border  safe.  I  mean,  we  are  an 
<br/>archipelagic state. Honourable Naupoto has just referred to a case from Taveuni. It comes from the 
<br/>Lau Group, then it comes all that way undetected to here, then it goes to New Zealand.  Sometimes 
<br/>we catch it, sometimes we do not, but many of the times we do not, but these are capacity building - 
<br/>we will build over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Government is talking to the Ministry of Home Affairs of Australia and of 
<br/>the United States of America, people who have the capacity to give us information and to build our 
<br/>cybersecurity to endure the current threats that are passing through it, that comes to affect our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, a very important issue and no one denies 
<br/>the seriousness of the drug problem in Fiji. But I am a bit reluctant on the national crisis term that we 
<br/>are using because of the implications as well to us, not that I am denying this, but how we define the 
<br/>national  crisis  and  how  it  is  going  to  affect  us  in  terms  of,  particularly,  people  coming  into  the 
<br/>country, tourism, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the critical point that I want to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because of the question raised 
<br/>by honourable Tuinaceva on children being used and how we are dealing with it.  If I may alert the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and the honourable Minister as well, one of the biggest delays in this 
<br/>whole  work  is  the  Juveniles  Act  because  they  are  being  used  as  mules  to  take  the  drugs  but  the 
<br/>Juveniles Act is where there is a lot of complications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would kindly ask the honourable Attorney-General if we could seriously look into this.  The 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister is, while we are doing a lot of work, he mentioned about the lack 
<br/>of capability that we have, how are we again pursing our efforts with our partners to make use of, 
<br/>particularly, the technology that they have because of the porous border, particularly the maritime 
<br/>border that we have and how are we utilising them throughout the machinery that we have just to 
<br/></span><span>help us?  How is it being pursued further because that will be of great assistance to us? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, from a ministerial perspective, I can share this 
<br/>with the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  He will understand during his time that we had built 
<br/>the  capacity  in  the  Ministry  to  be  able  to  coordinate  with,  particularly,  our  intelligence,  not  only 
<br/>through  defence,  but  also  in  law  enforcement.    They  have  these  people  who  are  stationed  in  our 
<br/>Embassies and High Commissions who help to do that - coordinate this assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  our  own  level,  we  talked  to  New  Zealand,  Australia  and  USA  -  the  government 
<br/></span><span>departments that help us to coordinate, particularly, information sharing.  This is one capacity that 
<br/></span><span>we are dealing with under this internal security review, to rebuild that centre.  I know you used it  
<br/>particularly a lot during your term, but it has been officially incapacitated in many ways, and I want 
<br/>to rebuild that.  You will understand what I am talking about here.  This is the centre where we share 
<br/>information with everyone else, and we are rebuilding that, we are inviting the French Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can say, we have got the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), DEA and international partners 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>2314 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that have capability.  We have been talking to the Australians, the Minister for Home Affairs at the 
<br/>Ministerial  level  and  at  every  level,  because  we  understand  the  magnitude  because  they  also 
<br/>understand that what is coming from here is going to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to assure the honourable Minister and thank you for raising the issue of juveniles.  
<br/>There  was  this  person  who  came  to  see  me  the  other  day  and  he  told  me,  “You  need  to  get  the 
<br/>Juveniles Act reviewed”, so I am actually on it because this is one neglected part of the work that 
<br/>Police really has to look at also - dealing with young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, if we can get our partners, we get them back into the room that we are familiar 
<br/>with, honourable Leader of the Opposition, I am sure there is a lot of coordination tying up we can 
<br/>do to seal the gaps that we have, particularly in dealing with drugs.  Not only drugs, but arms and all 
<br/>other contrabands that come through our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister in relation to hard drugs, particularly, methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine, including 
<br/>cocaine, to name a few, in addition to </span><span>marijuana</span><span>.  How safe are these drugs when kept at our Police 
<br/>Exhibit Rooms because we have seen in the past that it has gone missing from the Police Exhibit 
<br/>Rooms?  What is the Police doing about this issue, particularly, in the safe keeping of these drugs 
<br/>before it reaches the trial?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand that there are provisions in the Illicit Drugs Act where we can dispose of those 
<br/>drugs before the trials, but what about those accused persons who dispute the drugs and they are kept 
<br/>at the Police Exhibit Rooms, how safe are those? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know I had alluded to this earlier because this is talking about the handling of exhibits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, you are right.  Over the years, I think that has been the joke going around.  If you leave 
<br/>the  exhibits  around  for  too  long  unsecured,  it  is  not  going  to  be  there.  I  am  sure  the  former 
<br/>Commissioner of Police will attest to that.  It happened, it is not new.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the responsibility is here, and I have talked about these new police stations with better 
<br/>and  more  secure  drug  facilities.    That  is  where  we  are  going,  Mr.  Speaker.    Much  of  the  drugs, 
<br/>particularly hard drugs, we have counter safes. Within these big, controlled rooms, we have big safes 
<br/>also for things like methamphetamine and components of which that they use to make these drugs.  
<br/></span><span>If you go to Nadi, I can take the honourable Member for a tour, I can show you how we have brought 
<br/></span><span>all these exhibits where it is kept and then we can bring them to court when they are needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, Police are now talking to DPP, Judiciary, Office of the Solicitor-General and the 
<br/>Attorney-General on how we can review our laws, on how we can destroy the drugs on site and still 
<br/>being able to use the evidence as if the drugs were still there and were produced in court on the day. 
<br/>So, this is something we are working on too.  This is something that the Police are struggling with, 
<br/>particularly, if they go up to Saqani in Vanua Levu, particularly in Natewa, I understand.  It is very 
<br/>hard to carry them, this bulk of drugs from the bush.  So, somehow, they are trying to find the legal 
<br/></span><span>framework to destroy the evidence but to be able to continue to keep whatever it is.  I do not know 
<br/></span><span>what the legal term is.  We cannot say, “admissible in court”, so we are looking after that too.

<div><span>Empowerment of Co-operatives and Business Sustainability 
<br/>(Question No. 198/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2315 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on how the Ministry 
<br/>is empowering co-operatives and promoting business sustainability? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Vocea  for  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, may I be allowed to respond very politely to 
<br/>two issues that were raised yesterday in Parliament. The first one was to do with the regulation of 
<br/>mobile companies, and I did state that the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) actually regulates them.  So, I 
<br/>asked  for  a  confirmation  from  the  RBF  and  there  are  only  two  mobile  wallets  in  Fiji  operating 
<br/>currently, which is M-PAiSA and MyCash.  They are regulated under the National Payment System 
<br/>Act 2021 and the National Payment System Regulations 2022.  They were passed by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government in 2021 and the Regulations came into effect in 2022.  That is why Telecom is not under 
<br/>regulation because it does not have a mobile wallet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second issue that I just thought I would clarify, there is much talk about Fiji Water, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and I just thought to clarify once and for all in terms of Parliament.  We understand how 
<br/>this arrangement with Fiji Water came about.  Let me state categorically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics and I who were heavily involved, there is  zero loss of revenue to the 
<br/>Government of Fiji in terms of the arrangements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, whilst there is a tax-free arrangement, what has happened is, if you look at the actual Act, 
<br/>for suppliers that supply over 10 million litres per month, you have to pay a higher price at $19.05 
<br/>and that covers for the income tax.  In fact, it covers for more than just, it is about $2 million extra.  
<br/>I just thought, Sir, that I would clarify that to the Members of the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, on this side of Parliament are very careful with Government revenue.  It is an arrangement 
<br/>that has done some better things for Fiji Water in terms of its overall global business but in terms of 
<br/>Fiji, there is absolutely no loss of revenue in Fiji.  I just thought I would clarify that.  What it does 
<br/>do though, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, it creates a better working relationship with Fiji Water and, hopefully, 
<br/>we can collaborate in other areas of the economy going forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is quite an important one and I guess 
<br/>from this side of Parliament, the reason we placed a lot of importance on co-operatives, it is now part 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Ministry  officially  which  I  look  after.    Currently,  there  is  about  554  Co-operatives  in  Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>operating  across  15  various  sectors.    I  have  to  say  here,  Sir,  I  was  just  looking  at  some  of  the 
<br/>infographics, it covers the whole of Fiji.  That augurs well for what the Government will try and do, 
<br/>which is to try and push economic activity into the rural areas where most of these co-operatives are 
<br/>based. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of how we are going about trying to empower businesses, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 
<br/>various forms of assistance that we have developed over the years.  This include what we call as 
<br/>handholding services.  Our Ministry, in terms of setting up a co-operative, it takes time and then there 
<br/></span><span>is  a  need  for  a  lot  of  awareness  and  a  lot  of  handholding  with  those  who  are  interested  with  co-
<br/></span><span>operatives.  So, that is a major service and we have officers that cover Suva, Lami, Sigatoka and 
<br/>basically the whole of Fiji and their prime job is to try and drive for co-operatives to be formed and 
<br/>developed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, over the last 12 months, we have added about 76 new co-operatives, Sir, into the 
<br/>books.  I suspect that numbers will increase more rapidly.  The honourable Minister for Youth and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports who is not here is actually trying to encourage the youth clubs to form co-operatives, like a 
<br/>commercial arm, so I suspect that the number will increase which augurs well, again, for the way we 
<br/>are trying to drive the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of training the Ministry undertakes and this is financial training and governance training, 
<br/>bookkeeping as well to try and assist the co-operatives in starting up and moving forward.  We are 
<br/>trying to do the best we can in terms of both access to finance, that has always been a challenge with 
<br/>co-operatives or small businesses in general.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think one of the big solutions is something that the honourable Premila Kumar alluded to, 
<br/>which is the National ID card.  That is something that we will try and introduce next year as a project 
<br/>because if that comes through, it hastens all the  identification process,  et cetera.  Also,  access  to 
<br/>markets.  We are also, where we can, try and connect businesses to markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the things that we are currently involved in, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have pages 
<br/>and pages of notes here, but I just thought that I would highlight that.  We are very committed to 
<br/>developing  very  sustainable  co-operatives.    We  have  had  a  rich  history  of  co-operatives  in  this 
<br/>country, going a long way back, and I think in terms of how we intend to develop the rural economy, 
<br/>the  co-operatives  would  certainly  be  a  significant  vehicle  that  would  be  used  to  try  and  generate 
<br/>economic activity, particularly, in the rural setting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question.  Before that, I also 
<br/>would like to declare my interest under section 59 of the Standing Orders.  I am a farmer and president 
<br/>of the Riverside Farmers’ Co-operative in Ba - one of the biggest sugarcane farmers co-operative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  were  also  assisted  with  the  $90,000  grant  by  the  FijiFirst  Government  to  purchase 
<br/>harvesters, similar to all other co-operatives.  That is really assisting the farmers on flat land.  There 
<br/>is a provision whereby if we remove the two back tyres and if it is replaced by rubber tracks, then we 
<br/>can harvest on a slope of 30 degrees to 40 degrees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, is there are any sort of assistance, because the rubber tracks comes at a cost 
<br/>of about $40,000 to $50,000.  Is there any assistance from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister or 
<br/>in coordination with the Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Sugar?  If that assistance is given, it will 
<br/>further assist  in  regard to the shortages of labour and the harvesters can harvest  on a slope of 30 
<br/>degrees to 45 degrees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my suggestion would be to either channel 
<br/></span><span>that question directly through our Ministry and we can certainly pick that up. Generally some of the 
<br/>agricultural assistance is either done through us or done through the Ministry of Agriculture.  We 
<br/>normally then have a conversation as to who picks it up. Sir, I am quite happy to look at that and any 
<br/>other agricultural interest that are out there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress – Savusavu, Levuka and Nakasi Markets 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 199/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on  the  progress  of  the  Savusavu,  Levuka  and  Nakasi  Markets  that  were  initiated  by  the 
<br/>previous government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question posed  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2317 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before this august Parliament this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First,  let  me  thank  and  commend  the  initiatives  by  the  previous  government  for  the 
<br/>commencement of these three markets namely Savusavu, Levuka and Nakasi Markets.  However, it 
<br/>took  the  previous  government  eight  years  to  finally  construct  the  three  markets  apart  from  other 
<br/>markets that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government continues to prioritise the development 
<br/>and refurbishment of municipal markets.  It is worth nothing, the present Government has allocated 
<br/>funding  in  this  fiscal  year  (2023-2024)  to  excel  business  growth  in  the  marketplaces.    With  this 
<br/>funding, my Ministry and the respective Councils aim to complete the three most anticipated markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Coalition Government believes that for any infrastructure development 
<br/>in the municipalities, we will require feasibility studies and business cases to comprehend the need 
<br/>for any capital projects to be undertaken. This will ensure the upgrading or construction of municipal 
<br/>markets which will benefit the Councils and the market vendors in the long run and such feasibility 
<br/>studies are imperative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the projects will strengthen the revenue streams of the Councils which will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure their financial sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $6.3 million, to be exact $6,305, 664 in total has been allocated 
<br/>for  the  completion  of  the  three  markets.  The  Savusavu  Market  would  be  the  first  ever  market  to 
<br/>replicate the Bluetown Mall in Fiji.  This will not only benefit the farmers, but it will also benefit 
<br/>market  vendors,  tourists  and  the  public  at  large.    The  new  Savusavu  Market  is  co-funded  by  the 
<br/>Government and United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women which 
<br/>is UN Women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Savusavu  Market  has  been  allocated  a  sum  of  $3.8  million  in  this 
<br/>financial year which is for the completion of the market. The market will consist of 141 vendor stalls, 
<br/>some handicrafts kiosks, five SME kiosks which are located on the ground.  The top floor will have 
<br/>provisions for one conference and meeting room, one kitchen, washroom facility, if there are MSME 
<br/>vendors, stalls, three food outlets, open spaces for future demands with exotic balcony fronting sea-
<br/>view.  The total project cost is $3.63 million, out of which, $2.5 million has been paid to date or 35 
<br/>percent of the initial project cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded earlier, the project is co-funded by the Government and UN Women at a cost of 
<br/></span><span>$6.3 million and $340,000 respectively. The Council engaged lead consultant China Engineering and 
<br/>market contractor Jenn’s Construction for the Savusavu Market Project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the progress of construction to-date, the structure is about 30 percent completed and the 
<br/>building is around 35 percent completed. Mr, Speaker, Sir, it is also very interesting to note that the 
<br/>project was expected to complete within 52 weeks, since October 2022.  However, due to the delay 
<br/>in the release of funds by the previous government and unfavourable weather conditions, the further 
<br/>has delayed by 167 days. As such, the project is expected to be completed by March 2024, subject to 
<br/></span><span>better weather conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Nakasi Market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this market has been long overdue.  For hose market 
<br/>vendors who sell illegally on the roadside, especially in Makoi, behind Hansons Supermarket, and

<div><span>The total project cost is $1.9 million, out of which $759,000 or 39 percent of the national 
<br/>funding has been paid to-date. This project is under the administration of my Ministry, and Jenn’s 
<br/>Construction  has  been  engaged  as  the  main  contractor  for  the  Nakasi  Market.  The  market 
<br/>construction was expected to be completed within 40 weeks since October 2022, however, due to the 
<br/>delay in the release of funds and unfavourable weather conditions, it is expected to be completed by 
<br/>March 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To-date the market has progressed with 50 percent of the work being completed. In addition 
<br/>to  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  two  markets,  Savusavu  and  Nakasi  also  incorporates  some  of  the 
<br/>greener energy concepts, where solar energy panels have been installed, and also Bluetown concept 
<br/>where  the  solar  panel  will  also  be  installed  to  promote  Green  Economy  as  well  as  rainwater 
<br/>harvesting.

<div><span>On Levuka Market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be a two-storey building that will accommodate 
<br/>spaces for more than 300 stalls for the market vendors, and approximately 310 market vendors are 
<br/>currently selling from the roadside under temporary tents, provided by UN Women under its Market 
<br/>for Change Project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Levuka Market will not only support the Municipal Council of Levuka, but it will 
<br/>accommodate  those  market  vendors  who  endure  the  adverse  weather  conditions  in  their  current, 
<br/>temporary market shelters. The market is funded by Government and UN Women, the total project 
<br/>cost  is  around  $2.7  million  out  of  which  $400,000  is  supported  by  UN  Women.  The  project 
<br/>commenced in April 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  due  to  some  adverse,  also  delays  of  funds,  as  well  as  adverse  weather 
<br/>conditions,  the  project  is  expected  to  be,  it  is  near  completion,  but  we  are  proposing  for 
<br/>commissioning and opening around January 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  I  took  over  the  office,  in  the  first  six  months,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government  that  is  a  government  of  the  people,  by  the  people,  for  the  people.    There  were  new 
<br/>initiatives to assist some of our stations that really need assistance to have better and proper market 
<br/>facilities.  The Dreketi Rural Centre which is a place where we have, in my first to Vanua Levu, I 
<br/>have noted the need to upgrade the existing market structure at Dreketi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of Parliament, my Ministry in collaboration with Labasa Town Council 
<br/></span><span>decided  to  construct  a  temporary  market  to  provide  a  secure  and  safe  market  with  proper  public 
<br/>convenience, because Dreketi is like a stopover for commuters who travel from Nabouwalu to Labasa 
<br/>to Savusavu.  They normally stopover at Dreketi for a bite moved to Savusavu and even to Labasa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, the Government has allocated a sum of $100,000 for temporary works in the market 
<br/>at  the new site.  The temporary market  structure is  worth  $72,000, out of which the  Government 
<br/>funded $52,000 and the Labasa Town Council funded $20,000.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is interesting to 
<br/>know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that when we commissioned, it only took us four months to complete the 
<br/></span><span>project and it was commissioned on 20</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.  We were amazed with the smiling faces 
<br/></span><span>that  we  put  on  the  people  of  Dreketi,  especially,  the  market  vendors  who  used  to  sell  at  Dreketi 
<br/>Market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst being a progressive government focused on 
<br/>economic  development,  provided  spaces  for  vendors  to  sell.    In  the  last  eight  years,  FijiFirst 
<br/>government made Laqere Market, extended Ba Market, made Namaka Market, Rakiraki Market and

<br/>about the Navua Market where the money was withdrawn and diverted somewhere else? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Navua Market was not well planned. There 
<br/>was no good feasibility study for Navua Town.  That is what we are trying to do at the moment.  We 
<br/>are looking for the best place to relocate the Navua Market; that is something that we are doing right 
<br/>now.  That is part of our vision, part of our mission is to also make Navua to become a town.  So, 
<br/>there are few services, few facilities and infrastructure that we want to ensure we are doing it right 
<br/>before we declare Navua a town.

<div><span>Education (Establishment and Registration of Schools) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 
<br/>(Question No. 200/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  update  Parliament  on  the  Education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Establishment and Registration of Schools) (Amendment) Regulations 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. Just a quick update, the subject regulation was approved by Cabinet on 8</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, 
<br/>which was to reverse the provision under the 1996 Regulation, which stipulates that the requirement 
<br/>for children who turn six years old by 30</span><span>th</span><span> June of the same year of admission will now be enrolled 
<br/>as Year 1 students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the Cabinet Decision, this was gazetted on 28th September, 2023 and 
<br/>has now become law unlike the previous regulation that was yet to be gazetted and the decision to 
<br/>revert was based on the projected increase in enrolment in 2024 which was the basis of the earlier 
<br/>Cabinet  Paper.  Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  limitations  in  terms  of  the  feasibility 
<br/>study, in terms of readiness of the infrastructure and in terms of the readiness of additional teachers 
<br/>that will require this initial regulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I would like to address the question that was also raised yesterday in 
<br/>terms  of  the  enrolment.  We  see  a  lot  more  concerns  being  raised  by  parents  and  stakeholders 
<br/>regarding schools being levying some sort of a fee for an enrolment form.   I would like to state here 
<br/>for the information of the honourable Members of Parliament and also the general public, the parents 
<br/>and guardians that the Ministry of Education does not condone such exercise and does not have a 
<br/></span><span>policy that requires parents that wishes to enrol their children into schools to pay a fee to access those 
<br/></span><span>enrolment forms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>response.  Just a clarification on that matter, it is not really a question but the point that I want to 
<br/>raise is that we need to move forward.  The problem is, it is really unfair for those children who turn 
<br/>six years old in June are denied enrolment for the whole year.  So, if they are born in July, August, 
<br/>September of that admission year, they are sitting at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technologies  have  come  in,  these  little  children  have  been  in  Early  Childhood  Education 
<br/></span><span>(ECE)  for  two  years  but  they  are  denied  enrolment  and  the  provision  within  that  discussion,  the 
<br/>provision was there that any parent who wants to enrol their children, they need to do a provisional 
<br/>enrolment and we want to focus more on provisional enrolments and I can see the problems that can 
<br/>be created when you do not know the number and how you are going to accommodate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We allowed for provisional enrolment whereby we can analyse the needs at different schools,

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, my question is actually a comment.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Good comment.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I know.  What Deputy Prime Minister?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, she has made that comment.  Honourable Members, in the past have 
<br/>also  had  the  opportunity,  when  it  arises  you  go  for  it  and  then  when  they  are  stopped  to  ask  the 
<br/>question then they say, “no, this is just a comment.”

<div><span>Free Education Grant and Boarding Grant 
<br/>(Question No. 201/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prices of most items have increased due to increase in VAT and corporate tax. Can 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament whether the Ministry is considering 
<br/>increasing the Free Education Grant and Boarding Grant to meet the increase in the cost of 
<br/>items?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, saving the best for the last in terms of Question 
<br/>No. 5 by the honourable Member.  Before I answer the question, I would just like to take this time to 
<br/>maybe remind the honourable Member that I think he knows very well the amount of assistance this 
<br/>government  has  given  to  227,000  students  who  access  the  $200  back-to-school  assistance  at  the 
<br/>beginning of this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- That is different. I am asking on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- That culminates to your question regarding increase in VAT and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also we are about to give another $200 again for back-to-school in 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for those in the tertiary level we have written off TELS loans that they have 
<br/>for them not to pay back so that is about 53,000 families that again will benefit from those initiatives 
<br/>and also … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  … we have also reviewed the payment of  “location allowance” 
<br/>to teachers that were not eligible during your time.  We are now trying to make them be eligible to 
<br/>pay for those that are truly in need of the location allowance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2321 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Most of the teachers are now back teaching when we revised the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>retirement age from 55 to 60. So, most of the teachers are now back in school Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maybe,  that  is  something  that  you  should  have  also  taken  into  consideration,  honourable 
<br/>Member, before you ask the question but, anyway, in terms of the question, the Ministry will, first 
<br/>of all, review the school policies and procedures regarding financial management of the school as it 
<br/>is now due for review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that management handbook, as you know, there are six allocations that the grant will need 
<br/>to  be  allocated  to  and  used  accordingly  by  the  respective  schools.  These  are  government-funded 
<br/>schools, not  private schools  which is  something that  this government  will  also need to  look  at  to 
<br/>accommodate those students that are eligible for this assistance to also be part of this free education 
<br/>grant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In short, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total budget for free education grant this year which includes 
<br/>the increase in VAT, it is $68.9 million as of 24</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023, the total utilization for ECE is 
<br/>about 20 percent, primary schools is about 44 percent and secondary schools is about 51 percent; in 
<br/>terms of dollar value primary schools is $35.1 million and secondary schools is $30.8 million and 
<br/>ECE is $2.9 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the review of this handbook will be done through consultations with relevant stakeholders 
<br/>and we also will accommodate the assessment and see whether and how other free education grants 
<br/>have been used by respective schools.  What we see is that most of the classrooms in the rural and 
<br/>remote areas have limited number of students or less number of students and they are affected by the 
<br/>amount of the free education grant that is usually given to them as compared to those schools in the 
<br/>city and town areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  boarding  grant,  in  2023-2024  the  boarding  per  capita  grant  for  Non-Government 
<br/>schools, for secondary schools has increased this year: from $50 per year to $150 per student. The 
<br/>boarding per capita is budgeted at secondary school level of $301,800 and primary $459,600 for the 
<br/>current financial year.  The rate remains the same for Non-Government Primary Schools of $50 per 
<br/>child with total utilisation for boarding grant for primary schools, it is 18 percent and boarding grant 
<br/>for secondary schools is 2 percent.  The Free Education Grant and Boarding per capita grant for Non-
<br/>Government Schools as per budget under SEG 6 of the Budget Book which are also VAT inclusive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to Honourable Rinesh Ritesh Sharma who raised a 
<br/>supplementary question I just want to acknowledge, honourable Members, those in the gallery.  These 
<br/>are the staff of the Department of Immigration led by one Rasieli Rabukawaqa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are here to familiarise themselves with the Parliamentary Process and it is indeed and 
<br/>honour to receive you, ladies and gentlemen. We hardly get visits from civil servants so this is quite 
<br/>encouraging because you have here some that have already served their time as civil servants. They 
<br/>are interested in Parliament, they have graduated to Parliament but the engine room is with you all. 
<br/></span><span>Civil Service is the engine room of any government that comes in. So, we acknowledge your presence 
<br/></span><span>and the honourable Members have already made known their acknowledgement and we wish you 
<br/>well in your journey here and also in your careers, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now offer the floor to honourable Rinesh Sharma.  They are pointing at each other  as to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which one to go first.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I will let him go first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- After this, then we will jump straight to the next item which is the End of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Week Statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I will allow him, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. One of the main reason for the introduction 
<br/>of Free Education Grant was to ensure that schools provide good teaching resources to students and 
<br/>teachers and also provide good teaching/learning environment. The other reason was to stop levying 
<br/>students and parents.  Now it is noted with great concern that students/parents are heavily levied by 
<br/>some schools.  Parents are raising serious concerns regarding levy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  We  have  received  some  concerns  from  parents  that  the  schools  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>levying the students and parents. We have got evidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Which school? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- My question is, what is the Ministry doing about this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- This goes back to the preparation of teachers from the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Education. They need to be trained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member was a Director - Human Resources, Head of Human Resources. The 
<br/>teachers were not properly trained in terms of financial management of Free Education Grant and 
<br/>therefore  these  are  some  of  the  things  that  this  current  Ministry  is  trying  to  address  in  terms  of 
<br/>providing proper training to those that are responsible in terms of the management of the grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the levying of the fees to parents, I have just addressed earlier that the Ministry usually 
<br/>gives due consideration to the respective Heads of School. We do not have a standardised policy and 
<br/></span><span>this is something that we are working on to ensure that there are enrolment policies for all schools, 
<br/></span><span>given the respective ownerships of the schools, some are government-owned, some are faith-based 
<br/>owned, some are community/management-owned, so these are some things that we will have to take 
<br/>into consideration in terms of formulating the policy for enrolment for the respective schools.
