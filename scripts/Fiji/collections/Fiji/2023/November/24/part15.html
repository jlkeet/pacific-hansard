<br/>and this session and I thank you all for all your contributions throughout the week and also this first 
<br/>session of Parliament.  We have completed one year of sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, at this juncture, I wish to advise that Parliament will stand prorogued 
<br/>from Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2023.  By convention, this is not a sitting day, prorogation signifies the 
<br/>formal end of a parliamentary session or year during the parliamentary term which is four years.The 
<br/>Speaker will inform his Excellency the President of the prorogation as well as the State Opening of 
<br/>Parliament and the Session on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  The State Opening will be officiated by 
<br/>His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.  We will ensure that we will be communicating 
<br/>and listening to the decision of the honourable Prime Minister and the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once Parliament is prorogued, parliamentary business including parliamentary sittings and 
<br/>parliamentary  standing  committeesâ€™  proceedings  on  Bills,  motions  and  reports  are  suspended  or 
<br/>ceased until the opening of a new parliamentary session, with the exception of matters that will be 
<br/>deemed urgent and necessary such as the standing committee work on Bills, but this will be at the 
<br/></span><span>discretion of the Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  this  will  be  our  last  sitting  for  this  session  of  Parliament,  I  would  like  to  wish  all 
<br/>honourable Members and for each and everyone sitting in the gallery and those watching the live 
<br/>proceedings and everyone in Fiji a very Merry Christmas and a prosperous 2024. I also would like 
<br/>to wish the honourable Prime Minister and his entourage, including this Office well on the journey 
<br/>to attend the COP28 meeting in Dubai.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, thank you so much, and I now declare Parliament adjourned until Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span>
