<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>PACIFIC FISHING COMPANY LIMITED 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Pacific  Fishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Company Limited 2018–2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Pacific Fishing Company Limited (PAFCO) is one of 
<br/>the largest fish processing companies in the Pacific region.  It is the largest employer in Levuka and 
<br/>immensely  contributes  to  the  economic  activity  of  the  Island.    The  Committee,  as  part  of  its 
<br/>deliberations, had visited the PAFCO site earlier this year to fully understand the operations of the 
<br/>company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The years 2018-2019 Annual Reports were filled with its unique opportunities and challenges 
<br/>for the company. In 2018, PAFCO achieved a milestone when the former Prime Minister visited the 
<br/>factory to officially open the new cold storage facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  year,  PAFCO  continued  its  efforts  to  upgrade  its  infrastructure,  plant  and 
<br/>equipment.    However,  the  company  faced  significant  challenges  during  2018-2019  due  to 
<br/>inconsistent  supply  of  albacore  tuna.  This  led  to  the  factory  aligning  its  processing  operations 
<br/>throughout to adjust to the incoming fish stock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while deliberating on the Report, the Committee noted that the causes of 
<br/>the $3.2 million loss in 2019 was due to the low supply of tuna.  Apart from the 20,000 metric tonnes 
<br/>of albacore supplied by Bumble Bee, the Committee recommended for PAFCO to explore engaging 
<br/>other  suppliers  under  strict  contractual  terms  to  ensure  consistency  and  supply  of  tuna  and  to 
<br/>ultimately optimise the plant’s productive capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  also  noted  the  need  for  the  company  to  have  a 
<br/>comprehensively documented Risk Management Policy for high risk areas that are not covered, given 
<br/>the two years of consecutive losses from 2018 to 2019.  The Committee recommended an overall 
<br/></span><span>organisational review be conducted to assess both, the short term and long-term strategic issues, and 
<br/></span><span>determine future directions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee agreed that PAFCO must continue their initiative of finding the right people 
<br/>to undertake the various roles available in the company.  We were made aware of their cadets in the 
<br/>Quality Control and Production Department and an accountant was being recruited.  We were also 
<br/>made aware of their successful Apprentice Programme through which five apprentices successfully 
<br/>completed their four-year programme and one was the runner up in the Apprentice of the Year Award 
<br/>given by the Fiji National University.  Sir, PAFCO must continue its efforts to upgrade the skills of 
<br/></span><span>its workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor, perhaps, may I remind you, honourable Members, once more that the Business 
<br/>Committee has decided that there are, at least, two speakers from each side of Parliament before the 
<br/>right of reply is provided by the mover of the motion.  The two speakers from each side will be given 
<br/>five minutes each.  I have been given a list from the honourable Whips and is as follows:

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023                Consolidated Review Report – PAFCO 2018-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2063 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S.T. Koroilavesau; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign affairs, Climate Change, Environment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications. .   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute 
<br/>to the motion before the floor on the Consolidated Review Report of the Pacific Fishing Company 
<br/>Limited (PAFCO) for 2018 to 2019.  I would like to thank the Chairman and the Management Board 
<br/>of PAFCO for the period under review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must thank the late Mr. Iqbal Jannif for his commitment and dedication during those difficult 
<br/>years,  as  the  company  continued  to  face  significant  challenges  in  the  supply  of  albacore.    The 
<br/>company is the mainstay of the economy in the Lomaiviti Group and the largest employer in Ovalau 
<br/>with  the  workforce  of  over  870  people,  comprising  of  senior  management,  production  line 
<br/>supervisors, team leaders and skilled and general workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are, at least, 100 people indirectly employed as contractors to transport 
<br/>and other business, as well as on a call basis with the major shipment of tuna that arrives at PAFCO 
<br/>in Levuka.  Overall, the positive financial impact is spread across the entire populous of the Lomaiviti 
<br/>Group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PAFCO has helped to diversify the source of income and employment in 
<br/>the seven islands of Lomaiviti.  In 2018, as had been alluded by the Chairperson, PAFCO opened a 
<br/>new storage facility to store raw tuna for processing.  This led to the factory aligning its processing 
<br/>operations throughout the adjustment to incoming fish stock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We deliberated on the $3.2 million loss in 2019 because of the lack of albacore.  Ultimately, 
<br/>there has to be an avenue sought, now that the company is under FCF Company Limited of Taiwan.  
<br/>There could be an avenue to open a joint venture and I would encourage the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Fisheries to relook at that as I have opened the discussions with few companies that are involved in 
<br/>fishing in Kiribati, that could have a mother ship that actually collects fish, especially albacore, from 
<br/>Kiribati as a friendly neighbour that can provide a concession on the fishing licences.  If this is done 
<br/>and  the  mother  ship  collects  raw  tuna  from  Kiribati  and  directly  bring  it  to  Levuka,  it  will  help 
<br/>PAFCO during times when albacore is greatly demanded in the open market.  The FCF is the second 
<br/>largest  buyer  and  supplier  of  tuna  in  the  world.    That  has  provided  a  base  where  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister can actually discuss.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have had discussions with the Shanghai Deep Sea Fishing in China and they have agreed 
<br/>for a joint venture but, ultimately, the process of negotiation was not completed.  They will provide 
<br/>purse seiner vessels with the mother ship that will collect it and deliver it to PAFCO in Levuka.  If 
<br/>that is done, it will greatly help PAFCO to survive in these challenging times and more so, provide 
<br/>employment  opportunities  for  the  whole  the  Lomaiviti  Group.  If  PAFCO  dies,  Levuka  dies  and 
<br/>Lomaiviti will really get the repercussions of the non-existence of any economic activity in Ovalau 
<br/>and the whole of the Lomaiviti Province. Thank you for the opportunity Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic 
<br/>Affairs for their Report.  They would have had a very good look at the Annual Report from PAFCO 
<br/>to come up with the report that they have presented to us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with the comment made by the former Minister, honourable Koroilavesau, and we 
<br/>note the difficulties that PAFCO had gone through because of the shortage of supplies of tuna, as 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – PAFCO 2018-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well as the dilapidated condition of the various machinery and infrastructure supporting the industry 
<br/>in Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to go straight into the recommendations.  It is a public enterprise under the Prime 
<br/>Minister’s portfolio so we have taken note of the recommendations. Earlier on this year, I received a 
<br/>dividend of $268,000 from PAFCO that has gone into Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PAFCO and Bumble Bee have had lengthy discussions about the tuna supply shortage, 
<br/>the subject of Recommendation No. 1. Furthermore, PAFCO is currently exploring new revenue-
<br/>generating alternatives, in order to strengthen its financial performance and position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier on, we had a bit of a tussle on the use of the wharf but that was amicably resolved 
<br/>when  a  shipping  company  tried  to  unload  stores  for  the  agriculture  and  photovoltaic  projects  on 
<br/>Ovalau.  However, it leaves open the question on maritime transport infrastructure for Lomaiviti, 
<br/>particularly Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The influence of climate change will continue to have a significant impact on tuna supplies.  
<br/>We have had </span><span>La Nina</span><span>, I do not know whether </span><span>El Nino</span><span> will balance it, but we live and learn.  In the 
<br/>meantime, PAFCO will have to be looking at risk management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 3 - The lease commitments were derived from both land and buildings. 
<br/>The 2019 audited accounts show the liability to be realised in the future and also the offsetting of 
<br/>right of use assets to be utilised in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Suva Office exists for several reasons.  Firstly, the annual sales of fish meal and packs 
<br/>of canned tuna are done from the office which is the dispatch office for all sales to Punjas and export 
<br/>of fish meal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority  of  the  Board  Members  are  based  in  Viti  Levu  and  often  travel  to  Levuka  for 
<br/>meetings.  Thus, the Office provides the opportunity for meetings to be held in Suva and it saves 
<br/>cost. It eases the movement of PAFCO sales stock, as it is more accurately controlled from the Suva 
<br/>Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  No.  4,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  financial  year  2020  and  2022  have  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>profitable and the average of return on equity is 10 percent for the three years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, PAFCO has reviewed its Organisational Structure to ensure that the company has 
<br/></span><span>the right people in the right position, to implement the company’s strategies and achieve its vision. 
<br/>The Government is also appreciative of the late Iqbal Jannif’s performance in the control of PAFCO 
<br/>and its Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note the recommendation from the Committee 
<br/>and Government will continue to support the apprenticeship programme, as well as the graduate cadet 
<br/>training programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  No.  6,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  been  the  liaising  between  the  relevant 
<br/></span><span>Ministries and other relevant agencies to assist the company in resolving the issues that they have 
<br/>raised in their report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are my comments on the Report and I, once again, commend the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for their Report and also the Company for its performance.

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023                Consolidated Review Report – PAFCO 2018-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute 
<br/>to the Pacific Fishing Company Pte Limited 2018-2019 Annual Reports and I would like to thank the 
<br/>Standing Committee for their review and assessment of the Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me join the sentiments raised by honourable Koroilavesau and my neighbour in Lami, the 
<br/>late  Mr  Iqbal  Jannif,  a  well-known  personality  in  our  country,  who  served  well  on  the  Board  of 
<br/>Pacific Fishing Company (PAFCO) for so many years and would like to just pay tribute to him in 
<br/>terms of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, PAFCO has been around for some time.  Actually even at 
<br/>one point in my life, I went and did audits on PAFCO, and that is how long PAFCO has been - 55 
<br/>years actually to be exact. It has played a significant role in, not only in the economy of the country, 
<br/>but  certainly  in  the  economy  of  Lomaiviti  and  Levuka,  as  also  mentioned  by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau and the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, PAFCO is the anchor for Levuka, Mr. Speaker, Sir, or the economic epic centre 
<br/>for Levuka and that being the case, this side of Parliament certainly are committed to continuing the 
<br/>investment of PAFCO.  I thought I would just change the angle a little bit,  Sir, and talk about some 
<br/>of the things, from trade perspective, that we are thinking about PAFCO for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I do that, Mr. Speaker Sir, I need to raise something in Parliament that probably not 
<br/>all of us are aware of.  Some years ago, the other side actually introduced a fishing levy - $450 metric 
<br/>tonnes, which basically meant that all supply of fish into Fiji became uneconomical. So, when we 
<br/>talk about the lack of supply of fish in PAFCO, that side of Parliament has a lot to do with that. They 
<br/>only reviewed the pricing in 2022 and I was trying to make it an issue during the Elections as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, if you want to talk about self-inflicted injuries on your own goals, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>just like the blunder we heard about in FRA, this is a classic blunder.  Sir, $453 metric tonnes, after 
<br/>that you have to add on the cost from Suva to Levuka, is uneconomical. So, they are all going to 
<br/>Solomons and Samoa right now and as we know in business, once we turn them away it takes them 
<br/>about 10 years to come back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … production of the domestic market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Well,  you  got  it  into  PAFCO.  Look  at  what  you  did  to 
<br/></span></div>
