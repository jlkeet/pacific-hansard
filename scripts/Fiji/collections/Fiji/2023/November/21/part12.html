<div><span>Sir, we need to endorse the Sitting Calendar.  It will allow all the six Standing Committees to 
<br/>continue  with  Committee  work  on  the  Annual  Reports  that  are  currently  pending  with  the 
<br/>Committees and Bills that may be moved in Parliament for consideration. Honourable Members, I 
<br/>request you to support this proposed Sitting Calendar as it is envisaged that there will be more time 
<br/>for debate on matters before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also pertinent to note that Committees are essential mechanisms which 
<br/>Parliament  can  reach  out  to  members  of  the  public.  Committees  are  essential  in  terms  of 
<br/>accountability and scrutiny and, therefore, it is vital to allow them time to undertake their work as 
<br/>we had done when we were in the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  proposed  calendar,  the  Government  will  continue  to  be  able  to  execute  and 
<br/>implement  its  plans  and  policies  and  programmes  whilst  Parliamentary  Standing  Committees 
<br/>undertake and discharge their functions as mandated in the Standing Orders.  In that respect, Sir, the 
<br/>proposed Sitting Calendar before Parliament needs all our support as it would greatly ensure that the 
<br/>Fijian Parliament will continue to undertake its legislative representative and oversight functions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I do commend this motion to Parliament, and I hereby seek the support of Parliament and 
<br/>all honourable Members to approve the proposed Sitting Calendar for the year 2024.  Sir, I thank you 
<br/>for your indulgence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity.    I  take  this 
<br/>opportunity to also convey our best wishes to our athletes who are in the 17</span><span>th</span><span> Pacific Games in the 
<br/>Solomon Islands.  We wish the management and all the athletes the very best and we hope that they 
<br/>will bring in more golds to add to the past achievements of our athletes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the motion by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, 
<br/></span><span>I thank him for all the good words that he has used in order to gain the confidence and the trust of 
<br/>this side of Parliament. Let me assure the honourable Leader of the Government and the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and Government  that we have no objections to  the Sitting Calendar before us for 
<br/>2024. But again, as we have raised in the Business Committee, Sir, let us hope that the Government 
<br/>will commit to this Sitting Calendar. We have flexibility as well and we understand the engagements

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that Government need to undertake but let us not forget the fact that we also have a responsibility to 
<br/>our people and that is something that we need to continually highlight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, 2023, I think in the record of Fiji Parliament, is the worst year in terms of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, 2023, on record is the worst for Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in terms of the number of sittings… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- If we are unable to meet rather than totally cancelling the schedule, it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can be re-scheduled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You have made your point, move on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is exactly the point, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem is, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and all the Ministers are undertaking too 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>many ministerial travels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I know for a fact, Mr. Speake, Sir, in the previous government, it is 
<br/>the  directive  of  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  whenever  there  is  Parliament  sitting,  cancel  all  your 
<br/>overseas commitments.  Parliament is important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS. - Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- And that is what we are pleading with Government.  We are flexible, 
<br/></span><span>we have served in government, but we have a responsibility to the Fijian people as well and that is why 
<br/></span><span>this institution is so important.  We need to scrutinise, we need to look at …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. - This is working much better now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU. - Well, that is what you are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have taken away the number of sittings, we have reduced the debate timings and number of 
<br/></span><span>speakers.    We  have  a  responsibility,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    As  I  have  stated,  we  have  already  served  in 
<br/>government, but I urge on the Government, please make a commitment on our national priorities because 
<br/>we all have a responsibility to serve our people and serve them better.  We support this but we will 
<br/>continue to raise our concerns particularly given the record that we have in this year’s sitting, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. We support the motion, but I hope that Government will take our concern seriously.

<div><span>2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2011 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I am thankful 
<br/>that the honourable Members have been persuaded by what I have presented and are in support of the 
<br/>motion before us.  Various points raised regarding flexibility, yes, definitely we take into account.  Some 
<br/>of the comments in terms of our planning have been taken into account in this calendar and, of course, as 
<br/>experienced by the last Government, there are always issues which come up as we move in the year.  As 
<br/>experienced by them, they have also exercised that throughout their term of Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also a comment made on overseas travel.  Again, as I had mentioned, the calendar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before us has taken into account some of the regular international commitments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point regarding the scrutiny role of Parliament, we all know the experience of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the last few years during the FijiFirst Government in terms the suppression of the Opposition … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- … which has been ongoing 
<br/>for over several years, despite some of the justification we brought up.  It is not a matter of, as they are 
<br/>mentioning that we are taking revenge, no it is not that.  We have move up another level in terms of 
<br/>allowing for Opposition accountability, not only in the Committees but also in what we as a Coalition 
<br/>Government stand for, which is an open and transparent government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, they mentioned the number of speakers, the way we put in motions and how it has 
<br/>been programmed, they have broken the record in terms of Standing Order 51.  The numbers are already 
<br/>there in public, but we will never …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- … reach that record in terms 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the abuse of Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  end by thanking the Opposition  and those in  the Business Committee for supporting  the 
<br/>calendar in front of us.  You should be ashamed, why have you been missing from Parliament?  For 
<br/>16 years we have been supressed but now we are free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR.  SPEAKER.-  Just  a  comment  on  the  calendar,  honourable  Members,  we  are  almost 
<br/>completing one year of governance by the Coalition Government. It has not been an easy journey, 
<br/></span><span>quite a trying one, as the Government is trying all its best to govern. So, the calendar has been affected 
<br/></span><span>one way or another because as they try to forge ahead, they try as well not to be restrictive in the way 
<br/>they do things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, with all the comments that have now been passed regarding this new calendar, I 
<br/>hope that that should be able to send a strong message to Government that we will try our best to 
<br/>make these little changes as possible to the agreed calendar that we have now approved.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I want to say is, it is not easy being in the Chair and to go through all these with changes. 
<br/>Perhaps, it is a new ship, trying out its best to trial the seas, the different weather and all that goes 
<br/>with it in sailing a boat and by sailing a boat, it will be remiss of me not to mention the presence in 
<br/>the gallery of the former Assistant Minister for Health, Mr. O’Connor.  He is a former navy man and 
<br/>he  fully  understands  what  we  are  talking  about  when  we  are  talking  about  weather  in  the  seas. 
<br/>Welcome to Parliament, Mr. O’Connor.
