<div><span>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 29/2023), be considered by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> November, 2023, but 
<br/>that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Local  Government 
<br/>(Amendment)  (No.  2)  Bill  2023  and  why  Parliament  must  consider  it  without  delay.    The  Local 
<br/>Government Act 1972 is the primary legislation that regulates, amongst other things, the governance 
<br/>of local government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  its  practical  note  on  the  topic,  decentralised  governance  for  development,  a  combined 
<br/>practice note on decentralisation, local governance and urban-rural development, the United Nation’s 
<br/></span><span>programme has articulated that to quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For development and governance to be fully responsive and representational people 
<br/>and institutions must be empowered at every level of society; national, provincial, district, 
<br/>city, town and village.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  currently  oversees  13  Municipal 
<br/>Councils - two City Councils and 11 Town Councils.  However, the last Local Government Elections 
<br/>was  held  in  2005  and  since  then,  Municipal  Councils  have  been  governed  by  appointed 
<br/></span><span>Administrators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For over 17 years, the Local Government Elections have not taken place.  That is a history.  
<br/>We have a collective responsibility to provide our people with a chance to elect councillors that will 
<br/>safeguard  the  interest  in  various  municipalities.    Local  Government  elections  serve  as  the  most 
<br/>accessible means for the public to engage with the authorities and State institutions, and for these 
<br/>institutions to be held accountable for their decisions.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Local Government (Amd’t) (No. 2) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The holding of Local Government Elections is a manifestation of democracy at the grassroot 
<br/>level, which will offer an avenue for heightened civic participation.  This, in turn, fosters a stronger 
<br/>civic culture and empowers our citizens to engage in governance and decision-making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In alignment with the Coalition Government’s commitment to conduct Local Government 
<br/>Elections in 2024, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to allow for the execution of Local Government 
<br/>Elections to address related matters.  Consultations were held on the Bill, and based on the outcome 
<br/>of these consultations, the Bill is now being introduced in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> From 11</span><span>th</span><span> September this year, consultations were held within internal stakeholders, which 
<br/>included the Electoral Commission, Fijian Elections Office, Chief Executive Officers of Municipal 
<br/>Councils,  Special  Administrators,  political  parties,  members  of  the  media,  Civil  Society 
<br/>Organisations and diplomatic and development partners.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 15</span><span>th</span><span> September to 14</span><span>th</span><span> October this year, face to face public consultations were held in 
<br/>13 Municipalities.  In addition to these face-to-face consultations, the Bill was also made available 
<br/>on the Ministry’s website, to collect input from those who could not be physically present during the 
<br/>consultations.  Lastly, the consultations were held with the following key stakeholders: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Office of the Prime Minister; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>National Development and Statistics; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts; and 
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  only  16  Clauses  of  the  Bill.  As  alluded  to  earlier,  the  Local 
<br/>Government Elections are of great importance and given its significant public interest and the need 
<br/>to  hold  the  elections  at  the  earliest  and  most  feasible  opportunity,  I  recommend  that  Parliament 
<br/>considers this Bill without delay and that it be debated upon on Thursday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, our reason remains the same as to why we are objecting 
<br/>to this Bill, that this Bill has come under Standing Order 51. I have previously listened to what other 
<br/>honourable Members said, that we had done  consultation and, therefore,  we have brought  it here 
<br/>under Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyone who has worked previously in Government which I did and I am sure most of you 
<br/></span><span>sitting in this Chamber have worked previously under different Ministries and we know the process, 
<br/></span><span>even your good self, you had worked under the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources.  There are 
<br/>two processes involved, first is consultation with the public and second is, once the legislation is 
<br/>drafted, it comes to Parliament and it is the work of the legislature to scrutinise the Bill, take it to the 
<br/>public  and  then  bring  it  back  to  Parliament.  That  is  generally  the  process.    However,  for  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General to read out a long list of consultations that he has done, we have not 
<br/>done any consultations on the Bill collectively in a bipartisan manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason I am raising this is simply because it was the Opposition then 
<br/></span><span>who objected the use of Standing Order 51. They objected, even during  election time, they were 
<br/></span><span>talking about that, but what do we see? They are using Standing Order 51. What they are saying and 
<br/>what they are doing are two different things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to do what they told the public that they will be doing and we are 
<br/>here to ensure that these legislations that we want to introduce and pass in this Parliament is done 
<br/>collectively and without the use of Standing Order 51.  That is the point we are making, Mr. Speaker,
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2061 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, nothing else.  Just that particular point that we never said that we will not use it, they said that 
<br/>they will not use Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- We did not say it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Of course, you have said it so many times. So based on that, we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objecting, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  There  being  no  other  speakers,  I  now  offer  the  floor  to  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mission and vision of the Coalition Government 
<br/>is quite clear. We said it from the beginning that we are going to hold elections and that is what we 
<br/>have done. Subsequent to this, there will be further changes. There is really nothing else to say in 
<br/>relation  to  Standing  Order  51,  as  you  had  rightly  advised  Members  of  the  Opposition,  it  is  a 
<br/>parliamentary process and as Government, we are doing it for good reasons.  
<br/></span></div>
