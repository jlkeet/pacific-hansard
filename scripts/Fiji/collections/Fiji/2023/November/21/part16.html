<div><span>EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Employment  Relations  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  27/2023),  be  considered  by 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or another Committee of Parliament; and

<br/></span><span>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, the  Employment  Relations Act 2007 has been the 
<br/>focus  of  considerable  Government,  social  partner  and  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) 
<br/>interest over several years because of amendments to the Act from 2011 onwards, which did not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comply with fundamental ILO Conventions, including the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948; 
<br/>Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention 1949; and  
<br/>Abolition of Forced Labour Convention 1957.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  motion  is  for  this  august  Parliament  to  consider  the  Bill,  to  amend  the  definition  of 
<br/>“essential  service  and  industry”  (particularly  section  185  of  the  Act)  without  delay,  which  is 
<br/>necessary in order to restore the rights of workers and unions’ right and to bring Fiji’s employment 
<br/>legislation in compliance with international labour standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is under increased pressure, including at the ILO Conference 2022 and 
<br/>this year, to bring its employment legislation in compliance with the fundamental ILO Conventions 
<br/>that it has ratified, including the International Labour Organization’s Freedom of Association and the 
<br/>protection of the right to organise a convention. There has been widespread criticism over the past 
<br/>decade, both in Fiji and internationally, in relation to other amendments in the Act in 2011, 2013 and 
<br/>2015, which dramatically increased the scope and number of industries that are defined as essential 
<br/>services and industries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially when the Act  was promulgated in  2007,  there  were 16 services 
<br/>listed as essential services in Schedule 7 of the Act. Following the amendment over the past 12 years, 
<br/>there are a number of entities that are now considered essential services and industries, including 
<br/>Government workers, all statutory and local authorities in Fiji and all public enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s current list of essential services includes industries, like 
<br/>the finance industry and pine and mahogany industry, that fall outside of the definition of essential 
<br/>services. The effect of Fiji’s wide definition of essential services means that under Part 19 of the Act. 
<br/>workers and unions’ right to strike and right to free assembly and free speech are severely curtailed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Government had also signed the Joint Implementation Report and 
<br/>the Tripartite Agreement on 29</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2016, which effectively closed the case under Article 26 of 
<br/>the  ILO  Constitution  which  may  have  led  to  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  for  Fiji.  The  Coalition 
<br/>Government  has  reconstituted  the  Employment  Relations  Advisory  Board  (ERAB)  and  ILO 
<br/>Convention  144  and  has  brought  the  tripartite  parties  together  for  a  genuine  dialogue  with  a 
<br/>commitment to review and amend the ERA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past 10 years, ILO has repeatedly called on Fiji to review its list of essential services 
<br/>so as to restrict limitations on the right to strike and to essential services in the strict sense of the 
<br/>term.  The  ILO  supervisory  bodies  have  indicated  that  Fiji’s  original  list  of  essential  services  in 
<br/>Schedule 7 contains an appropriate list of resource service, and the effect of the proposed amendment 
<br/>to section 185 is to revert to the original list of essential services in Schedule 7.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment is an important first step and Fiji in taking action is to show 
<br/>its commitment to bring Fiji’s employment laws in compliant with International Labour Standards, 
<br/>in order to promote decent work and recognise the rights of both, employers and workers, who are 
<br/></span><span>the lifeblood of our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must emphasise that the urgency is underscored by the need to uphold the 
<br/>right to  assembly,  organisation  and free speech.    This,  Sir, is  one of the  many longstanding non-
<br/>compliance  issue  with  international  labour  standards  and  safeguards.  There  have  been  wider 
<br/></span><span>consultations, and I, therefore, endorse the Bill.

<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2055 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again on behalf of this side of Parliament do 
<br/>not agree with this notion that this should be discussed using Standing Order 51. The honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General needs to know that Fiji is not the only country in the world that has not fully ratified 
<br/>all the ILO Labour Conventions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the biggest countries and richest countries have not done that.  They look at what is 
<br/>necessary for their country. The group that is now in Government have always portrayed themselves 
<br/>as the bastions of democracy. We have talked about the importance of this Chamber and for us as the 
<br/>representatives of the people to discuss these things.  Just because someone says it, it does not mean 
<br/>that you automatically do it. Those large countries that you are talking about, not all of them have 
<br/>signed on to all of these fundamental ILO Conventions, not all of them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- So what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- They have not signed the ones they are pushing to do and they have 
<br/>not  signed  themselves  and  you  are  saying  just  because  they  say  ‘we  should  do  this’  we  should 
<br/>automatically do it. Why do you not bring it to this Chamber?  Let the Committees go through it. Let 
<br/>us discuss it. You talked to yourselves about the passion and democracy, but you are suppressing 
<br/>democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The representatives of the people are here. Why are you always going to Standing Order 51? 
<br/>Now you are not acting just like it, well you are not hypocrites, but when you do things and then you 
<br/>suppress the opportunity for us to debate it, let us debate it in Parliament. Let it go through the whole 
<br/>system with the Committees. Just because someone say something you just want to bow down to 
<br/>them.  Stop it. Stand on your two feet. Let us discuss it here. Let it go through the process and do the 
<br/>right thing. We object to this going through Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is precisely what I am going to speak on Standing Order 
<br/>51.  Honourable Usamate is showing the height of hypocrisy. He is talking about hypocrites, but the 
<br/>height  of  hypocrisy  is  coming  from  the  other  side.  This  is  a  legislation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General very carefully explained that this is the Government that is correcting 
<br/>the fundamentals of democracy that was destroyed by those sitting on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After the 2006 </span><span>coup</span><span> in 2007, the first attempt and those who were part of that became part of 
<br/></span><span>the  FijiFirst  Government,  continued  in  2015.    Even  in  Parliament,  they  passed  the  legislation  to 
<br/>further curtail the rights of the workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Standing Order 51, Mr. Speaker, was used by those who are sitting on the other side now, 
<br/>to do that. This is essentially a process where the Employment Relations Advisory Board (ERAB) 
<br/>was re-established … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You are the one complaining the most.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … where the employers have come together, where they have 
<br/>all agreed and they all see that this is an urgent Bill to be passed because the consultation with those 
<br/>that mattered had already taken place.

<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Thursday, they will have the right opportunity and so for him to come out and say, you 
<br/>know we are not practising democracy and somehow, we are overriding Parliament, I mean, there is 
<br/>a lot of hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming  from  the  honourable  Member  who  blames  everyone  else  about  hogwash  but  the 
<br/>biggest  hogwash  comes  from  him.  The  demonstration  of  the  biggest  hypocrisy  comes  from  him 
<br/>because he was the Minister for Employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, we brought further restrictions, so Standing Order 51 is the right thing to do. Let us 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pass this on Thursday and restore the rights of the workers.  I support the Bill, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to contribute to this motion and against 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Standing Order 51 being used.  On 16</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2017, if I can just read to you what was 
<br/>reported, it says in the Fiji Times, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“National Federation Party Leader Professor  Biman  Prasad  yesterday 
<br/>Parliament that rushing important Bills under Standing Order 51 was inappropriate.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>told 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was what he said.  Professor Prasad said this after the Government fast-tracked three Bills and 
<br/>three motions for Government guarantees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  a  point  of  order,  he  said  the  Opposition  should  be  given  a  few  days  to  prepare  a 
<br/>comprehensive response to the motions.  This is what he said, Mr. Speaker Sir, “It makes sense to 
<br/>get the Bills in our hands for a few days before we can make meaningful contributions,” Hypocrisy 
<br/>- that is what we are saying, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  That  is  why  we  are  saying,  that  is  hypocrisy.  Try  and  stop  using 
<br/>Standing Order 51 and let Legislature do its work and take this out to the people. Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Naupoto and Honourable Members, I have indicated several 
<br/>times in the past, Standing Orders 51 is a Parliamentary process. That is available for us to utilise 
<br/>and the Government, for this matter is now utilising Standing Orders 51 as previous Governments 
<br/>have done in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previous Governments  have done it in  the past.  They have gone under 51 to  work on the 
<br/>Parliamentary process that is available to bring into the Parliament at the earliest time possible, the 
<br/></span><span>motion that is being followed here, so the motion that we have before us, is on 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the Honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If I can recall clearly, a term that I used 
<br/>during my Maiden Speech was “restoration”. That is basically what we have done here. We are going 
<br/>back to where it was before, so that it is acceptable to the whole world.  That is why it needs to be
