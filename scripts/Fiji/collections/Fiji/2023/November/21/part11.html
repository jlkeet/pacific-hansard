<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament adopts the Sitting Calendar for the year 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  all 
<br/>honourable Members are aware, Standing Order 22(1) stipulates that the Business Committee must 
<br/>recommend to Parliament a programme of sitting periods of each session of Parliament or each 12-
<br/>month sitting period of Parliament, whichever is the shorter.  In that respect, the Business Committee 
<br/>had convened and undertook discussions on a proposed Sitting Calendar for the year 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can confirm that the Business Committee agreed and approved the Sitting 
<br/></span><span>Calendar for the year 2024, which was circulated to all honourable Members this morning.  Whilst 
<br/>we will try our utmost best to avoid any amendments to the calendar, only the essential and necessary 
<br/>re-adjustments will be subsequently tabled in Parliament. Primarily, this is to allow some flexibility, 
<br/>as most honourable Members may be aware that this has been the accepted practice in the last two 
<br/>terms of Parliament, of course, including the former Government.

<div><span>As honourable Members, we can see that Parliament will not sit until March 2024.  This is to 
<br/>allow for the Parliamentâ€™s ICT overhaul upgrade in the Chambers, which will involve the complete 
<br/>removal of the current system and installation of the new system.  These works will be very extensive 
<br/>and one which will require time for the benefit of all honourable Members, as well as the general 
<br/>public at large.  The endorsed Sitting Calendar outlines the following sitting periods:
