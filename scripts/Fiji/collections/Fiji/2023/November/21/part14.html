<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2015 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will begin with the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs. The floor 
<br/>is yours, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Policy on International Conflicts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise under the authority of Standing Order 40 to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>make a Ministerial Statement on Government policy on international conflicts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, make this Statement with a background of conflict going on around the 
<br/>world. Some of it could affect some of our peacekeepers on duty in the Middle East at the moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just come back from the meeting in San Fransisco, the Asia Pacific 
<br/>Economic Cooperation (APEC) Meeting, where we had the opening cocktails on Wednesday of last 
<br/>week, at the end of which there was a very lively fireworks display.   The welcome reception was put 
<br/>on by the Mayor of San Fransisco.  There was very lively fireworks, and as some of us were enjoying 
<br/>the fireworks, I was quietly thinking of the young people in Russia and Ukraine, and also those in 
<br/>Gaza and Israel.  What they would be doing, particularly the children, when they saw or heard loud 
<br/>bangs around them.  They very quickly learned to know whether it is incoming or outgoing, and they 
<br/>would take necessary and needed actions to stay safe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the following morning at the Roundtable of the Leaders present at the APEC Meeting, I 
<br/>mentioned that at the function the previous evening, and I said, “Your Majesty (there was a king 
<br/>there), Excellency’s, and honourable Prime Ministers, I do not know what you were thinking about 
<br/>last night when we were having the firework displays.  I was thinking about the young children, the 
<br/>young people in Gaza and Israel, and also those in Russia and Ukraine.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  there  was  the  other  thought  that  perhaps,  we  were  celebrating  the  four-hour  long 
<br/>meeting held by President Biden, who was sitting opposite me, and President Xi Jinping, the Chinese 
<br/>President, who was sitting towards my right.  I said, “I thought we were celebrating their summit.  I 
<br/>thought  we  were  aware  that  these  two  men,  between  them,  can  bring  peace  to  the  world.    And  I 
<br/>encouraged them to continue to talk to those who were engulfed in conflicts around the globe at this 
<br/>time.  I also told them, “Around this table, I am the only former peacekeeper present. I, and our troops 
<br/>now are called to go and keep the peace in conflict that had nothing to do with us but have gravely 
<br/>affected us in our cost of living, cost to us and lost lives.”  It attracted a lot of attention, and I am glad 
<br/>to say that 48 hours after that, peace negotiations had started around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak a Ministerial Statement as Minister for Foreign 
<br/>Affairs, to elaborate on Government policy on international conflicts.  We make our views and our 
<br/>stance based on rules based on international order and decision-making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, Sir, I received an envelope on my table from those who were trying to attract 
<br/>international  attention  towards  the  alleged  atrocities  suffered  by  our  kinsmen  -  the  Papuans,  the 
<br/>Melanesians of Indonesia.  I am glad that in the discussion I had with President of Indonesia, I did 
<br/>not mention West Papua or Papua as their concern, but my colleague, the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>of Papua New Guinea mentioned it.  And we have been asked by the Pacific Islands Forum of Leaders 
<br/></span><span>in the Melanesian Spearhead Group to spearhead the Pacific’s attempt to get attention focused on the 
<br/>people of West Papua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After our discussion with the President of Indonesia, he invited me to make that State visit 
<br/>and I hope it does not interfere with the parliamentary programme that we have.  In fact, I would plan 
<br/>it so that we do not interfere with the sitting of Parliament next year.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we may be

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>small, we may not have the power to influence the economies of the world.  But we enjoy a profile 
<br/>in international peacekeeping, and thanks to those who serve in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we may be small, we may not have the power to influence the economies 
<br/>of the world.  But we enjoy a profile in international peacekeeping, and thanks to those who serve in 
<br/>the Military and peacekeeping efforts, thanks to those who started the idea  - the late Ambassador 
<br/>Berenado Vunibobo, the late Colonel Paul Manueli and the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara during their 
<br/>time of leadership and representatives of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  at  the  moment,  would  like  to  continue  to  make  our  decisions  based  on  rules-based 
<br/>international  order  and  decision-making.    When  we  participate  in  global  debates  or  consider 
<br/>resolutions, we prioritise the sovereignty of UN Member States, as outlined in the United Nations 
<br/>Conventions.  Our approach is premised on the determination of whether the issue at hand affects the 
<br/>sovereignty of States recognised as part of the United Nations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>States are signatories, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and parties to international conventions and rules set 
<br/>out  by  the  United  Nations.    By  our  very  membership  of  this  world  body,  we  hold  each  other 
<br/>accountable to that standard.  How do we deal with non-State actors and proxies?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of accountability raises the question of what  happens if and/or 
<br/>when non-State actors or proxies are involved in international conflicts? Where these entities initiate 
<br/>conflicts and ignore the international rules governing corresponding conducts, including the laws of 
<br/>wars, who will come for them, or precisely, how can they be made accountable? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in the UNDA when the group of pilgrims from Fiji were preparing to 
<br/>go to Israel. My wife and a girl from home were on the passenger list. I called the organisers, and I 
<br/>called home and said, “Please, cross off my wife’s name.”  Master Mika asked, “Why, Sir?”.  I said, 
<br/>“They will be there on 7</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, which is a Saturday.”  He asked, “What has that got to do 
<br/>with the trip?”  I said, “That is the 50</span><span>th</span><span> Anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I asked my wife to excuse me for that, but on the afternoon of Saturday, 7</span><span>th</span><span> October, as the 
<br/>people of Navatu were having a meeting remembering the Republic Day of Fiji before the Fiji Day 
<br/>Celebrations on the following Monday, word came out that the war had broken up on Saturday, 7</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>October, 2023 - 50 years exactly to the day the Yom Kippur War started.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had to work out how we were going to extract our pilgrims.  We got the co-operation of 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  Airways,  we  got  the  co-operation  of  our  Embassies,  of  our  Permanent  Representative  in  the 
<br/></span><span>United Nations, who arranged with all the countries over which Fiji Airways would fly, to be on 
<br/>standby should we need refuelling coming back because we would not have had time for Fiji Airway 
<br/>to refuel on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We got word that the Iron Dome had been activated, that no missiles would fall on Ben Gurion 
<br/>Airport, we had cleared the air route, Fiji Airways was on standby in Singapore with full fuel tanks, 
<br/>which meant they could  not bring back all the passengers.  They could bring back everyone who 
<br/>went but not the others who did not go by the charter flight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We managed to do that, Sir, because we have a very good reputation with countries around 
<br/>the world who are willing to cooperate with Fiji Airways should they need to refuel on the way back.  
<br/>The flight returned, picked up our passengers and came back.  Sadly, while they were on board, they 
<br/>heard the news that the Mayor, who had entertained them two days before the conflict broke out, had 
<br/>been killed in the kibbutz he was defending as the Mayor in the very first assault into Israel.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, battlelines nowadays are not drawn.  All former military men know that  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) is no longer applicable.  There is no longer an FEBA.  The 
<br/>enemy is no longer in uniform and wears no rank.  Things are very difficult.  Definitions and identities 
<br/>of combatants are no longer discernible.  These are the nature of conflicts that we have to think about 
<br/>in our role as leaders in the legislative assemblies of nations, so far remote from the conflicts yet 
<br/>suffer most of the effects.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such things as human shields that we used to read about are reality in the conflicts of today.  
<br/>The brutal atrocities we thought might be fiction in a lot of things we see and read and view on social 
<br/>media are real, but we must abide by the international  standard that we uphold.  And, that is, we 
<br/>respect the sovereignty of nations, and we must also continue to serve to the best of our interest and 
<br/>the interest of the world because I believe we are there, we believe it is for the world that we have 
<br/>our peacekeepers out there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have our own faith, our own religion, and we also have our own sovereignty to protect.  
<br/>Our policy stance on managing international conflicts, we respect the sovereign integrity of States.  
<br/>We stand for non-aggression, for non-interference in domestic affairs of States and the resolution of 
<br/>conflicts by peaceful means in line with Chapter VI of the UN Charter.  When it comes to the required 
<br/>action with respect to threats to peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression, Fiji is guided 
<br/>by Chapter VII of the UN Charter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, and as a sovereign State, Fiji does not take a position simply because it is 
<br/>popular, or because it is the easy way out.  Instead, we will stand for truth, for what is right, even 
<br/>though this may not be pragmatic at times because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the very principles we stand for 
<br/>as expressed under Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the UN Charter, demonstrates our belief in the 
<br/>sacro-sanctity of life, in truthfulness and human decency, in good faith and accountability - that no 
<br/>meaningful and durable solution will come out from situations where a party to a conflict refuses to 
<br/>take responsibility for its actions.  How else can a doctrine of consent be applied when it comes to 
<br/>an agreed third party role?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  an  ethical  standpoint,  the  embracing  arms  of  forgiveness  and 
<br/>acceptance can only come from admission and repentance.  Therein lies the dignity of life and peace 
<br/>restoration, built on truth in the One in whom we live and move and have our being.  This is Fiji’s 
<br/>hope for the world.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for his elaboration on the policy that  the Government has on international conflicts and how this is 
<br/>consistent with the Foreign Affairs Policy of being friends to all and enemies of none. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has explained at length talking about the people that went to Israel as part of the trip earlier 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on and I am glad to see some of the things that he mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Listening to the words I am trying to put things together to see how they gel up with what the 
<br/></span><span>Government has actually done and the great words that have been expressed by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Foreign Policy, Mr, Speaker, Sir, I believe must always serve our national interest: our 
<br/>national interest of today and our national interest of the future. This must be fundamental at all times. 
<br/>It is not an easy thing to do because sometimes we are at pressure to do things that others want us to  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do. It is also very important that the Foreign Policy must reflect our values.  One of these key values 
<br/>is humanity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has talked about the important role that is made in terms of 
<br/>peacekeeping: peacekeeping today in the Middle East there are between 15,000 to 20,000 people that 
<br/>have passed away.  At least 6,000 children. I do not know what the figures are in places like Ukraine. 
<br/>What those numbers are but this morning, I just googled those numbers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this value of humanity must be crucial in everything that we stand for. We are a country 
<br/>that  stands  for  humanity.  We  have  stood  for  climate  change  because  climate  change  impacts  on 
<br/>humanity.  We have stood at the forefront of this world and shouted these matters to everyone. When 
<br/>you are for climate change you are for humanity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am saying from our part this key value of humanity we must never deviate from it if 
<br/>people are dying around the world. Humanity is also about the lives of our peacekeepers.  If you are 
<br/>going to make decisions at the United Nations, we need to be very careful that they are not decisions 
<br/>that might impact the lives of our very own peacekeepers that are in that part of the world, and I know 
<br/>that the honourable Prime Minister is a former peacekeeper knows that and that is our concern that 
<br/>we have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  make  decisions  whether  we  support  this  motion  or  that  motion  in  the  United 
<br/>Nations, we have to think about humanity around the world, humanity of our very own people.  As I 
<br/>talked  about  this  today,  they  were  talking  about  the  causes  for  humanitarian  issues.  I  think 
<br/>humanitarian focus on humanity must be critical in all our notions that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in doing this the perception of what the honourable Prime Minister had said that 
<br/>we need to be able to stand on our own feet and not be pushed by the powers that be whoever they 
<br/>are and we totally agree with this. We must not try to appease people just because they are strong.  
<br/>Our sense of who we are must not be bought by anyone else. So, the sentiments are there we want to 
<br/>see that this is implemented well.  We maintain that we maintain the importance of humanity, the 
<br/>importance of our people, the importance of this world to make sure that it is preserved for all the 
<br/>future generations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The words I heard from the Government, I look forward to seeing the execution to make it 
<br/>really happen where the rubber hits the road, where people’s lives are saved, where children can grow 
<br/>up to become adults. The babies that are in incubators are not killed because they have done nothing 
<br/></span><span>wrong at all. That is our great concern, honourable Prime Minister, so thank you for those words.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, maintain the interests of this country.  Maintain our values and do not be torn asunder 
<br/>by the perceptions that people have when they want us to do what they want to do for their own 
<br/>benefit.  We must do what is in the best interest of the world, of our people and our country.

<div><span>Google South Pacific Connect Initiative and Google’s Investment in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  before  you  today  to  make  a 
<br/></span><span>Ministerial Statement on Google South Pacific Connect Initiative and Google’s Investment in Fiji (in 
<br/></span><span>short at which it will be known: the Tabua Cable Connection).  Let me just say Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>when the history of this Government is written in years to come, the creation of the Tabua Cable is 
<br/>the collaboration between the tech giant, Google, and the Government of Fiji will go down as a major 
<br/>achievement and significant building block in rebuilding the economic architecture in the new Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  Let me say again, when the history of this Government is 
<br/>written,  the  creation  of  the  Tabua  Cable  will  go  down  as  a  major  achievement  and  a  significant 
<br/>building block in the rebuilding of the economic architecture of the new Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Where is your dagger? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Sir,  today,  I  wish  to  share  some  information  on  this 
<br/>transformative investment and why, as Minister of Communications and by extensions naturally, the 
<br/>People’s  Government  is  very  excited  about  this  partnership  with  Google  and  the  further 
<br/>opportunities, we believe, this initiative will unlock for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative aligns well with the Coalition Government’s long-term goal 
<br/>of diversifying the economy, progressing into a more digital economy and cementing Fiji as the hub 
<br/>of the Pacific.  We not only speak about it, but we also actually do it.  We make it happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to start, please, allow me to share some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>details on Google South Pacific Connect Initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, you’ll learn something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We have nothing to learn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Google will establish and lay a new sub-sea cable that will 
<br/>link United States, Fiji, Australia and French Polynesia.  Google will lay the Tabua Cable which will 
<br/>connect the United States, Australia and Fiji and additionally, Google will lay a second cable dubbed 
<br/>the “Honomoana cable”, connecting the United States to French Polynesia and onward to Australia.  
<br/>There is also potential to eventually link Fiji to Japan and Fiji to Chile through South America.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Google  plans  an  interlinking  subsea  cable  connecting  Fiji  and  French 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Polynesia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- When did you start the negotiation with Google? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Google plans for the interlinking subsea cables connecting Fiji and French 
<br/>Polynesia will truly make Fiji the technological hub of the Pacific and continue this desire, and this 
<br/>is another thing that differentiates us from them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- When we do things, we do things for other Pacific Islands, 
<br/>with  the Pacific.  This  investment  Mr. Speaker,  Sir, will open up the technology  to  whole of the 
<br/>Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Who started the discussions with Google?

<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- This ring will include pre-positioned branching units that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will allow other Pacific Islands .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me address that question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They were mucking around with Google. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Google approached them, they were mucking around with Google.  In seven months, we got it done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- When we met Google, they said, “We have been talking to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these guys, they are not talking to us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You were talking to Fiji Water all the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Look at him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No action, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with too much talk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very good action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Seven  months,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  bringing  our 
<br/>transformative  investment  into  this  country.  This  ring  that  I  am  talking  about  will  include  pre-
<br/>positioned branching units that will allow the Pacific Island countries and territories to take advantage 
<br/>of the reliability, diversity and resilience resulting from this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  President  of  the  United  States  and  the  Prime  Minister  of  Australia  announced  their 
<br/>support for the Google Pacific Connect Initiative on the 25</span><span>th</span><span> October this year providing funding for 
<br/>some of the branching units which will allow for potential future submarine cable connections to 
<br/>other Pacific Island countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The South Pacific Connect Initiative is a collaborative effort with Google making a significant 
<br/>step in the advancement of digital infrastructure in the Pacific region.  It is one of the first projects 
<br/></span><span>of its kind in the Pacific providing the ability to bring redundant international connectivity to a region 
<br/></span><span>that is susceptible to natural disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, listen to this - Google will also construct a diverse cable landing station and 
<br/>ICT facility in Fiji which will create the first Tier III data centre in the Pacific improving reliability, 
<br/>adding capacity and reducing latency for users in the Pacific and around the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one would ask, “why is Google Pacific Connect Investment and Googles 
<br/>investment in Fiji important to us? With Googles investment in the Pacific Connect Initiative their 
<br/></span><span>plan to construct a diverse cable landing station and ICT facility this is a game changing initiative 
<br/></span><span>for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The estimated investment by Google into Fiji is FJ$200 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have spoken in this august Parliament about the initiatives to turbocharge 
<br/>the economy.  This, in itself, has the potential to turbocharge, diversify and strengthen the economy 
<br/>and more.

<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Are you the new Minister of Finance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, even prior to becoming a politician, I have 
<br/>been very supportive of the BPO and outsource sector in Fiji and vocal for the need of an additional 
<br/>landing station and submarine cable connectivity to provide redundancy, greater connectivity, reduce 
<br/>risk in the case of a cable being damaged.  I am pleased to say to the people of Fiji this has now come 
<br/>to pass.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am not sure if the Members of this august Parliament are 
<br/>aware, but with Viti Levu having one cable station, if something goes wrong, God-forbid, we would 
<br/>be severely and adversely affected.  The risk is there, and we saw this in Tonga two years ago.  The 
<br/>economic impact if Fiji were to lose connectivity would be severe, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Imagine not 
<br/>having internet connectivity for an extended period in this day and age.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  acknowledges  that  developing  resilient 
<br/>infrastructure is critical to development advancement and we have prioritised supporting initiatives 
<br/>such  as  this,  initiatives  that  have  the  ability  to  not  only  strengthen  the  ICT  infrastructure  but 
<br/>revolutionise digital connectivity in Fiji and the region providing a robust and reliable network, vital 
<br/>backup, expanded capacity and minimising delay for users in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk briefly about some of the high-level benefits that the 
<br/>South Pacific Connect Initiative and Google’s investment will have in Fiji.  Sir, we anticipate long-
<br/>term economic benefit of this investment to Fiji, and it will be significant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, the fact that a global multinational technology company like Google is investing in Fiji 
<br/>shows investor confidence. The fact  that we did it in seven months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has placed 
<br/>much more confidence (Google) in Fiji as opposed to the other side that marked them around for 
<br/>almost  two  years.  With  the  additional  submarine  cables,  increased  infrastructure  investments  and 
<br/>improved  digital  network  infrastructure,  there  is  an  opportunity  for  greater  international  internet 
<br/>bandwidth  capacity,  faster  internet  speed,  potential  cost  savings  to  Fiji,  increased  resilience  and 
<br/>reduce latency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Levu na vosa</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You might learn something.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improved  network  infrastructure  will  support  new  and  emerging  technologies  including 
<br/>frontier technologies such as, Artificial Intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, Quantum Computing, 
<br/>and will have the potential to  make the greatest  progress  in  areas such  as, education, agriculture, 
<br/>communications, medicine, manufacturing and combating climate change.  Now I have made them 
<br/>quiet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not forget the economic impact.  The estimated impact from the new 
<br/>subsea cable infrastructure on Fiji’s economy and society will include a higher economic output and 
<br/>supporting employment directly attributed to the market effects of this new cable infrastructure.  By 
<br/>2030, it is estimated that the economic output over seven years will reach approximately US$295 
<br/>million and has the potential to create almost 3,600 jobs economy wide.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is very conservative, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The above economic output and job estimates 
<br/>excludes the economic contribution of building and operating subsea cable infrastructure.  Just as 
<br/>important,  this  new  subsea  cable  would  act  as  a  catalyst  for  new  digital  technology-enabled 
<br/>opportunities.  This investment will greatly support the Fiji Business Process Outsourcing sector, by 
<br/>not only offering greater network infrastructure, but by reducing the risks mentioned earlier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this investment would also provide further confidence backed by this greater 
<br/>infrastructure  for  current  and  new  BPO  investors  to  consider  investing  and  expanding  their 
<br/>investments in Fiji.  You can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is a major interest in Fiji right now.   
<br/>This will lead to increased employment and economic activity in the BPO sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The BPO sector has the potential to provide 25,000 jobs and contribute greatly to Fiji’s GDP.  
<br/>This initiative further supports the business case for greater investment in the BPO and outsource 
<br/>sector.    Improved  digital  connectivity  and  greater  network  infrastructure  leads  to  technologies 
<br/>supporting social objectives, such as, digital technology in healthcare and education and even disaster 
<br/>management, to name are few.  Online digital education programmes will enable people to develop 
<br/>new skills and open up new additional career opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Fiji,  </span><span>Google</span><span>  is  collaborating  with  key  stakeholders  -  FINTEL  and  FNPF.    These 
<br/>partnerships  will  strengthen  Fiji  and  FINTEL’s  telecommunications  hub  status,  and  also  provide 
<br/>much needed reliability, resilience and connectivity between the people of the Pacific and the rest of 
<br/>the world.  We also believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Fiji’s institutional investors, such as FNPF, Fijian 
<br/>Holdings  and  BSP  Life,  may  have  an  opportunity  to  invest  in  the  Tabua  Cable.    This  is  also  an 
<br/>excellent opportunity for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is no secret that this Government, the People’s Government is very excited 
<br/>about this initiative and this investment in this country.  It is a big deal and will have real economic 
<br/>benefits for the people of Fiji.  I wish to assure the people of Fiji, we are just getting warmed up, and 
<br/>this Government not only talks, it actually walks the walk and takes action.  Remember that!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I end, I would like to acknowledge all the collaborators who have taken part in this 
<br/>initiative from the team at </span><span>Google</span><span>, to the Office of the Prime Minister, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, Investment Fiji and the 
<br/>Trade Commissioner at the Trade Commission Office, Mr. Alika Cooper, and finally, the Ministry 
<br/>of Foreign Affairs in Fiji.

<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to reply to the Ministerial Statement by the 
<br/></span><span>Deputy Prime Minister and I thank him for his Statement. Connectivity is a must for development 
<br/>and  modernisation.    One  of  the  biggest  pillars  in  strategies  for  the  FijiFirst  Government  was  to 
<br/>modernise Fiji and the connectivity …

<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- … that we have right now is as a result of that strategy to modernise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the margins of the 77</span><span>th</span><span> General Assembly, the honourable Prime Minister met with </span><span>Google</span><span>
<br/>in Washington and started off this discussion on </span><span>Google</span><span> Investment in Fiji and for the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister just to … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- … whitewash it and say that this is just their own, is a lie.  We started 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it all in October.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He is a liar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, connectivity has both good and bad sides to it.  We 
<br/>hear the benefits it will bring to Fiji but there is a bad side to connectivity, and it is called cybercrime.  
<br/>The Budapest Convention, which is the Convention on Cybercrime, was brought to Parliament, we 
<br/>dealt with it in the Committee and the honourable Attorney-General was supposed to come back to 
<br/>Parliament and move a motion that Fiji ratifies this Convention. That is the smart way of doing things.  
<br/>When you have connectivity, you make sure that you cover yourself from the negative aspects of 
<br/>connectivity and we are still waiting for that motion to come to Parliament so that Fiji can ratify the 
<br/>Budapest Convention so that we can partner with those countries that are at the forefront of fighting 
<br/>cybercrime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, connectivity is good, it is good for development, it is good for modernisation, but we 
<br/>must not forget the downside to it. That Convention will help the nation to curb the downside of 
<br/>having connectivity. You open up the internet nowadays, everyone has a phone, for kids, you open 
<br/>it up, you open to the ideologies of extremists of the world. We have dealt with that Cybercrime 
<br/>Convention and we are hoping that the honourable Attorney-General can bring it to Parliament so 
<br/>that Fiji can ratify. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  mention  that  yesterday,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  said  that  the 
<br/></span><span>Biodiversity  Beyond  National  Jurisdictions  (BBNJ)  Treaty  that  he  signed  had  already  come  to 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and with the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I would like to correct 
<br/>it that it has not come to Parliament, he definitely got bad advice.  The BBNJ was just drafted, I think, 
<br/>in March 2023. I am expecting the Solicitor-General or the honourable Attorney-General to bring a 
<br/>motion to Parliament so that Parliament can then push that across to the Committee and we can come 
<br/>back to Parliament for ratification of the BBNJ.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, that cable will help Fiji, it is good for our country, it is good for development but please 
<br/>do  not  forget  the  bad  side  to  it.  I  certainly  hope  that  we  can  ratify  that  Cybercrime  Convention 
<br/></span><span>(Budapest Convention) which helps us in dealing with the downside to connectivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  intend  to  adjourn  Parliament  for  tea.    For

<div><span>National State of Preparedness by the National Disaster Management Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable  Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/>I rise in this august Parliament today to share some ongoing initiatives that are part of the disaster 
<br/>preparedness works undertaken by the Ministry through the National Disaster Management Office 
<br/>(NDMO).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, please, allow me to provide a brief historical background of 
<br/>natural disaster events that we have witnessed over the years.  As we know, Fiji is situated in a region 
<br/>prone to various environmental hazards, including cyclones, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis. These 
<br/>natural  calamities  have,  over  the  years,  brought  about  devastating  consequences,  prompting  the 
<br/>Government to prioritise disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response, our team at the NDMO has embarked on ongoing initiatives aimed at enhancing 
<br/>the  nation's  resilience  and  preparedness  in  the  face  of  natural  disasters.  To  understand  these 
<br/>initiatives, it is imperative to have a look at the historical background of natural disaster events that 
<br/>have plagued Fiji in the past. This historical perspective not only sheds light on the challenges faced 
<br/>by the country but also underscores the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding the lives 
<br/>and livelihoods of its people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  study  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  revealed  that  Fiji  is 
<br/>expected to incur climate change-related losses equivalent to 4 percent of our annual GDP by the 
<br/>year 2100 due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events, which will have 
<br/>adverse  effects  on  agriculture  and  the  broader  economy.  According  to  the  study,  Fiji  is  likely  to 
<br/>experience increased droughts, floods, and temperature spikes by 2070 with a potential temperature 
<br/>rise of 2 degrees Celsius from 1990 levels under a medium emissions scenario. Sea levels could also 
<br/>rise by as much as 1.41 metres by the year 2100. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Contextualising reality with theory, Mr. Speaker, Sir, observed sea levels have been rising at 
<br/>a rate of 4 millimetres per year from 1992 to 2018. Additionally, over the past 75 years, there has 
<br/>been a noticeable increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events. For the Nadi River, out of 84 
<br/>floods recorded since 1870, 54 flooding events alone occurred after 1980, with 26 major floods since 
<br/>1991. In January 2009, major flooding resulted in tragic consequences, including at least 11 fatalities, 
<br/></span><span>displacement of 12,000 people and economic damages amounting to US$54 million.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> was the strongest tropical cyclone to have hit the South 
<br/>Pacific  since  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  in  2016,  and  the  fourth  most  intense  tropical  cyclone  on  record  in  the 
<br/>Southern Pacific Basin causing significant destruction to infrastructure, buildings and livelihoods. It 
<br/>was  also  the  second  severe  tropical  cyclone  in  2020  after  </span><span>TC  Harold</span><span>,  impacting  Fiji  during  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic. Around 24,413 people were displaced, four deaths with one missing person 
<br/>recorded with economic damages mounting to over US$100 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>it is of utmost significance to acknowledge that the heightened occurrence 
<br/></span><span>of flooding and cyclones cannot be attributed solely to rising sea levels, temperature increases, or 
<br/>extreme  rainfall  events.  These  consequences  are  compounded  by  the  gradual  silting  and 
<br/>sedimentation of our river channels, primarily resulting from deforestation in the hinterland.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, various forms of development have led to the depletion of a significant portion 
<br/>of our mangrove fringe, a critical natural barrier against flooding and coastal erosion. Therefore, the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>imperative to take immediate action to prioritise resilience has never been more pressing than it is 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a significant concern for our small island nation is that 76 percent of our 
<br/>population resides within a 5-kilometre radius of the coast, making our homeland highly susceptible 
<br/>to  future  disasters.  Forty-two  vulnerable  communities  in  Fiji  have  been  identified  for  potential 
<br/>relocation. Our approach has transitioned towards involving disaster survivors in their own efforts to 
<br/>recover housing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this month, in partnership with the International Office of Migration (IOM) and Korea 
<br/>International Co-operation Agency (KOICA), we soft-launched the Evacuation Centre Retrofitting 
<br/>and Newly Built Guideline. This Guideline will undergo testing in all the evacuation centres that will 
<br/>be built and retrofitted through this project before it is finalised. It will also include a standard design 
<br/>for evacuation centres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster preparedness plays a critical role in the work of the NDMO due to 
<br/>the countries vulnerability as I have aforementioned.   We recognise that being well prepared for 
<br/>disasters is essential to saving lives, reducing the impact of damages to infrastructure and effectively 
<br/>managing emergency response operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The NMDO greatly appreciates the support received from its partners in its efforts to enhance 
<br/>disaster preparedness in Fiji. These partners, ranging from regional organisations to international aid 
<br/>agencies and donor countries have provided vital assistance in terms of financial resources, technical 
<br/>expertise  and  capacity  building.  With  their  support,  the  NDMO  has  been  able  to  strengthen  its 
<br/>capabilities in disaster response, early warning systems and community awareness programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture  that  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  New  Zealand 
<br/>government  for  its  investment  of  FJ$3.2  million  towards  providing  support  to  improve  disaster 
<br/>preparedness and response. The funding and support comprise a suite of interventions designed to 
<br/>increase the capacity of the NDMO to manage disaster awareness and response in Fiji. It will involve: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>technical assistance to the NDMO; 
<br/>upgrade of early warning and flood protection systems; 
<br/>construction of warehouses, upgrade of divisional Emergency Operation Centres; and  
<br/>development of information management system and preparedness and capacity building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working on upgrading the National Emergency Operations Centre 
<br/>for disaster preparedness and for monitoring and coordinating disaster response and relief operations. 
<br/>Some of our equipment that was damaged from </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> will be upgraded to ensure efficiency during 
<br/>disaster  operations.  I  am  pleased  to  inform  this  august  Parliament  that  in  collaboration  with  the 
<br/>Korean  National  Disaster Management  Institute, we are presently working on an ongoing  project 
<br/>titled the “Construction of the Forecasting and Warning System for Disaster Reduction Project in 
<br/>Fiji.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  installed  flood  early  warning  systems  within  the  Ba  Province  Catchment, 
<br/></span><span>encompassing four rainfall stations, seven water level stations and six warning posts. The primary 
<br/></span><span>objective of this joint project is to offer early warning to vulnerable communities, facilitating timely 
<br/>evacuations to safeguard lives and properties during flood events. The project had commenced on 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>May and is expected to conclude on 30</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji will pilot an initiative in partnership with the United Nations Office for 
<br/></span><span>the Coordination of Humanitarian Response (UNOCHA) to implement Anticipatory Action within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Central Emergency Response Funds. This initiative will receive US$2 million through the Fiji 
<br/>Cluster System to support Government priorities during disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anticipatory  action  aims  to  enhance  existing  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  frameworks  by 
<br/>enabling  pro-active  actions  and  financing  to  be  initiated  based  on  forecast  of  impending  hazards 
<br/>rather than waiting to respond after the disaster has occurred.  This approach is supported by growing 
<br/>evidence  suggesting  that  taking  action  before  a  predictable  shock  occurs  as  both  timely  and  cost 
<br/>effective, in addition to upholding human dignity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an aside, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  </span><span>TC Mal</span><span> if it had come directly towards  Viti Levu, this 
<br/>would have kicked into anticipatory action, meaning that funds would be issued to targeted groups 
<br/>along the path of the cyclone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  share  an  update  on  an  important  development  regarding 
<br/>Fiji’s  disaster  response  capabilities.  In  March  of  this  year,  the  Cabinet  granted  approval  for  the 
<br/>establishment of Fiji’s inaugural National Emergency Response Team (NERT).  It is my pleasure to 
<br/>inform this esteemed Parliament that the first induction training for our dedicated first responders 
<br/>took place from 2</span><span>nd</span><span> July to 9</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 35 Government Officials across 19 agencies took part in the exercise.  A training 
<br/>programme took place outdoors at the Ministry’s warehouse in Lautoka, where our participants were 
<br/>accommodated in the First Responders accommodation block on the premises. The training spent 
<br/>seven days and included a total of 85 learning hours with 24 hours dedicated to Simulation Exercise 
<br/>(SIMEX).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The training sessions focused on disaster response scenarios, including standardised tools and 
<br/>methodologies for efficient disaster response, specifically the Tropical Cyclone Response scenario 
<br/>during the learning sessions, and Earthquake and Tsunami Response scenario during the simulation 
<br/>exercise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having Fiji's own National Emergency Response Team (NERT) is crucial for 
<br/>a  swift  and  effective  response  to  disasters,  as  it  allows  for  local  expertise,  tailored  strategies, 
<br/>community empowerment and enhanced collaboration with international partners. Together, these 
<br/>factors contribute to a more resilient and prepared Fiji in the face of emergencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the significance of investing in disaster preparedness, the United 
<br/></span><span>Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has verified that investing just one US Dollar 
<br/></span><span>in risk reduction and prevention can save up to 15 US Dollars in</span><span> </span><span>post-disaster recovery. This reaffirms 
<br/>the significant impact and cost-effectiveness of prioritising risk reduction measures to mitigate the 
<br/>consequences of disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Cabinet’s approval for the National Emergency Response 
<br/>Team (NERT) mechanism, I am pleased to inform this Parliament that we had successfully completed 
<br/>a National Simulation Exercise focused on tsunami and earthquake scenarios marked as a key event 
<br/>in our National Disaster Awareness Week which was conducted from 12</span><span>th</span><span> October to 18</span><span>th</span><span> October, 
<br/></span><span>2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Disaster Awareness Week is mandated by the Natural Disaster 
<br/>Management Act 1998 to be conducted annually. This year’s Disaster Week was extra special, as we 
<br/>were graced by the attendance of Ms. Mami Mizutori, the Assistant Secretary-General and Special 
<br/>Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction at the UNDRR, marking it her 
<br/>first visit to the region.

<br/>in the Tsunami Simulation Drill and presenting our guest, Ms. Mizutori, with our ‘thank you’ token 
<br/>at the closing of the Disaster Week. I would also like to thank all honourable Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament who had participated on that day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  year’s  Disaster  Awareness  Week  started  with  training  conducted  by  the  Australian 
<br/>Disaster Assessment Response Team for three days and the first of its kind on Urban Search and 
<br/>Rescue, followed by a Communication Sub Exercise, an Academic session, Tsunami Drill, Marine 
<br/>Search and Rescue, Oil Spill, Urban Search and Rescue, with two full days of a public exhibition in 
<br/>tents on Albert Park.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The theme for this year's Disaster Awareness Week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was “Fighting Inequality 
<br/>for a Resilient Future”</span><span>.</span><span> It is a topic that not only underscores the challenges we face, but also the 
<br/>immense potential we have to create a more equitable and resilient world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the realm of disaster risk reduction, we often discuss strategies, early warning systems and 
<br/>preparedness. While these are undeniably crucial, we must also recognise that disasters do not affect 
<br/>all individuals or communities equally.  Inequality amplifies the impact of disasters and exacerbates 
<br/>the vulnerability of the marginalised and disadvantaged among us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through our active engagement and the involvement of our disaster risk reduction community, 
<br/>we have evaluated our collective level of readiness concerning earthquake and tsunami scenarios. 
<br/>Organisations have also assessed their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  However, what is the 
<br/>most significant is the relationships building and network creation of our first responders - a worthy 
<br/>investment we witnessed first-hand during the </span><span>TC Mal</span><span> response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  allow  me  to  provide  an  update  on  the  preliminary  damage  assessment  data 
<br/>analysis for </span><span>TC Mal</span><span>. Some districts are still conducting their assessments and we anticipate receiving 
<br/>more data by the end of this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Ba  Province,  a  total  of  four  homes  have  sustained  partial  damage.  Additionally,  two 
<br/>households have reported damage to their sanitation facilities, while three households have reported 
<br/>damage  to  their  kitchen.  Three  houses  have  experienced  damage  to  their  water  supply  systems, 
<br/>affecting 21 families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> A team is currently deployed to the Yasawa Group of Islands to conduct an Initial Damage 
<br/></span><span>Assessment (IDA) and so far, majority of the damages reported are from their agriculture farms. Food 
<br/>rations  have  been  deployed  to  alleviate  suffering,  while  we  collaborate  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture to normalise their food security and livelihood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023 National Disaster Awareness Week was, for the first time, where 
<br/>we  tried  out  this  scenario  event  where  we  attempted  to  simultaneously  evacuate  over  1,203 
<br/>individuals  from  16  different  locations  nationwide.  This  represents  the  largest  scale  evacuation 
<br/>exercise we have ever conducted at a national level. The seamless execution of this operation is a 
<br/></span><span>clear testament of the high level of professionalism that we now have in country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on these exercises, we are also comfortable that we can scale up evacuee numbers and 
<br/>locations nationwide, if the need arises. The evacuation encompassed a total of seven schools, one 
<br/>community, a hospital, the Suva Market, six businesses in the greater Suva area - all of which actively 
<br/>participated in the tsunami drill.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank them all for joining efforts with us and would like to extend a special 
<br/>acknowledgement to  the Pacific Disability Forum for their valuable contribution  to  the drill.  It  is 
<br/>important to recognise that every individual’s wellbeing is of utmost importance, and we are all on 
<br/>this collective journey together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my gratitude to our partners who collaborated with 
<br/>us in ensuring the success of the National Disaster Awareness Week - the New Zealand Government, 
<br/>the Australian Government, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the Pacific Community, UNDRR, UN 
<br/>Women, IFRC, UNICEF, UNOCHA, WFP, IOM, USAID and Walesi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  standing  resolute  in  our  commitment  to  the  principle  of  leaving  no  one 
<br/>behind, we have extended invitations to our neighbouring countries. Over 10 Pacific Island Countries 
<br/>actively participated in the exercise, with the inclusion of their respective Red Cross Offices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Early this month, Sir, we completed our operational readiness checks for evacuation centres 
<br/>and  emergency  operation  centres.  These  checks  are  crucial  for  assessing  preparedness  and 
<br/>effectiveness, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of individuals during emergencies and disasters. It 
<br/>was done just in time to coincide with </span><span>TC Mal</span><span>, and I suppose the results speak for themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government committed to making a significant commitment 
<br/>towards mainstreaming of the 122 Action Items  outlined in the National  Disaster Risk Reduction 
<br/>Policy. This commitment will be executed through a coordinated effort across Government agencies 
<br/>and Civil Society Organisations, following a whole-of-society approach.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to update this august Parliament that we have circulated the first draft of the 
<br/>Western Division Disaster Risk Reduction Plan. This marks the first plan for Fiji when Disaster Risk 
<br/>Reduction is integrated into our planning and development. We intend to complete this plan once all 
<br/>disaster historical analysis are finalised and incorporated into the programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  express  my  gratitude  to  all  the  people  of  Fiji  for  their 
<br/>cooperation  during  </span><span>TC  Mal</span><span>,  despite  uncertainties  about  the  cyclone’s  path.  We  successfully 
<br/>disseminated crucial lifesaving messages. The absence of casualties or injuries reflects remarkable 
<br/>collaboration and support from the public, businesses, the media and first responders. It is vital for 
<br/>all stakeholders, not just the Government, to unite during such times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Effective disaster response requires a collective effort and shared responsibility involving 
<br/></span><span>Government agencies, NGOs, community organisations, businesses and individuals. Collaborative 
<br/></span><span>preparedness activities, such as emergency planning, drills and resilient infrastructure investment, 
<br/>are key to minimising the impact of disasters and safeguarding lives and livelihoods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Early preparedness contributes to economic growth during emergencies when communities 
<br/>and  households  are  ready  with  robust  disaster  plans  and  mitigation  measures,  the  response  and 
<br/>recovery processes become more efficient. Swift action and minimal disruption allow businesses to 
<br/>recover faster, saving jobs and ensuring continuity in livelihoods. This resilience not only protects 
<br/>the economy but also fosters confidence in investors, contributing to long-term economic growth and 
<br/></span><span>stability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is essential to acknowledge that neglecting preparation is equivalent to preparing for failure.  
<br/>By working together and investing in early preparedness, we can bolster our resilience, protect our 
<br/>communities, and lay the foundation for economic growth even during times of emergency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Sir, I thank this august Parliament for giving me this opportunity.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2029 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or his designate, to deliver their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  bell  was,  indeed,  loud  enough  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister to end his statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  like  the  statement  made  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  on 
<br/>Google, stating their excitement about the project, we are equally excited too from this side to see 
<br/>that they are continuing the work that we have started and it is not about the politics, it is about Fiji, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister yesterday talked about this 
<br/>great partnership and participation of honourable Koya and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>as part of the COP 28 delegation.  We could be childish and refuse this, Sir, but we look at the big 
<br/>picture.  This is about Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We have served as Ministers for eight years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 
<br/>we have a lot to offer this Government.  So, I thank the honourable Minister for stating the state of 
<br/>preparedness, but this is nothing new.  The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) is where 
<br/>it is today because of the leadership of FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, NDMO is where it is today because of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership of FijiFirst.  No one can contest that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016, as we prepared for the World Humanitarian Summit in Turkey, we came up with a 
<br/>statement  and  this  was  the  main  statement  for  the  Pacific  because  we  are  linking  the  Sendai 
<br/>Framework, we are linking the SDG Goals, and we are also linking the Paris Agreement.  The change 
<br/>in our paradigm - what is that change, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The way we live is changing.  That is what  we call the ‘new norm’.  He talked about the 
<br/></span><span>changing rainfall pattern, the intensity and the frequency – that is the new norm, and we are the ones 
<br/>that suffer most.  We are amongst the most vulnerable because the way we live is changing.  The 
<br/>way we do development must also change.  Let us not do development just for the sake of doing 
<br/>development and I will continue to urge the honourable Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, 
<br/>when it comes to investing in DRR, the biggest problem that we used to face in the machinery of 
<br/>Government is we do not see money put into DRR as investment.  We always see it as expenditure, 
<br/>so that change the way we do development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister correctly stated about the need for us to shift to sustainability and 
<br/></span><span>resilience.  We have always talked about the debt.  This is linked to the debt that we had accumulated 
<br/>because every one dollar is going on $15 but usually the figure is around $7 saving for the country.  
<br/>That is good for us in the long term – for sustainability and for resilience as well because we need to 
<br/>prepare better come the next one.  If electric cables needs to go underground like we did in Nadi, it 
<br/>has to go underground because of the tourism industry and how it also contributes.  This is the change, 
<br/>the paradigm that we initiated, and I am thankful that it is continuing. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  the  way  we  live  is  changing,  the  way  we  do  development  has 
<br/>changed, the partnership is important.  Sustainable Development Goal 17 is about partnership and, 
<br/>again, the honourable Minister has talked about that partnership as so critical.  Within the country 
<br/>and, of course, regionally and the multi-lateral organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are well aware of the issue about forced migration and displacement 
<br/>and, unfortunately, the trend right now, there is no appetite multi-laterally on changing the 1951 UN 
<br/>Convention of Refugees and they are coming back to the regions now to look at ways.  This is why 
<br/>partnerships are so important.  We have done so much.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because  of  my  time,  Sir,  just  a  few  things  that  I  have  picked  up  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister’s speech that they probably need to look at.  He had talked about the 1998 Act – that Act 
<br/>has been under review now for the last four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  went  to  Tonga,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Tonga  has  come  up  with  a  new  Act  and  I 
<br/>congratulated the Tongan team. I told the Director NDMO, I do not know what is still happening 
<br/>with the Act in Fiji because that Act has been under review now for the last four years. I hope that, 
<br/>that can be fast-tracked, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our state of preparedness, I asked the honourable Minister about the state of our fleet because 
<br/>Fiji, given our layout, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are always worried about the islands.  The state of the 
<br/>jetties or otherwise, the state of the airfields and Australia has already done some work on the state 
<br/>of our airfields because air, land and sea passages is something that the Government should always 
<br/>be critically aware of when it comes to response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is prepositioning.  We have got the strategic reserve in 
<br/>Black Rock. We have got the warehouses in the North and in the Central Division, and hopefully we 
<br/>can  also  push  forward  prepositioning  in  the  outer  islands,  particularly  where  we  do  not  have  the 
<br/>infrastructure.  It is hard to get to Ono-i-Lau when it is low tide.  These are things that they need to 
<br/>consider in terms of our state of preparedness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the multi-hazard early warning system, that is a priority.  We need 
<br/>to  be  proactive  rather  than  reactive.    I  congratulate  Government  for  the  continuation  of  the  early 
<br/>warning systems when it comes to flooding, but we have to do a lot as well on our coastal areas. We 
<br/>have  installed  the  first  13  sirens  for  Suva,  there  is  a  plan  to  start  and  continue  from  Kiuva  right 
<br/>through to Rakiraki, but I do not know where that is now, and we hope that we can continue with 
<br/></span><span>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, again, I plead with the honourable Minister of Finance to invest in DRR. We have a 
<br/>DRR Policy. It is good for us in the long term because when it comes to sustainability and resilience, 
<br/>investment in DRR is the solution.  So, I plead with the Government, please, invest in our DRR and, 
<br/>of course, let us look at how we can continue to support the work of NDMO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, the work of NDMO is critical and needs the support of every stakeholder, so be assured 
<br/>honourable Minister and Government that we will always be available to support our Government in 
<br/></span><span>its DRR and DRM efforts.  Congratulations as well for the establishment of the National Emergency 
<br/></span><span>Response Team (NERT).  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plans for Self-Income Generating Agro-Based Projects  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is good to start speaking agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for some form of peace in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2031 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the plans for self-income generating agro-based projects 
<br/>in pursuit of agricultural diversification.  Just before I do so, I would like to thank all honourable 
<br/>Members of this august Parliament who managed to visit the National Agriculture Show and had a 
<br/>look at the 1.4 tonne bull.  Unfortunately, I did not see my good friend, honourable Bala, because  I 
<br/>would have introduced you to the Bull. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Next time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  On  the  same  token,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  just  received 
<br/>information  from  the  Animal  Health  and  Production  Division  that  we  have  finally  succeeded  in 
<br/>freezing  cattle  semen  in  Sigatoka  Research  Station.    I  must  commend  the  Animal  Health  and 
<br/>Production Division Officials for a job well done.  The process is quite hectic, and it requires the 
<br/>bulls be maintained on a formulated ratio to ensure their status as sexual athletes (forgive me for the 
<br/>language).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  semen  is  extracted  by  an  electric  ejaculation  and  analysed  and  processed  in  the 
<br/>reproductive laboratory, and then loaded into straws and frozen.  The semen is then stored in liquid 
<br/>nitrogen  tanks  ready  for  future  use  in  artificial  insemination.    Not  only  does  this  allow  for 
<br/>dissemination of genetics across Fiji, it also preserves the bull genetics that we currently have, and it 
<br/>is anticipated that at the current capacity of Sigatoka Research Breeding Centre, we will be able to 
<br/>produce in excess of 1,000 straws per week.  That is quite a lot of semen, enough to sustain the cattle 
<br/>industry in Fiji.  For your information, we will be receiving the liquid nitrogen generator, which is 
<br/>currently on order, and it is expected to arrive next month, and we will be expected to produce around 
<br/>20 litres of liquid nitrogen per day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the  honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy  Prime Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen seated in the gallery and those who are listening via live telecast of 
<br/>this sitting; I stand before this august Parliament today to outline a vision for the future of agriculture 
<br/>in Fiji - a vision that goes beyond traditional market practices and embraces a future for self-income 
<br/>generating agro-based projects or value added agriculture.  Our nation has long been blessed with 
<br/>fertile lands and a rich agricultural heritage, and it is time to adopt innovations that not only enhance 
<br/></span><span>productivity, but also create new opportunities for our farmers that contribute to greater economic 
<br/></span><span>growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need to shift from our over-dependence on fresh produce exports 
<br/>to value adding and agro-processing.  This shift has already started and augurs well for the sector 
<br/>given the vast distance to these new markets with the obvious advantage in extended shelf life of 
<br/>processed products.  There is also the advantage of reduced volume and increased value of exports.  
<br/>Australia and New Zealand are considered to be Fiji’s largest export market for fresh agricultural 
<br/>products,  but  Fiji  has  the  potential  to  expand  its  export  base  through  increased  efforts  on  agro-
<br/></span><span>processed products, targeting the huge markets like China and the USA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture production plays an important role in setting up small scale agro-
<br/>processes while at the same time, channelling any surplus raw materials to large agro-processes.  The 
<br/>value-added agriculture imports on average is around 53.6 percent of the total agricultural imports 
<br/>over the last five years.  Fiji also imports an average of $121 million worth of wheat for production 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of flour and other by-products.  This data indicates the importance of the domestic demand for value 
<br/>added products and flour in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, potential commodities for value added processing to name a few, include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Staples like cassava, plantain, sweet potato (gluten free flour, chips, starch and animal feed); 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Coconut flour, desiccated coconut, virgin coconut oil; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Lemon grass, moringa powder; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Ginger (candy, powder, paste or juice); 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Turmeric powder; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Pulses to substitute the amount of dhal consumption; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Tomato (tomato juice, puree and canning of peeled tomatoes); 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Pineapple (juice, candy and fruit canning); 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Duruka; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mango and other local fruits for jam, pickles and juice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Various  methods  of  preserving  fruits  and  vegetables  can  be  explored  such  as  canning, 
<br/>refrigeration, drying, pickling, sugar preservation and others. There is a lot of traditional knowledge 
<br/>that could be expanded with modern technology.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my recent visit to India was an eye opener to the opportunities that small 
<br/>scale food processing can bring to the economy. Fiji needs to mobilise resources that are needed to 
<br/>exploit opportunities in the agro-processing space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years  agricultural  production  in  India  has  consistently  recorded  higher  output  and 
<br/>according  to  World  Agriculture  2019  India  has  been  ranked  first  in  pulses  and  milk  production; 
<br/>second in vegetable, fruit, wheat and rice production and third in cereals and egg production.  Their 
<br/>food processing sector grew at an average annual growth rate of 8.4 percent between 2016 to 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of this august Parliament I had the opportunity to meet 
<br/>with the Minister for Food Processing Industries of India and key amongst matters discussed was the 
<br/>possibility of bringing to Fiji those small scale food processing equipment and machineries. These 
<br/>will be made available to those individuals and communities willing to venture into food processing 
<br/>enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year the Ministry was allocated a sum of $150,000 which 
<br/>assisted  11  exporters/agro-processors  from  the  four  Divisions  on  a  cost  sharing  basis  for 
<br/>infrastructure development, provision of equipment, machinery and I must say that more funds is 
<br/>needed for this activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues to  embark on modernising Fiji’s agriculture sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through agriculture entrepreneur’s mechanisation and agro-processing through value addition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This financial year the Commercial Agriculture Development Programme (CADP) received 
<br/>$1.177 million to establish and upgrade agro-processing facilities to facilitate the transformation of 
<br/></span><span>raw agriculture products into high value processed goods.  This will not only address current issues 
<br/></span><span>with the market access of commodities like ginger, turmeric, cassava and pineapple but also achieve 
<br/>sustainable economic growth through consistency in supply, increased export competitiveness, value 
<br/>addition and diversification.  The programme includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Manufacturing machines for value adding cassava, pineapple, ginger; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Procurement of cooler and freezer storage facilities;

<br/>Infrastructure  development  such  as  establishment  or  improvement  of  packhouse  and 
<br/>processing or exporting facilities; 
<br/>Procurement of equipment for diversification purposes, such as cassava flour machines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  the  existing  capital  programmes  including  crop,  livestock  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>research, the Ministry is seeking to fund and scale-up the following areas for diversification: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Promotion of high value crops: The Ministry will identify and promote the cultivation of 
<br/>high-value crops with high market demands such as organic fruits and exotic vegetables.  
<br/>Creating such market linkages for these crops will ensure steady income for farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment in Post-Harvest Research  and  Infrastructure: The Ministry  will  upgrade  and 
<br/>expand  post-harvest  infrastructure  including  storage  facilities  and  farm  access  roads  to 
<br/>minimise post-harvest losses and ensure the quality of agricultural products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Capacity  Building  and  Training:  The  Ministry  will  provide  training  programs  and 
<br/>initiatives for farmers, individuals and communities on value addition techniques, quality 
<br/>control,  and  market  trends.    The  Ministry  will  further  collaborate  with  academia  and 
<br/>research organisations to develop expertise in value-added agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technology adoption: The Ministry will encourage the adoption of modern technologies in 
<br/>agriculture such as precision farming, smart irrigation systems and advanced processing 
<br/>equipment.  The Ministry will facilitate the integration of information and communication 
<br/>technologies to improve farm management and market access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Certification and standards: The Ministry will work with relevant government agencies to 
<br/>establish  and  enforce  quality  standards  and  certifications  for  value-added  agriculture 
<br/>products to enhance consumer confidence and facilitate exports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): The Ministry will encourage partnerships between the 
<br/>public and private sectors to leverage investments and expertise in value-added agriculture.  
<br/>The Ministry through these partnerships especially private sector involvement will create a 
<br/>conducive environment for agri-business to thrive through policy support and incentives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Market  Diversification:  The  Ministry  intends  to  reduce  dependence  by  exploring  and 
<br/>diversifying  export  markets  for  value-added  agriculture  products.  The  Ministry  in 
<br/>collaboration  with  other  key  stakeholders  will  develop  marketing  strategies  to  promote 
<br/>Fijian agricultural products internationally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plans for value-added agriculture in Fiji are ambitious but necessary for 
<br/>the sustainable growth of the agriculture sector.  As we embark on this journey, let us remember that 
<br/>the  success  of  these  plans  depends  on  the  collective  efforts  of  farmers,  policymakers  and  all 
<br/>stakeholders in the agricultural value chain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  sector  is  capable  of  addressing  critical  issues  of  food  and  nutrition 
<br/>security, food inflation and alleviating poverty.  I call upon each one of you to join hands in realising 
<br/>this  vision,  for  in  doing  so,  we  not  only  secure  a  prosperous  future  for  our  farmers  and  agro-
<br/>processors but also contribute to the overall development and prosperity of our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for providing me the opportunity to deliver this Statement.  </span><span>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister for Agriculture. Those are very interesting 
<br/>topics  of  the  bull  and  what  you  are  able  to  get  out  from  the  bull,  especially  with  your  Assistant 
<br/>Minister there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to deliver their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  CHAND.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  reply  to  the  Ministerial  Statement  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture.  I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his insights on 
<br/>the  agriculture  sector  and  I  always  said  it  and  I  must  reiterate  again  that  irrespective  of  how  many 
<br/>industries we have in the country, irrespective of how many factories we have in the country, Fiji is still 
<br/>an agro-based industry and each and every Member, each and every individual to support the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must congratulate the Agriculture team for successfully freezing the AI straws.  It is a good start 
<br/>but what I was trying to hear from the Minister was, what is happening to the dairy industry?  Are we 
<br/>also concentrating on the dairy industry?  That is the industry that needs a lot of support and unfortunately 
<br/>not a word has been said about the dairy industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The animals are decreasing due to disease and the production is decreasing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Now,  the  meat  industry  is  good  but  the  dairy  industry  should  also  be 
<br/>concentrated on value adding which the Minister has talked about is good for the country and good 
<br/>for export but this trust has been ongoing for ages. Last year at Koronivia Research Station there was 
<br/>a trial display, and we all went there to taste how the cassava flour tasted and everything else.  So 
<br/>this  has  all  been  done.    Why  are  we  trying  to  reinvent  the  wheel  again,  why  are  we  not  moving 
<br/>forward?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Timely introduction of technology: The extension services need to go out to the farmers and 
<br/>improve production, introduce technology, train farmers.  It is no good sitting in the office or in the 
<br/>research station doing trials when the knowledge is not being transferred to the people that really 
<br/>needs to produce.  What are we doing to control the cost of production in the agriculture sector?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Day  in  and  day  out  the  cost  of  production  on  farms  is  increasing.    The  fertiliser  cost  is 
<br/>increasing, the sea cost is increasing, the labour cost is increasing, what support are we going to give 
<br/>to our agriculture sector to enable farmers to produce?  It is good to say we will value add but value 
<br/>add what? We need production on the ground for the produce to come up and then we value add. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is a very minute amount which the honourable Minister of Finance is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talking about.  You go to the farm and see how much assistance they are getting - it is negligible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I would highly recommend our Minister of Finance to get off from his four 
<br/>wheel drive, get out of his overseas trips and go to the farm and talk to the farmers.  It is no good 
<br/>sitting here and saying ‘we give subsidy, we give fertiliser subsidy, seed subsidy’ no, talk to the

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmers ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Go and talk to the farmers and then you will understand the plight of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not do the BBQ from the road like you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- That statement is uncalled for and I must remind the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Finance, I do not do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I do not do that and you should retrack your statement.  You know the facts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then you say something about it. What are we going to do about the supply chain management?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- There is a huge disparity …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Minister for Finance, are you done with your childish statement so I can 
<br/>continue?  If you need time to do some more, I will give you time then I will continue.  Grow up, 
<br/>please!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are we doing about our supply chain management?  There is a huge disparity in the 
<br/>income of farmers in Bua, Nabouwalu Vanua Levu and farmers here. They do not have access to 
<br/>markets because of the supply chain.  They cannot take their produce from their farm to the market 
<br/>in a quality that is palatable to the buyers.  We need investment in the supply chain. These things are 
<br/>not being done - market accessibility and supply chain management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are investments that the Ministry need to do, getting the farmers to increase production, 
<br/>train them, assist them, our farmers need support.  You may see a doctor once in two months, you 
<br/>may see a lawyer once in six months, but you see a farmer everyday and every time you put something 
<br/></span><span>in your mouth, that is the produce from a farmer.   So, we must appreciate their hard work and assist 
<br/></span><span>them in improving production and getting their produce to the market so that they can sell, survive 
<br/>and our consumers can get good quality products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not need to import all the produce that are being imported. Most of it can be grown 
<br/>locally  and  supplied  in  better  quality.    So,  if  we  can  give  them  an  opportunity  to  produce  in  an 
<br/>environment where they can bring it to the markets, we are helping our farmers and our country.
