<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK 2020-2021 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled 
<br/>its Report on the Fiji Development Bank 2020-2021 Report in July early this year. The Committee 
<br/>noted  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  achieved  a  net  profit  of  $0.99  million,  in  comparison  to  $1.14 
<br/>million in the 2020 Financial Year. Furthermore, the lending portfolio recorded profits for both years: 
<br/>$541.88 million in 2020 and it grew to $618 million in 2021, despite COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Development  Bank  witnessed  the  impacts  of  the  novel  coronavirus,  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, tropical cyclones and subsequent floods. The Bank then implemented the strategies that 
<br/>prioritised business continuity and resilience.  The Committee received submissions from the Chief 
<br/>Executive  Officer  of  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB);  government  ministries  and  other  relevant 
<br/>institutions such as the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council and Business Assistance Fiji to understand 
<br/>the assistance they provide to FDB customers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee identified the gaps and duplications amongst stakeholders and recognised the 
<br/>need for collaborative efforts between the government ministries and other stakeholders to assist the 
<br/>applicants and customers of FDB to succeed in their business venture.  The Committee was updated 
<br/>on  the  Agro-Photovoltaic  project  in  Levuka.    It  was  noted  that  there  were  delays  in  its 
<br/>implementations  and  request  for  urgent  action  to  be  taken  by  Government  to  expedite  the 
<br/>commencement of the project.  The Committee commends the bank in assisting several customers 
<br/>with working capital loans during the pandemic by borrowing from the Reserve Bank of Fiji through 
<br/>its Disaster Recovery and Contentment Facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate.  Before I offer the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor, I have a list from the honourable Whips and the speakers are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>honourable Semi Koroilavesau; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before going into the FDB Report, let me 
<br/>just highlight a correction on the issue on PAFCO.  I wanted to talk to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister  Kamikamica  and  highlight  the  issue,  but  I  could  not  get  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Fisheries to be there so that I can double check that the facts that I was going to state are correct, that 
<br/>is why I am highlighting it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, licences: Licences are restricted to 60 and they are all local companies that fish within 
<br/></span><span>Fiji’s  EEZ.    If  any  other  foreign  vessel  that  is  licensed  in  Fiji,  it  is  licensed  to  unload  and  load, 
<br/></span><span>establish their business here but they fish outside the open waters or in other territorial EEZ of other 
<br/>neighbouring countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, is the unloading of catches.  For PAFCO, this is driven by price so most of the 
<br/>fishing  vessels  that come here  are attracted to  more better pricing  overseas and they prefer to  be 
<br/>loaded into containers and sent out especially for raw tuna.

<div><span>  Consolidated Review Report – FDB 2020-2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report 
<br/>of FDB for 2020 to 2021.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will comment on the findings and recommendation by 
<br/>the Economic Affairs Committee.  The Committee noted the increase in not performing loan portfolio 
<br/>during  the  period  under  review.    The  Committee  recommends  the  strong  collaboration  of  FDB, 
<br/>government ministries and other stakeholders to assist the clients of FDB in improving operations of 
<br/>their business.  I will highlight this later in my contribution because it is one of the issues that is 
<br/>affecting the operation of FDB. There seems to be some disconnections with the sporting ministries, 
<br/>live agencies especially with Ministry of Fisheries and Ministry of Agriculture, Small Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted a good opportunity that is provided by government 
<br/>agency called Business Assistance Fiji (BAF).  That small agency actually can help especially for 
<br/>iTaukei  landowners  that  would  like  to  go  into  business.    The  BAF  has  a  small  office  (I  think  in 
<br/>Victoria Parade) it is only consists of three and they have Government fundings.  What they do is, 
<br/>they take in the project, they work it and then they allocate a consultant to help the small businesses 
<br/>to go to the various bank agency in Fiji to assist them to obtain their loan.  I will highly recommend 
<br/>to small businesses to go through BAF if they want to improve their opportunity to get loans from 
<br/>loaning agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  after  thorough  discussions  with  FDB  as  I  have  alluded  to  that 
<br/>Government  Ministries  really  need  to  coordinate  their  activities  in  conjunction  with  the  loan 
<br/>portfolios that have been given out by FDB.  It is a development bank, and we appreciate the fact 
<br/>that they actually have a lot of threats that can damage their loan portfolio.  It is very important for 
<br/>Government agencies and Government Ministries to assist them to work through the repayment and 
<br/>schedules  that  have  been  set  with  our  local  population  especially  our  resource  owners  in  our 
<br/>communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was pleased to note that the Fiji Development Bank dedicated a section of its 
<br/>report to include the progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that was 
<br/>relevant to them. In 2020 the bank has its financial solution such as the Agriculture Family Loan 
<br/>facility that ensures women are actively involved in business as well as promotes the use of renewable 
<br/>energy  projects  within  farms  as  solar  irrigations.  Further  the  bank  exports  credit  facility,  imports 
<br/>substitution and export finance facility and other financial available for the agriculture sector which 
<br/>contribute towards achieving various targets in the National Development Plan and the Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  quickly  one  of  the  highlights  of  our  review  was  the  Northern 
<br/></span><span>Development Programme (NDP) and we highly recommended that the other Divisions in Fiji follow 
<br/></span><span>that pattern because it has materialised and uplifted the lives of our people in the Northern Division.  
<br/>We have suggested that the other Division in Fiji follow suit and do the similar investment through 
<br/>NDP and I would urge Government to imitate that to the other Divisions to assist our local people to 
<br/>invest in our economy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute towards the Consolidated 
<br/>Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  2020-2021  Annual  Report.  Before  I  commence,  I 
<br/>would like to thank the Standing Committee for doing a marvellous job in assessing the Report as 
<br/></span><span>well as come up with very practical observations as well as considerations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Development  Bank,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  promotion  of 
<br/>development in the rural areas and most importantly in the agriculture sector. This is one of the key 
<br/>mandate of the Fiji Development Bank that is clearly stipulated in the Fiji Development Act 1966. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with agriculture as a key sector which benefits the most, the 2020-2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Consolidated Review Report – FDB 2020-2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2083 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report has highlighted that FDB has closed to 51 percent of the total market share in Fiji.  In 
<br/>the  agriculture  sector  of  its  91  percent  of  these  loans  are  in  the  category  of  sugarcane  farming.  
<br/>Therefore,  it  is  very  encouraging  to  witness  such  expensive  assistance  to  our  sugarcane  farmers.  
<br/>However, I also urge FDB management to also fund innovative solutions and packages for other sub-
<br/>sectors of agri-business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, echoing the sentiments shared by the Standing Committee to venture 
<br/>out to other non-sugar sectors and unconventional farming projects, such as, agricultural value chain, 
<br/>financing  which  was  piloted  with  a  baby  ginger  industry.    Despite  there  is  a  decline  in  the  loan 
<br/>portfolio from 2019 to 2022, in 2019 it was $110 million, by the end of 2022, it has gone down to 
<br/>$91 million, even though there is a decline, there is room for improvement.  The FDB management 
<br/>to  encourage  a  review  of  the  products  that  are  currently  on  hand  as  well  as  the  promotion  and 
<br/>participation of our people in the agricultural sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as also alluded to earlier by honourable Koroilavesau, I think there is a need 
<br/>for the Bank to actually review the import substitution facility as well as the export financial facility 
<br/>with the Reserve Bank of Fiji to ensure that there is a promotion of activities.  We are still importing 
<br/>more rice and lamb chops from overseas, so there is opportunity there to venture into sheep farming.  
<br/>I believe we are working with the Ministry of Agriculture, we should be able to venture into some of 
<br/>these industries which is going to impact the economy greatly.  We urge the FDB management to 
<br/>consider  increasing  sector  portfolio,  market  share  to  reserve  related  ventures,  business  process, 
<br/>outsourcing projects and sustainable renewal energy projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FDB is accredited to the Green Climate Fund being the first development 
<br/>bank in the South Pacific to achieve this amazing achievement.  Through the Green Climate Fund, 
<br/>the Bank undertook the first agrophotovoltaic project in Fiji and the region.  It is a great initiative for 
<br/>Levuka, however, due to unfortunate delays, this project has to be realised.  I urge those involved in 
<br/>the project to work towards setting realistic targets and achieving results for our old capital.  Another 
<br/>issue that was raised was the large number of portfolios because of the effects of COVID-19.  It is 
<br/>very  important  for  the  Board  and  the  management  to  device  immediate  plans  in  the  recovery  of 
<br/>payment of those loans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  aptly  highlighted  by  the  Standing  Committee,  FDB  as  well  as  the 
<br/>Business Assistance Fiji to work closely in assisting the loan applications over the potential Micro 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprise clients.  With those few words, I once again thank the FDB Board and 
<br/>management for the 2020 and 2021 Annual Report and I hereby support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for their 
<br/>contribution,  and  also  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  for  the  presentation  of  the  Report  and 
<br/>highlighting some of the key issues within the Bank in the period of the review.  The Bank’s history 
<br/>is  one which has  been tasked to  stimulate and  facilitate the promotion of development  of natural 
<br/>resources, in particular, agriculture sector, transportation and other MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My first job, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was with FDB and I remember the late Laisenia Qarase used 
<br/>to be the Managing Director of the Bank.   Even then the focus of the Bank was Small, Medium 
<br/></span><span>Enterprises, unsecured loans and many of them, a good percentage of those who helped by the Bank 
<br/></span><span>would go on and develop further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bank,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  already  embarked.  We  have  a  new  Board,  and  the 
<br/>management  are  working  very  well.  They  were  embarked  on  a  new  five-year  strategic  plan.  The 
<br/>focus will be a value driven organisation. We expect the Bank to create a more open, less hierarchical 
<br/>organisation by having few layers between the staff and management. Obviously, the interaction of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>2084 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Consolidated Review Report – FDB 2020-2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Board with the Management in a much more inclusive and closer manner is expected to produce 
<br/>those results and allow the Bank to implement the strategic plan in a much better way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  on  the  Report  for  the  review  period,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  obviously  the  Bank  has  gone 
<br/>through  a  lot  of  experience  and  learning  exercises  in  terms  of  the  natural  disaster  by  providing 
<br/>financial assistance and supporting the business continuity and recovery of some of the businesses at 
<br/>that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously concerns about the Non-Performing Loans (NPL). Again, transition from COVID, 
<br/>we saw a lot of growth in 2022 and now in 2023 the Bank is obviously on a much better footing in 
<br/>terms of recovery.  And because of the strong growth in the economy, strong performance of not only 
<br/>the  tourism  sector  but  also  a  very  strong  pick-up  in  business  generally  has  allowed  the  Bank  to 
<br/>improve its repayments and we expect the Non-Performing Loans to decline much faster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bank is also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, working very closely with the different ministries and 
<br/>honourable  Koroilavesau  is  correct.    I  think  some  of  the  key  Ministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry ought to work very closely with the Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank. These are some of the things that we have talked about before in this Parliament where we said 
<br/>that  the  FDB’s  mandate  really  should  be  to  focus  on  supporting  Small  Medium  Enterprises, 
<br/>particularly those in the natural resource-based sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that, Mr. Speaker, the good news about the Bank’s future, the FDB has been producing 
<br/>recently very remarkable results in terms of not only the change from very low profit to increase in 
<br/>profit in 2022, but the most important feature that we see is the doubling of the account holders from 
<br/>4,500 to around 9,300 in 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  looks  like  that  the  Bank  is  on  track  to  hit  the  10,000  mark  very  soon.    I  think  it  is  an 
<br/>indication of the refocus and the close cooperation between the FDB board and the management team 
<br/>and I want to thank the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Darmend Gounder, CEO and the management 
<br/>for taking on board the Government’s vision and priority in terms of supporting the Small Medium 
<br/>Enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The launch of the FDB Loan for Women Entrepreneurs, in the last four months, I am told that 
<br/>the Bank received 4,000 applications, approved about 1,000 loans totalling about $2.5 million.  In 
<br/>terms of the overall figure, Sir, it may not sound very big but if you are looking at thousand loans 
<br/>individually, it proves the point that the Bank is really focusing on the small, medium enterprises and 
<br/></span><span>the pleasing thing is that these are women entrepreneurs who are actually engaging with the Bank.  
<br/></span><span>Most of it is unsecured loans so in other words they do not need any security, all they have to do is 
<br/>to present good proposals, the Bank will assess it and if the feasibility shows that it is going to be 
<br/>successful, they get that as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point in relation to this, all these applications came digitally, it was launched very 
<br/>early this year.  A lot of the women who were applying, they actually expanded the reach to outer 
<br/>islands  such  as  Batiki,  Cikobia,  Gau,  Kadavu,  Koro,  Lakeba,  Moala,  Moce,  Moturiki,  Ovalau, 
<br/>Rotuma and Vanuabalavu.  All these were done digitally (online applications). Again it is a good 
<br/></span><span>innovation and it will allow the Bank to improve its financial literacy programme as well.  In fact 
<br/></span><span>earlier this year they also launched a new financial literacy programme and that I think is going to 
<br/>bring the Bank back to one of the key original objectives and that is to support the small, medium 
<br/>enterprises and more particularly those which are linked with the natural resource sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I want to thank the Chairman, Board and the management for 
<br/>taking on the new approaches and making sure that the Bank is getting back on its original objectives

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their contribution towards the Report. As highlighted by some honourable Members, it is critical that 
<br/>FDB and other stakeholders forge strong partnership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The issue of access to non-sugarcane farmers has been highlighted and it is very critical and 
<br/>perhaps  more  allocation  and  attention  to  be  given  to  the  non-sugarcane  sector.    Sir,  FDB  has 
<br/>formulated other innovative products towards women and SMEs and we should encourage FDB to 
<br/>continue along this innovative path.
