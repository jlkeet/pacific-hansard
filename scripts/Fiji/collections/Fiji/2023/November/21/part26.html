<h3>ANNEXURE I</h3>
<div><span>ANNEXURE I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Hon. V.T.T.K Rayalu) 
<br/></span><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to the question by honourable S. Nand is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways’  five-year Strategic Development Plan  (SDP) 
<br/>has  five  key  Strategic  Priority  Areas.  Strategic  Priority  Area  4  of  the  SDP  aims  to  establish  and 
<br/>improve  commercial  agriculture  to  accelerate  the  process  in  transitioning  smallholder  farmers  to 
<br/>semi  commercial and commercial  level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has registered 24,174 agricultural households in Fiji, who grow vegetables at 
<br/></span><span>subsistence,  semi-commercial  and  commercial  level.  About  370  of  those  farmers  are  growing 
<br/>vegetables at commercial level, utilising a minimum 1 hectare of  land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total number of commercial vegetable farmers in Fiji by Division is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•  </span><span>Central - 66 farmers (63 male and 3  female); 
<br/></span><span>•  </span><span>Eastern - 13 farmers (9 male and 4  female); 
<br/></span><span>•  </span><span>Northern - 10 farmers (9 male and 1  female); and 
<br/></span><span>•  </span><span>Western - 281 farmers (272 male and 9 female). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  it  is  worth  noting  that  44  percent  of  total  commercial  vegetable  farmers  are 
<br/>registered under the Bilateral Quarantine Agreement (BQA) - farmers who influence the export of 
<br/>fresh/chilled vegetables in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  5  percent  of  commercial  vegetable  farmers  in  Fiji  are  female.  The  Western 
<br/>Division continues to dominate vegetable farming in Fiji, mainly from the salad bowl – Sigatoka, 
<br/>where 40 percent of commercial vegetable farmers are located. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  is  assisting  commercial  vegetable  farmers 
<br/>through the Commercial Agriculture Development Programme (CADP) and Commercial Farmers 
<br/>Equity Package (CFEP). These Programmes are designed to specifically address targeted outcomes 
<br/>of Strategic Priority Area 4 of the SDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  CADP  encompasses  component  of  the  existing  Demand  Driven  Approach  (DDA) 
<br/>Programme, Food Security Programme (FSP), Export Promotion Programme (EPP) and Rural and 
<br/>Outer Island (ROI) Programme.  The CADP for vegetable farmers will provide borehole assistance 
<br/></span><span>for irrigation to farmers during the dry season in the Western and Central Divisions, while scoping 
<br/></span><span>has been done for the Northern Division, to be implemented in the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  CFEP  directly  supports  commercial  farmers  to  improve  their  capacity  to  expand 
<br/>production  through  the  provision  of  loan  equity  in  partnership  with  the  Fiji Development  Bank 
<br/>(FDB). Moreover, the assistance is to inspire existing local commercial farmers to acquire financial

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support outside Government, that will modernise their agriculture  production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the Ministry has other capital programmes which support commercial vegetable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farming through the  following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Highland Farming Programme  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Focusses on the highlands of Western Division (Sigatoka, Nadarivatu and Saivou in the 
<br/>Ra Province). This Programme includes provision of planting materials, infrastructure 
<br/>development (land clearing, construction of drains), protective structures, crates and 
<br/>small farm equipment (irrigation kit and rototiIler). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Agriculture Extension Services  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provides farm support on supply of vegetable seeds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Farm Mechanisation Programme  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Purchase of machines (tractor and digger and rice harvester) on one-third and two-third 
<br/>basis where the farmer contributes one-third of the total cost and the Ministry contributes 
<br/>t w o - t h i r d . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Small Farming Equipment  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The supply of small farming equipment on one-third and two-third basis (mini rototiller, 
<br/>power tiller, dryers and portable value adding machines). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will assist commercial vegetable farmers in Fiji through the following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>measures: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Research and Development Support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has allocated funds for research and development initiatives focused on 
<br/>improving vegetable varieties, pest and disease management, and sustainable farming 
<br/>practices.  This  has  been  done  through  establishing  partnerships  with  agricultural 
<br/>research institutions to facilitate the transfer of technology and knowledge to farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Training and Extension Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry organizes training programs and workshops to educate farmers on modern 
<br/>and  efficient  farming  techniques,  including  crop  rotation,  irrigation  methods,  and 
<br/>organic  farming  practices.  The  Ministry  also  strengthens  its  extension  services  to 
<br/></span><span>provide timely information and advice to farmers on best practices, market trends, and 
<br/></span><span>weather forecasts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure Development 
<br/>The Ministry has invested in rural infrastructure such as farm access roads, irrigation 
<br/>systems, and storage facilities to enhance the overall efficiency of the supply chain and 
<br/>reduce  post-harvest  losses  in  vegetable  farming.  The  Ministry  also  supports  the 
<br/>establishment  of  farmers'  cooperatives  to  improve  collective  bargaining  power  and 
<br/>facilitate the sharing of resources and knowledge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Market Access and Linkages 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  facilitates  the  creation  of  market  linkages  and  diversification  between 
<br/>farmers  and  agribusinesses,  supermarkets,  tourism  sector  and  export  markets.  For 
<br/>instance,  large  scale  maize  production  is  currently  being  discussed  to  replace  wheat 
<br/></span><span>imports for livestock feed reducing our import bill. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>iii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Data Collection and Analysis 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has a comprehensive database on vegetable production, market price, and 
<br/>market trends to aid in informed decision-making and policy formulation. With the use 
<br/>of  data  analytics  helps  to  identify  emerging  challenges  and  opportunities  in  the 
<br/>vegetable farming sector and tailor support programs  accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Promotion of Value-Added  Products 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  encourages  the  development  of  value-added  products  from  vegetables, 
<br/>such as processing facilities for canning, drying, or freezing, to enhance the income of 
<br/>farmers and promote economic diversification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Environmental  Conservation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry promotes sustainable farming practices that focus on soil conservation, 
<br/>water management, and biodiversity preservation to ensure the long-term viability of 
<br/>commercial vegetable farming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  by  addressing  these  areas,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  can 
<br/>significantly  assist  farmers  and  contribute  to  the  success  sustainability  of  commercial  vegetable 
<br/>farming, fostering economic growth and food security.
