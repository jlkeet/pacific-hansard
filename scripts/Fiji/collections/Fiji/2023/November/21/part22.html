<br/>2019 which was tabled on 5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2067 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation  oversees  three  departments  -  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare,  the  Department  of 
<br/>Women and the Department of Poverty Monitoring Unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department  of  Social  Welfare  administers  Fiji’s  Social  Welfare  Programmes  which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>include the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Poverty Benefits Scheme; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Child Protection Allowance; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Food Voucher Programme; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Social Pension Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  managing  these  Programmes,  the  Department  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  assistance  target 
<br/>those most in need and eliminating corruption and fraud in the process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Department’s statutory responsibilities to ensure the protection and wellbeing 
<br/>of children which includes managing Juvenile Centres.  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the Department 
<br/>also manages three State-owned homes for senior citizens and plays a leading role in the National 
<br/>Council for Older Persons and the National Coordinating Committee for Children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Women and Children is responsible for mainstreaming gender in the Public 
<br/>Service through the National Gender Policy and does so by promoting and protecting the Rights of 
<br/>Women and Girls through the implementation of the National Women’s Plan of Action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the National Women’s Plan of Action is aimed at boosting women’s employment 
<br/>opportunities,  increasing  women’s  participation  in  decision  making,  eliminating  violence  against 
<br/>women and girls, improving Women’s Access to Basic Services and Addressing Women’s issues in 
<br/>new legislations.  The Department works with other Ministries to promote gender equality, to ensure 
<br/>gender perspective are addressed in all Government policies and initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Department  of  Poverty  Monitoring  Unit  evaluates  Government’s  poverty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>related programmes and makes policy recommendations to the Ministry and Cabinet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department is committed to ensuring that all such programmes deliver tangible outcomes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that improved livelihoods and reduce poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the 2018-2019 financial year, the Ministry received its highest budget over the 
<br/>years.  This  had  enabled  the  Ministry  to  provide  better  for  the  welfare  of  the  neediest  Fijians  by 
<br/>sustaining all existing social and protections programmes administered by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry continues to work in collaboration with its stakeholders and partners 
<br/>from Government and civil society to ensure the best possible results were obtained from its work 
<br/>and reviewed areas that needed improvement for better service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry continued the implementation of its plan in place for policy changes, 
<br/></span><span>projects,  programmes  and  better  adherence  to  international  governing  instruments  of  the  United 
<br/>Nations  and  other  international  and  regional  organisations  that  Fiji  has  ratified  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>benefits of its clientele.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Committee  is  yet  to  receive  the  substantive  response  on  the  Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee Report as according to Standing Order 121(6)(b) which requires the agency to provide

<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>its response within 21 days of receiving the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  The  floor  is  now  open  for  debate,  honourable  Members.  I  have  a  list  of 
<br/>speakers before me supplied by the Whips. There are two each from both the Government and the 
<br/>Opposition.  Honourable  Tuinaceva  will  lead  the  batting  followed  by  the  Minister  for  Women, 
<br/>honourable Tabuya and then followed by honourable Sachida Nand and then it should be rounded of 
<br/>by the honourable Assistant Minister Sashi Kiran. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  give  my  contribution  on  the  motion 
<br/>before Parliament. At the outset I just want to thank the Committee for the work done in putting the 
<br/>Report together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation, Item 4.2 of the Report the call to the Ministry to work in collaboration 
<br/>with  other  relevant  Government  agencies  and  NGOs  to  address  and  reduce  the  number  of  street 
<br/>dwellers.  The simple term most people understand is ‘homeless’, the modern term they use nowadays 
<br/>in many countries is “streetism.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, to be honest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am disappointed that we have decided to settle for 
<br/></span><span>second best which is to reduce and not to eradicate street dwelling problems in our country. There 
<br/></span><span>are countries that do not have homeless problems or the lowest rate. They have successfully battled 
<br/>homelessness by focusing on prevention, early intervention and a comprehensive support system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  talk  about  a  special  case  of  extreme  concern,  and  that  is  the 
<br/>increase in the number of children who are below the age of 16, who are dwellers, especially in Suva.  
<br/>I always want to believe that with the kind of family values and network, religion and </span><span>vanua </span><span>systems 
<br/>in our community, on which it is founded on, no one should be homeless in this country. I do not 
<br/>think that we have reached a crisis point. I believe that we better work, or deal with this problem and 
<br/>we still can do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The figures released in 2018 and 2019 Report says that 37 minors roamed or lived in towns 
<br/>but have been returned home.  A survey conducted by a prominent media agency in 2022 stated that 
<br/>close to 20 children, the youngest being nine, live and sleep under Stinson Parade Bridge every night 
<br/>and they do not want to return home. However, in June this year, it was confirmed by mthe Police 
<br/>through a media report that there were more than 30 adults and children living on our streets, namely 
<br/>Suva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through </span><span>talanoa </span><span>with the children themselves, we found out that there were 
<br/></span><span>more  than  20  children  alone  who  were  homeless  in  Suva.  They  get  shelters  to  sleep  at  Thurston 
<br/>Garden, Suva Market and under Stinson Parade Bridge. When you talk to these kids, we can easily 
<br/>put them into three groups: street living, street working or street family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is: why children leave home and come to live on the streets? 
<br/>Every single child we talked to has their own unique story. Economic poverty plays a major role, 
<br/>although other factors are of equal importance. Some have been pushed into the streets because, they 
<br/>have been forced into criminal activities, or being rejected from the family for so call moral reasons, 
<br/>some have mental issues or substance abuse while some are through peer pressure. The big question 
<br/>is, how can we help these children go back home or move away from the street life? They do want 
<br/>to go back home. They will even share the views on what needs to be addressed to make them go 
<br/>back home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The assistance like, provide them with  food, clothing,  shelter, education,  healthcare, love, 
<br/></span><span>protection and basic rights. Assistance like, to provide them with an opportunity for a career outside 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2069 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of begging. Assistance like, prevent conflict with their family, if we can do that, or to reduce poverty 
<br/>in the community and homes. Enforce law systems to protect them, promote their integration into the 
<br/>society and also encourage more programmes that support them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Ministry, NGOs and other institutions and agencies are trying to 
<br/>take children away from the streets, we all need to ask the question: how through parenting can Fiji 
<br/>control children coming down to the streets? Tackle the problem at home! For a child to decide to 
<br/>come down to the streets, it does not happen overnight. So, why wait for the problem to happen? 
<br/>Why cannot education and awareness on this “streetism” be taken down to parents through agencies 
<br/>and some kind of preventative measures?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to create detection and early intervention measures, we need a support system that 
<br/>involves  everyone, including  government,  communities, regional organisations,  </span><span>vanua</span><span> NGOs and 
<br/>the people! Everyone to work together to save our generation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of these children went through a normal life in the beginning of their 
<br/>journey.  Something not normal happened along the way which drove them to the streets.  I am sure 
<br/></span><span>if that not normal is addressed, most of the children will willingly go back home.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>I support the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to commend the Committee for their great 
<br/>work in reviewing the Annual Report from 2018 to 2019 which is four years later now.  I thank the 
<br/>honourable Tuinaceva for raising that issue about our street children and as you know, my Assistant 
<br/>Minister honourable Sashi Kiran has been spearheading the work in this regard from the Ministry so 
<br/>I will let her address the issue.  It is an issue that speaks to all of our hearts and something that we all 
<br/>agree on, is the need to take better care of our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee does talk about the need to have legislation as 
<br/>well as the need to strengthen the new Department of Children.  Currently, the budget that has been 
<br/>allocated, $100,000 for this budget year is really to set up the Department of Children with skeletal 
<br/>staff including the Director of Children which we are finalising the interviews.  As s we prepare for 
<br/>the new budget year, we are to put together our programmes that will then justify the budget to have 
<br/>it up and running fully.  We still have the Child Services Unit, but it will become a fully-fledged 
<br/>Department in the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  work  towards  that,  we  have  been  working  with  UNICEF,  so  thank 
<br/></span><span>UNICEF as our development partner to partner with us on coming up with an overarching vision of 
<br/>the  Department  of  Children  and  to  strengthen  any  existing  programmes  targeted  at  the  care  and 
<br/>protection of children which does include what honourable Kiran will cover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  Report  is  the  need  to  fill  the  vacant 
<br/>positions  in  the  Ministry.    When  we  came  into  Government,  there  were  76  vacancies,  we  have 
<br/>advertised for 50 which is provided for in this budget and we hope to cover the balance in the next 
<br/>budget.  We have interviewed and we are finalising in the last three months 38 positions so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to strengthen the Department of Children, we currently are looking within 
<br/>the Ministry to reach out to any welfare officers who will want to become full time child welfare 
<br/>officers, so we are now going to demarcate those roles so that you have those that work in social 
<br/>protection  and  those  at  work  in  child  welfare.    So  hopefully  it  will  contribute  to  improving  the 
<br/></span><span>services for our children, otherwise our welfare officers are dealing with adults and children 24/7 and 
<br/></span><span>it is a really tough job.  I commend our welfare officers for the great work they do.

<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  working  closely  with  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro  </span><span>and  advisory 
<br/>councillors  on  our  Poverty  Alleviation  Programmes,  Poverty  Monitoring  Unit  as  I  had  stated 
<br/>yesterday  has  been  reviewing  programmes  across  Ministries  and  have  come  up  with 
<br/>recommendations  which  include  the  need  for  greater  engagement  with  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro</span><span>  and 
<br/>advisory  councillors  to  be  aware  and  to  also  monitor  and  report  back  on  our  Poverty  Alleviation 
<br/>Programmes on all the ministries across the board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point about the timely manner to determine our recipients.  Yes, we 
<br/>have a way to go but as I had stated earlier, we are digitising our database in the hope to make our 
<br/>systems more efficient.  I apologise to the public, there are sometimes cases that falls through the 
<br/>cracks, we ask you to please visit your nearest office and raise that issue so we can attend to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  wrap  up,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  had  asked 
<br/>yesterday about programmes that have been underutilised.  One of the issues raised in the Report is 
<br/>the Welfare Graduate Programme, which is one of those programmes that has been underutilised in 
<br/>the  past,  where  money  was  given,  for  example,  there  was  allocation  from  the  World  Bank  of  $2 
<br/>million  but  by  the  time  it  came  into  Government,  only  $400,000  was  utilised.    So,  it  was 
<br/></span><span>underutilisation for Jobs4Nature Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we are now stepping it up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we digitise the database, we now 
<br/>have identified close to 3,000 recipients who potentially should not be in the database or should not 
<br/>be receiving welfare.  We will not just kick them off because really welfare is for temporary shocks, 
<br/>you should not be on the programme for many years.  It is really to buffer and so we are looking at 
<br/>these recipients  to  graduate them out  of the programme and with  that assistance from  TVET, the 
<br/>Ministry of Education as well as the Ministry for Youth in reviving some of our Youth Centres around 
<br/>the country, it assists us to be able to transition them out of the welfare into training programmes and 
<br/>then as the honourable Prime Minister had mentioned, Apprenticeship Programmes and then finally 
<br/>to meaningful employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for their work, and I commend the Report before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to commend the Ministry for Women, Children and 
<br/>Poverty  Alleviation  Annual  Report.    I  must  start  by  thanking  the  Government  for  increasing  the 
<br/>allocation to the Ministry for Women and Social Protection.  It is a commendable job, however, there 
<br/></span><span>is a question which I ask, “Is the Ministry or the Government serious about our poverty alleviation 
<br/></span><span>and bringing people out of social issues?”  Passing belittling comments on people and discouraging 
<br/>them is not a way forward in dealing with the issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just this morning the honourable Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister stated, “go and do roadside BBQ”.  I do not do roadside BBQ. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I did not say that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- This is a direct insult on hundreds of roadside BBQ sellers who work hard 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to make ends meet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. First of all, irrelevance and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also the honourable Member is misleading.   He said …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2071 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He said that I was taking too many trips and I said, “you want 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me to do roadside BBQ instead of doing this job. ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 44, so I think he should not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mislead that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue honourable Sachida.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is a usual trend of the honourable Member 
<br/>to back track what he is saying.  This is an insult to the hundreds of people who sell roadside BBQs 
<br/>to makes ends meet. These are the people who do hard work to feed the people. These are not the 
<br/>people who go around texting other people’s wives, inviting them over; these are not the people It is 
<br/>important that these people should be, we are talking about poverty alleviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Member  is  imputing 
<br/></span><span>improper motive. He knows what happened and he knows how that matter was disposed off.  I think 
<br/></span><span>his totally going down to gutter level and insulting, hurling insults using this parliamentary Chamber.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Sachida,  could  you  just  continue  with  your  speech  rather 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>than…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must stress, I did not state any names. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Withdraw that statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I am not going to withdraw, I did not state any names.  There are no names 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stated.  But if the shoe fits, wear it, please.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that we need to work towards alleviating poverty.  It is important that people 
<br/>who are doing hard work, who are trying to make ends meet  are desperately working, we should 
<br/>assist  them  and  encourage  them.    People  need  assistance  on  time.    There  is  one  of  the 
<br/>recommendations in the Report … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have not ruled, honourable Sachida.  We have gone overboard here into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a very sticky situation.  It is for and against.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics said something to the effect of BBQ, and then you have come up with 
<br/>another one to counter that one, on texting some women.  So, I strongly suggest and implore upon 
<br/>each and every one of us here, just to debate in a proper way rather than stooping low and doing 
<br/>gutter level attack on each other because it does not augur well.  You will end up breaching some 
<br/>privileges,  and  then  we  will  be  loaded  with  the  task  of  trying  to  come  up  with  another  way  of 
<br/>rectifying all these problems when the milk has already been spilt.  That is what I try and implore 
<br/>upon each and every one of you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Sachida, you continue with the way you are addressing this motion and that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>good and stay there, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the poverty in the country, as we see it on the ground, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is increasing.  People are struggling to make ends meet.  If people are denying it, go to a supermarket 
<br/>on a Saturday or Friday and see parents with children trying to pick things from the shelves, and 
<br/>many a times, the children are left crying because the parent cannot afford to pick that stuff out of 
<br/>the shelf.  Things have gone beyond the reach of ordinary people, and this is a social issue that we 
<br/>need to address.  How can we decrease the cost of living for our people?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  economy  may  be  booming,  may  be  in  the  tourism  sector,  but  the  other  sectors  are 
<br/>struggling.    People  are  struggling  to  put  food  on  the  table.    This  is  a  social  issue.    This  Report 
<br/>recommends  that  assistance  needs  to  be  given  on  time,  and  that  is  what  we  are  asking  for.    The 
<br/>assistance should be given on time and people’s cost of living needs to be brought down.  People 
<br/>need to be able to put decent meal on the table.  Are we working towards that?  Are we talking about 
<br/>that?  I do not see anyone doing that.  Why are we putting other policies in front of the normal citizens 
<br/>issues, the normal issues that our citizens are dealing with?  We need to ensure that people are able 
<br/>to feed themselves.  Food on the table is the primary course for people, the primary objective is food  
<br/>on the table, and secondary is everything else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I highly recommend the Ministry together with the Government, to look into these issues.  
<br/></span><span>Social problem arises when people cannot live comfortably.  Street children arise when people cannot 
<br/></span><span>feed their children and they run away from home.  We need to look into all these things.  It is one of 
<br/>the causes of social problems.  Poverty is one of the causes of social issues, so let us look at poverty 
<br/>seriously, and I hope this Government and the Ministry will deal with this issue.  With that, I support 
<br/>the motion in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Sachida Nand for your contribution and I now offer 
<br/>the floor to the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection for her contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  former  Minister,  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary  and  the  Ministry  Team  for  their  work  in  serving  our  people.  The  Ministry  has  a  huge 
<br/>responsibility  to  serve  our  people,  there  is  no  two  ways  about  it.    I  would  like  to  remind  the 
<br/>honourable Member that this Report is four years old and since the honourable Member has discussed 
<br/>about other recommendations, I will just discuss the issue of street kids, Recommendation 4.2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, until this year while there was a taskforce for street dwellers and there were 
<br/>profiled  over  the  years  there  did  not  exist  a  programme  to  help  them  lived  out  of  their  situation.  
<br/>Wherever possible they were taken to their families and most children landed back on the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a very strong commitment to the most vulnerable by the Coalition Government which 
<br/>is not only indicated by the increase in social protection alarms for the vulnerable with an allocation 
<br/>of $200.2 million overall by far the biggest ever allocation to this Ministry but also visible by the 
<br/>high level of commitment to the work on assisting our people on the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank the honourable Attorney-General, the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Youths, the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs for their high level 
<br/>of commitment towards the support of our efforts to help us work with the street dwellers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  past  few  months,  we  have  had  very  strong  partnerships  between  different 
<br/>Government Ministries and Civil Society sector including the churches in trying to find solutions for 
<br/>people living on the streets.  This year, we have profiled 144 people in the Suva-Nausori corridor, 14 
<br/>were found to be below the ages of 14, 66 between 15 to 35, 47 between 36 and 59 and 17 above the 
<br/></span><span>age of 60.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, 31people were profiled in the West; 26 below the age of 14. There were 68 new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>persons identified in the last few weeks rather and are currently being profiled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  157  of  those  profiled  have  been  placed  in  either  a  State  home,  Faith  Based 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shelter or reunited with the family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, 12 street kids are in a Home undergoing rehabilitation and will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be joining the Ministry of Youth Seeds of Success Programme to be held later this month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, seven others have been enrolled in a yearlong rehabilitation programme, 12 
<br/>from  Lautoka  have  been  trained  under  the  Ministry  of  Youth  Programme  Seeds  of  Success  and 
<br/>another batch is ready to start.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, six joined TVET: 15 were trained by Red Cross and once trained there are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pathways identified for job placements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 35 street dwellers have been placed in various Aged Care Homes or to seek 
<br/></span><span>treatment  from  St.  Giles.  There  are  23  street  dwellers  we  are  working  within  Suva  who  keep 
<br/></span><span>returning. There have been efforts made to support beggars with income generation, social protection 
<br/>however  some  of  them  struggled  with  being  integrated  with  their  families  and  land  back  on  the 
<br/>streets.  Where needed some of these people are referred to social support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  order  to  be  able  to  reach  out  to  street  dwellers  and  build  trust,  we  have  worked  with 
<br/>different organisations who have been feeding street dwellers and Faith Based Organisations to reach 
<br/>out and help start rehabilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  acknowledge  Faith  Based  Groups  for  opening  up  shelters  for  these  youths  and 
<br/>different Government Ministries for opening up the training facilities, in particular Salvation Army 
<br/>that  has  opened  up  a  shelter  in  Lautoka  and  Suva  for  their  rehabilitation.  There  are  some  very 
<br/>committed volunteers within Salvation Army who have been actively supporting the work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank the Methodist Church for availing their facilities in Serua that be used for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rehabilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Youth has also been very supportive with not only availing their motivational 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programmes for the young but also the training facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, increasing number of dysfunctional families, drug abuse and neglect are seeing 
<br/>some increasing numbers on our streets.  However, Mr. Speaker, we are committed, and I thank all 
<br/>partners on the taskforce who have been working tirelessly to provide support to those on our streets.  
<br/>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak in Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
