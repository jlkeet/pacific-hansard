<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TRADE AND  
<br/>TOURISM 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament debates the  Review Report of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism 2018-2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled 
<br/>its Report on the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism 2018-2019 Annual  Report in  July this 
<br/>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  represents  some  of  Fiji’s  most  important  sectors  that  impacts  the  socio-
<br/>economic  development.  The  Tourism  Industry  contributes  significantly  to  Fiji’s  economy  as  the 
<br/>country’s largest foreign exchange earner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  was  informed  of  the  importance  of  the  International  Visitor’s  Survey  to 
<br/></span><span>improve services. Furthermore, the Committee noted the significance of the impact of cruise tourism 
<br/>and the need to engage with Municipal Councils and other stakeholders to improve and market the 
<br/>unique cultural activities in the different centres and geographical locations in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the significance of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) 
<br/>and strongly recommend that MSMEs Fiji needs to engage with all stakeholders to further develop 
<br/>the sector. In addition, the Committee received contributions from the Fiji Development Bank, the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture, Business Assistance Fiji and the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends the Ministry on the launch of this Fiji Portal and looks forward 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on a positive result on future Annual Reports.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The motion is now open for debate and before I offer the floor, there are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>four speakers that have been identified by the Whips. They are:

<div><span>  Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Jone Usamate; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Assistant Minister, honourable Alitia Bainivalu; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Premila Kumar; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk on 
<br/>this Report.  I congratulate the Committee for the outstanding work that it has done in the Report and 
<br/>the various recommendations that have been done. The Ministry, of course, as we know is a very 
<br/>critical  one  in  terms  of  the  lifeblood  of  our  economy  and  I  just  like  to  talk  to  some  of  the 
<br/>recommendations that are there, and I congratulate the Committee for the recommendations that it 
<br/>has done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  recommendation  that  I  want  to  talk  briefly  about  is  the  second  one.    It  is  the 
<br/>importance of strengthening  standards  for development, implementation  and monitoring for trade 
<br/>promotion in consumer protection.  The Committee has actually recommended that there should be 
<br/>a standard unit to become a statutory entity. I think that is a very good suggestion because the world 
<br/>over we note that Governments are beginning to change to take out a lot of these operational activities 
<br/>out of the ambit of Government proper or it maintains the policy and regulatory role and set up these 
<br/>bodies.  I think that will be a good move.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only thing that we have to make sure is that if the standards unit is set up to be a unit on 
<br/>its own then it must be able to be sustainable.  It should not be such that Government has to come in 
<br/>and then to keep funding this unit.  So, I think overall that is a good policy drive, that is why we 
<br/>created  things  like  Fiji  Roads  Authority  and  Water  Authority  of  Fiji.    We  take  out  the  direct 
<br/>operational arms into specific entities so they can be quick and nimble and get on with the lot. So 
<br/>that recommendation I agree with them entirely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second one that I want to talk about briefly too in my five minutes is the 
<br/>first recommendation in terms of MSMEs and in terms of MSMEs, micro enterprises is something 
<br/>that  we  all  need  to  look  after  and  we  should  congratulate  people  who  sell  BBQ  on  the  roadside, 
<br/>people who sell fruit drinks, people who sell kava, we should not make fun of them because these 
<br/>people are trying to struggle to make a living and as they graduate from Micro to Small to Medium 
<br/>Enterprises, that is something that we should encourage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to see that there has been quite a lot of work done in the Ministry in terms of this 
<br/>MSME  Fiji  and  the  BAF  programme  that  was  identified  by  the  honourable  Koroilavesau.    I  had 
<br/></span><span>noticed here is that, what this recommendation is trying to do, is a very important one.  Because what 
<br/></span><span>you tend to  find is  that,  Ministries try to  create their own  empires, so if  someone is  doing  micro 
<br/>enterprise here, someone else wants to create it again.  So, the idea of consolidating that altogether 
<br/>under one umbrella is a very good one.  It eliminates duplication and allows us to be able to focus 
<br/>our resources much better on what needs to be done.  So, I am totally in agreement with the first 
<br/>recommendation that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third recommendation is something that I had the opportunity of participating in some of 
<br/>the Committees.  This particular recommendation no. 3 is recommending for future repots to have 
<br/></span><span>their achievements against KPIs.  This is very important.  A lot of reports just talk about activities, 
<br/></span><span>we did this and we did that.  What we really want to know is what you have done relative to your 
<br/>targets, your outputs and the outcomes.  What have you achieved out of your activities?  This is a 
<br/>good  and  solid  recommendation,  and  I  think  this  is  something  we  should  make  sure  that  all 
<br/>Government Ministries should do.  When they report, do not just report on the activities, but what 
<br/>was the output, and the outcome.  What has been the trend over the past few years, you can see, the 
<br/>trend is improving.  That is a very good recommendation.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>  Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2087 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one, and I think it is probably related to recommendation no. 4, which is talking about 
<br/>the Fiji’s trade commissions, which were not reflected in the report.  Hopefully, I am sure the Ministry 
<br/>would be looking into that.  Along the same lines, we need to know whether they are getting money 
<br/>out  of  these  establishments,  the  trade  commissions,  the  trade  departments,  and  it  should  not  be 
<br/>activity based.  It must be output against the target, leading to outcome and showing a trend of a 
<br/>number of years.  That will give us a good information to discuss in this Parliament and to see what 
<br/>needs to be improved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge and thank the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs  for their assessment and the compilation  of this Report.  I 
<br/>would like to commend the Ministry for incorporating the alignment of its work with the UNs SDGs 
<br/>as well as having an unqualified audit opinion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  highlighted  in  the  Chair’s  foreword,  the  Ministry  represented  some  of  Fiji’s  most 
<br/>important sectors that impact the socio-economic development of the country, with tourism being the 
<br/>driver of our economy, contributing close to 40 percent to our GDP.  The years leading up to 2019 
<br/>was a record year for tourism.  In the period under review, we welcomed 895,137 visitors, a 4 percent 
<br/>increase from the previous financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year has been one of the books for the Fiji tourism industry.  For the 
<br/>first nine months of this year, Fiji welcomed 689,142 visitors, which is a 2 percent increase over the 
<br/>same period pre-COVID-19 with visitors mostly from Australia, New Zealand. US and China.  In 
<br/>addition to exploring the new destinations, Fiji’s efforts to enhance regional connectivity remains a 
<br/>priority.  At the end of this month, Fiji Airways will commence its new service between Fiji and New 
<br/>Caledonia.  There will also be direct flights from Nadi to French Polynesia by Aircalin starting in 
<br/>December.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka 
<br/>for being  elected as  the  Chair of the  International  Civil  Aviation Organisation Conference that is 
<br/>currently underway in Dubai.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend some of the work 
<br/>done by the Department of Tourism, who are now part of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2018 to 2019 financial year, Cabinet endorsed the Fijian tourism 2021, Fiji’s tourism 
<br/>sectorial plan, which sets the strategic priorities of the industry.  As shared in this Parliament, the 
<br/>Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation is now close to finalising a 10-year strategy that will build 
<br/>upon the Fijian tourism 2021 document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, two very important studies were also commissioned in an effort to create strong 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>linkages and diverse our tourism products:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  assessment  of  the  economic  impact  of  cruise  tourism  in  Fiji.  The  assessment 
<br/>identified seven investment opportunities that if pursued would lead to an added USD 
<br/>$43.98 million to the Fijian economy in the next 10 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>From the farm to the tourist table study which shows hotels and resorts in Fiji’s main 
<br/></span><span>tourism areas spent over $75 million buying fresh produce in 2017, with 48 percent of 
<br/></span><span>that spent on locally items. It also identifies barriers to increasing local production such 
<br/>as poor networking between hotel chefs, purchasing managers, suppliers and farmers and 
<br/>outline recommendations to increase local food sourcing by Fiji’s tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, implementation of the recommendations of these reports also commence such 
<br/>as the chef training undertaken in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture in the Coral Coast and</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>  Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Rakiraki. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share that the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation will in 
<br/>this financial year continue this so that we see more of local produce and cuisine been used in the 
<br/>industry. Another commendable achievement of the Department  was the successful rollout of the 
<br/>modernise online international visitors survey. The IVS is available tool not just for the Department 
<br/>but  for  other  Government  stakeholders  and  industry  from  April  to  December  of  2022  587,  406 
<br/>visitors arrived and contributed $3 billion to the economy. Approximately, 47 percent of spending 
<br/>occurred prior to arrival and approximately 54 percent of spending occurred after arrival. The average 
<br/>visitors spend was around FJD $3,572 per trip and around FJD $376 per night. The average spending 
<br/>per trip has increased by six percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  such  insights  are  possible  when  we  prioritise  robust  data  collection  and 
<br/>reporting. I would also like to commend the Ministry and the Tourism Fiji’s efforts in promoting Fiji 
<br/>as a top sporting destination by hosting events like super rugby and earlier this month I am pleased 
<br/>to  share  that  we  successfully  hosted  the  Fiji’s  Spartan  Event.  This  event  brought  over  3,000 
<br/>participants from 25 countries to Sabeto over four days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I commend the achievements of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and their contribution to the economy. Thank you for giving me the floor Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you and I now offer the floor to the honourable Premila Kumar to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>make her contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. Ministry of Industry Trade and Tourism 
<br/>(MITT)  is  responsible  for  developing  and  implementing  policies  and  strategies  to  shape  Fiji’s 
<br/>economic landscape. The Ministry’s policies and initiatives have a direct impact on job creation and 
<br/>overall economic prosperity. We have seen the effort made the hard-working staff of MITT to come 
<br/>up  with  strategies  to  create  supportive  environment  for  the  growth  and  success  of  businesses  at 
<br/>different stages of development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years MITT has introduced innovative programmes and policies 
<br/>such  as  start-up  incubators,  skilled  development  programmes,  market  access  and  support 
<br/>programmes regulatory simplification in e-gov services example base Fiji. Incentives for innovation 
<br/>research  and  development,  access  to  finance  by  collaborating  with  RBF,  FDB  and  Ministry  of 
<br/>Finance by setting up this credit guarantee scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  MITT  came  up  with  community  engagement  initiatives  that  have  been  organising 
<br/>networking events and workshops including recognition and awards and that is where we have the 
<br/>Prime  Minister’s  International  Business  Awards.  They  are  also  involved  in  international 
<br/>collaboration for exports, and they continue to provide business advisory services to the clients. So, 
<br/>they  do  all  these  works  and  Recommendation  (7)  clearly  states  that  this  institution  must  be  well 
<br/>resourced. If they are well-resourced then they will be able to deliver better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the committee had the opportunity to hold a round table meeting with varies 
<br/></span><span>Government agencies and entities involved in MSME’s space.  From this meeting it was crystal clear that 
<br/></span><span>there was lack of coordination and cooperation amongst them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, MITT set up the SME Unit by consolidating varies programmes and 
<br/>funding within the Ministry with the intention of reducing the bureaucratic hurdles and creating a more 
<br/>accessible and efficient ecosystem for MSMEs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2089 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of merit in Recommendation No. 1, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We suggest that SME Fiji 
<br/>should  be  able  to  respond  to  the  dynamic  needs  of  the  private  sector  and  particularly,  NSME  small 
<br/>business, small and micro businesses and MSME Fiji can then think like a private sector and operate like 
<br/>a private sector, and not like a government entity - involved too much in bureaucracy and this and that. It 
<br/>will  allow  better  collaboration  between  different  parties,  and  it  will  be  able  to  address  the  unique 
<br/>challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a statutory body, MSME Fiji will have a greater visibility both, domestically 
<br/>and  internationally,  and  that  is  when  it  can  tap  into  donor  funding.    They  can  also  tap  into  human 
<br/>resources, and it will be able to coordinate with other MSME programmes dished out by other agencies. 
<br/>So, it will give better value for money by consolidating all these under one roof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also recommended the replication of the Northern Development 
<br/>Programme to other Divisions in Fiji. Sir, NDP as we call it, was initially established in 2007 to address 
<br/>the severe impact of the expiry of sugarcane leases on the economy of the North.  The NDP actually 
<br/>comes under the ‘Look North Policy’ and under that when this programme was introduced, it became 
<br/>highly successful and the recipe for success was that anyone that was entrusted to tap into NDP had to 
<br/>get commercial loan and if they get the loan, then the Ministry will provide the grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a lot of handholding, making sure that when they started off with the business at every 
<br/>step they were guided, they were mentored and that produced the results because they knew their money 
<br/>is also involved in the project. So, it was extremely successful in 2019.  The success rate was about 84 
<br/>percent which is very high and even this grant was not given just like that, it was disbursed based on what 
<br/>their needs are.  If it needs to be paid to the supplier, then it is paid to the supplier, it was not given cash 
<br/>on hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I just want to go back in 2019, when the MITT report was 
<br/>being discussed in this Parliament the honourable Prime Minister then the leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>later SODELPA Leader, honourable Gavoka raised their concerns on PACER Plus. The question was 
<br/>Fiji had not signed the agreement while other pacific Island countries has signed PACER Plus in 2017. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request honourable Kamikamica to provide the position of the Coalition Government 
<br/>on this matter, so that we are clear on that. Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Premila Kumar. I now offer the floor to the Deputy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister honourable Kamikamica. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know it is getting on late in the evening so I 
<br/></span><span>will be as quick as I possibly can.  As I rise to contribute to the Report into the Ministry of Industry Trade 
<br/>and  Tourism  2018-2019  Annual  Report,  I  thank  the  Committee  for  their  contributions  and 
<br/>recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all agree, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (MITT) as it was 
<br/>back then called and now it is somehow different because tourism has peeled away from the Ministry, 
<br/>but they have a pivotal role to play as a key driver, enabler, facilitator in creating a friendly business 
<br/>environment and creating investment opportunities in our country, stimulating SME growth co-operatives 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji which are very important to the People’s Coalition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations which 
<br/></span><span>have been discussed by the preceding speakers are helpful and instructive, and some of them, I would 
<br/>like to sort of touch on today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So my discussion today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will touch briefly on the report but try and provide 
<br/>a  bit  of  a  feel  to  the  Members  of  the  august  Parliament,  on  where  the  Trade  Ministry  and  the 
<br/>Communication Ministry is headed, going forward. In terms of the MSMEs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, right 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2090 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now, as the Committee had recommended that a statutory body be considered. I think that is probably 
<br/>a journey that we will take as a Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, from what we can see, there is a very good ecosystem already being developed in 
<br/>Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir and some of the key entities have been mentioned by respective parties here 
<br/>today; Business Assistance Fiji, by honourable Koroilavesau. The FDB, of course, MSME Fiji and 
<br/>there is also a tremendous level of accelerator programmes already evolving through private sector 
<br/>participation and that is one of the fundamental key things that we are trying to develop in this MSME 
<br/>ecosystem to try and encourage private sector to provide their support to the MSME sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  would  have  seen  recently  that  Tappoos  announced,  and  I  was  honoured  to  be  at  the 
<br/>ceremony that they were announcing that they support their own MSMEs in their business. That is 
<br/>quite a significant added contribution by the Tappoo Group. We thank them for that. And that, in 
<br/>itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be an impetus for more activity and more opportunity for the MSMEs 
<br/>that are in that sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, BSP Life now has a training for entrepreneurs. There are about 25 women 
<br/>and men that they train every six months, and they are committed to do this over a period of five 
<br/>years. So, in a period of five years, 250 potential entrepreneurs and existing entrepreneurs will get 
<br/>expertise  in  that  kind  of  training.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  the  MSME  sector,  yes,  it  is 
<br/>fundamental.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, it is only 18 percent of GDP according to statistics. We would like it to sit 
<br/>around 30 or 40 percent of GDP, but to do that, it requires building a comprehensive ecosystem that 
<br/>we are currently in the process of doing. In terms of the co-operatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are seeing 
<br/>good growth in co-operatives. In 2018-2019, there were about 371 co-operatives in existence. Now 
<br/>there  is  about  545,  and  it  is  growing.  We  will  continue  to  use  that  as  a  means  to  stimulate  the 
<br/>economic growth in our country and it is a fundamental part as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the MSME 
<br/>ecosystem that is currently developing, and we hope to bring more direction to the Parliament next 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the trade needed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the most important units in our 
<br/>Ministry and just very briefly, they have been involved in some very significant negotiations, the 
<br/>most  recent  of  which  was  the  IPAF  negotiations  which  has  been  substantively  concluded  in  San 
<br/>Francisco. The honourable Prime Minister was also in San Francisco to attend the first High Level 
<br/>Meeting in San Francisco. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was initiated by the Fiji First Government, it will be a significant economic agreement for 
<br/>Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It represents 40 percent of the GDP in the world and there are 14 countries, 
<br/>and Fiji is there as the Small Island Developing State representative, and we expect to benefit quite 
<br/>significantly from that initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  very  briefly,  we  talked  about  standards,  and  I  agree  with  the  sentiments  raised  about 
<br/>standards.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  moment,  I  have  convened  a  taskforce  that  is  just  looking  at 
<br/>standards  in  the  country.  It  is  an  inter-agency  collaboration,  and  it  is  interesting  that  it  came  up 
<br/></span><span>through the recommendations of the Committee.  And we are looking very closely at the creation of 
<br/></span><span>improved standards for Fiji, and it is something that we can work on going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, the question around the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) 
<br/>Plus. I am happy to report that one of the reasons why we have been, if you like, slow on PACER 
<br/>Plus is basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Trade Team which is only about four people who are totally 
<br/>immersed in the Inter Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) negotiations but we have very clearly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2091 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>articulated to colleagues in New Zealand and Australia that now that the substantive negotiations are 
<br/>over that we will begin the engagement on PACER Plus with the view to coming up with the position 
<br/>next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of PACER Plus, we all know that there are genuine concerns on the Fiji side and 
<br/>those will be looked at very carefully in terms of the overall position that we finally take PACER 
<br/>Plus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final comment I want to pick up from honourable Usamate was that he 
<br/>did mention - the need for KPIs, and that is something that we have been discussing in the Ministry 
<br/>as well.  It will be worthwhile, for instance, to have good data on investment in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not even have a hand on how much foreign direct investment or local direct investment 
<br/>we have in Fiji, depending on who you talk to we do not know what the number is. So that is an area 
<br/>that  we  are  looking  at.  Those  are  some  of  the  things  that  we  can  use  to  really  measure  how  our 
<br/>economy is doing, how well it is doing and also the Ministry is also committing some resources into 
<br/>that endeavour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  that  short  contribution,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  this  opportunity  to 
<br/>contribute very briefly. I have not spoken at length about the historical report but try to sprinkle the 
<br/>appetite with a little bit of forward thinking and I support the Report of the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their contribution on the Report. The comments were very valuable and, of course, very insightful.  I 
<br/>hope that the comments would assist in improving the performance of the Ministry as they forge 
<br/>ahead in trying to deliver services to the people of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
