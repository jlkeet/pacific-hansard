<div><span> Leadership Training for Multi-Ethnic Groups 
<br/>(Question No. 160/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice:
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  offers  leadership  training  for  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>leaders.  The 
<br/>training, packaged  as  the  </span><span>Sauvaki</span><span>  Programme, assists them in  their community  leadership 
<br/>roles.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament if the Ministry has any plans to provide similar leadership training for other multi-
<br/>ethnic groups?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  by  honourable 
<br/>Tuinaceva.  In fact, I did talk to honourable Tuinaceva during tea break to give him the programmes 
<br/>and plans that we have.  However, for the benefit of Parliament, I would like to talk some more on 
<br/>his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  per  my  response  in  the  April  Sitting  of  Parliament,  I  mentioned  that  the  work  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry is in progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, just a point of interest, is it a military strategy that 
<br/>you get to the person who is going to raise a question first before the time is given for him to ask his 
<br/>question?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I somehow like the honourable Member.  That is why 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am alright about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is good - very promising.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consultation has focussed on the key issues in the 
<br/>ethnic-affairs space and how they address the new Ministry.  The overall tenure of the consultation 
<br/>has been very positive and the level of expectation from the community and the new Ministry is very 
<br/>noteworthy.  At this juncture, I would like to mention that we have brought in two consultants from 
<br/>New  Zealand  who  are  former  Fiji  residents,  but  at  no  cost  to  the  taxpayers  of  Fiji.    They  have 
<br/>volunteered to do the service free of charge, to write, a report for the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together with that, I would like to send my humble appreciation to the High Commission of 
<br/>New Zealand, in particular, the High Commissioner.  The New Zealand High Commission paid for 
<br/></span><span>all the expenses surrounding the consultation, air fares and accommodation throughout Fiji wherever 
<br/></span><span>they will go.  So, at least, the work is in progress now.  We expect to receive a detailed report from 
<br/>our advisors in the next four weeks to six weeks on the framework for the Ministry, with detailed 
<br/>plans on the implementation. This will begin the development and the implementation of the new 
<br/>Ministry’s substantive work programme.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  it  is  premature  to  identify  the  specific  priorities  of  the  Ministry  at  this  stage,  the 
<br/>honourable Member  can be assured  that the intension is to  include specific programmes that will 
<br/>promote social cohesion amongst all ethnic groups, including our indigenous community.  It will be 
<br/></span><span>expected that there will be a significant co-operation between the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  where  learnings  from  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  could  be 
<br/>beneficial to the multi-ethnic affairs that will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that the work has commenced as planned, and we 
<br/>have substantial  progress established by the Coalition Government.  It  has appointed a  core of 12 
<br/>support staff, and it is making a good progress on the setting up of the administrative system.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2037 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the assistance of the two advisors, over 50 consultations have been undertaken with a 
<br/>wide range of ethnic groups representatives and leaders, State agencies, academics, political leaders 
<br/>and lead institutions, including Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, </span><span>Turaga Na Roko Tui Bau, Marama na 
<br/>Roko Tui Dreketi, Tui Noco</span><span>, the Ministry for Education, Ministry for Women, Children and Social 
<br/>Protection and the two gentlemen who have also met with the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To other Ministries, the  co-operation will help  leverage the  experience.    Our Government 
<br/>works  on  the  principles  of  consultation,  inclusiveness  and  commitment.  I  want  to  assure  the 
<br/>honourable  Member  that  suggestions  and  recommendations  made  during  the  consultation  will  be 
<br/>taken into consideration, with the assurance to include leadership training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  very  quickly,  the  honourable    Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture highlighted about the bull, if it is not controlled, it can become very reckless, of course, 
<br/>a mass destruction. Speaking of reckless, honourable  Minister, I just want to quickly highlight in 
<br/>Parliament that he has threatened farmers - …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- … a bulldozed threat to the farmers.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he spoke about the framework that is being established for the Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs  and  it  is  almost  11  months  into  Government.    Because  you  said  that  consultations  are 
<br/>happening,  does  this  framework  include  cultural  competence  to  address  ethnic  disparities  that  is 
<br/>being faced in this country?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this honourable Member should read the entire 
<br/>article, if not, then just the headline.  What I have said to the farmers is that the variety of cane which 
<br/>is not approved, that has to be removed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot waste our time and money on the sugarcane farms that do not give the right variety 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of cane.  That is it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  ask  a  supplementary  question  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, but before I do, I would like to make comment, just 
<br/>like honourable Rinesh Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Question!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- The honourable Minister conducted a consultation where honourable Bia 
<br/></span><span>was also present and he gifted those who were present with PAP mugs - mugs with PAP logo.  I do 
<br/></span><span>not know what the honourable Minister was trying to implement there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- But Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are about to end the year and the Coalition 
<br/>Government is about to finish its first year in their term. The question to the honourable Minister is, 
<br/>has the Ministry conducted any surveys or consultations to gauge the interest and specific needs of 
<br/>leaders from different ethnic groups regarding leadership training? If so, what were the findings and 
<br/>how are they being incorporated into your planning? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Member  is  daydreaming.    I  just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answered that a report is coming out, just wait for it and be patient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You watch out, we will make a statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Hold on, do not threaten the honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Section? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  An  honourable  Member  should  not  be  issuing  threatening 
<br/>language.  He pointed at the honourable Member and said, “You watch out”.  It is, sort of, a physical 
<br/>threat, he should withdraw that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Lorry </span><span>awe</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, you have the floor, that will be the third supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has just mentioned that they have 
<br/>engaged two consultants who are basically sponsored the New Zealand Government.  In doing so, there 
<br/>must have been an MOU done, so I want to find out the amount that the New Zealand Government has 
<br/>given for this exercise?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not  actually have the figure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Hold on!  But I think it is somewhere around $200,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! They are former Fiji residents, honourable Bala.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of Issuance of PSV Licence 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 161/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update Parliament on the status of issuance of a PSV licence? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2039 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. Before I respond, I would like to provide some background in the uplifting of the freeze on 
<br/>the four permit types.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2011, the former Government had imposed a freeze on permit types with a justification 
<br/>that Land Transport Authority (LTA) undertake a comprehensive review on the demand and supply 
<br/>of PSV permits in Fiji, and to clearly assess and determine the future viability and sustainability of 
<br/>Fiji’s land transport industry.  However, this comprehensive review did not materialise but instead, 
<br/>substantive changes to the law were made, in particular, relating to PSV permits and the sale of those, 
<br/>and  also  in  terms  of  financial  institutions  being  somehow  accountable.  It  is  now  up  to  this 
<br/>Government to correct some of these.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  and  LTA  had  undertaken  a  nationwide  consultation,  seeking  views  of  all 
<br/>stakeholders on PSV permits. The information obtained has been crucial, to enable the Ministry and 
<br/>LTA to address gaps in policies and processes and also in relooking at operations within.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In October 2023, Cabinet had endorsed the uplifting of the freeze for the four types - Licence 
<br/>Hire (LH), Licence Rental (LR), Licence Carriers (LC) and Licence Minibus (LM). This has become 
<br/>a necessity, especially with the increase in activities, particularly in the tourism industry. There are 
<br/>currently more than 14,000 PSV permits issued - more than 7,000 issued in the Central Division; 
<br/>approximately 7,561 in the Western Division; and 1,038 in the Northern Division. Majority of these 
<br/>permits are taxis operating in Fiji with more than 4,000 in the Central Division; 2,883 in the Western 
<br/>Division; and 519 in the Northern Division. There are 57 bus companies currently in operation - 27 
<br/>in the Central Division, 25 in the Western Division and five in the Northern Division, a total of 1,250 
<br/>buses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to issuing applications for new PSV permits, the LTA first issues out 
<br/>a checklist to customers so that they acquire the necessary requirements for the application.  This has 
<br/>been an ongoing process, for example, in the Central Division, the LTA has issued checklist for LM 
<br/>- 445, LR - 215, LH - 737 and LC 183. In the Western Division, 266 for LM, 123 for LR, 205 for 
<br/>LH.    Out  of  the  total  of  615  in  the  Western  Division,  43  have  provided,  for  example,  relevant 
<br/>documentation; 25 had been issued with applications which are currently under process and seen as 
<br/>complying, 18 did not meet the criteria, 11 appeared for applications and more than 500 of those who 
<br/>had been issued with a checklist have yet to submit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things which we have noticed is the delay in the submission of applications due to 
<br/></span><span>the  various  compliance  requirements,  in  particular,  difficulty  in  acquiring  base  letters,  obtaining 
<br/></span><span>consent  letters  for  applicants  wishing  to  operate  from  commercial  properties,  support  letters  for 
<br/>private bases and also for binding contracts. So far, LTA has not issued any licence given the issues, 
<br/>and for us, it is an indication of rigorous checks in place and assessments before licences are issued.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister; most of those who are waiting for the lifting of the freeze from those that have been wanting 
<br/>to get a licence on taxis and minibuses, however, that has not been included in the list of licences 
<br/>being lifted. Is there a reason for that, or when can they expect these licences to be opened up for 
<br/></span><span>them?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The minibuses are included but the taxis, the freeze is still to 
<br/>be lifted and that is currently being assessed. One of the issues is further consultations regarding the 
<br/>operations from the base and the open taxi rank system.  The other one which we are currently looking 
<br/>at,  which  we  will  be  presenting  to  Cabinet,  is  the  review  of  the  sale  of  permits.  That  is  another 
<br/>contentious issue which is also urgent, and we should resolve it by the end of the year. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, special cases, special needs because we need 
<br/>to serve the people as well because when you do not fix the roads, taxis cannot go. This is a major 
<br/>problem in Seaqaqa. They prefer not to use cars, they prefer to use four-wheel drives. Where do they 
<br/>fit into this plan that you have?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Do something honourable Minister?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- New question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is hard to fix 16 years of neglect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very hard to fix it in 12 months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Northern Division, they are approached individually, including Seaqaqa.  Definitely, 
<br/>on the village-based ones in terms of carrier, we have received applications for those and also looking 
<br/>at it in terms of the criteria.  But there is also a concern by bus companies that whatever LTA approves 
<br/>should not result in undermining the operations of the buses.  It has to be very balanced, and we need 
<br/>to proceed carefully so other PSV licences are running and we do not destroy the bus industry, as we 
<br/>have managed to do since, I suppose, before Independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  ask  a 
<br/>supplementary  question.  The  last  time  I  was  in  Seaqaqa  was  last  year,  the  road  was  fixed.    So, 
<br/>obviously, if that road is deteriorated, then it became deteriorated this year, just like we have the 
<br/>potholes at Nakasi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Coming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  relation  to  the  Public Service  Vehicles  (PSVs),  my  concern,  honourable  Minister,  is  in 
<br/>relation to the people who drive these vehicles.  This past month, I have had to tell-off bus drivers 
<br/>and taxi drivers about calling on the phone, loud music - personally doing that.  I am just wondering, 
<br/>when you give these PSVs, is there a stronger process to get these PSV operating drivers to really 
<br/>serve the people rather than do this loud music, answering the phones and all that?  It is a big concern. 
<br/></span><span>I hope you can come up with a solution to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I just give some examples of numbers in Divisions who have 
<br/>taken the checklist and they have tried to adhere to the checklist and after that, they are assessed.  So, 
<br/>upto now, LTA has not issued a licence.  That shows that a more vigorous assessment is being done 
<br/>before we issue that.  In that assessment, we are envisaging that such persons will not come through 
<br/>- those whom you have mentioned who are not operating according to ethical standards in terms of 
<br/>operating a public service vehicle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, every supplementary question starts with the roads. This is about LTA, so let 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me remind honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Those two connect and you should know better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A major reform was done in terms of roads management by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the FijiFirst Government when they were on this side.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2041 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What will PWD do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So, in that reform, they managed to get rid of the major entity 
<br/>which  was  dealing  with  the  rural  roads  and  now  they  are  criticising,  which  is  the  Public  Works 
<br/>Department. Before there were depots in Seaqaqa, but who closed it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  The road was alright last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is something we are trying to fix. It needs multi-million-
<br/>dollar support to bring back those depots and re-equip them.  It will take perhaps, one budget cycle 
<br/>and another budget cycle because it cannot be done immediately. I mean, not only did you muck up 
<br/>PWD, you also mucked up the budget with your huge debt and that is why he cannot give me the 
<br/>money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now move on. The third Oral Question for 
<br/>today is now redundant, since the honourable Prime Minister has made a Ministerial Statement to 
<br/>that effect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 162/2023 was withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I adjourn Parliament for lunch, I would like to acknowledge the presence of Reverend 
<br/>Kania and his colleagues sitting in the gallery, not forgetting Pundit Swami Maharaj.  It has been a 
<br/>while since we have seen you again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, honourable Members, I would like to adjourn Parliament for lunch, and we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resume when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>2023-2026 Strategic Action Plan Framework – Agriculture &amp; Fisheries Co-operation 
<br/>(Question No. 163/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>2023–2026  Strategic  Action  Plan  Framework  on  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  Cooperation 
<br/>between the Government of the Republic of China and Pacific Island Countries? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question. Before I move onto my response, I wish all honourable Members of this august Parliament, 
<br/>all fisherfolks  nationwide, all industry stakeholders, partners in  development  and members of the 
<br/>public at large, a Happy World Fisheries Day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, China continues to be an important development partner for Fiji and  the 
<br/>Pacific  Island  Countries  (PICs).  Since  the  establishment  of  our  diplomatic  relations  in  1975,  the 
<br/>friendship and bilateral relations between Fiji and China have grown significantly across all fields of 
<br/>co-operation, but more so notably in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. It is, therefore, important 
<br/>that Fiji continues its pathway to strengthening its partnership and forge new pathways to developing 
<br/>and sustaining these sectors into the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the onset, the 2023-2026 Strategic Action Plan Framework on Agriculture and Fisheries 
<br/>Cooperation, is one of the outcomes of the second China-Pacific Island Countries Agriculture and 
<br/>Fisheries  Ministers  Meeting  hosted  in  Nanjing,  China,  May  2023.  This  second  China-PICs 
<br/>Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers Meeting attended by Fiji and nine other PICs resulted in China 
<br/>presenting two outcome documents – the Nanjing Consensus and the 2023-2026 Strategic Actions 
<br/>on Agriculture and Fisheries Co-operation between China and PICs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2023-2026  Strategic  Action  Plan,  aims  to  identify  the  direction  and 
<br/>priorities  for  our  agriculture  and  fisheries  cooperation  over  the  four  years,  leverages  our 
<br/>complementary strengths and promotes our shared growth in agriculture and fisheries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, key strategic actions identified under this Plan are as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet has endorsed Fiji’s participation to the Strategic Framework Action 
<br/>Plan through the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  conclude, in  the second Ministers Meeting headed  by the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways,  Fiji  and  China  urgently  resounded  the  importance  of 
<br/>strengthening cooperation in  sustainable agriculture and fisheries as a critical  way forward for us 
<br/>small island countries to help elevate living standards of our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>explanation on the assistance by China.  What I would like to ask the honourable Minister, if he has 
<br/>done a comparison on the assistance provided by our friends from other countries, compared to the 
<br/>assistance provided by China in the last eight years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.   I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>think it is a new question and I will work on it and I will come back on another day of the sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, I will decide on that, honourable Minister.   Will you come back to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Koroilavesau with an answer? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture, this morning, talked about the downstreaming process and the need to shift 
<br/>away from commodities into products because that will bring a lot of economic benefits.  How is the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries approaching this as well based on this agreement that they have signed with 
<br/>China?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is an area that probably needs to be looked at seriously too by the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries as it has a lot of wild harvesting going on and we need to go into technology.  Where is 
<br/>the Ministry of Fisheries heading in this regard? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  it  is  also  a  new  question,  but  I  will  try  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>elaborate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, it relates to the earlier question.  Do you have an answer, or you do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not have it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- I will answer, later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji and China…

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You still have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  As 
<br/>I have alluded in my speech, Fiji and China have diplomatic relations since 1975 and they are coming 
<br/>up with questions.  I think Fiji is taking it lightly to partner with China.  They are looking at China 
<br/>as a karate kid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, they are scared of coming closer to China so when the Coalition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I am very confused as to where you are taking us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do you have any other supplementary question honourable Members? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is alright, honourable Minister, we will take another question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you for the opportunity to ask a supplementary question.  China 
<br/>has been a friend of Fiji for a long time.  They stood by our side in difficult times and has continued 
<br/>to do so as part of our foreign affairs policy of friends of all and enemies of none.  It is good to see 
<br/>this particular question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier on this year when we were looking at the fishing industry in Fiji, we 
<br/>noticed that a lot of our offshore fisheries boats are not moving.  If you go now, they are parked in 
<br/>the harbour.  One of the difficulties that they have, a lot of the companies that they compete against 
<br/>are subsidised by their home countries.  Would that be something that you will also address in this 
<br/>strategic  cooperation  with  China  because  our  boats  are  being  parked,  they  are  finding  it 
<br/>uncompetitive to compete and because of that, people that are employed in our local industry are not 
<br/>earning income for their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question. I  will come back with  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response on that at a later date.  I can refer to Foreign Affairs.

<div><span>Market Employability Survey 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 164/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament if Market Employability 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Survey is conducted before Government grant is allocated to training institutions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  this 
<br/></span><span>question because it is, no doubt, a very important question, especially  when the honourable Member 
<br/></span><span>is  a former Director of Human Resources in the Ministry of Education.  He could have made some 
<br/>submissions to the relevant institution to adopt such tool.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Answer, answer!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2045 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I do not know what has happened to our sitting down and discussing 
<br/>things because that earlier stance taken by the honourable Minister for Fisheries, I do not know 
<br/>what bait he haa been bringing in.  It has gone on a tailspin, I think. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Market  Employability  Surveys  guide  us  on 
<br/>whether our graduates are competent to meet the job demands, they will have and also assist our 
<br/>nation identify the areas that may need certain kind of skills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, job markets in the rapid developing world pursue employees with the right 
<br/>kind of knowledge, skills and capacities.  For a developing country like Fiji, a Market Employability 
<br/>Survey is crucial, to ensure that we are generating a workforce that not only meets the demand of our 
<br/>various job sectors, but it complements any new markets that are presenting itself in our fast-evolving 
<br/>global economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  preparation  for  our  young  generation  for  the  labour  market,  as  we  know,  is  a  critical 
<br/>responsibility  for  universities  and  accordingly,  the  curricula  of  universities  should  continuously 
<br/>reflect and improve the quality of their graduates to fit into dynamic and diverse job markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  prerequisites  for  the  Higher  Education  Commission  Fiji 
<br/>(HECF)  on  the  university  grants  allocation,  they  are  regulated  and  disbursed  through  the  Higher 
<br/>Education Commission Act 2008 and the Higher Education Commission Regulations 2009.  In there, 
<br/>it specifically provides the requirements that the Commission must consider when determining the 
<br/>allocation of grants to institutions. The primary requirement for accessing these grants,  Sir, is that 
<br/>they should be registered with the HECF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the current Coalition Government, we have made  it mandatory for 
<br/>the  three  Universities  to  submit  Graduate  Destination  Surveys  with  grant  application.  This 
<br/>requirement  came  into  effect  on  the  2023-2024  National  Budget.    However,  due  to  data 
<br/>unavailability, the Universities could not fulfil this requirement for the 2023-2024 grant allocation.  
<br/>They are currently working on it and will be now required to submit these survey results for the 2024-
<br/>2025 grant allocation and beyond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Using the survey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the HECF will work with the Tertiary Scholarships and 
<br/>Loans Scheme (TSLS) to ensure that scholarships and loan assistance are directed to qualifications 
<br/></span><span>that are in demand and reduce for the qualifications where students are unemployed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TVET qualifications are essential and special funding was allocated in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023-2024 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have requested the HECF to analyse the audited financial statements 
<br/>of the Universities as part of their grant allocation.  The idea is to ascertain the Universities’ financial 
<br/>sustainability and understand their funding requirements.  I am talking about the detailed analysis of 
<br/>the audited financial reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government funds for the three Universities’ operation and capital budgets, 
<br/>while they also charge student fees, it is natural to think that if Government funds universities, should 
<br/>they not subsidise tuition fees for the local students as a way forward?  I am thinking the HECF to 
<br/>benchmark to the university funding system of Australia, may be, and if a similar funding system can 
<br/>be adopted in Fiji universities, where local student fees are subsidised by the Government funding.

<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform this Parliament that a detailed review of the 
<br/>three Universities will be carried out in 2024, as I will be alluding to it in my Ministerial Statement 
<br/>tomorrow.  Amongst other things, we will consider the quality and relevance of tertiary qualifications 
<br/>and financial sustainability of the three Universities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  inform 
<br/>Parliament if there was a Market Employability Survey conducted before the Government grant was 
<br/>allocated to Pacific Polytech? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have alluded to that supplementary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question earlier on, that there was none done because of unavailability of data.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am a bit worried.  If the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>survey was not done for Pacific Polytech, how come before Budget, $1 million was allocated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There was no survey done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  See, again, he is interrupting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He told you very clearly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  He has to tell me, not you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And then in the budget, $1.6 million was given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have to re-state my answer again, that 
<br/>there was no survey done, as in the previous years.  So, this is what we are trying to improve on, 
<br/>going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will leave it at that.

<div><span>Total Road Upgrading Cost - Queen Elizabeth Drive to National Stadium  
<br/>(Question No. 165/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on the total cost of upgrading the road from Queen Elizabeth 
<br/>Drive in Nasese to the National Stadium? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Queen Elizabeth Drive upgrade project 
<br/>between Ratu Sukuna Road to Laucala Bay Intersection comprise a total distance of 4.23 kilometres. 
<br/>It has the following features: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dedicated online bicycle lane for 8.5 kilometres in both 4.25 kilometres in each direction;   
<br/>two roundabouts at Vuya Road and Muanikau Road signalised pedestrian crossing; 
<br/>improved parking facilities; bus shelters, bus bays and recreational areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The above project  is  currently nearing  completion, and it is  targeted to  be completed around 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/></span><span>December.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2047 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It started in March 2019. The original contract price was $61.9 million on 14</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2020 
<br/>when there was variation in design change - redesigned for the purpose of shifting alignments towards 
<br/>the sea to avoid land acquisition.  This also included delayed damages to contractors as this was a 
<br/>design and build contract.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on  12</span><span>th</span><span>  January, 2021, another variation of $3.3 million to  meet  climate 
<br/>resilience, lifting of whole pavement works and services relocation of WAF, EFL and TFL. So, the 
<br/>total  variation  was  $3.7  million  and  payment  to-date  was  $49.7  million.    The  estimated  cost  of 
<br/>completion is $65.7 million, so those are the costings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suppose the Opposition will claim or say that “Yes, this is the FijiFirst project”. I am sure it 
<br/>was started under the previous Government but some of the fundamental questions we need to ask 
<br/>regarding  projects  such  as  this  is,  what  should  we  be  prioritising,  given  the  extremely  high  cost 
<br/>because if you look at it with that estimated total cost at the completion of the project of $65.7 million, 
<br/>that will work out with 4.23 kilometres - $15.5 million per kilometre?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Wastage. Investigate it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  This  is  what  this  Coalition  Government  is  relooking  at  
<br/>whether we will be repeating such projects which are too costly and reassign hard-earned funds of 
<br/>the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  other  priorities,  for  example,  double  lanes  from  Laqere  to  Kinoya  and  Fletcher 
<br/>Road.  That was in the original plans in terms of traffic alleviation - Fletcher Road and MGM to 
<br/>Laucala Bay. So, we could have looked at double lanes there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The upgrades of rural roads and bridges and community roads - these have been neglected for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>too long and this is an area which we need to prioritise into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, Listen!

<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Sir,  to  conclude,  just  looking  at  the  cost  as  a  Coalition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government moving forward, our priorities will be different ….

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-…  rather  than  looking  at  too  shorter  distance  and  a  huge 
<br/>amount. Also, if you look at the amount of traffic there, I think it finishes about 5.00 p.m. to 6.00 
<br/>p.m. compared to improving the Laqere to Suva Point … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- You change it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- … to four lanes and other priorities, including some of our

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So, that is the answer to that question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have wasted $65.7 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are arguing about whether it is a waste 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or not, from our perspective as a Coalition, it is excessive and a waste and wrongly prioritised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Can  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister inform us as to what was supposed to be the real cost for the road? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO.  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  If we look back into the history of the road, it sort of coincided with the approval of the 
<br/>development lease for Tian Lun Investments Pte Limited in 2018 where a development lease was 
<br/>issued in September 2018 and this project started in 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So regarding that development which is linked to the road, 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources has taken action on Tian Lun Investments 
<br/>that  failed  to  obtain  a  subdivisional  approval  or  scheme  plan.    They  failed  to  submit  approved 
<br/>engineering plan and all sorts of non-compliance, Sir, which resulted in the cancellation of their lease 
<br/>on that road.  So, the question is, who approved the lease to Tian Lun Investments? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO.  F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  When  we look  back, this  is  the kind  of thing  this  country 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be avoiding - building the road for a particular investor and we ended up wasting $65 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going back to answering that question, I asked some of the experienced engineers, can you 
<br/>develop Queen Elizabeth Drive from what it was before to an acceptable state?  They said, “Yes, $15 
<br/>million… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- You are on record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- … as opposed to $65 million.”  So, $65 million minus $15 
<br/>million, if you ask a secondary school student, $50 million extra was used where we should have just 
<br/>used $15 million.  Just imagine where we could have used that $50 million on rural roads, community

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Albert  Park  and  look  at  how  Albert  Park  is 
<br/>currently utilised.  There was a recent article in one of the dailies, Sir, about the value of the estates 
<br/>(got a valuer) from within this corridor.  You are looking at the cost, but you are not looking at the 
<br/>benefits out of the investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We talked about resilience infrastructure this morning, that is resilience infrastructure.  It is 
<br/>going to raise big time the value of the properties there, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I know for a fact that the 
<br/>former Leader of the Government in Parliament has a three-storey building just at the end, that is 
<br/>investment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, despite the high cost, what major projects are you going to 
<br/>tell  the  people  of  Fiji  and,  particularly,  Suva,  you  have  in  place  in  the  next  four  years  while  in 
<br/>Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already explained our priorities and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are already there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Think big, man!

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The double lane is from Laqere to Suva Point.

<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Do not lower your standards.

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Upgrade of roads and bridges, rural roads and bridges in 
<br/>Vanua Levu.  You mentioned Seaqaqa and, of course, the sealing of non-sealed roads and new 
<br/>roads, of course.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this financial year.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The next Question, I am allowing honourable Aliki Bia to raise this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on behalf of honourable Bulitavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Policy on Menstrual Health and Hygiene 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 166/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament what the policy 
<br/>is  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  sanitary  pads  under  the  Menstrual  Hygiene 
<br/>Management activity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to correct the question that has been 
<br/></span><span>raised because the Ministry of Education does not distribute sanitary pads.  It only distributes the 
<br/>sanitary pad vouchers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is talking about the policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- It is about the young girls.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to introduce and to table the iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 before this august Parliament.  This is an important aspect of our 
<br/>history  where  we  wish  to  give  legislative  recognition  once  again  to  the  establishment  of  a 
<br/>fundamental  institution,  which  is  the  Great  Council  of  Chiefs  (GCC)  or  Bose  Levu  Vakaturaga 
<br/>(BLV)</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The GCC is a historical institution of our forefathers, whose role was recognised under the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1990 and 1997 Constitutions to be consulted on, make recommendations and take decisions in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span> Editor’s Note:  Reply to Written Question No. 170/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>Reply to Written Question No. 171/2023 tabled by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for  
<br/>Justice is appended as Annexure IV. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>2052 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>matters concerning the good governance and wellbeing of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.  This requirement to 
<br/>have the GCC in place is specified under the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944, which also makes reference 
<br/>to  the  GCC  in  various  other  provisions  under  the  Act  and  in  other  legislation  relating  to  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  2012, these important  key provisions were removed  entirely  and also 
<br/>extended  to  the  regulations  or  subsidiary  laws  that  were  made  under  the  Act,  and  I  say,  without 
<br/>consultation or consideration of our traditional leaders’ input, when it came to the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.  In 
<br/>fact, the deletion of provisions under the Act was done by way of a Decree, and as you all know, 
<br/>there was no Parliament in 2012, therefore, no opportunity was given to debate on the changes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  not  to  marginalise  anyone,  but  simply  to  highlight  that  it  is  our 
<br/>Coalition Government’s priority to restore the recognition of the GCC whilst under the Act to ensure 
<br/>that the voice and opinion of our traditional elders are considered when matters concerning </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>people, their traditions and culture arises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the amending legislation will come into force on a date or dates appointed by the Minister by notice 
<br/>in the Gazette. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act by inserting the definition of “Council” to 
<br/>mean the Great Council of Chiefs and the definition of “Permanent Secretary” to mean the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary responsible for iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill inserts section 3 of the Act to provide for the constitution and primary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>function of the GCC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section4(4) of the Act to require the iTaukei Affairs Board to 
<br/>refer to  the GCC any question relating  to  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people that the Minister may submit to  the 
<br/>Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 5 of the Act to empower the Minister to make regulations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in relation to the GCC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 11 of the Act to require the Minister to refer the Board or 
<br/>the Council any proposed Bill that is intended to be introduced in Parliament and which may appear 
<br/></span><span>to the Minister to affect in any important matter the rights and interests of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people. The Board 
<br/></span><span>or the Council, as the case may be, is then required to submit the proposed Bill with a memorandum 
<br/>to the Permanent Secretary. This memorandum contains respective comments on the proposed Bill 
<br/>to be used in parliamentary debate by Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 7 of the Bill consequentially amends the iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004, among other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things, to include reference to the GCC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  this  Government’s  priority  and  promise  to  institute  fundamental 
<br/></span><span>provisions and laws to give legislative recognition to the GCC. It is only imperative that Parliament 
<br/></span><span>deliberates on this in an expeditious manner, as there are so many laws that have been made that have 
<br/>direct  impact  on  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  people.  It  is  without  doubt  that  this  Bill  must  be  considered  so  that 
<br/>institutions, specifically dedicated to look into matters, are afforded the legislative authority to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Attorney-General  for  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presentation on this particular Bill.  We stand only on one issue and Government has the right to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2053 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>present its Bills and what it needs to change, and it has that particular right.  But there has not been 
<br/>a  single  legislation  that  this  Government  has  brought  to  Parliament  that  has  not  gone  through 
<br/>Standing Order 51; not a single one.  Let me say that again, not a single one.  This is from people 
<br/>who always talked about not using Standing Order 51. This Government has not given a Bill; a single 
<br/>one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We are clearing up your mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Not one! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People who say something and do the exact opposite are hypocrites.  I am not  calling you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hypocrites, but people who do that, they are hypocrites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that ground alone, we object to this going through Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no other comments to be made on the Bill, I now offer the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor to the honourable Attorney-General for his right of reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  I  think  if  honourable  Usamate  was  listening  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei Affairs’ comments, he would have understood the  purpose as to why this is to 
<br/>be brought forward.  As we debate on the Bill on Thursday, the reason will be fully articulated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
