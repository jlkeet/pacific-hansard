<div><span>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Mahogany  Industry  Development  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  28/2023),  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considered by Parliament without delay.  
<br/>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> November, 2023 
<br/>but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the right of reply given to me as the 
<br/>Member moving this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Mahogany  Industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 and why Parliament must consider it without delay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 was introduced to provide 
<br/>for  the  restructuring  of  the  Mahogany  Industry  in  Fiji  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  its  further 
<br/>development, having regard to the interest of indigenous landowners and the people of Fiji generally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be an understatement to state the importance of Fiji’s Mahogany 
<br/>Industry,  however,  one  cannot  deny  that  this  industry  requires  specific  knowledge  and  technical 
<br/>skillset for its sustainable development.  For this reason, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to transfer 
<br/>the overall responsibility of the Act and by extension, the regulating of the Mahogany Industry from 
<br/></span><span>the Office of the Prime Minister to the Ministry of Forestry, which will be able to provide the much-
<br/></span><span>needed technical expertise, advice and guidance in the Mahogany Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act repealed by the Fiji Mahogany Act of 2003 and transferred oversight 
<br/>of the Mahogany Industry from the Ministry of Forestry to the Office of the Prime Minister through 
<br/>the establishment of a Mahogany Industry Council wherein the Prime Minister is appointed as the 
<br/>chairperson.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amd’t) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The Bill, therefore, is really just an avenue for the reinstatement of what was previously the 
<br/></span><span>status quo</span><span>.  There have been consultations on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> of June, 2023 conducted by the Office of the 
<br/>Prime Minister with the Ministry of Forestry; the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics; Ministry of Public Enterprises; the Office of the Solicitor-General; Fiji 
<br/>Hardwood  Corporation  Limited;  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that Parliament considers the Bill without delay and 
<br/>that it be debated upon on Thursday, to allow the Ministry of Forestry to be the appropriate custodian 
<br/>that would assume responsibility of the Act, to begin with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion and at the end, we will have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, I come to assist the honourable Member 
<br/>and maybe that will mean a change of heart with the other side of Parliament.  We oppose this Sir, 
<br/>again, on the use of Standing Order 51.  I have one major concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General did state about the need for this Bill and the simple reason 
<br/>behind it was the reinstatement of the </span><span>status quo</span><span>.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have progressed a lot since 
<br/>the inception of these Acts.  Time has changed and that is why we object to the use of Standing Order 
<br/>51.  I have had one observation that I wish to state in front of Government this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initially, when we debated the President’s Address, most of the statements that were coming 
<br/>from this side of Parliament, we stated that this is where we have left off and hope that you will take 
<br/>it from there.  However, I have noted that instead of where we left off, they are going back to 1997 
<br/>where they left off and then trying to bring in these changes, so it is the context.  That is why we 
<br/>objected to Standing Order 51 because I, at some stage, served under the Fiji Mahogany Board under 
<br/>Mr. Winston Thompson and Mr. Uday Sen. I was given the Chairmanship for about a year before the 
<br/>Mahogany Decree came into place, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, this is critical.  We have just had some discussions about the pine industry business, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is not that we want to deny landowners the opportunity but, again, from the 
<br/>transition from Forestry into Fiji Hardwood and the problems that they faced and the need for this, 
<br/>that is why the role of the Committee is so important to look into the issue. That is why we are not 
<br/>just objecting for the sake of objecting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are better ways to do this, particularly 
<br/></span><span>given  the  importance  of  this  industry  and  how  it  can  contribute  to  Fiji’s  economic  progress, 
<br/></span><span>development, employment opportunities, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we really need to seriously look at some of these issues, not just reinstating 
<br/>the </span><span>status quo</span><span> for the sake of doing it but within the context of the time that we are in, the history, 
<br/>the changes and the challenges that it went through and use this Parliament to bring better alternatives 
<br/>and look at things, scrutinise them well so that we can be in a better position to make some informed 
<br/>decisions  and  bring  the  best  legislation  that  will  not  only  meet  the  needs  for  today  but  most 
<br/>importantly, for the future as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the comments from the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  it  is  a  cosmetic  change.    Once  it  is  reverted  to  Forestry,  there  will  be 
<br/>significant review that will go through the Committee stage.  We want it to go to Forestry and, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, you would probably understand more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has a lot of things on his plate, that is why it must be engineered by
