<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry  currently  has  a  vast  and  wide  footprint  in  our  four 
<br/>geographical Divisions.  Ice plants have been very beneficial to our rural communities in recent 
<br/>years and have greatly assisted the development of subsistence fishers to small scale artisanal fishers 
<br/>in providing the infrastructure necessary for preserving and maintaining the quality of fish products, 
<br/>enabling coastal communities to participate more effectively in the fisheries industry and enhancing 
<br/>their economic wellbeing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the latest 2021-2022 Annual Report tabled in 2023, the Ministry has 32 Fisheries 
<br/>Stations all over Fiji.  Of these 32 Fisheries Service Centres, the Ministry also has 24 Ice Plants.  
<br/>Listed below are the 24 Fisheries Service Centres that have ice plants.
