<h3>PAFCO.</h3>
<div><span>PAFCO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just keep on going from there, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The albacore that we get from our 
<br/>own fishing vessels, not all of it goes to PAFCO. So, the question that this side of Parliament and 
<br/>certainly, the Ministry of Trade is asking is, is there a way we can encourage those of our own fishing 
<br/>vessels?  About 7,000 metric tonnes, Mr Speaker, Sir, that are caught in Fiji Waters, but it is not all 
<br/>going to PAFCO.  It is something that we should be discussing and we will certainly be discussing 
<br/>and addressing in the near future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of skipjack tuna, Mr. Speaker Sir, currently it is expensive to export our skipjack 
<br/></span><span>tuna into the European Union because there is duty imposed on it.  Now, with the new Economic Co-
<br/></span><span>operation Agreement that is about to be signed, we will be taking steps to try and remove the duty 
<br/>and ensure that we are able to export economically into the EU market which, in itself, is one of the 
<br/>largest markets in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I agree with honourable Koroilavesau on the need to look at regional 
<br/>co-operation when it comes to fish supply.  In fact, this is a conversation I have just been having on 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2066 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Reportâ€“Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a regional level. The question that we have to ask is, why are we getting foreign vessels from outside 
<br/>to come and fish in our own waters?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to change this, it is wrong. You have oil in your country.  Do you get other people 
<br/>to come and get your oil? Your oil is your own and so as our fish stocks, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, over 
<br/>the next 12 months, you will see a lot more activity.  Certainly, I know that PNG is interested in 
<br/>having that conversation and through the honourable Minister for Fisheries, we will try and actively 
<br/>pursue this because ultimately, what it means is more jobs to our country, more money to Levuka 
<br/>and also a bit more economic activity in our country, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report did mention something about insurance.  I am assured 
<br/>by the current management that they did have some issues with insurance but is now being sorted.  It 
<br/>is to do with the cyclone insurance and that is comforting from a risk management perspective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would also like to congratulate PAFCO for introducing capacity building 
<br/>into their workforce.  It is the largest employer of workers in Levuka, over 780 people with salary of 
<br/>about $8 million.  It means a lot to Levuka and the Lomaiviti Province.  As I had mentioned, certainly 
<br/></span><span>this  side  of  Parliament  will  be  trying  to  do  things  to  make  PAFCO  more  profitable  and  more 
<br/></span><span>successful in years to come. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee of Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their comments and insights into the Annual Report and the challenges and opportunities being faced 
<br/>by PAFCO.  It is quite important that we take note of all these challenges and, of course, Government 
<br/>has to address some of the pertinent issues that have been highlighted by the Report and we hope that 
<br/>this  will  ensure  that  we  have  a  sustainable  tuna  industry  in  this  country  to  be  managed  now  by 
<br/>PAFCO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  everyone  who  has  contributed  and,  particularly,  Members  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committee.  I have no other comments to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
