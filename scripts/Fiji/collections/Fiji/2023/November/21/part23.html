<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI REVENUE AND CUSTOMS SERVICE  
<br/>2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018-2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tables 
<br/>its report on the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2018-2019 Annual Report earlier this year.  While 
<br/>reviewing the Report, the Committee noted the benefits of the CEOs forum held by Fiji Revenue and 
<br/>Customs Service (FRCS) annually and recommended for forums of such nature to be held at least on 
<br/>a biannual basis to further strengthen engagements with stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  agreed  that  because  of  the  significant  role  FRCS  plays,  it  is  important  to 
<br/>maintain a strong relationship with its stakeholders.  The Committee noted the 14 Memorandum of 
<br/>Understandings  (MOUs)  signed  during  the  period  under  review  and  recommended  that  these 
<br/>stakeholders work in collaboration to ensure compliance at all levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted with concern the significant increase in debtors due to outstanding fees 
<br/>and  charges  as  well  as  a  significant  increase  in  outstanding  inventory  funds.    The  Committee 
<br/>recommended that more practical measures be pursued to alleviate these matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also made recommendations for continuous awareness sessions to ensure that 
<br/>people are able to understand the compliance requirements.  Services and programmes such as Stock 
<br/>which appear in newspaper articles and border control, TV shows are a positive form of spreading 
<br/>awareness and similar initiatives must be taken on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and before offering 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the floor, I have a list of speakers before me from the Whips: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>honourable Vijay Nath; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Micro, Small and Medium 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enterprises; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>honourable P.D. Kumar; and the 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Review Report 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service  2018-2019  Annual  Report.  As  we  delve  into  this 
<br/></span><span>comprehensive report, I would like to highlight a few key points. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The CEO Forum is a resounding success and has gained the Committee’s recommendation 
<br/>for  biannual  rather  than  the  current  annual.    This  shift  will  foster  deeper  engagement  with 
<br/>stakeholders and strengthen relationships with relevant parties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2075 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  signing  of  14  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOUs)  during  the  review  period 
<br/>underscores  the  willingness  of  stakeholders  to  collaborate  with  FRCS  for  mutual  benefit.  This 
<br/>positive attitude towards compliance is commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  initiative  like  the  Gold  Card  Services  and  Authorised 
<br/>Economic Operators Programme has been instrumental in recognising and rewarding the compliant 
<br/>company with priority and privileged services.  This approach not only encourages tax compliance 
<br/>but also contributes to reducing the black economy, a significant loss in tax revenue that is crucial 
<br/>for our national development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Coaling Government to recognise that running of Government is 
<br/>not  an  easy  task.    It  demands  funding  for  various  initiatives  including  economic  stimulation, 
<br/>infrastructure  maintenance  and  upgrading  quality  and  free  education  for  primary  and  secondary 
<br/>levels, accessibility to healthcare and dental care and many more. It is imperative to understand that 
<br/>the majority of the funds required for these initiatives which the Government has yet to present to 
<br/>Parliament will be generated through tax revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in year 2018-2019, FRCS collected $2.8 billion, accounting for 66.4 percent 
<br/>of the overall Government revenue.  Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2019 dealt a 
<br/>severe blow to FRCS revenue collection, causing the dramatic drop to $1.692 billion.  In the post-
<br/>COVID fiscal year (2022-2023), FRCS managed to collect $2.285 billion.  While this represents a 
<br/>recovery, I sincerely hope that FRCS revenue collection will return to pre-COVID level in the near 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Customer Service Survey rating of 2.55 out of 5.0 raises concern about 
<br/>the need for improvement.  This rating indicates an approval rating of only 51 percent.  As the Report 
<br/>aptly states, FRCS has identified areas for improvement to enhance their rating.  I eagerly anticipate 
<br/>seeing the improvement in the approval rating in recent years and the specific measures implemented 
<br/>to elevate service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  analysis  revealed  and 
<br/>encouraging 47.95 percent female staff representation.  I applaud this achievement and hope to see 
<br/>an even higher percentage of female staff in the years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to concluding, I would like to address the fact that during the period 
<br/>covered  by  this  Report,  the  Cost  of  Living  and  debt  were  manageable.    However,  this  situation 
<br/></span><span>drastically changed with the offset of the COVID-19 pandemic which plunged our beloved nation 
<br/></span><span>into a state of economic hardship.  While we witnessed a low inflation rate during COVID-19 crisis, 
<br/>we are now facing a surge in the Cost of Living and inflation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has said yesterday that ANZ should 
<br/>be very careful while making such wild projections because the methodology they used is based on 
<br/>the gross value added of the retail sector.  The Minister further explained “inflation” is measured by 
<br/>the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based on the representative basket of goods and services purchased 
<br/>by  the  consumer  with  different  weights.    I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  to  consider 
<br/></span><span>updating the CPI basket as it relies on the outdated data of 2008.  The Coalition Government must 
<br/></span><span>recognise that the higher cost of living, the increase in VAT and the increase in inflation is inevitable 
<br/>led by reducing consumer spending constantly diminishing tax revenue.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I commend FRCS for its comprehensive report and commend the organisation 
<br/>for its significant contribution to the nation’s economic development. I urge the Government to heed 
<br/>the recommendations present in this Report and prioritise measures to enhance FRCS’s efficiency, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>effectiveness  and  consumer  service  to  ensure  that  continued  success  of  our  nation’s  revenue 
<br/>collection effect.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Review Report 
<br/>of the FRCS Annual Report 2018-2019 that was published this year.  I would like to congratulate the 
<br/>Committee for their comments.  Because my contribution is brief and will focus really on MSMEs, 
<br/>I just thought I respond to some of the outlandish statements that were made in the last question.  The 
<br/>first thing I would like to mention or state, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this adage, “if you cannot measure, 
<br/>you cannot manage.”  That is the summary of the government on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Women  and  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  were  very 
<br/>modest.  What they have been doing over the last 12 months is trying to collect data, which will 
<br/>enable them to start creating a pathway out of poverty for the people who are impoverished in this 
<br/>country.  They have gone so far as to talking to the Australian Embassy to develop a database which 
<br/>will  then  allow  us  to  say,  “how  many  are  genuinely  impoverished  in  our  country,  let  us  create  a 
<br/>pathway for them.”  Simple!    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other side, after 16 years, did not come up with something that this side of Parliament 
<br/>and  the  two  learned  honourable  Members  have  come  up  within  less  than  12  months.      So  going 
<br/>forward, you will find that there will be a concise, very clear plan to move people out of poverty and 
<br/>it will be measured.  The other side of Parliament used to come up with outlandish statements about, 
<br/>“we have reduced poverty by blah, blah, blah.”   No statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  honourable  Sashi  talked  about  interagency  corporation.    The  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament, I think there was only one person who used to credit himself with everything.  That is 
<br/>the secret to how we are going to get out of poverty in this country.  We have to work together as a 
<br/>country.  Every single agency in this country needs to work together to get us out of poverty.  It is 
<br/>not their problem, it is not our problem, it is not Kamikamica’s problem, it is our total problem.   As 
<br/>a country with data, we will be able to get out of poverty in this country.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is you may recall that in our budget 
<br/>speech, we talked about rebuilding Fiji.  In order to realise this alleviation of poverty, this side of 
<br/>Parliament is saying we need to rebuild Fiji, we need to rebuild the economic architecture of Fiji, 
<br/>which means: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Google</span><span> is landing a second cable into Fiji. Trust me, Sir, it will transform Fiji digitally; and 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister for Agriculture talked about how he wants to transform agriculture 
<br/></span><span>using mechanisation at farm level to try and value add. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the types of visionary ideas that will get us out of poverty.  So, when the other side 
<br/>of Parliament is saying, “what are we doing?”  We are doing a lot more than what you ever did in 16 
<br/>years.  Remember that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Where is your data? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to contribute very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quickly on the Report.  I would like to congratulate FRCS in terms of their Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  years,  being  an  accountant  myself,  I  have  seen  a 
<br/>transformation in FRCS.  They have moved from what used to be a very almost vindictive way of 
<br/>operating into a risk-based management system. So, if you are good taxpayer, you get rewarded as 
<br/>was alluded to by honourable Nath.  That is the way of the future, that is the way we should go, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2077 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looking at compliance and then managing taxation based on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second point I would like to make, I would like to credit the FRCS is they have started 
<br/>focusing on MSMEs as a specific area of interest.  They now have a unit that actually deals with 
<br/>MSMEs. We are working very closely with that Unit and again in terms of rebuilding this country, 
<br/>that piece of work will ensure that we continue to make the small steps in order to rebuild this country, 
<br/>rebuild the architecture and alleviate poverty which is something that these Members have mentioned 
<br/>for 16 years, all they did was take us backwards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  the  kind  of  response  you  get  when  he  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing much to say about the subject matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRCS play a very important role in the revenue collection, and it also assists 
<br/>in the overall development of Fiji. In other words, for revenue and customs services if they do not 
<br/>collect the revenue the Government is crippled. They will not be able to provide the services that we 
<br/>often talk about, for example, the support system that we need to provide to the vulnerable group or 
<br/>the roads that are needed in the rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need the revenue but  who are the people who are paying these revenue to  FRCS and 
<br/>collecting all these?  It is definitely the taxpayers of this country, whether you are running a business 
<br/>or you are an employee or sole trader, whatever you are, there are certain amount of taxes and duties 
<br/>levied which is collected by FRCS. In other words, FRCS’ real client are the public, Fijians, people 
<br/>who live in this country and, therefore, it is very important for them to be customer centric service 
<br/>oriented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For that, over the years FRCS underwent major reform, they continue to reform the taxation 
<br/>system from the customers’ point of view, they focused on simplifying tax administration system for 
<br/>better customer service experience. FRCS introduced the standard interpretation guideline to remove 
<br/>subjective  decision  making  and  for  the  first  time  automated  economic  operator  programme  was 
<br/>introduced  for  its  trusted  traders  who  are  accorded  benefits  by  the  customs  in  the  movement  of 
<br/>international cargo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  IT  investments  were  also  made  by  the  Government  to  assist  FRCS  in  designing  and 
<br/>implementing an online new tax system. Again, all that was done so that things become easier for 
<br/></span><span>the taxpayer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to provide a better avenue for aggrieved taxpayers, Fiji also has a tax court 
<br/>which further builds confidence in our taxpayers and investors. So, it is not one way, if people are 
<br/>aggrieved, they can take their matter to the tax court and recently the tax court had ordered FRCS to 
<br/>return a sum of $26 million to a foreign company; that builds confidence in the system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these reforms took place during FijiFirst Government with the intent to 
<br/>shift away from the authoritarian mindset to promoting a service-oriented approach where the goal 
<br/></span><span>is to enhance the overall experience of those receiving services.  In this regard, the Committee also 
<br/></span><span>recommended  that  FRCS  identify  areas  of  improvement  to  enhance  the  customer  survey  rating, 
<br/>which was 2.55 out of 5, and suggested that they need to develop better strategies to improve this 
<br/>customer service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  interesting  to  note  when  you  go  through  the  Report  where  the  staff  in  terms  of 
<br/>atmosphere within FRCS and how staff are operating within FRCS, they gave a very high rate which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>2078 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>means it is a very conducive environment to work which is good but do the customers feel the same? 
<br/>Well, this rating shows the other way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Financial Intelligence Report, it identified the two top possible underlying criminal activities 
<br/>identified in the suspicious transaction reporting were tax evasion, frauds and scams were right there than 
<br/>anything else which means we still have people who are avoiding tax and FRCS is trying their best to 
<br/>arrest that but for the Government, it is loss of revenue.  Every effort must be made to recover every cent 
<br/>that people owe, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  again,  if  you  read  the  report  during  the  year,  FRCS  paid  around  half  a  million  dollar  to 
<br/>whistleblowers  which  is  again  a  very  good  strategy  to  encourage  people  to  come  up  and  report  tax 
<br/>evasion.  Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kamikamica mentioned that Ministry of Women are 
<br/>collecting data and creating a database so that correctly we can identify the vulnerable groups and we can 
<br/>pay them et cetera.  Let me make it very clear rather than each Ministry making their own little database 
<br/>to give this and that, it is important to work on the national ID for each and every citizen; that is the way 
<br/>forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the honourable Members, I thank the 
<br/>Chairman of the Committee. I think the contributions from the honourable Members have been very 
<br/>good.  I thank the contribution from the opposition both from honourable Nath and honourable Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FRCS as rightly pointed out is a very critical and important arm of Government 
<br/>because as honourable Kumar said quite rightly, if this organisation does not collect the revenue, the 
<br/>whole  fiscal  situation,  revenue  and  expenditure  for  Government  is  dependent  on  how  effective  and 
<br/>efficiently we are able to implement all the tax policies, how efficiently and effectively we are able to 
<br/>collect revenue?  If you look at the contributions that we have had so far from yesterday and the budget 
<br/>debate, despite the articulation of how Government should manage their budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is always, Mr. Speaker, Sir, demand for more expenditure, demand for more revenue from 
<br/>every sector of the economy and the Government has to have that fiscal space to be able to provide those 
<br/>services. What has happened, Mr Speaker, Sir, over the years apart from notwithstanding the impact of 
<br/>Covid-19 and the devastation on the economy.  What we have seen over the last 10 years or 12 years is a 
<br/>kind of economics (what I can voodoo economics) where we have concentrated on borrowing, spending 
<br/>and perhaps, not looking at it carefully on how we can also mobilise resources through the appropriate 
<br/>tax system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2023-2024 budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have carefully navigated our way, we have 
<br/></span><span>made sure that we provide a platform in the budget where we are able to collect reasonable amount 
<br/>of revenue, where we are able to than put out the appropriate expenditure into appropriate sectors, 
<br/>particularly health, social welfare, agriculture that all has seen an increase in the last budget.  So as  
<br/>a government, what we are looking at, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to make sure and I take all the points that 
<br/>have been raised by honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica and honourable Premila Kumar 
<br/>about  what FRCS is and how it has changed. The allocation for FRCS in the current budget is about 
<br/>$45.5 million. This is an increase of about 13.8 percent compared to the budget of $40 million for 
<br/>the last financial year.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this increase in budget is timely for the newly unveiled 
<br/></span><span>strategic  plan  that  has  substantial  plans,  objectives  and  once  operationalised  effectively,  it  can 
<br/></span><span>produce substantial windfall gains not only for the organisation but for the government as a whole in 
<br/>terms of collecting revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Nath talked about the basket, in fact, it is not 2008 it is 2014, the base that they 
<br/>are using to calculate the CPI and I agree with him. The Bureau of Statistics, we have brought back 
<br/>the Government Statistician who was unceremoniously removed by the previous Government.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2079 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bureau of Statistics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is already working on re-basing the calculation of CPI. We are 
<br/>going to also re-look at the basket, his is right, it is an old basket, things have changed, consumption 
<br/>patterns have changed, we need to look at the weights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While sessions from some of the Members, unlike a very good contribution from honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar and honourable Vijay Nath on specific suggestions about how the cost of living has 
<br/>increased simply because of the budget or because of the new tax measures, they  do not realise, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that we are still transitioning from the impact of COVID, loss of jobs and loss of income. 
<br/>What the figure show, as I had pointed out yesterday, Mr. Speaker, there is job growth, in fact, as I 
<br/>have said, in the formal sector.  This is FNPF data which shows that the salaries and wages have 
<br/>actually increased somewhere between 10 percent to 12 percent, which is also a factor of the demand 
<br/>for are tight labour market. We have lost some labour but the other side of the coin is that there are 
<br/>more jobs being created as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  I  am  saying  is  that,  in  the  FRCS,  contrary  to  the  assertions  that  was  made  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Member  who  is  not  in  Parliament  now  that  we  will  lose  tax  revenue  because  the 
<br/>disposable income has gone down and because the cost of living is so high, in fact, for October 2023, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, net tax collection is $26 million or 10.7 percent above the forecast, compared to 
<br/>the same period last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tax revenue is higher by about $18.9 million or 43.8 percent and it comes from a number of 
<br/>measures that we have in the budget and if you look at the increase in revenue, we are adding about 
<br/>$500 million to $600 million as a permanent increase in revenue into the budget. And if you look at 
<br/>the expenditure that has gone out of that, increase in the social welfare Ministry’s  budget, increase 
<br/>in the education budget, increase in the health budget. We are fixing some of the infrastructure in the 
<br/>health sector.  I was in Nausori the other day and I met people and they were related by the fact that 
<br/>after so many years of neglect of the Nausori Health Centre, suddenly it is being renovated.  Similar 
<br/>things we have done in the last 10 months throughout the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you  go to  Dreketi, Wainikoro and Korovou you will see Government 
<br/>quarters being painted now. The things are happening, and I have been told that the CWM Hospital 
<br/>is for the first time in many years, you know that clean that people can go there. So, these are things 
<br/>that are happening as a result of what we have done and all these, Mr. Speaker, can be done properly 
<br/>if we are able to collect enough revenue. So as a Government we have put all these measures. If we 
<br/>did not take some of these tax measures if we did not look at FRCS as an important institution that 
<br/>can collect this on the basis of the policies of the Government, we will not be able to do this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge honourable Members on the other side when they speak to look at the facts of what is 
<br/>happening.  On the part of Government we will continue to support FRCS. I think we have seen what 
<br/>they are capable of doing. There has been a lot of efficiencies that I have seen in the last six months 
<br/>coming out of the organisation and I want to take this opportunity to thank the Board and all those 
<br/>who are at the helm at the moment for driving and making sure that Government’s policies - measures 
<br/>in the Budget are effectively implemented and revenue collected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their  valuable  contribution  on  the  Report.  We  realise  the  important  role  that  FRCS  placed  its 
<br/>contribution  to  revenue  collection.   We would like to  thank FRCS for the reforms  that they have 
<br/>undertaken as we believe that it will significantly contribute to revenue collection in this country.
