<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting of Parliament.  It has been a while since 
<br/>we are able once more to continue with our programmes as already included in our calendar.  I also 
<br/>welcome those who are joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television 
<br/>and the internet.   Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report of the Emoluments Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as I had informed the Business Committee, I received a letter from the 
<br/>Chairperson of the Emoluments Committee, informing that the Committee will not table its report 
<br/>during this week’s sitting but at a later sitting of Parliament.  For the information of all honourable 
<br/>Members, this is well within the parameters of the Resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span>

<div><span>Time Limitation – Debate on Standing Committee Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, at its sitting last Friday, the Business Committee unanimously agreed 
<br/>to impose time limitations during debates on the Standing Committee Reports and this is to ensure 
<br/>meaningful and efficient use of parliamentary time.  You would have seen that there would be about 
<br/>five reports for debates per day from today through to Thursday. I trust that the Government and 
<br/>Opposition Whips will action the responsibility accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as further agreed by the Business Committee, the final decision on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>times and the number of speakers will rest with the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
