<div><span>The  Committee  noted  a  few  highlights  for  the  year  2014  and  2015,  which  allowed  the 
<br/>continuous improvement of the Council’s work on Levuka.  For instance, the 2015 Back to Levuka 
<br/>Carnival which was revived after 15 years; the partnership between the Council and Animals Fiji 
<br/>VET from UK for a weeklong clinic of de-sexing domesticated and wildlife animals; and the Council

<br/>Embassy donated a compactor truck to manage solid waste in Levuka during the 2014 financial year, 
<br/>and through the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP), continuous support and improvement 
<br/>provided to upgrade Levuka’s road and drainage system; the improvement of the depot and the town
