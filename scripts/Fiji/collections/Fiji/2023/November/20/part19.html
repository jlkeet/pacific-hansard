<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI AIRPORTS 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of the 2020 Fiji Airports Annual Report which was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tabled on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Airports  is  responsible  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operation of 15 public airports in the Fiji Islands.  These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two international airports – Nadi International Airport, Fiji’s main international gateway, 
<br/>and Nausori Airport, Fiji’s domestic hub; and 
<br/>13 outer island airports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airports also provides Air Traffic Management in the Nadi Flight Information Region.  
<br/>This includes the airspace of Fiji, Tuvalu, New Caledonia, Kiribati and Vanuatu – covering an area 
<br/>of 6 million square kilometres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports is a fully owned Government Commercial Company that was 
<br/>established  in  April  1999  into  a  separate  commercial  and  regulatory  authority  under  the  Public 
<br/>Enterprises Act 1996.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports’ establishment was part of an overall Government policy to 
<br/>ensure that Government entities were more efficient, productive and accountable, and more focussed 
<br/>on  commercial  activities  and  profitability.    The  outer  island  airports  are  operated  as  part  of  Fiji 
<br/>Airports’ social obligation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2020,  Fiji  Airports  recorded  a  net  operating  profit  before  tax  of  $1.6 
<br/>million.    Fiji Airports declared a total of $175 million in dividend over the last six years from 2014 
<br/>to 2019.  Despite this unprecedented dividend payout, the total shareholder equity stood at $488.6 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  operation  of  Fiji  Airports  was  severely  affected  by  the  prolonged  COVID-19  global 
<br/></span><span>economic crisis, which negatively affected its revenue.  However, it remained steadfast to emerge 
<br/>strong  as  an  organisation,  having  necessarily  gained  insights,  developed  strategies  and  prudently 
<br/>restructured its business model for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  is  yet  to  receive  a  substantive  response  on  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee Report, as according to Standing Orders 121(6)(b), which requires the agency to provide 
<br/>the response within 21 days of receiving the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion, but 
<br/></span><span>doing so, just like in the previous motions, I have a list from the Whips on those who will participate 
<br/>in the debate, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. A.A. Maharaj; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;

<div><span> Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Lal; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises, and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to give my short contribution with 
<br/>regards  to  the  review  of  the  Fiji  Airports  2020  Annual  Report.    Before  I  do  so,  I  would  like  to 
<br/>congratulate the newly appointed CEO of Fiji Airports Limited, Mr. Mesake Nawari, who is taking 
<br/>the lead role in gearing up Fiji Airports from where it was left by the former CEO, the late Mr. Faiz 
<br/>Khan. We should thank the late Mr. Khan for his contribution towards the leadership of Fiji Airports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one thing that  we have actually  seen, if we look  at  the record, that in  2006, 
<br/>Airports Fiji Limited used to make an annual profit of around $0.5 million.  In 2019, Airports Fiji 
<br/>Limited made a record profit of close to $80 million and they almost made a 50 percent payout in 
<br/>dividend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know what the Government side will actually oppose is increasing the rental of real estates 
<br/>and the tenants that we were able to actually get that much of profit.  But we should thank Mr. Khan 
<br/>for uplifting the face of Nadi Airport itself.  That is one of the only airports in Fiji that is making 
<br/>profit.    The  rest  of  the  13  airports,  including  Nausori  Airport,  are  basically  social  or  corporate 
<br/>responsibility of Fiji Airports Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  one  side  while  Fiji  Airports  Limited  pays  dividend  to  the 
<br/>Government, on the other side, they also have a social responsibility of running these 13 airports 
<br/>which are basically non-profitable.  So, it is kind of double-dipping and I urge the Government to 
<br/>consider giving something back to Fiji Airports Limited so that they can run those 13 other non-
<br/>profitable airports that they are managing at this point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why we see Nadi International Airport making profit is because 
<br/>the planes are landing at Nadi Airport.  They pay substantial amount of fees to land and taxi at the 
<br/>Airport, so that is one of the reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  back  in  2020,  there  were  a  lot  of  calls  to  actually  sell  those  planes  that  are 
<br/>landing at Nadi Airport.  Had we actually taken that decision to sell all these Fiji Airways planes, Mr 
<br/>Speaker, what would we have done with these airports now that we know that tourism is one of the 
<br/>biggest factor why our economy has boomed back to where it is today.  Sometimes strong decisions 
<br/>were taken, we had to take those decision and we should thank the FirstFirst Government ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- … for not listening to the Opposition back then and sending the 
<br/>planes that they were actually requesting. Unfortunately, honourable Gavoka is not here who was 
<br/>playing the lead role in telling the Government to sell the planes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The state of the airport, Mr. Speaker, as I said, Nadi Airport has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been commended by a lot of visitors coming to Fiji… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- ... that arriving at Nadi Airport is one of the best airports that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can actually flew in to the South Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1991 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that  same note  I would like to  request  there  was  a  banner in  Labasa 
<br/>Terminal back in 2020 to upgrade the terminal.  When we used to fly to Labasa Airport we used to 
<br/>see  that  banner  ever  since  this  Government  has  come  into  picture  they  have  pulled  down  that 
<br/>particular banner and I do not know where the banner is. Please look into it, people of Labasa and 
<br/>Vanua Levu ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Refurbishment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, it is almost a year now, should have done it by now.  Do not 
<br/>say you are going to do it after we have actually raised this in Parliament”.  It was a very good design, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  the  terminal  and  while  I  am  talking  about  the  terminal  that  also  brings  me  to  this 
<br/>particular point about Northern Airways.  I believe that is the only Airways that is actually owned by 
<br/>a local.  The charges of Northen Airways is quite substantial.  At the moment it is only flying once 
<br/>to  Labasa.    Initially  it  used  to  be  two  trips  -  morning  and  afternoon.    He  is  giving  a  quite  good 
<br/>competition to Fiji Link as well in providing a very good fare for the citizens to fly from Suva to 
<br/>Labasa and back to Suva as well.  They should be given some kind of rebate in terms of what they 
<br/>are actually paying in fees to Airports Fiji Limited, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that we can see that a local 
<br/>owner of a local airways company.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are trying to destroy it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No, no, we never did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Your former boss did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What have you been doing for a year now - still waiting?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some of the things that I would like to 
<br/>mention  about  Airports  Fiji  Limited,  they  are  doing  a  wonderful  job  and  I  wish  the  former 
<br/>Management  and  the  current  Management  as  well  for  the  future  endeavours.    Thank  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this motion that we debate the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report of Fiji Airports 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report was quite comprehensive, it gave us the responsibilities and also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the ups and downs of their performance. This report is about the Year 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will go straight to the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because noting all those ups and 
<br/>downs, the reasons and also giving themselves time to look at why they have been subjected to the 
<br/>vagaries of business and international travel, they have come up with certain resolutions on how to 
<br/>perform better into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  has  made  recommendations  after  studying  the  Report  and  the  first 
<br/></span><span>recommendation is that the Committee recommends that Fiji Airports embark on and prioritise the 
<br/>commercial development of its real estate portfolio to maximise its non-aeronautical revenue stream.  
<br/>From  the  Government’s  point  of  view,  the  recommendation  is  noted.  Fiji  Airports  current  non-
<br/>aeronautical revenue is mainly from concessions and rental revenue from officers, warehouses, land 
<br/>leases and housing and right now they are going to diversify their revenue sources and venture into 
<br/>real estate and alternative revenue streams to mitigate future disruptions in the aviation industry. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of that, Fiji Airports will conduct a development plan assessment of potential land 
<br/>development opportunities associated with the land in Namaka. My last visit to them, I was shown 
<br/>the map and all the potential areas for development which all look very promising. The proposed 
<br/>development plan is expected to spend over the next 25 years and will engage consultants to assist in 
<br/>the development of a master plan for land development and progress plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation that the Committee made as part of its social responsibility, the 
<br/>Government considers providing support to Fiji Airports for the implementation of its Capital Work 
<br/>Programme for Outer Island Airports.  The Committee recommendation is noted, a major component 
<br/>of Fiji  Airports’ Capital  Work Programme is  the maintenance of outer island airports  and in  that 
<br/>regard, Fiji Airports has also developed an outer island infrastructure plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recent years, Fiji Airports has been internally financing its capital works including outer 
<br/>island maintenance.  In terms of major capital projects, they have secured $40 million loan from ANZ 
<br/>and the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP). Government supports 
<br/>the  Fiji  Airports  efforts  in  maintaining  the  outer  island  airport  and  has  assisted  Fiji  Airports  in 
<br/>facilitating international funding in terms of financing and grants towards the outer island airports 
<br/>development.  As a result of discussions between Government and the World Bank in relation to the 
<br/>10-year tourism projects in Vanua Levu, we have plans to upgrade airport facilities in Labasa and 
<br/>Savusavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  three  is  noted,  which  is  to  prepare  a  contingency  plan  to  account  for 
<br/>possible future events or circumstances and all the recommendations as contained in the Report from 
<br/>our Social Affairs Committee are noted by the Government and we promise to follow through with 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the 
<br/>Review of the Fiji Airports Annual Report 2020 and I also would like to thank the Committee for the 
<br/>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the support of  Fiji  Airports, Fiji  was one of the fastest  growing economies after the 
<br/>devastating effects of COVID-19.  Infact, some of the Opposition Members then were not in favour 
<br/>of buying more planes and some had made TikTok mocking the decision to buy airbuses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. LAL.- Through these planes a lot of tourists came to Fiji and our economy started 
<br/></span><span>moving  towards  normalcy.  It  was  the  foresight  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  that  has  led  to  the 
<br/>development of the Fiji Airports to where it is today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Sir, prior to the pandemic, Nadi International Airport handled an average of 
<br/>41  international  flights  per  day.    With  no  flights,  the  airports’  revenue  evaporated  and  with  no 
<br/>passengers coming through arrival and departure terminals, airports’ tenants were not able to meet 
<br/></span><span>their lease obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aviation and travel industries were the greatest corporate casualties of the pandemic.  There 
<br/>were massive job losses, pay cuts and reduced working hours worldwide. Fiji Airports capacity to 
<br/>remain  a  viable  business  entity  to  meets  its  operational  expenses  and  credit  obligations,  put  the 
<br/>company  under  immense  financial  pressure.  Despite  the  momentous  challenges  faced  during 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1993 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19,  Fiji  Airports  was  able  to  progress  and  commission  new  state  of  the  art  Air  Traffic 
<br/>Management System in April 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In November 2020, Fiji Airports achieved a milestone by obtaining a Certification of Airport 
<br/>Health Accreditation from the Airports Council International. Sir, COVID-19 pandemic caused the 
<br/>total international passenger movement to shrink by 81 percent, not only that but it also affected the 
<br/>balance sheet and resulted in the worst financial performance. During the pandemic, Fiji Airports 
<br/>continued  to  provide  employment  to  our  people  through  a  management  restructure  and  staff 
<br/>reduction. Nadi is also the only airport in the South Pacific to have received Level 3 Airport Carbon 
<br/>Accreditation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2020, the two major projects including the Nausori Runway Upgrade and Extension Project 
<br/>and the Nadi Offgates Apron Project had commence before the pandemic and had continued based 
<br/>on its needs and the downturn in aircraft movement. In November 2021, the Nausori International 
<br/>Airport Runway Project had reached completion despite COVID-19’s impact. The Nausori Runway 
<br/>Upgrade  and  Extension  Project  has  enhanced  the  Boeing  737  aircraft  movements  in  and  out  of 
<br/>Nausori. This has allowed airlines to carry more passengers on the Boeing 737 compared to previous 
<br/>load restrictions. This runway upgrade has changed international travel in and out of Nausori for the 
<br/>greater good of the Deuba/Nausori corridor. It allows for the further extension of the runway to cater 
<br/>for Airbus A350 movements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, all these developments took place when the FijiFirst Government was in 
<br/>place.  The  FijiFirst  Government  always  worked  towards  improving  its  services  and  making  sure 
<br/>these services reached the wider communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- With this Coalition Government, you cannot say the same, as in the past 11 
<br/>months, we have not seen any real progress but a lot of contradictions - on one hand saying something 
<br/>and the other hand doing the opposite. One such example, the Government is talking about protecting 
<br/>our oceans and marine resources, but the honourable Prime Minister goes ahead and allows Japan to 
<br/>dump its nuclear waste in the ocean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Sir, I can give many such examples but I will leave that to my colleagues.  
<br/></span><span>There are many questions regarding the charter flight to Israel.  Who is going to bear the cost of this 
<br/></span><span>charter flight?  There are many unanswered questions about this issue?  Sir, a lot of questions were 
<br/>also asked about the so called conspiracy theory about Waqavuka.</span><span> </span><span>I hope that is all clarified now 
<br/>after a statement was issued on this. With these words, Sir, I once again thank the Committee for its 
<br/>recommendations so that further improvements could be done to better the services of Fiji Airports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER: Thank you honourable Virendra Lal for your wonderful counter-punches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute 
<br/></span><span>to the debate on the Review of the Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report and I noticed that the FijiFirst 
<br/></span><span>Government always gets preoccupied itself aggrandisement or self-praise.  Sometimes  they speak 
<br/>about  the  wrong  company,  Sir.    We  are  talking  about  Fiji  Airports,  they  were  talking  about  Fiji 
<br/>Airways; I am not sure how that is related.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they praise themselves for what the performance of Fiji Airports, but I think 
<br/>you have to stack back a bit in history and the credit for that sits with the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>1994 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because he started the reform process of Fiji Airports.  Before it was altogether, the regulatory arm 
<br/>and the commercial arm, the honourable Prime Minister had the vision to separate it and what we 
<br/>have today is, not from them, the origin came from this side of Parliament.  So, I thought I just remind 
<br/>them of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I would like to thank them for is, they almost sold every other asset in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only asset that was left is Fiji Airports; everything else they have sold.   So, I have to 
<br/>thank them for that.  Trust me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will not sell our assets as wilfully as the other 
<br/>side of Parliament has done.  The third one was, this was just more sort of a sharing from my side.  
<br/>They lament that there is only one profitable part of Fiji Airports and there are 12 other airports that 
<br/>are non-profitable.  That is a fact of life in our country.  There is only one point of entry and so, there 
<br/>is close subsidisation that happens.  It is a responsibility that we have to bear as part of delivering 
<br/>services to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I also join the chorus in congratulating the new CEO, Mr. Mesake 
<br/>Nawari.   A lot of us know him on a personal basis.  He is a man of calibre, and I know that the other 
<br/>side of Parliament is asking about what we are going to do.  Give him time, he will impress you all.  
<br/>He is  making plans to  develop  the airport in  Labasa, that is  why the signage may come down in 
<br/>Labasa.  He is making plans for Nadi, as we all know, we are getting more aircrafts into Nadi.  We 
<br/>need  5,000  rooms,  therefore,  we  will  need  a  bigger  airport.    These  are  the  plans  on  this  side  of 
<br/>Parliament that Mesake will bring at the appropriate time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Report itself, you have to congratulate Fiji Airports and its management at 
<br/>that time.  They were facing a very difficult time in 2020, and both sides of Parliament congratulate 
<br/>them  for  managing  themselves  through  a  very  difficult  time  in  our  country.    We  also  note  with 
<br/>encouragement that during that time, they actually managed to get accreditation as well in terms of 
<br/>carbon accreditation, and I understand that they are still the only airport in the South Pacific that has 
<br/>such accreditation.  We also would like to congratulate them for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  two  other  points  in  the  Report  that  I  thought  I  would 
<br/></span><span>highlight.  The first one was, there was the recommendation about the expansion of non-aeronautical 
<br/></span><span>revenue, that was developed even when I used to be in aviation.  The first steps were made during 
<br/>the time of the honourable Prime Minister, and I can see that with the expansion that is required at 
<br/>the airport, there will be opportunity for more non-aeronautical revenue with the expanded airport as 
<br/>with the other outer islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is more of an accounting matter, the other side of Parliament is always good at window 
<br/>dressing and for a long time they used to debate that the government grants needed to be recognised 
<br/>as capital  rather than revenue.   I am  pleased to  note that good sense has  prevailed, and it is  now 
<br/></span><span>recorded as revenue as it should be for proper accounting purposes.  Once again, I congratulate the 
<br/></span><span>former and current management of Fiji Airports and wish them well in the expansion plans that they 
<br/>have, and I support the Report before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak in reply.
