<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission 2018 -2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr Speaker Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  tabled  its  Report  of  the  Fijian 
<br/>Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC)  2018–2019  earlier  this  year  in  April.    While 
<br/>deliberating, the Committee agreed that FCCC plays a significant role in ensuring that consumers in 
<br/>Fiji  are  protected  from  unfair  and  unethical  market  practices.  It  works  with  a  vision  to  create  a 
<br/>dynamic and competitive market in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  was  pleased  to  note  the  array  of  information  that  was 
<br/>available in the 2018– 019 Annual Report which helped during our deliberations. The FCCC had 
<br/>submitted a written submission which provided the Committee with a better understanding of the 
<br/>operations during the period under review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  reading  through  the  analysis  that  was  provided  by  FCCC,  the 
<br/>Committee noted that the number of rentals complaints increased by 58 percent and recommended 
<br/>that further consultations are held with all stakeholders. It further noted that the three worst industries 
<br/>in terms of complaints received included automotive, construction and white goods with automotive 
<br/>comprising of 57 percent and made recommendations of the same.  The 2018-2019 period was when 
<br/>FCCC had launched its 5-year strategic plan which was from the 2018–2023, given the important 
<br/>roles played by FCCC. The Committee looks forward to future reporting against its yearly business 
<br/>plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER:- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Before 
<br/>offering  the  floor,  I  would  like  to  inform  you  honourable  Members  that  we  have  a  list  of  speakers 
<br/>identified by the Whips that are here: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Hon.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic Development, National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Planning &amp; Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  speak  on  this  motion  before 
<br/>Parliament.  We all know the importance of FCCC in the marketplace. The crucial role of FCCC is 
<br/>promoting a fair and efficient market by addressing the imbalance that exists between businesses and 
<br/>also between consumers and businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCCC was established by folding up three institutions which were:  Fair 
<br/>Trading  Department,  Prices  &amp;  Incomes  Board  and  Commerce  Commission.    Over  several  years, 
<br/>FCCC  has  become  a  multi  sectorial  regulator,  and  if  one  analyses  FCCC  into  detail,  it  is  a  very 
<br/>modern institution that deals with issues which is faced by businesses and consumers, and it tries to 
<br/>create  that  fair  marketplace.    That  is  really  the  intent  of  FCCC.    The  Committee  made  several 
<br/>recommendations to further protect unsuspecting consumers in the marketplace, and to improve the 
<br/></span><span>performance of FCCC when market practices and dynamics keep changing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  period  under  review,  FCCC  received  maximum  complaints,  as  we  have  heard 
<br/>from  the  Chair  of  the  Committee,  and  the  complaints  were  on  rental  properties,  automobiles, 
<br/>construction and white goods.  It is disappointing to note that the hard work done by FCCC in coming 
<br/>up with a self-regulating Guideline for Landlord and Tenants in 2010 did not actually reduce the 
<br/>number of complaints.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2003 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  just  heard  from  the  Chair  again  that  the  number  of  complaints  increased  in  that 
<br/>particular year by 58 percent.  The nature of complaints are such that sometimes it is very hard for 
<br/>the institutions to find solutions, for example, there is no law that governs how the bonds or deposits 
<br/>should  be  treated  and  how  it  should  be  refunded.    Often  the  landlords  will  come  up  with  the 
<br/>unjustified quotations and they will expect the tenants to pay for the wear and tear.  We have also 
<br/>come  across  situations  where  landlords  disconnect  water  and  electricity  supply,  creating  more 
<br/>problems, and on the other hand we have tenants who do not comply with the 30- day eviction notice.  
<br/>There are many other issues surrounding rental premises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCCC, with its line Ministry has developed a draft Landlord and Tenants 
<br/>Bill, and the Committee was very well briefed on this particular Bill, which they are still trying to 
<br/>finalise.    We  do  understand  that  from  2020  to  early  2022,  it  was  not  possible  to  conduct  public 
<br/>consultation because of COVID-19, and we just hope that FCCC will speed up finalising the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that the honourable Minister of Finance is not in favour of Rent Freeze Order.  
<br/>He announced in January 2023, the changes will be made by FCCC on rent increase restriction on 
<br/>Residential and Ground Rent Order 2021.  We look forward to his further announcements now that 
<br/>December is around the corner and when the current Rent Freeze Order will expire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are obvious reasons  as to  why he is  not  in support of using the Rent  Freeze  Order, 
<br/>however, we are waiting for the changes he will announce that will, depending upon what the content 
<br/>of the changes would be, it will allow landlords to change rent based on market rate.  We do not 
<br/>know how consumers will manage an increase in rent at a time when VAT has gone up by 15 percent, 
<br/>and the promise to increase the minimum wage is yet to be realised.  It is a catch-22 situation.  What 
<br/>will happen to the inflation rate which is on the rise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  commend  FCCC  for  undertaking  the  investigation  into  Lagilagi 
<br/>Housing Project that assisted the Ministry of Economy at that time in refunding hundreds of Fijians 
<br/>who paid money to PCN with the hope of getting a flat.  We also commend FCC for coming up with 
<br/>fixed  penalty  regulation  which  will  streamline  FCCC’s  enforcement  and  provide  a  very  quick 
<br/>solution to the consumers or small businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I hope the Government now realises that FCCC does its work 
<br/>independently  without  fear  or  favour.  When  they  were  in  Opposition,  they  were  never  tired  of 
<br/>complaining about the CEO and the work he does with his team to make the marketplace competitive, 
<br/>informed, fair and efficient. I hope all their conspiracy theories regarding FCCC have been put to 
<br/></span><span>rest, now that they are in Government, they are working closely with the CEO of FCCC and realise 
<br/></span><span>that, that is their job, it is not an easy one, it is a very difficult job.  The CEO of FCCC has always 
<br/>lived up to it and he is still delivering at a time when the cost of living has risen and we often see him 
<br/>trying to educate the public through various press releases, through various other work that he does 
<br/>behind the scene to ensure that the marketplace is fair to the consumers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support 
<br/>the motion that is before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute as well to the FCCC 
<br/>Report for 2018-2019 and basically since coming into office, I have actually seen how tirelessly the 
<br/></span><span>FCCC works to monitor and regulate pricing in Fiji and protect our consumers from price gauging 
<br/></span><span>and unfair and dishonest practise. Let me assure Parliament that as you have probably worked out 
<br/>that  currently  we  are  noticing  an  escalation  in  scams  around  the  country.    I  will  be  answering  a 
<br/>question  in  that  regard  but  let  me  assure  Parliament  that  through  this  process,  there  will  be  a 
<br/>strengthening of laws regarding FCCC to  ensure that such scams  are not able to  take  foot in  our 
<br/>country.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I delve into the Report, I would also like to congratulate the board of FCCC and the 
<br/>hardworking team for the Report.  We do notice that they have tabled a strategic plan and as the Chair 
<br/>of the Committee has mentioned, they are looking forward to reports relative to the plan and it is  
<br/>encouraging to see a regulator that is strategic and forward looking in its endeavours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned as well by honourable Kumar which I quite agree, the increase in landlord and 
<br/>tenancy issues is still an on-going concern. I receive monthly reports from the Consumer Council, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and they are increasing.  I agree that something needs to done about it. There was 
<br/>a  technical  working  group  established  to  look  into  it  and  there  is  a  draft  Bill  already  making  its 
<br/>rounds.  We will ensure that, that Bill makes its way into Parliament to try and ensure that both the 
<br/>landlord and the interest of the tenants are protected and maintained.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in terms of FCCC enforcement, like I mentioned, the 2010 FCCC Act is also under 
<br/>review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the aim to explore avenues to deter non-compliance amongst traders 
<br/>and businesses. I have heard some suggestions that perhaps in the past some businesses were given 
<br/>leeway, that we will ensure that we clamp down on to ensure that the regulation is adjudicated fairly 
<br/>and justly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the introduction of increased VAT, the FCCC has been 
<br/>very actively monitoring pricing.  The Report which was produced today by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance is part of the active monitoring that is taking place and that is why, as the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance has alluded to, this side of the House has more calmer or sort of less panicky 
<br/>view of the price increases based particularly on the regular surveys that are being carried out by the 
<br/>FCCC which suggested there is also a lot of benefits accruing to the consumers through the price 
<br/>reductions. The biggest one that we saw lately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the reduction in butter prices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  other  areas  I  think  that  FCCC  is  working  on  is  to  look  at  an  alternate  dispute 
<br/>resolution mechanism that tries to resolve consumer disputes or disputes generally. So that is another 
<br/>area that the FCCC will work upon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from my dealings with the FCCC they continue to uphold the Government’s 
<br/>commitment to ensuring consumer rights are protected. Where there is abuse that necessary action is 
<br/>taken  to  discourage  unethical  market  practices  and  ensure  that  services  are  delivered  at  a  high 
<br/>standard and with quality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those comments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion on Report for the Review of the 
<br/></span><span>Standing Committee on the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission Annual Report of 2018 
<br/></span><span>and 2019 on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I thank the honourable Members who have spoken before me. 
<br/>All I want to say in my introduction is, this is an important and an independent institution. Since 2016 
<br/>a total budget of about $32 million has been provided to the organisation this year and the budget 
<br/>includes $4.8 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  both  the  honourable  Premila  Kumar  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kamikamica have raised a number of issues answered some of the concerns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The couple of points, Mr. Speaker, that  I  want  to make in  relation  to  the issues raised by 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar. I think she talked about the independence of FCCC. I agree with her. 
<br/>We once in the Opposition we know there were things being done. People were being forced to Fiji 
<br/>Independent  Commission  Against Corruption (FICAC).  Officials  were being  forced to  say things 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2005 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that they would not say otherwise.  We are a Government that respects those independents do and 
<br/>what they do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The points she raised about the rent freeze. Mr. Speaker, I think she is right that a lot of things 
<br/>have happened. The rent freeze was put in place in 2007. You look at the economics of rent freeze 
<br/>anywhere in the world. It is an emergency. It is a one-off response. It has a time limit to address a 
<br/>spike or something unintended that happens.  We have had this rent freeze for almost 15 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  economics,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  understand  what  we  call  perverse  incentive.  The 
<br/>unintended consequences of a particular policy if it is not reviewed. What has happened in the market 
<br/>is  not  only  the  quality  of  rental  properties  has  gone  down,  but  people  have  used  all  kinds  of 
<br/>unscrupulous waste to increase the rent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More importantly, Mr. Speaker, what has happened is, all those new flats that have come into 
<br/>the market, because the rule is that, if you have a base rent, for example, if your rent was $400 in 
<br/>2007, you cannot increase your rent, so what is happening is that, a lot of landlords have done all 
<br/>sorts of things. But what is also happening, the new ones that have come on the market, the landlords 
<br/>would raise the rent above the normal market rent that would normally be there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happens is, the intention of the rent freeze was to help the tenants, in fact it has worked 
<br/>the opposite. The rents have just increased. So I think, what we were saying at the beginning of this 
<br/>year, Mr. Speaker is that it needs to be reviewed and FCCC of course will do its due diligence and 
<br/>look  at  the  market,  what  is  happening  there  and  the  Landlords  and  Tenants  Agreement,  that 
<br/>honourable Kamikamica talked about, of course that started in 2017 and that is something we need 
<br/>to look at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The contribution, Mr. Speaker, from honourable Sharma – I am thoroughly disappointed and 
<br/>saddened by the fact that they keep saying that we are trying to stop young people from saying things, 
<br/>that does not mean Mr. Speaker, that when you are young, you have the licence to say and lie about 
<br/>the  facts  that  are  there.  He  started  by  saying,  there  is  no  job,  the  economy  is  not  doing  well, 
<br/>investment is not taking place, but the data Mr. Speaker, hard data, official data shows otherwise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Reserve Bank of Fiji has actually revised the initial forecast, Mr. Speaker, from 6 percent 
<br/>to 8 percent. All international organisations looking at our budget, appraised the budget, have looked 
<br/>at the growth forecast and all of them agree – the Internal Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian 
<br/>Development Bank have all agreed that growth is on the right trajectory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD - Other figures Mr. Speaker, ANZ also agrees with the growth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>figures, except they got it wrong with the inflation forecast.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the other point that he made, this is FNPF data. Formal sector wages in 2023, 
<br/>between January to August increased by 14 percent relative to 2020, Mr. Speaker. It increased! The 
<br/>other formal sector wages increased by 14 percent, relative to the same period in 2019. What it shows, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, is that there are a lot of jobs, there are a lot of vacancies – some arising out of people 
<br/></span><span>leaving,  but  also  there  is  job  growth.  The  President  of  the  Suva  Retailers  Association  called  out 
<br/>publicly and said if you are at home and you are looking for a job, please come because we need 
<br/>people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Tourism  Industry,  the  numbers  have  increased  beyond  2019.  The  wages  and  salaries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there have increased, Mr. Speaker.
