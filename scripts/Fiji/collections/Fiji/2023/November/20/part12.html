<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I can rule on that immediately since the Business 
<br/>Committee has approved what appears in today’s Order Paper. It is your right whether you still want 
<br/>to continue and air your views in this Chamber, that is well within your right honourable Whip.  But 
<br/></span><span>let me just remind honourable Members, what is decided upon and how it was decided in the Business 
<br/></span><span>Committee, remains with the Business Committee.  It is the outcome of the resolution, and that is 
<br/>what you see in the Order Paper that is before us, so we will leave that as it is and we shall continue.
