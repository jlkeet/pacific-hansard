<br/></span><span>2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017-2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023.

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023        Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1981 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, as 
<br/>a member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Report of the Justice, Law 
<br/>and Human Rights Committee on the review of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 
<br/>2017–2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in April of this year, and I wish to proceed 
<br/>directly to reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in the Report.  Sir, to 
<br/>begin with, there were few pertinent issues identified by the Committee which include that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Parliament  has  made  tremendous  strides  it  contributing  to  the  achievement  of  certain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically SDG 5 and SDG10. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Parliament has been provided great support by the Department and donor partners such as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the UNDP which have led to numerous noteworthy undertakings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The working conditions for Members of Parliament and staff have been given priority which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has allowed for Parliament to function well and carried out its mandate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The welfare of Members of Parliament and staff be given ample emphasis so as to maintain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a safe work environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  issues  were  addressed  and  clarified  by  the  Department  and  any 
<br/>information  on  this  can  be  retrieved  from  the  Committee’s  Report.    I  will  go  straight  into  the 
<br/>recommendations, Mr. Speaker, put forth by the Committee for the consideration of Parliament and 
<br/>these includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee commends the Department for its noteworthy achievement on SDG 5 and 
<br/>recommends  that  Parliament  continues  with  its  efforts  in  promoting  gender  equality  and 
<br/>empowerment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  Committee  commends  the  Department  for  its  achievement  on  SDG  10  in  terms  of 
<br/>physical  accessibility  to  the  Parliament  complex  and  numerous  initiatives  introduced  for 
<br/>expanding  accessibility  to  Parliament  business  such  as  the  sign  language  interpreters, 
<br/>however the Committee recommends the following to further support SDG 10, that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Parliament  considers  improving  accessibility  to  the  Complex  by  fast  tracking  the 
<br/></span><span>installation of aids such as direction signs and other means of accessibility which cater 
<br/></span><span>for persons who have mobility issues; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Parliament  further  considers  introducing  other  initiatives  such  as  </span><span>Hansard</span><span>  being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>published in the different vernacular languages and also in braille. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee believes that these would promote inclusivity in our society 
<br/>especially  those  who  take  interest  in  our  Parliament  sessions.    Furthermore,  the  Committee 
<br/>recommends that a clear demarcation of the Parliament precinct is considered by Parliament in order 
<br/>to facilitate easier accessibility to the Parliament precinct which also contributes to the achievement 
<br/></span><span>of SDG 10.  The Committee further recommends the expeditious digitisation of all parliamentary 
<br/></span><span>Hansard</span><span>. In terms of the parliamentary space and infrastructure, the Committee recommends that 
<br/>space should be provided for separate offices for the various parties represented in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  awareness  and  public 
<br/>engagement  programmes  for  Parliament  like  the  “Meet  the  Speaker”  and  “Parliament  Bus”  be 
<br/>revamped  to  include  all  Members  of  Parliament.  This,  Mr.  Speaker,  would  open  up  more

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunities for Members of Parliament in engaging with the public and raise awareness on matters 
<br/>pertaining to the standard procedures and matters of this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity and urge the honourable 
<br/>Members of this august Parliament to take note of the contents of the Committees Report and show 
<br/>support for the motion that is before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  have  also  received  a  list  of  speakers  from  the 
<br/>honourable Whips.  To lead off the batting, honourable Maharaj will lead off, that is to be followed 
<br/>by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Ketan  Lal  and  then  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to give  a short contribution on the 
<br/>Review of Parliament of the Republic of Fiji and before I give my remarks on the Report itself, I 
<br/>hope you are not holding a yellow card because we are discussing the Parliament of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji and I hope to not be the first one to receive the card.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three arms of the State - the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. 
<br/>All three arms have different roles, and it is very important that independence is actually maintained 
<br/>whenever we are talking about these three Arms of the State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I hope this is just a rumour that is floating around on social media about the 
<br/>Executive’s interference in the Judiciary. As I said, I just hope that it is a rumour and there is no fact 
<br/>to it but if there is any fact that Executive Ministers are interfering in the Judicial system then it is a 
<br/>very sad day for Fiji. Very poor.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will be consulting the video analyst on the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the same note now let me come to Parliament. The third arm which is the 
<br/>Legislature Department, if there is any kind of interference or is the Parliament totally independent? 
<br/>We need to maintain and ensure that Parliament is independent at all times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this report is quite old: 2017-2018 so I would like to actually speak on some of 
<br/>the current issues that we actually faced and the way of how we can improve. I will be basically 
<br/></span><span>talking on my nine years of experience in this Parliament and the first recommendation that talks 
<br/></span><span>about gender equality, it was good to see when this Parliament was reinstated, we had a Speaker, a 
<br/>Secretary-General and \a Deputy Secretary-General who were females and that was a very good way 
<br/>to actually portray that gender equality and most of the management roles were handled by females 
<br/>in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the role of the Parliament as a legislator needs to be justified and whether we 
<br/>are justifying by reducing the number of weeks by four weeks of Parliament Sitting this year, is again 
<br/>something that can be questioned because that can actually reduce the performance of the Parliament 
<br/></span><span>and us being the scrutinisers as Members of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  were  offered  laptops  which  crashed  within  weeks  and  these  were  new 
<br/>laptops, who procured it, what kind of quality assurance was there.  It did not just happened to one 
<br/>Member, it happened to a couple of Members. Most of the Members refused to use these new bulky 
<br/>laptops. Is it okay for us to carry the bulky stuff with us? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023        Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1983 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, for one year the House Committee is yet to convene 
<br/>to look after the welfare of the Members. When is that going to happen, Mr. Speaker - a big question 
<br/>mark. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Induction Programme happened after nine months.  As I said we hear these 
<br/>rumours about Ministers interfering with the Judiciary - interference here interference there. While 
<br/>we had the Induction Programme for the MPs we need to understand that there are Members on the 
<br/>other  side  who  are  Ministers  for  the  first  time,  they  need  to  be  made  aware  what  their  roles  and 
<br/>responsibilities are as Ministers. Some of them think that they can do anything to everything if they 
<br/>are the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very poor Mr. Speaker. Maybe Parliament can take a lead role for the Induction of Ministers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Assistant Ministers on the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  Mr. Speaker, in  terms  of Business Cards, some of us are yet  to 
<br/>receive our Business Cards.  We are Members of Parliament and when we go around, people ask us 
<br/>for our Business Cards, we offer them our telephone numbers because we do not have a business 
<br/>card given by the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the Standing Order Review Committee, we agreed in one of the Sittings a 
<br/>few months ago that we will be convening, and we will allow the Standing Order Review Committee 
<br/>to sit to actually review the submission handed in by Opposition, that is yet to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  still  waiting  for  the  issue  that  we  have  raised  with  regards  to  the 
<br/>Membership of the Committees.  We are still waiting for a response.  It is almost a year now that we 
<br/>have  requested  for  a  clarification,  and  I  do  not  know  why  the  Secretary-General  to  Parliament’s 
<br/>Office is not giving a legal opinion on what we had requested to your office so that you can give a 
<br/>written report back to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe my time is over, Mr. Speaker, I have a few more issues over here which I intend to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discuss with you personally, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to commend the Committee for their Report 
<br/>and also to support your decision that we should try and table as many of these Reports as possible 
<br/>and also discipline ourselves to contributing within the time allocated to us. That, Mr. Speaker Sir, 
<br/>is based on a very dangerous assumption that we have all read the Report. Mr. Speaker Sir, I would 
<br/>like to go straight to the recommendations of the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In reviewing the Report, they have made these recommendations. One that they noted the 
<br/></span><span>achievements  that  have  been  made  on  Sustainable  Development  Goal  5,  which  is  the  efforts  in 
<br/></span><span>promoting  gender  equality  and  empowerment,  something  that  all  parties  represented  here  in 
<br/>Parliament I believe now, note and will promote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also commend the department for its achievements in SDG 10, in terms of 
<br/>physical accessibility and I commend the work that has already been done.  When you come to my 
<br/>age you need those rails and I commend Parliament for the work that has already been taken and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>1984         Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improvements.  We will put in the same request for the lift on the other side of the New Wing of 
<br/>Parliament House which some time works and many times does not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, Mr. Speaker Sir, concluded by saying that they are happy with what our civil 
<br/>servants and members of our staff have done in the preparation of the Report in the submission and 
<br/>this Report was made for the period before COVID and later report that reporting on the period after 
<br/>COVID 19 provide a different stark reality of the time we go through. We commend the Report and 
<br/>the review by our Committee and I also support this Report before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I share the same sentiments as honourable Maharaj, that I do 
<br/>not get the first yellow card or red card since this is the last Parliament Sitting. I know this Report is 
<br/>an old one Sir, and in light of these findings I would like to support the recommendations put forth 
<br/>by the Standing Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We should continue with our efforts to promote gender equality and empowerment in building 
<br/>on  the  Department’s  achievements  on  SDG  5,  and  we  should  expedite  the  measures  to  improve 
<br/>accessibility to the Parliament Complex including the installation of direction signs and other aids 
<br/>for persons with disability issues.  We should also consider demarcating the Parliament precinct to 
<br/>facilitate  easier  accessibility  thereby  contributing  to  SDG  10.    We  should  also  privatize  the 
<br/>digitalization of Parliament </span><span>Hansard</span><span> for improved accessibility and transparency which I understand 
<br/>is currently happening, but Mr Speaker Sir, we are still receiving papers for our daily Parliament 
<br/>debates and I think we should start digitalizing our everyday documents here as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Prime Minister also highlighted, the separate office that 
<br/>we also require for Parties and representatives of Parliament, should also provide enhanced efficiency 
<br/>of our parliamentary processes.  We should revamp our awareness and public engaging programmes, 
<br/>such as “Meet the Speaker and Parliament Bus” to ensure inclusivity and wider public engagement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I end my contribution, I would like to express my disappointment that I am only given 
<br/>five  minutes  to  contribute  to  this  motion,  and  also  that  our  voices  as  Members  of  Parliament,  as 
<br/>legislators and as representatives of the people are being suppressed, and the number of weeks have 
<br/>been reduced all over this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We understand this is a new Government and they are still learning, but it does not mean that 
<br/>the voices of people are suppressed.  People have been raising issues to us and we were very excited 
<br/>to come last week and raise many issues after </span><span>Diwali</span><span> (a happy belated </span><span>Diwali</span><span> to everybody). I had 
<br/></span><span>raised all these issues but unfortunately, we had to reduce those issues to one week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a few days ago, we were informed that our contributions will now be reduced to 5 minutes 
<br/>only, that is not enough, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We represent hundreds and thousands of people in Fiji 
<br/>and 5 minutes per report is not enough.  I think it is important that we are here to serve the people 
<br/>and not to be served.  As legislators. we need to understand that we are here as 100 percent legislators.  
<br/>I understand, on the other side, they are playing dual roles, as legislators and as executive Members.  
<br/>But,  here,  when  we  are  in  Parliament,  we  are  representing  people  as  legislators,  and  I  think  it  is 
<br/>important  that  we  need  to  ensure  that  every  voice  is  heard  here  and  more  time  is  given  to  each 
<br/></span><span>honourable Member to express themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just adding on to what honourable Maharaj said about this laptop, this is the laptop that was 
<br/>given to us, it is bulky.  I may be able to handle it, but some honourable Members will not be able 
<br/>to.  It is bulky, and you cannot fit it in a laptop bag with its extra wires given.  This costs somewhere 
<br/>around more than $5,000 and it does not work, and it did not work for a couple of months when it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023        Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1985 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was given to us with regular breakdowns, so I am not sure if this technology worth $5,000 is even 
<br/>worth it, and we are using taxpayers’ money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  did  raise  the  issue  with  the  Secretary-General,  asking  her  to  give  us  something  more 
<br/>efficient: iPads which were already given to Members during the 2014 Parliament as well, the former 
<br/>honourable Opposition Members might know. I think the former Opposition Members, they were 
<br/>also given much easier or accessible technologies such as the touchscreen laptops to do their work 
<br/>more efficiently.  At the same time, I think we need to respect that this is the people’s Chamber and 
<br/>we are here to discuss about the people’s issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank you for those straight shooting comments you have made and I only 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hope that you were around when we were also given those laptops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In so far as suppression of your time to speak, I think I have made myself very clear as to the 
<br/>decision made by the Business Committee in how we could accommodate these volumes of reports 
<br/>coming back to this august Parliament.  We just have to cut the coat according to the cloth available 
<br/>and say “Okay, two speakers from each side to speak before the Right of Reply is given.”  I think we 
<br/>should be fair in  doing  that.   I now offer the  floor to  the Deputy  Prime  Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by thanking you, Sir, because 
<br/>it is a breath of fresh air in this Parliament, and what we have seen over the last 10 months since we 
<br/>have been sitting in this Parliament.  I was actually listening to honourable Maharaj.  He was a bit 
<br/>more diplomatic, but then when I heard honourable Ketan Lal, it was an insult, not only to your high 
<br/>office, but an insult, a direct insult to his leader who is the Leader of the Opposition who was in the 
<br/>Business Committee where we agreed, Mr. Speaker, on how we are going to debate and discuss this 
<br/>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I address everyone. Everyone has the right to speak. This is the People’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  But  let  me,  Mr.  Speaker,  also  commend  you  for  the 
<br/>independence, the confidence, the trust that you have placed in this Parliament and the way we have 
<br/>conducted ourselves as government, the resources that we have provided to the Opposition, they have 
<br/></span><span>forgotten, of course, he was not there but Honourable Maharaj, diplomatic as he was, forgot that in 
<br/></span><span>this very Chamber, when they were sitting this side, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Why are you complaining? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.  PRASAD.- Now, they are complaining like little kids but when they were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on this side.  They bullied, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hogwash. Talk to Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …  they  punched  an  honourable  Member.    Their  Prime 
<br/>Minister punched an Opposition Member outside this Chamber, within the precincts of this Chamber 
<br/>and yet,  Mr. Speaker,  all these people yelling  from  the other side were  sitting there and voted to 
<br/>suspend him for six months, that is what they did. As opposed to that the people of this country, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  know  the  many  things  that  have  changed  in  the  last  ten  years  in  this  country.  There  is 
<br/>freedom, there is confidence.

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They, on the other side, even today, Mr. Speaker, will not admit it but under your leadership, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the leadership … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- … not under your leadership. Nobody wants to listen to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.  PRASAD.- … of the honourable Prime Minister and us in government in 
<br/>Parliament  they  actually  feel  free.  They  have  entangled  themselves  out  of  the  shackles  and  the 
<br/>dictatorship of two-men rule …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.  PRASAD.- … in this Parliament Mr. Speaker. They could not open their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mouth properly, Mr. Speaker, and that is the difference in this Parliament today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K.  LAL.- No one wants to listen to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.  PRASAD.- What we are saying, Sir you have all the recommendations 
<br/>that are there, you have shown leadership, you have addressed a number of issues.  The government 
<br/>on its part, has provided adequate resources to the Parliament to provide all those resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Parliament  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  section  37(a)  of  the  Financial  Management  Act, 
<br/>ideally, we would like the Parliament to still go further and have the independence of procurement, 
<br/>have the independence of managing their own budget.  Right now, although there is a one-line budget, 
<br/>the Parliament is free, independent and determine how it is going to use that budget. That is what we 
<br/>have provided unlike what they were doing Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Parliament and you know Sir, too.  
<br/>You  were  also  a  victim  of  their  dictatorship  and  I  think,  Mr.  Speaker  they  should  thank  this 
<br/>government, the Honourable Prime Minister, they should thank you, Sir, and not come here and insult 
<br/>you, Sir, because … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- He understands, do not worry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … what you have shown in the last nine months is absolute 
<br/>independence and freedom of the Parliament. You have shown bipartisanship, Honourable Koya is 
<br/>not here with Honourable Gavoka, that is a bipartisan participation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition is going to be part of the delegation to 2023 United 
<br/>Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  Conference  COP28.  You  could  never  ever 
<br/>imagine in the last eight years…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Never, ever! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …that Bainimarama and Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum would ever 
<br/>agree  to  take  an  Opposition  Member  anywhere.  That  is  the  independence  of  Parliament,  that  is 
<br/></span><span>bipartisanship, that is the freedom, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have provided in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  He is referring to people who are not 
<br/>here. Why are you referring to people who are not here and do not have the opportunity to defend 
<br/>themselves?  Stop making up stories. Talk about the people who are here. You focus on the issue, 
<br/>tell the truth and stop lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Sir,  honourable  Usamate  does  not  even  recognise  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bainimarama was the Prime Minister. That is why he is saying that I cannot even talk about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You rubbishing him he is not here!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am not rubbishing him. I am just reminding you what you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are doing. I am just telling you that you were part of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Government side, we assure Parliament, your good self, and all 
<br/>honourable Members on the other side that we will provide adequate resources to Parliament  - to 
<br/>honourable Members whether they are in Opposition or Government, all the adequate resources for 
<br/>them to conduct their role as Members of Parliament, including the grants for Political Parties and 
<br/>the allowances for them to conduct their business and their activities as Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Human Rights to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Firstly, I thank those honourable Members who 
<br/>have spoken in  regards to the Report that is  before Parliament. Secondly,  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Members of the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, there are no further comments from my side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, for housekeeping purposes and for the purposes of 
<br/></span><span>complying  with  Standing  Orders  with  respect  to  sitting  time,  I  now  call  upon  the  Leader  of  the
