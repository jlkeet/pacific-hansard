<h3>HON. R.R. SHARMA - $5.00.</h3>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA - $5.00.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He comes here and completely lies, lies overboard, says there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are no jobs. These are FNPF figures, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- No confidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Now  he  is  talking  about  confidence,  when  every  business 
<br/>sector, when we have meetings, you see the number of people who come, who say that they are now 
<br/>free, even the FijiFirst supporters say they are free now.  They are free, they want to invest, they want 
<br/>to work with the Government. It is actually quite shameful that somebody who can contribute more 
<br/>positively, come up with some facts, do some research, comes in this august Parliament and lies just 
<br/>like he is talking to people on the street.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a Parliament, Mr. Speaker, when you come here and say there is no job growth, for 
<br/>God’s  sake,  use  some  figures  because  this  is  the  kind  of  lies  and  misinformation  that  they  are 
<br/>spreading out there in the community. They are going there and lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You are lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Shameful!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the honourable Member, I urge him, he has got a bright future in politics.  He can have 
<br/>a bright future, he has got potential, I can see that, but he is just being carried away into the politics 
<br/>of the past of what they are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Stick to the report … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I want to say to the people of this country, yes, we understand.  
<br/>This morning, I pointed out a list of items.  The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica 
<br/>talked about the prices.  Yes, some prices have gone up and I explained the inflation rate and how it 
<br/>is  calculated,  what  is  happening.    I  also  explained  what  is  happening,  what  is  the  transmission 
<br/>mechanism of what is happening to imports.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Time’s up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The people are suffering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Please,  come  into  this  Parliament  with  some  dignity  and 
<br/>respect on facts and what you say because we are telling the people of this country and the people of 
<br/>this country are watching and saying - what, there is no jobs when employers are desperate to get 
<br/>people to come and work for them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I</span><span> </span><span>now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their contribution towards the debate.  I am sure that a lot of these issues that they have raised will 
<br/>be  an  added  value  to  how  the  Government  is  going  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  Fiji 
<br/>Competition and Consumer Commission.  I have no further comments to make.
