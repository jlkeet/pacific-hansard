<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to the question by honourable N.T. Tuinaceva is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways in addressing Gender gaps in the Agriculture Sector 
<br/>and aligning with Fiji's 20-Year National Development Plan, formulated a 5-year Policy for Gender 
<br/>in  Agriculture  in  Fiji  (2022-2027).  This  ensures  commitment  towards  the  achievement  of 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Policy has four major objectives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Equality of access by women and men to the economic resources required for productive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and resilient agriculture and markets; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Equality of access by women and men to the information, technology and training needed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for secure livelihoods and healthy diets; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Equality  of  representation  and  participation  in  decision-making  by  women  and  men,  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>informed future agriculture planning and resourcing; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Effective  mainstreaming  of  gender  perspectives  in  all  programs  through  strengthened 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>capacities resources and commitment in the agriculture ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  policy  is  designed  to  integrate  well  with  the  Government's  existing  initiatives  including 
<br/>Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting led by the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National  Development  and  Statistics  and  the  Gender  Transformative  Institutional  Capacity 
<br/>Development  Initiative  led  by  the  National  Machinery  of  Women  -  Ministry  of  Women.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is one of the pilot Ministries under the Gender Responsive 
<br/>Planning and Budgeting initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  operationalising  the  Gender  in  Agriculture  Policy,  the  Ministry  has  implemented  various 
<br/>programs that support women's participation in the agriculture sector and these include but are not 
<br/>limited  to,  Vanilla,  Coconut,  Poultry  Extension,  Apiculture,  Cocoa,  Post-Harvest  Losses  and 
<br/>Women in Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Women in Agriculture Programme, previously known as the Cottage Industry Development 
<br/></span><span>Program [CIDP], started in 2006 as one of the Demand Driven Approach [ODA] initiatives. It 
<br/></span><span>was implemented in 2007 before it was taken up by the then Ministry of Social Welfare, Women 
<br/>and  Poverty  Alleviation  until  2012  when  the  program  came  back  under  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture.  In  the  2016-2017  financial  year,  the  current  name  was  adopted  with  its  primary 
<br/>objective which is to increase women's participation in the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The Ministry through this program since 2016-2017 financial year has supported 1,060 women 
<br/>under the various age groups listed below:

<div><span>24 percent young women (20-35yrs) 
<br/>55 percent adult women (36 -55yrs) and 
<br/>21 percent were (56 -  77yrs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the assistance provided to those women, a notable increase in production was recorded 
<br/>since 2016 on the following targeted commodities:

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Floriculture production had increased from 78 tonnes in 2016 to 6,406 tonnes in 2022. This 
<br/>growth reflects the positive impact of the Ministry's support towards the floriculture sector 
<br/>which enhanced women's participation.
