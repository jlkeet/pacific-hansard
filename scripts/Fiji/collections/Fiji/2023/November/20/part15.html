<div><span>Survey/Study on Skills Shortage 
<br/>(Question No. 146/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>inform Parliament whether the Ministry has undertaken any survey or study to ascertain which 
<br/>industry  sectors  are  affected  the  most  and  consequently,  whether  any  policy  initiative  has 
<br/>been put in place to address the skills shortages by the private sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the question asked by the honourable 
<br/>Alvick  Maharaj  and  I  thank  him  for  the  question.  Addressing  skills  shortages  requires  multi-
<br/>stakeholder approach involving collaboration among government, educational institutions, workers 
<br/>and employers’ organisations and the whole private sector to ensure that we get the most practical 
<br/>solution to the problems that exist within the industries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  issue  of  skills  gaps  and  labour  mobility  is  a  global  issue,  and  a  small 
<br/>economy like Fiji is hit the hardest due to our skilled workers being poached by bigger nations. This 
<br/>is an issue that I have profoundly discussed with the relevant stakeholders to ensure we come up with 
<br/>better policies and programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has been working with stakeholders, like the Tertiary Scholarships 
<br/>and  Loans  Service  (TSLS)  through  Professor  Hitendra  Pillay  of  Queensland  University  of 
<br/>Technology and in the area of priority needs on training and development of the workforce.  Professor 
<br/>Pillay and his team has prepared a comprehensive report on the priority areas where scholarships will 
<br/>be given in the next three to five years based on the labour market and industry demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Why do you get overseas academics, do you not have academics here in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  copy  of  this  report  is  also  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Finance and National Planning.  We have already been in discussion with the Fiji Higher Education 
<br/></span><span>Commission, Ministry of Education, International Organisation for Migration, TSLS including our 
<br/></span><span>overseas development partners in working together to conduct an employment survey and skills gap 
<br/>and also  explore new opportunities to  strengthen our local  institutions like National  Training and 
<br/>Productivity Centre (NTPC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was invited to launch the TSLS Employer Connect Framework earlier this 
<br/>year.  This Framework is to connect employers with students who are sponsored by TSLS and the 
<br/>recent graduates seeking employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  TSLS  assured  to  launch  an  online  portal  to  help  employers  connect  with  students, 
<br/></span><span>graduates seeking employment.  The online portal is ready to be launched on 15</span><span>th</span><span> December and go 
<br/>live.  The Employer Connect Portal developed by the Tertiary Loans and Scholarship Service is a 
<br/>comprehensive job board.  The key features of the Employer Connect Portal are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The job board for graduate and employers, graduates can register, create online resumes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>while employers can post job vacancies.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  framework  not  only  assists  graduates  in  securing  employment 
<br/>opportunities but also expedites talent search for employers.  Overall, the Employer Connect Portal 
<br/>by  TSLS  represents  significant  steps  in  connecting  sponsored  students  with  potential  employers, 
<br/>supporting them throughout their educational and early professional journey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Ministerial Statement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I thank the TSLS leadership and the staff as well as the Fourth Year 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Software Engineering Students from USP who developed this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministerial Statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Just wait, listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has allowed over 13,000 sponsored students to work 
<br/>20 hours a  week  by  seeking  approval.   This  is  helping employers to  some extent mitigate labour 
<br/>shortages.  I thank the TSLS, again, for this initiative in helping the Government and the employers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  soon  be  meeting  with  potential  employers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  discuss  the 
<br/>Apprenticeship  Scheme,  it is all  about the  job  market.   In consultation  with the TSLS Board, the 
<br/>Apprenticeship  Scheme  is  a  way  of  mitigating  labour  shortage  and  Government  has  a  plan  to 
<br/>incentivise it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Listen!  How are we going to incentivise this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  hourly  pay  of  the  apprentices  is  $2.97.    We  are  now  offering  the 
<br/>employers an incentive to top it up with $2, make it $4.97 or pay 50 percent of the school fee through 
<br/>TSLS.  That is the incentive we are working on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I speak, the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation together with our 
<br/>Ministry with the assistance from the ILO is conducting its own survey of the job market including 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debt of the SMEs and that is going to assist us further in determining the areas of need where we can 
<br/>then offer the short-term and medium term training programmes through all the institutions that are 
<br/>offering this programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also put on record in this reply the draconian laws that were imposed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the FijiFirst Government were the biggest hindrance... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- …towards a collaborative approach in determining the shortage.  Let 
<br/>me quantify Mr. Speaker, Sir.  A good survey needs data and people who are in charge of doing good 
<br/>data for us are the Bureau of Statistics.  The Chief Statistician was terminated by them for coming 
<br/>up with true data.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Flabbergasted.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Employment Relations and Labour 
<br/>has  to  work  in  compliance  with  ILO  Conventions,  an  instrument  that  we  are  signatory  to.    They 
<br/>blatantly breached all the Conventions that they were signatories to including the fundamental one 
<br/>and they talk about labour market survey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now complying with all those and we are doing 
<br/>everything through consultation.  Now the tri-partisan is at its best, no longer distorted and we are 
<br/>consulting, discussing and dialoguing at every step on everything that we do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has gone around the world ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>... and explained 50 percent of the question.  One of the questions that has been asked and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>may I read “which industry sectors are affected the most?” He has not even elaborated on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you made a very thorough reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the industries are affected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- All the professions are affected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- There is a shortage in every area, Sir.  We have chased our people away 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just because of the way we treated them.  Now, we are trying to retain and replace them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker Sir, through you, can the honourable Minister inform 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament:

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1955 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>how much you have paid to that overseas consultant; and 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>when the survey will be completed and the report presented?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It is a new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the survey has been completed and the report, I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just stated, is already with the Ministry of National Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- No, towards the end of your statement, you said that the survey has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been carried out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- At the expense of repeating Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the report 
<br/>has been completed and handed over, the copy is already with the Office of the Ministry of National 
<br/>Planning and it is being implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K BALA.- Cost? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The cost is a new question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K BALA.- Clarification, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K BALA.- A point of clarification, Sir. At the end of his Statement he mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that right now the Ministry of Employment, the private sector …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You’re not the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K BALA.- Can you answer? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K BALA.- I am not asking you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, towards the end he said, and that is what I have asked, as to when will the 
<br/>survey be finished and the survey report will be presented - simple, that is what I am asking.  What 
<br/>is so difficult, is it a new question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- What do you want? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K BALA.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, I could not get what he wants, if he wants a copy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Report I will bring it over for him after lunch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is not the point, Mr. Speaker Sir.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, it is very simple. During the end of his Statement, he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said that … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your point of order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … right now, his Ministry staff, the private sector and other stakeholders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are carrying out a survey. What I have .… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Can you shut up, man. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-… what I am asking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when will that survey be finished?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am not asking for the report that is lying in his office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will clarify that one Sir, with your permission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I am sorry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  The  language  used  is  not  only  unparliamentary  but  it  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extremely unparliamentary.  He used the word “shut up” to another honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  word  “shut  up”  should  not  be  used  in  any  Parliament  and  now  I  am  asking  him  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdraw “shut up”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I withdraw that, Mr. Speaker. I am kind enough to do that, but the fact 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remains the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move on, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High Seas Treaty (BBNJ) - UNCLOS 
<br/>(Question No. 147/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1957 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Change,  Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran 
<br/>Affairs update Parliament on the signing of the High Seas Treaty (BBNJ) under the UN 
<br/>Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister,  an  issue  has  been  raised  with  my  Office  regarding  this  question  and  the  amount  of 
<br/>information that is going to be tabled if it is going to be thorough in the way he addresses the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  it brings to  mind the definition of classified information  if there is  such a thing as 
<br/>classified information  under the Official Secrets  Act  or any other Act  for that matter because the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister is a bit worried as to the depth of the question and where it is heading 
<br/>because it might force him to divulge certain issues which are regarded as classified.  But I leave that 
<br/>to the honourable Prime Minister for him to make that statement once more and we will leave it at 
<br/>that, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise to respond to Question No. 147 of 2023.  But 
<br/>as you had pointed out, Sir, I have a lot of information which is useful for us in Parliament now and 
<br/>for those who will come after us.  A lot of the substance contained in the response is of great national 
<br/>interest to national leaders all over the world, whether I present a summary and present and table the 
<br/>full response to the House, I will be led by your direction, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, Fiji has always played a very important role internationally and regionally 
<br/>advocating  for  our  oceans  and  we  have  carried  on  this  from  the  previous  government  and  the 
<br/>governments before that. All the way back to 1992 when the world met in Rio for the first Earth 
<br/>Summit that developed into a series of Conferences of Parties (COP) from the following year up to 
<br/>this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 8</span><span>th</span><span> September, Sir, Cabinet approved the signing of the BBNJ Treaty when it was opened 
<br/>for signing around the United Nations General Assembly in September.  The Treaty was then tabled 
<br/>in  Parliament  and  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence.    The 
<br/>Committee is still working on that and has not come back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, when the Treaty was presented for signing, Fiji was one of the first to sign and 
<br/>have led to be ratified by this august Parliament. It was negotiated and adopted by the UN General 
<br/>Assembly as an Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 
<br/>on  the  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  marine  biological  diversity  of  areas  beyond  national 
<br/></span><span>jurisdiction.  That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it is of interest to us, and it will be of interest 
<br/></span><span>to those who will grace this Chamber in the years to come.  For me, it was an honour to sign the 
<br/>Treaty at the signing ceremony on the margins of the United Nations Development Account (UNDA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was one of the first countries to sign the BBNJ Treaty, just as we were the first to sign 
<br/>the UNCLOS in Jamaica in 1982. To fast-track notifications of the Treaty to ensure entry into force 
<br/>as soon as possible, 60 countries must ratify the Treaty for it to come into force. As with the UN 
<br/>Convention on the Law of the Sea our nation’s diplomat participated extensively in the negotiations 
<br/>for the Treaty which aims to better coordinate stakeholders in the protection of the areas beyond their 
<br/></span><span>national maritime boundaries called the High Seas Treaty (BBNJ). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, through our former Ambassador to the United Nations, His Excellency Satya Nandan, 
<br/>led the complex negotiations throughout the 1970s that led to the adoption of the Law of the Sea on 
<br/>behalf of Pacific Island Countries at the time that the Pacific was not well represented in the United 
<br/>Nations and many Pacific Islands then were still colonies. Many countries strongly opposed the 200-
<br/>mile economic zone throughout those long-drawn-out negotiations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>1958 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The adoption of the UNCLOS was a mammoth step for Fiji and all Small Island States of the 
<br/>Pacific, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   The Law of the Sea effectively gave Pacific Island Countries the control 
<br/>of our respective 200-mile EEZ, which meant that Island Countries gained control of the fish and the 
<br/>seabed resources across our 200-mile zone as a result of the adoption of that historic Convention.  
<br/>Ambassador Satya Nandan went on to become the first Secretary-General of the International Seabed 
<br/>Authority and retired after serving two consecutive terms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Biodiversity  Beyond  National  Jurisdiction  (BBNJ)  Treaty  gives  all  the  UN  member 
<br/>States the opportunity to effectively conserve and sustainably manage the use of maritime resources 
<br/>in the high seas and we talk a lot about the protection and management of our marine resources, and 
<br/>this is where we are drawing that authority from.  In turn, it will also help to protect marine resources 
<br/>within our national jurisdiction, contributing to a healthy marine environment and a stronger blue 
<br/>economy for the livelihoods of the people of Fiji.  The High Seas Treaty is key to protecting the 
<br/>ocean,  promote  equity  and  fairness,  tackle  environmental  degradation,  fight  climate  change  and 
<br/>prevent biodiversity loss in the high seas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The adoption of this BBNJ Treaty is a historic achievement marking the successful end of 
<br/>more than  a decade of  multilateral  negotiations.  Pacific Small  Island Developing States (PSIDs) 
<br/>representatives, including Fiji, participated in the BBNJ Treaty negotiations with members sharing 
<br/>similar priorities and positions.  The objective of the BBNJ Treaty is aligned with Fiji’s National 
<br/>Ocean Policy and other laws and policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The general objective of BBNJ Treaty is to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of 
<br/>marine biological diversity of areas beyond our national jurisdiction or any national jurisdiction for 
<br/>the  present  and  in  the  long  term  through  effective  implementation  of  the  relevant  provisions  of 
<br/>UNCLOS.  The Treaty also provides a link between the climate change and the law of the city, a link 
<br/>that was not included in our UNCLOS as the impact of climate change on the marine environment 
<br/>was not widely studied at the time of its negotiation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final  text, Mr. Speaker, Sir, captured Fiji  and PSID’s priorities, including  our special 
<br/>circumstances  as  PSIDs,  the  role  of  traditional  knowledge  and  indigenous  people  and  local 
<br/>communities, fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from access to and utilisation of marine 
<br/>genetic resources from areas beyond national jurisdiction, as well as the need for capacity building 
<br/>and transfer of technology.  The Leaders Communique issued at the PIF Leaders’ Summit in Nadi 
<br/>earlier this year, highlighted the need for the finalisation of the High Seas Treaty, given it will be 
<br/>instrumental in managing and protecting the region’s marine biodiversity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following our signing of the Treaty and eventual ratification, after Parliamentary approval, 
<br/>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will conduct the necessary consultations with relevant line Ministries 
<br/>to ensure relevant laws and policies are amended to facilitate the implementation of the Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Prime Minister update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament as to the benefits of signing this BBNJ Treaty to Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought that has been well articulated by the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>just a while ago.  He dwelt at length on the BBNJ Treaty, especially with the ocean boundaries and 
<br/></span><span>the jurisdiction.  Can we leave it at that, or do you still want to raise your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits that the Treaty will bring to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji?

<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I withdraw my question, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Rinesh Sharma, a supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank    the  honourable  Prime  Minister.  I 
<br/>understand  that  collective  action  is  required  in  moving  this  country  forward,  especially  for  the 
<br/>younger generations who are the future and the benefits that you have actually highlighted for this 
<br/>Treaty but Honourable Prime Minister, there is confusion in what terms is Fiji, a few months back, 
<br/>supported the Japan nuclear waste dump as well as … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- … the coal industry in Australia. Now with this Treaty, you have 
<br/>spoken about climate change, this Treaty has a marine genetic resource mechanism component. So, 
<br/>can you please inform the august House by when will this materialise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  I  will  not  allow  that  question  given  that  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister has made statements already, he has even given apologies at the recent Forum Secretariat 
<br/>meeting in the Cook Islands. So, I suggest we leave it at that and let us continue.

<div><span>Clarification on the Inflation Level 
<br/>(Question No. 148/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics clarify the inflation level, as the official CPI 
<br/>has been stated to be 4.2 percent in 2022 and below 2percent in 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/>This is an important question because I think there is a lot of misinformation, a lot of confusion with 
<br/>respect to how inflation is measured so I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the official average inflation released by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics in 2022 
<br/></span><span>stood at 4.3 percent while the year and inflation for 2022 stood at 3.1 percent in December 2022.  So 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the average inflation from January to October is around 1.7 percent while the recent 
<br/>year on year inflation for October 2023 stood at 4 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these  are the official numbers  that have been released  by the Bureau of 
<br/>Statistics which is the national office responsible for collecting and reporting statistics in Fiji but let 
<br/>me, Mr. Speaker, honourable Usamate will understand this because this would sound like Economics 
<br/>101, but it is important for the people to understand these and the definition of inflation and how it 
<br/></span><span>is always being measured in Fiji.   So, inflation, Sir, is the general increase in price of goods and 
<br/></span><span>services over a period of time and usually over a year. For example, the current 4.0 inflation rate in 
<br/>October 2023 means that consumer prices are four percent (4 percent) higher when compared to the 
<br/>year October 2022.  That is what it means.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  lot  of  people,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  unfortunately,  get  this  wrong  because  the  percentage 
<br/>increase in price is compared to the same period a year before, not compared to two years ago or five 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>1960 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years ago compared to the 1970s because that would be completely wrong, and some people try and 
<br/>do that.  They said, “Alright, the price was this three years ago or five years ago or ten years ago”.  
<br/>Furthermore, when we say, “average inflation for the year”, it means the average ‘year on year’, on 
<br/>inflation for 12 months. So, for policy purposes, we generally use the ‘year on year’ inflation and not 
<br/>the average.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other important point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, is that, inflation is measured by 
<br/>what we called the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is based on a representative basket of goods 
<br/>and services that is purchased by the consumer with different weights. Different items have different 
<br/>weights assigned to individual products and services based on its importance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, with the Bureau of Statistics, for example, the CPI base that we are using now is 
<br/>the 2014 base and there are 349 items in that basket.  They are categorised and I want to mention 
<br/>those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Food and non-alcoholic beverages -  35 percent; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Alcohol, tobacco and narcotics - 10 percent; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Housing and utilities -13 percent; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Household furnishing, clothing, footwear - 7 percent; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Health and education - 9 percent; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Transport - 14 percent; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Communication and others - 8 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For example, if the food price has gone up by 8.6 percent, if you look at year on year price 
<br/>rise, the weight is 35 percent. So, even a slight increase in the food items will show a much bigger 
<br/>inflation rate, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For example, hotels, the prices have gone up by 11.6 percent but the weight in the CPI basket 
<br/>for hotels and restaurants is only 2.98 percent.  So, while the price rise is much bigger there, the 
<br/>inflation rate, if it is looked at in the basket, will be much lower.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the point that I also want to make is that a lot of people you know focussing on 
<br/>the budget.  Yes, there are measures in the Budget. We had three rates of VAT - zero, nine and 15.  
<br/>We have kept the zero-rated VAT on all the 21 food items. So, there is no tax and no VAT increase 
<br/>on the 21 food items. Absolutely none!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, for some of them, we have reduced their duties.  Mr. Speaker, I just got the list of 
<br/></span><span>food  items,  in  particular,  from  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC).    The 
<br/>prices have gone down on 92 food items and there are a number of factors why the prices have gone 
<br/>down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One is that before COVID or during COVID, prices had gone up by quite a bit because freight 
<br/>costs had gone down. So, freight costs are also coming down and those 21 food items that have zero 
<br/>VAT and the freight cost has come down, their prices have also gone down. It is not as if all the 
<br/>products or all the different brands, but if you look at milk, for example, all the prices for the different 
<br/>brands of milk have actually gone down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The quality as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, one or two in the quality but generally, Mr. Speaker, if 
<br/>they care to look at this public list, they will actually find that in some cases, the same quantity, the 
<br/>prices have gone down.  I mean, I just wanted to make this point, and they do not talk about it, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1961 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that some of the prices have actually gone down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to hear from the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister that prices of 92 items have gone down because he has mentioned the list of 200, so 
<br/>we look forward to reading about that 200. The price of milk has gone down, and he forgot to mention 
<br/>that it used to be 500 grammes of milk, now it is 450 grammes, the price has gone down, the quantity 
<br/>has also gone down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ANZ just produced a report suggesting that the projected inflation for 
<br/>this year might be 6 percent, but they say that that is understated, that it will be around 13 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Food manufacturers are saying that the production costs have gone up between 20 percent to 
<br/>30 percent.  So, given this, if the projection is 6 percent and it is actually 13 percent, what will the 
<br/>Ministry be doing? Will there be other mitigation processes that you will need to consider in order to 
<br/>help the people of this country, considering the fact that you cut the taxation rate on the richest people 
<br/>in this country but not the poorer, and you have raised VAT in a lot of different areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD – That is, again, a bit of a hogwash.  Let me explain this, since 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he raised the ANZ prediction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent report, Mr. Speaker, by Dr. Kishti Sen and I have known him for years and his 
<br/>inflation numbers. I understand that was probably the key motivation for the question. In fact, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, what Dr. Kishti Sen is saying, is that inflation in 2022 stood at 18 percent to 21 percent.  
<br/>They do not  talk  about  that.    Inflation in  2023 is  around 13 percent.  Let  me state this very, very 
<br/>categorically, for ANZ and for everyone, that Dr. Kishti Sen is absolutely, completely wrong about 
<br/>that projection.  I will explain why.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is quite a ridiculous suggestion from an ANZ economist and 
<br/>because it is going to create wrong impressions amongst the people and honourable Usamate is using 
<br/>that. I will explain to you why it is wrong and ANZ really, should be careful in making those kind of 
<br/>wild projections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am answering the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the methodology that they used and I think he 
<br/>got it wrong, was based on the gross value added of the retail trade sector. And, Mr. Speaker, we all 
<br/>know and honourable Usamate would know that as an economist - a one-time economist, that the 
<br/></span><span>gross value added and expenditure as a proxy for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is completely 
<br/></span><span>incorrect! Completely incorrect! And is not used anywhere in the world to measure inflation. So, the 
<br/>projection that it will be 13 percent is based on the wrong method.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The simple reason is that the Gross Value Added Expenditure (GVA) and the Consumer Price 
<br/>Index (CPI) measure, Mr. Speaker, measure different things, and many items which are produced 
<br/>and sold in Fiji, included in the retail gross value added, are not part of the CPI basket.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very simple example, Mr. Speaker, if you look at hardware prices, the building materials, 
<br/>prices have a separate index which is known as the building material index. That rose by 13 percent 
<br/>in  2022,  so  clearly,  using  that  as  a  proxy  for  retail  trade  gross  value  added  approach  will  be 
<br/>completely  biased.  They  need  to  listen  to  this  because  they  can  explain  to  the  people  correctly 
<br/>because, otherwise, they will go and lie, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  also  explain,  the  honourable  Usamate  talked  about  the  mitigation  measures.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, obviously, they do not talk about this because when they go out, they talk to the people, 
<br/>they just say, “Oh, prices have gone up!”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Even when there is a list publicly put out by FCCC that the 
<br/>prices have gone down for certain items, the list is there, they actually put out the detail of the brand, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker,  that has gone down, they do not talk about it.  But let me just answer this question that 
<br/>he raised about mitigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Government started by recognising well before the Budget that the people 
<br/>were still transitioning for low income, loss of jobs, so as soon as we came in, as a Government, we 
<br/>allocated $50 million.  We paid $200 each to 227,000 students in the country to get back to their 
<br/>school.  Then when we came to the Budget, we made sure that we did not raise VAT on the 22 food 
<br/>items.  In fact, we added basic medicine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we made sure that we increase the social welfare allowances by 15 percent and 
<br/>25  percent.    We  made  sure  that  we  provided  additional  support  and  subsidies  to  farmers  in  the 
<br/>Agriculture Sector.  We made sure that the sugarcane farmers in the history of sugarcane farmers in 
<br/>this country got the highest price and we put $8 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate talked about the fact 
<br/>that we reduced the tax for the rich.  He forgot to mention that we actually raised the Company Tax 
<br/></span><span>from 20 percent to 25 percent.  We made, Mr. Speaker, sure that we did not touch the threshold.  We 
<br/></span><span>did not increase the tax for almost 70 percent to 80 percent of the people in this country who earn 
<br/>below $30,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are taking one little example of Fiji Water and saying, “Oh, the tax and 
<br/>one irrelevant politician or as the honourable Prime Minister said, spent force, is still talking about 
<br/>it.  They also forget that we wrote off $650 million for 53,000 families and their children.  The burden 
<br/>of paying that debt every month, every week, every fortnight has been lifted from them.  So, all the 
<br/>mitigation measures that we have put in to address any increase and a lot of these prices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talk about the fuel price.  During COVID-19, when the fuel prices went down, instead 
<br/>of letting the people benefit from the reduction, their Government put an additional 20 percent and it 
<br/>was 40 percent.  When we were raising it before the election, they then reduced it to 20 percent.  
<br/>Now, they are talking about another 20 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the lie and hogwash that they created when they go out there, Mr. Speaker.  This is a

<div><span>Poverty Alleviation Programme – Monitoring Mechanism 
<br/>(Question No. 149/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  monitoring  mechanism  in  place  on  the  implementation  of  the  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation  Programme  to  ensure  that  Government  investment  covers  the  targeted 
<br/>beneficiaries? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that question 
<br/>but before I answer, I would like to join the honourable Whip, as the Minister for Children, to wish 
<br/>all our children in Fiji a Happy World Children’s Day today with the theme, “For Every Child Every 
<br/>Right”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  the  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  new  Members  who  are  here  maybe 
<br/>hearing this for the first time - the existence of the Poverty Monitoring Unit (PMU) in the Ministry.  
<br/>However,  as  you  all  aware,  we  have  changed  the  name  of  the  Unit  to  Social  Protection  because 
<br/>according to the Coalition Government, poverty alleviation is a pervasive issue that all Ministries 
<br/>across Government should have their own programmes to alleviate poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I wish to explain the monitoring mechanism in place, Mr. Speaker, that it works 
<br/>with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  through  the  various  line  Ministries  that  implement  the  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation Programmes. They gather the baseline information which includes beneficiary listing, 
<br/>the  budget  of  those  programmes  and  the  performance  of  those  programmes  from  a  programme 
<br/>implementor’s point of view who are in the Ministries.  This baseline information is really important 
<br/>as it sets the platform of the PMU’s Impact Assessment Survey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, the Unit has been monitoring, identified poverty alleviation 
<br/>programmes  to  gauge  the  impact  of  Government  initiatives  across  the  four  Divisions.    These 
<br/>assessment  surveys  are  carried  out  through  interviewing  beneficiaries,  project  visitation  and 
<br/></span><span>obtaining the views of the programme implementors.  The PMU has monitored over 60 programmes 
<br/></span><span>from the financial year of 2016 to 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key measures are the standard of living before the assistance and after 
<br/>the assistance, the access to  services, the support  systems  and income level.   The findings  of the 
<br/>survey which includes project observation and challenges shared by the interviewed beneficiaries are 
<br/>highlighted  to  the  programme  implementors  in  each  Ministry  to  further  assist  them  to  improve 
<br/>delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  begin  with,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  results  of  the  survey  and  the  report  highlighted  that 
<br/></span><span>Government investments over the years have had positive impacts on the interviewed beneficiaries 
<br/>and individual, group and community-based levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to think that the entire Parliament is united in battling poverty 
<br/>at all levels and so there is an improvement gauged in the last five years through responses before 
<br/>and after assistance was provided in their standard of living, increase in the level of income,

<div><span>employment creation, expanding business and project and access to services, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that across the Ministries there were, in the 
<br/>last five years, non-active projects or partially active projects.  And this, Mr. Speaker, is what PMU 
<br/>-  the  information  they  have  to  assist  Ministries  to  activate  non-active  projects  or  partially  active 
<br/>projects that would have been budgeted for the year.  So, year in year out, they can be low utilisation 
<br/>for projects which Ministries need to improve on.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Lack of comprehensive feasibility studies prior to the implementation of the project - the 
<br/>general lack of a feasibility study whether this particular money or budget should be thrown 
<br/>into a project.   
<br/>Lack of technical-related training,  
<br/>Lack of monitoring the status of the project,  
<br/>Lack of ownership from the beneficiaries,  
<br/>Lack of support from amongst the group members themselves,  
<br/>Climate change risks,  
<br/>Non-availability of market,  
<br/>High cost of raw materials for projects such as speed and lack of collaboration amongst 
<br/>Government Ministries, who can collectively work to sustain a project.  It is also noted that 
<br/>there are issues that are process related, such as standard operating procedures or proper 
<br/>policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PMU has proposed a way forward that will assist Ministries.  It will 
<br/>assist programme implementors to ensure project sustainability in the future such as, the need for 
<br/>comprehensive feasibility studies by Ministries before committing to a project, the need for project 
<br/>recipients  themselves  to  take  ownership  and  encourage  working  together,  connecting  farmers  to 
<br/>potential markets and the possibility of cost subsidy to avoid middlemen who always reap the fruit 
<br/>of  farmers’  hard  labour  and  strengthen  network  in  collaboration  with  important  stakeholders  to 
<br/>support in the effective management of these projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Coalition  Government  is  committed,  and  this  was  very  important 
<br/>information  we  got  from  the  PMU  in  order  for  each  Ministry,  now  that  we  have  put  poverty 
<br/>alleviation across the Ministries to be able to address the challenges that were highlighted by PMU 
<br/>in the last five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, at this point, we all agree that there is space to improve and we are committed 
<br/>to  that.  The  PMU  is  working  closely with  the Ministry of Finance in  terms of the review of the 
<br/>Poverty Alleviation Eradication Strategy Framework 1999.  So it is almost 14 years old and this has 
<br/>not  been  reviewed  in  the  last  14  years.  This  will  include  the  development  of  the  Monitoring  and 
<br/>Evaluation Framework or Integrated National Poverty Eradication that goes across the Ministries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  the  Unit  is  working  in  our  Ministry  on  the  establishment  of  the  first  ever  National 
<br/>Committee on Poverty Alleviation.  So, Government is committed through a National Committee 
<br/>from Cabinet to spearhead Government’s effort in monitoring and evaluating existing programmes 
<br/>as well as playing a critical role in providing national direction to the Government or of Government 
<br/>as well as sectoral budget and planning with efficient and effective economic advice in addressing 
<br/>the socio-economic multi-dimensional issue of poverty embedded across all levels of society.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1965 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  A  supplementary  question;  can  the  honourable  Minister  also 
<br/>outline  what  the  Coalition  Government  has  committed  in  this  year’s  budget  to  help  the  Ministry 
<br/>alleviate poverty? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Assistant Minister for the question. I think 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Finance has very eloquently outlined some of the immediate steps that 
<br/>the  Coalition  Government  took  when  it  came  into  office.    But  let  me  highlight  them  again,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, just as a reminder to the people of what the Coalition Government coming into Parliament 
<br/>or into Government has taken steps to address this. As you had heard from the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance, there was the assistance for back-to-school for families of $50 million and this is now 
<br/>being issued again for the next school year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, we wrote-off $650 million student debts so that it alleviates our students 
<br/>from the burden of debt. It was also mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister in terms of 
<br/>the increase in budget all around in the social services sector, almost $200 million increase in the 
<br/>National Budget of the Social Services Sector as well as the Agriculture Sector, almost doubled in 
<br/>budget. Of course, you have heard that the sugarcane farmers are getting the highest price ever to 
<br/>have received,  as well as  no VAT increases on the 21 items, plus  medicine added as number 22.  
<br/>These are the commitments by the Coalition Government, and it will only increase in terms of our 
<br/>commitment to alleviate poverty across all Ministries, and I thank programme implementors in the 
<br/>Ministries who are committed to ensure that we are alleviating poverty across Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker Sir, but let me remind the 
<br/>other side of Parliament, when they took away the money for school assistance, they denied the other 
<br/>sectors that were allocated because that money was taken out from an allocation that already existed 
<br/>too.  While they took away the $600 million debt to the school, they added another $600 million as 
<br/>well to  the debt  of the country.   Sir, my simple question to  the honourable Minister is,  you have 
<br/>talked about the non-active and partially active projects.  Is it possible to name a few and what are 
<br/>you going to do about it?</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  will  be  happy  to  furnish  that  information  to  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition in terms of the list which is with the Poverty Monitoring Unit, 
<br/>but as each Minister, as you come into office and you review your budget, you will see that there are 
<br/>low utilization projects that needs to be utilised more in order to alleviate poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  example  I  give  from  our  Ministry,  in  terms  of  the  low  utilization  for  rural  pregnant 
<br/></span><span>mothers’ programme which we discovered.  This just happened to be associated with the difficulty 
<br/></span><span>of rural pregnant mothers coming from outer islands to come to the main cities to give birth if they 
<br/>face complications or issues like that. There was just not a very  good, streamlined process where 
<br/>rural pregnant mothers could be assisted to come to the main centres and we are looking at improving 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, to assist them in terms of their transportation and also their accommodation in the 
<br/>main cities when they come from rural areas.

<div><span>Early School Dropouts and Truancy 
<br/>(Question No. 150/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on how the Ministry is 
<br/>addressing the problem of early school dropouts and truancy amongst primary and secondary 
<br/>school students?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question. I would like to state that this question on school dropouts is everyone’s concern and there 
<br/>is no quick fix solution to this particular challenge. Let me just give some background. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Office of the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, by 
<br/>the year 2020, there were still 260 million children who did not attend primary or secondary schools 
<br/>despite of the aspirations of Sustainable Goal 4 which is to ensure that all girls and boys complete 
<br/>free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education.  The initial report states that without 
<br/>urgent action in a decade, 825 million children - half of all young people in the world, will not have 
<br/>the most basic skills necessary for jobs in the future. There are many reasons, Mr. Speaker Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So many young people are dropping out of school or been denied quality education and these 
<br/>reasons vary for each country and each obstacle is huge to the children trying to overcome them. The 
<br/>global reasons include child labour, it can be due to poverty or forced labour amongst others, lack of 
<br/>funding  support  from  home,  lack  of  empathy  by  teachers  who  are  not  so  welcoming,  not 
<br/>understanding  school  environment,  hunger,  difficult  journey  to  school,  gender  bias,  national 
<br/>conflicts, teenage pregnancies, natural disasters, et cetera.  Most of these reasons resonates to our 
<br/>education system here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, our school dropout range has been on average 0.5 percent per year over the 
<br/>past eight years as recorded in the FEMIS system. These figures could vary slightly, given that not 
<br/>all registered schools in Fiji are captured under FEMIS, especially private-run schools.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Education is working to initiate a process whereby all the students of Fiji need to be captured in a 
<br/>proper Ministry of Education system.  For our secondary school dropouts, an average of 3.2 percent 
<br/>per year over the past eight years.  A breakdown of this data can also be forwarded to the honourable 
<br/>Member if he so requests.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  children  and  youth  in  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  communities  are 
<br/>particularly at risk of educational exclusion.  The recent September Education Status Report indicated 
<br/>that the highest  number of school  dropouts  from  primary and secondary  education are of  </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>male students in rural communities.  What the Ministry of Education is strategising for early detection 
<br/>of risk of dropout is to provide intervention and this is done by the heads of schools and teachers.  
<br/>These are counselling hubs, and this is now widely encouraged for students and teachers, not only to 
<br/>address  students’  truant  behaviour,  but  also  concerns  and  needs  intervention  through  the  Fiji’s 
<br/>Psychological Society for early detection of underlying medical or psychological issues that are often 
<br/>left undetected and create barriers for healthy development and growth.   Continuation of the free 
<br/></span><span>education  support  to  address  financial  barriers  and  high  education  scholarships,  the  Drugs  and 
<br/></span><span>Substance Abuse Unit of the Ministry of Education based in Nasinu is engaging with schools and 
<br/>communities on the problems of drug use and advocating against the use and peddling of such drugs 
<br/>by students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I attended a Natabua High School Annual Prize-giving Ceremony, and we 
<br/>were briefed on how a student had been noted to miss school a lot and was eventually caught peddling 
<br/>drugs.  The school investigated the student’s background and provided counselling sessions for this 
<br/>young man.  It was discovered the student was being coerced to sell drugs.  He was offered a boarding 
<br/></span><span>space and was happy to accept it at the Natabua School.  He has since done well in school and his 
<br/></span><span>behaviour  has  taken  leaps  and  bounds  in  terms  of  his  personality  and  character  and  shows  very 
<br/>positive signs of becoming a well-balanced young man.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  what  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  encouraging  schools  to  do,  and  that  is  to  find 
<br/>solutions to resolve student challenges.  Sending children out of school as a disciplinary measure will 
<br/>not only dump the problem to another school, there is highly likelihood that because other schools 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>refuse to take students sent home to find another school, the student actually becomes a dropout with 
<br/>the possibility of soon becoming involved in crime because of neglect and rejection issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues with the hope programmes, whereby, extra support 
<br/>is  provided  to  students  and  trainings  for  our  teaching  staff  to  integrate  creative  and  innovative 
<br/>methods of keeping children engaged in our classrooms.  We also hope to provide more training to 
<br/>teachers and through our teacher training colleges in  how to  be understanding,  kind,  tolerant  and 
<br/>inspiring teachers with patience and tenacity to turn a problematic student into a success story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being no supplementary question, I now intend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to adjourn Parliament for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>Criteria – Great Council of Chiefs Membership 
<br/>(Question No. 151/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update 
<br/>Parliament on the specific criteria and requirements in place that needs to be adhered to by 
<br/>chiefs representing any Fijian province to qualify for membership within the Great Council 
<br/>of Chiefs?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question.  In 
<br/>appointing members to the Great Council of Chiefs Vakaturaga Conference this year, the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs was guided by the GCC Regulation 2023. The criteria for membership remains 
<br/>clear. A chief need to be a </span><span>turaga iTaukei</span><span> confirmed by the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission 
<br/>(TLFC).   They must not  be discharged bankrupt, in-mates  or extra-mural prisoners or persons of 
<br/>unsound mind. Additionally, their nomination must come from their </span><span>Bose Vanua.  </span><span>While members 
<br/>of the GCC must traditionally be confirmed in their position as </span><span>Turaga i Taukei</span><span>, we acknowledge 
<br/>the current high vacancy rates in chiefly titles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those reasons, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs adopts a flexible approach in this year’s 
<br/>appointment. Moving forward the TLFC will work diligently to fill this vacancy.  To further address 
<br/>this,  we  have  initiated  training  programmes  for  future  members  of  the  GCC.  The  </span><span>i  Sausauvou</span><span>
<br/>Programme,  a  six-week  course,  is  designed  to  prepare  upcoming  traditional  leaders  for  </span><span>vanua</span><span>
<br/>leadership. We successfully completed this programme in seven provinces. Despite these challenges, 
<br/>our  criteria  and  training  programme  ensure  that  appointed  members  uphold  the  integrity  and 
<br/>effectiveness of the GCC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transportation Issues - Mainland and Outer Islands 
<br/>(Question No. 152/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform Parliament on the measures being used to address the issues of transportation between 
<br/></span><span>the mainland and the outer islands?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. It is sort of a general question so I will touch on a few issues regarding maritime on the 
<br/>transportation, basically mainland and outer islands focusing on maritime.  Of course, the Ministry 
<br/>and our various agencies consider safety as one of the main responsibilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we may understand, the provision of inter-island shipping is categorised into two types of 
<br/>services  -  economical  routes  and  uneconomical  routes.  The  economical  routes  are  profitable  in 
<br/></span><span>nature, frequently serviced by ship operators and having a higher return in investment in terms of 
<br/></span><span>carriage of goods and services. These routes are not subsidised by the Government.  There have been 
<br/>various data on this, Sir, and recently we have seen a high number of movement in terms of passenger 
<br/>movements.  For example, in terms of the Eastern Division, covering Natovi and Levuka, there were 
<br/>more than 500,000 passenger movements in these ports between 2021 and 2023.    Also, 
<br/>the 
<br/>Western Division, we have seen a significant increase, given the improved performance of tourism, 
<br/>signifying growth as the Coalition Government came in.  Cargo movement has also increased from 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a million tonnes in 2021 to 2.4 million in 2022, according to the data on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  uneconomical  routes,  vessel  operators  are  provided  with  schedules  from  the 
<br/>Ministry,  particularly  in  terms  of  Natovi  and  Narain  Jetties.    Uneconomical  routes  have  low 
<br/>passenger and cargo capacity.  The cost of the inter-island shipping services to uneconomical routes 
<br/>outweighs the investment caused for shipping owners, which is why some of these routes are covered 
<br/>by the Franchise Scheme which is a subsidised Scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is being allocated $3.2 million in this financial year to subsidise private vessel 
<br/>operators  to  provide  inter-island  shipping  services  to  10  uneconomical  routes  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>franchise.  The three operators that provide at this moment are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Goundar Shipping Limited; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interlink Shipping Line Limited; and 
<br/>Brighton Holdings Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, they are vented into a  10-year agreement and this is reviewed every five years.  
<br/>Some  of  the  areas  serviced  include  Northen  Lau,  Yacata,  Vanuabalavu,  Tuvuca  and  Cikobia, 
<br/>Yasayasa  Moala  route  which  covers  Naroi,  Keteira,  Maloku  in  Moala,  Qalikarua  in  Matuku  and 
<br/>services Tovu and Udu in Totoya.  Upper Southern Lau Route include Vanuavatu, Nayau, Lakeba, 
<br/>Oneata, Komo, Moce and Namuka-i-Lau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lomaiviti Route covers Gau – Qarani, Sawaieke, Nawaikama and Nacavanadi; and for Nairai 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>– Lawaki,  Waitoga  and Nakasava in Batiki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  in  Kadavu,  several  villages  are  just  covered  by  the  franchise  scheme.  It  also 
<br/>provides for monthly services to other areas I have not mentioned including Rotuma; Yasawa; Beqa; 
<br/>Yanuca; Vatulele and other islands in the lower Southern Lau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  franchise  service  is  not  only  limited  to  those  ports,  but  we  have  encouraged  service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>providers to service nearby Ports where the franchise company is on the route. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  some  figures  from  2018  to  2023  the  franchise  successfully  serviced  and 
<br/>transported  an  accumulated  total  of  81,790  passenger  movements  averaging  6,800  passenger 
<br/>movements per year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of moving forward, we are currently reviewing the Franchise Agreement given the 
<br/></span><span>increased demands and also of course from the shipping operator side, the increased operational cost 
<br/>related to operating the ships.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other reviews, we are looking at digitalising the whole process so that it is better managed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in terms of the schedules monitoring and of course a performance review of the whole franchise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  not  only  the  economic  side  but  also  how  cost  effective  it  is,  whether  we  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budgeting enough or are we doing enough to service our maritime communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  in  response  to  that question we also  have the Government  Shipping Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This comes under the Ministry with various vessels under its operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He asked the general question, so I am giving a general answer. So, if you had asked about 
<br/>Government Shipping Service (GSS) or franchise I would have just focused on that area.  It is also

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>good for information. I know you were away for a while, so when you came back, I thought I would 
<br/>explain it, just to update you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  GSS  fleet  needs  to  be  modernised  and  upgraded.    I  know  under  the  last 
<br/>Government, they did one or two purchases but the rest of the fleet is aging so we are looking at not 
<br/>only an increased budget but also we are currently talking to various development partners in terms 
<br/>of the replacement for that. In addition, we need to run our transport system more effectively as we 
<br/>face climate change issues and move away from fossil fuels, that is another challenge which we are 
<br/>looking into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point, there has been a lot of things I understand, and in terms of the whole shipping 
<br/>fleet, some of our maritime communities are complaining about the cost of freight and at the moment, 
<br/>Fiji Consumer Competition Commission is currently undertaking a market study for the domestic 
<br/>shipping industry, not only on the rates and charges but also on the industry at large, including market 
<br/>players, infrastructure, regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  glad  to  see  that  the  honourable  Minister  has 
<br/>continued all the work that we did, because nothing that he has mentioned is obviously new, it is all 
<br/>news. We are invested in GSS ships, specialised ships, specialised boats. We also came up with the 
<br/>idea of the 10-year licence to make sure and to encourage people that run these ships to invest in new 
<br/>boats, so there is nothing new. I look forward to the time, Honourable Minister when you come up 
<br/>with your own ideas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One question, one of the things that makes the bus industry, people that use bus services as 
<br/>well because they are licensed. When there are times for you to go, you have to go. If you do not go, 
<br/>you can be penalised. This is not in place for boats. So, I am just wondering whether there has been 
<br/>any discussion, because a lot of the complaints about the islands that when the boat is supposed to 
<br/>come and it did not come, and then sometimes the boat owners for their own reasons, they decide not 
<br/>to do it, they say ‘I am going to stop my ships going’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This licensing where you have to go at this particular time, if you do not, there could be a 
<br/>penalty.    Is  there  any  consideration?  That  is  a  question,  it  has  got  a  question  mark  at  the  end  of 
<br/>licensing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You know, you cannot operate in Fiji like you are operating 
<br/>in New Zealand and Australia because we have to have some leeway for social considerations. That 
<br/></span><span>is what the Coalition Government is about unlike the Fiji First Government, they apply the law and 
<br/></span><span>punish.  That  is  different  from  us.  At  the  moment  I  mentioned  we  are  already  reviewing  -  the 
<br/>performance review of the franchise.  Yes, definitely, recently we had a case where there were threats 
<br/>to the boat owner, so they did not want to turn up. There have been issues like that, but there have 
<br/>been reasons provided by the boat owners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the compliance, MSAF is currently responsible for that and they are working diligently 
<br/>on the compliance issues which cover that type of operations and they are there at the beginning of 
<br/>the trip to look at the compliance issues before the trip and during and after. So they do separate 
<br/></span><span>reports  to  GSS  and  to  MSAF,  if  there  is  a  breach  then  they  are  addressed  through  those  two 
<br/></span><span>mechanisms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A supplementary question, honourable Minister, on the route licensing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  All  those  issues  will  be  accumulated  and  will  depend  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether it is renewed or not. So that is how we will deal with it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1971 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  stated  that  we,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government,  did  a  few  purchases.  Let  me  remind  him  that  when  we  came,  there  was  only  the 
<br/></span><span>Dausoko</span><span>, </span><span>Kaunitoni </span><span>and </span><span>Vatulawa</span><span>. So, the rest of the Government fleet was purchased through this 
<br/>Government, when we were in Government. But the question is, we are in the disaster period Sir, he 
<br/>talked  about  the  Government  fleet  and  what  we  would  like  to  know  is,  what  percentage  of  the 
<br/>Government  fleet  is  operational  that  can  do  the  job  for  the  Minister  if  needed,  when  we  have  a 
<br/>disaster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of the availability, I have worked closely with the 
<br/>Minister for Rural Development and Disaster Management that the fleet is available 100 percent in 
<br/>terms  of  the  need  as  determined  by  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office  and  we  have 
<br/>streamlined  that  process.    He  does  not  have  to  ask  me  all  the  time  and  the  other  issue  about  the 
<br/>percentage of availability, I do not have the figures right now, I can get back to you on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is on the transport on mainland.  What 
<br/>measures are being taken to address the issue of transportation faced by students in Lautoka area, in 
<br/>particular the following – Viseisei, Saweni, Vaivai, Raviravi and other nearby areas.  That is because 
<br/>students have to walk miles to reach to and from school and this is because of irregular bus service 
<br/>since August 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What is the Minister doing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  I heard them saying very poor.  Yes, it is very poor for them 
<br/>not to coordinate their questions or understanding of the question because if you read the question, it 
<br/>says “between the mainland and the outer islands”.  There is nothing there which says, ‘within the 
<br/>mainland’, can you re-pose that as a new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- </span><span>Areh, </span><span>the question says, between mainland and outer islands.  
<br/>Do you understand what “between” means?  Between means point A and B, that is that, not within.  
<br/>Between is different.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Too many </span><span>areh </span><span>going on.

<br/>regional assistance and increased collaboration between India and the region.

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as part of an action plan to strengthen the Indo-Pacific Island Countries partnership, India 
<br/>will construct a 100-bed regional super speciality hospital for Fiji.  The offer by the Government of 
<br/>India to build the 100-bed super speciality cardio hospital in Fiji was also discussed in February 2023 
<br/>during the visit to India by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor B.C. Prasad, 
<br/>and also subsequently by the visit of the Indian Minister for External Affairs, honourable Jaishankar 
<br/>when he visited earlier on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  hospital,  the  Government  of  India  is  going  to  provide  equipment  and  human 
<br/>resources for the operations of the hospital for a period of time.  At the moment, Sir, the land has 
<br/>been identified at Nasinu and the team from India is expected to arrive soon to begin the actual work. 
<br/>In terms of the commencement of the project, it will start most likely mid-next year, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>That in itself is a nutshell of the current development of the proposed 100-bed speciality Hospital 
<br/>given to the country by the Government of India.
