<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCTIVITY  
<br/>AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 2016-2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Ministry  of  Employment, 
<br/>Productivity and Industrial Relations 2016 to 2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and 
<br/>Industrial Relations is responsible for upholding the constitutional right of every Fijian to economic 
<br/>participation,  adjust  minimum  wage,  humane  treatment  in  the  workplace  and  proper  working 
<br/>conditions. The Ministry promotes and advances the rights of workers and employers and administers 
<br/>and enforces the Employment Relations Act of 2007, Health and Safety at Work Act of 1997 and the 
<br/>National Employment Centre Act of 2009.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 financial years, the Ministry of Employment 
<br/>and  Industrial  Relations  continue  to  support  workplaces  to  become  compliant,  productive  and 
<br/>inclusive  in  response  to  important  legislative  change,  complex  issues  and  growing  community 
<br/>expectations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry’s internal processes were changed and upgraded for re-certification 
<br/>to ISO 9001 of 2015 international standards in growing an efficient and effective work culture. The 
<br/>Ministry  significantly  expanded  its  service  offerings  through  the  launch  of  its  customer  services 
<br/></span><span>centre  ensuring  that  more  workers  and  businesses  understood  their  entitlements  and  obligations. 
<br/></span><span>There was also easier access of services for the general public as well as the implementation of Fiji’s 
<br/>first ever National Employment Policy aimed at reducing unemployment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee acknowledges the continued work of the tripartite partners and 
<br/>strive to find solutions to achieve decent work and employment growth in Fiji. The Committee is yet 
<br/>to receive the substantive response on the Standing Committee Report as according to Standing Order 
<br/>121(6)(b) which requires the agency to provide a response within 21 days of receiving the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  I have a list of speakers provided by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Whips  that  are  before  me.    The  debate  will  be  led  by  honourable  Bala,  then  followed  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Labour,  before  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma  takes  the  floor  and  will  be 
<br/>rounded off by the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute briefly to the motion that is before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us and at the outset, I would like to thank the Committee and in particular the Chairperson and the
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support staff. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is after lunch and as promised by the honourable Minister during 
<br/>the debate in the morning, he will hand in the report after lunch which I still have not received.  So I 
<br/>hope by the end of the session my good friend will hand over that report to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, I will be very brief but this is my experience and observation. 
<br/>Before there were less Ministerial overseas trips to go and meet the seasonal workers and there were 
<br/>less issues. Now there are more Ministerial visits.  Basically,  every month there is a Ministerial visit 
<br/>with more issues and I am wondering what is really happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Neglect the issues and do your job.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- From morning, I was very quiet. I felt sorry for the honourable Minister, 
<br/>but she is trying to create some situations, but I will still leave that at that.  I feel sorry for you anyway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  recent  weeks  there  was  a  post  from  the  workers  who  are  under  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme that the Ministerial visits are not well-coordinated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Very hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I request my good friend next time may be after two weeks he will go 
<br/>again, to visit the seasonal workers, to have a coordinated programme so that we do not have such 
<br/>problems here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  us  go  into  the  Report  itself  on  the  key  findings.  It  talks  about  the 
<br/>minimum wage rate and I would like to ask, as to when will there be a review of the national minimum 
<br/>wage rate as promised by the Government because there are a lot of discussions going on in regards 
<br/>to this, even this Report is connected to the Minimum Wage Rate and I urge Government to please 
<br/>look into it because the prices of goods are going up day by day but the wages and salaries are stuck 
<br/>at one place.  I do not know for what reason the salaries for the honourable Ministers, backbenchers 
<br/>have been differed but if that was tabled, that would have been a suicide case for the Government, 
<br/>honestly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me tell you, whatever we may say here, people are suffering and we need to pay some of 
<br/>them Sir. We can come here and say a lot of things, Mr. Speak, Sir, but what is happening actually 
<br/>on the ground, that is something that we need to address and I hope the honourable Minister will take 
<br/>note of this and may be in his response, he will give us some programmes and the timelines when 
<br/></span><span>this exercise will take place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these few comments I would like to thank you and the Committee as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a whole, and I support the motion that is before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I rise to contribute to the debate on the Report.  Firstly, I would like to 
<br/>convey my appreciation and commend the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs for the Review of the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  is  mandated  to  pursue  the  attainment  of  Distant  Employment 
<br/>Standards through the Promotion of the Employment Opportunities, Provision of a Healthy and Safe 
<br/>Work  Environments,  Fair  Employment  Conditions,  Good  Faith  Employment  Relations  and 
<br/>Productive Workplaces.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1997 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I actually go any further just let me briefly respond to honourable Bala’s 
<br/>comment on the visitation.  I will have a Ministerial Statement on the visitation and that is when he 
<br/>will get all the answers after that, Mr. Speaker, coming on Wednesday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this man never ever visited the workers, so what does he know about their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plight?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A Point of order, Mr. Speaker.  The honourable Minister for Employment 
<br/>is misleading this Honourable House. I did visit, go and check the records in your office, you will 
<br/>find and if your staff are not giving that to you, that is not my problem, it is your staff’s problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Pio, I have a lot of respect for you but I have seen you jumping up and down, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there must be something wrong with you again.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, the last three years I have visited the workers and the last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three years nobody has visited them since they have been there since 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I have visited as a former Minister, Semi Koroilavesau visited as a 
<br/>former Minister. We all visited them. Standing in this House and saying that, is a complete lie, Sir. 
<br/>He has to withdraw that statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, they have a difficulty in understanding. I said the last three 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years, Mr. Speaker, let me continue. This report is for the period 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is part of the eight-year period of talk down, dictatorial rule. The labour laws have 
<br/>been amended unilaterally to deny workers their fundamental rights, deny workers decent work and 
<br/>a decent living, livelihood. As reported earlier, Mr. Speaker, we are now in the process of reviewing 
<br/>and amending all those laws to ensure that we restore all those rights that were forcefully taken away.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this week there is a Bill coming to this Parliament, to this House, to be tabled 
<br/>by the Honourable Attorney General tomorrow. To begin with, by correcting the Essential National 
<br/>Industries List to the EIA 2007 listing, in compliance with the ILO advice listing. I will be very much 
<br/>interested  to  see  how  the  Opposition  is  going  to  react  to  that,  Mr  Speaker,  whether  they  want  to 
<br/>restore those rights or they still are opposed to restoring the fundamental rights of these people. We 
<br/>are also going to include in the Bill the six months provisions for reporting individual grievances 
<br/>which is now discriminatory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has noted the recommendations highlighted by the Committee for 
<br/>improvement on the anomalies and the financial statements and all audits highlighted from the basic 
<br/>audits being qualified. Mr. Speaker, major issues that we have corrected are already in place in the 
<br/>auditing, and our auditing is no longer receiving qualified reporting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we inherited a Ministry which had 25 percent vacant positions that needed to be 
<br/>filled. We have now filled, out of the 45 that were vacant, 25 and the other 20 have been advertised 
<br/>and they are in the process of being filled. With all these in place, we are hoping to be able to carry 
<br/></span><span>out our mandate better than what it used to be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir during that period there were also 53 resignations. That is 26.5 percent of 
<br/>the total workforce in the Ministry. That is why, and the reason of course, Mr Speaker is obvious, the 
<br/>unilaterally imposed … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USUMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- …. contractual appointments, Mr. Speaker ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USUMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- … and of course the fear of turning 55 tomorrow, if you spoke up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also reorganised the Tripartite Boards according to ILO 144 and 
<br/>employers and workers are now being fully consulted and the Employment Relations Advisory Board 
<br/>(ERAB) is in place.  Collective bargaining is now well and alive, workers and employers are coming 
<br/>together.  Workers now have the right to strike ballots, several unions have taken strike ballots and 
<br/>we have then intervened and brought them to the table for free discussions, dialogue in good faith 
<br/>and we have been able to resolve all those differences that were existing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is hurting, I know it is hurting.  You failed to do what you are supposed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to do and it is hurting now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- (Inaudible)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Good faith was totally missing in their days.  There was nothing like 
<br/>good faith.  The State being the worst employer, and it cascaded down to those other employers who 
<br/>wanted to take advantage and they did take advantage by treating workers unfairly in those days and 
<br/>all that is now a thing of the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must also thank the honourable Attorney-General for assisting us with the drafting and the 
<br/>Solicitor-General for drafting the Bill and also thanking the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
<br/>for providing us with a legal drafter who is sitting in our Office now assisting us with the entire ERA 
<br/>which will be completed by January this year and tabled in the next Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OHS, draft Plant Regulation Bill and the draft Amendment Right Code, 
<br/>the draft Sawmill Regulations are currently under development in consultation with the OHS Board 
<br/>and it has been completed and it is going to be presented soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the four-year ban on villages that the Committee has brought to our attention 
<br/>where people absconded when they were sent abroad to work.  Actually, it began in 2019 and now 
<br/>that has lapsed so there is no more a ban and I can assure you Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current approach 
<br/>of providing the support to the challenges that workers are faced with when they are out there in that 
<br/></span><span>alien environment, through our interventions, is going to see that that is going to be reduced, so we 
<br/></span><span>will not need that kind of a ban anymore because of the proactive action that we are taking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all in all, all the comments of the Committee have been taken on board by 
<br/>our Ministry and we are addressing that.  With that brief intervention, I thank you for the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Review of the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relation Report 2016–2017, 2017–2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the findings that were conducted then: 3,724 labour inspections 
<br/></span><span>were done from August 1</span><span>st</span><span>, 2017 to July 31</span><span>st</span><span>, 2018 on the new minimum wage rate.  Those who did 
<br/>not  comply  were  penalised  and  we  also  note  from  the  report  that  the  Ministry  conducted  public 
<br/>consultations around Fiji on the Government’s revised Seasonal  Work Recruitment and Selection 
<br/>criteria. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1999 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the honourable Minister for Employment that he, 
<br/>together with Felix Anthony was part of the Fiji team to avoid Fiji from being suspended by the ILO 
<br/>in 2015 and 2016, yet he goes on that nothing was done again and again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  can  talk  about  economic  development,  sustainability,  connectivity, 
<br/>resilience, infrastructure, climate adaptation, mitigation - big fancy words. But in order for this to be 
<br/>implemented for our people in our country there needs to be a sense of belonging, a sense of equality 
<br/>where people feel that equal opportunities are available in Fiji because it is up to every individual to 
<br/>work towards a better life and this is what the FijiFirst Government was about addressing the root 
<br/>issue which of course they are far away from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming to 2023 we witnessed the gradual corrosion of Fiji’s Constitutional 
<br/>integrity and economic development affecting employment and productivity in these last 11 months.  
<br/>They have achieved nothing, employment is very difficult since the Coalition Government has come 
<br/>to power, businesses are struggling since the Coalition Government has come to power.  Of course, 
<br/>the people are struggling with the high cost of living.  In simple terms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition 
<br/>Government does not know, they do not know minimum of eight years are spent by some of them in 
<br/>Opposition and where are the alternative solutions to take the people forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is a very good example of bad governance.  We 
<br/>have a Government here that cannot even reshuffle their Ministers properly. How do you expect them 
<br/>to improve employment and productivity in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government,  in  the  last  11  months,  have  shown  that  the 
<br/>women  who  hold  employment  at  the  national  office  are  shown  the  backbenchers  and  one  of  the 
<br/>Ministers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  fact  covered  by  Fijivillage  in  the  media,  she  went  on  record  for 
<br/>advocating for women participation in Municipal Elections and even at national office.  However, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact I asked honourable Sashi Kiran, did she utter a single word in support of a 
<br/>female colleague when she was removed as a Leader of the Government in Parliament not a single 
<br/>word,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  is  the  women  empowerment,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  where  you  sit  in 
<br/>Parliament ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- ... plays a significant role, right now no one is at the first bench which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is very, very obvious.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Go and ask your leader what they did to former honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member Mereseini Vuniwaqa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- … honourable Professor Biman Prasad talks about fresh air, a breath 
<br/>of fresh air.  Are you kidding me, breathe of fresh air.  You have choked the people of Fiji with a 
<br/>high Cost of Living and you are talking about fresh air.

<div><span> Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, people are jobless, businesses are cashless because 
<br/>this Coalition Government is clueless.  They fail to make one decision, stick to their decision and if 
<br/>it backfires, all they say is “I am sorry”.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a washing machine mentality, they 
<br/>go this way and then they go that way.  Indian communities they have a saying “</span><span>bina pendi ke lota</span><span>” 
<br/>unstable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have no direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude  I  support  the  findings  of  the  Committee  and  I  thank  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for fulfilling their mandate to review this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that was tabled here in Parliament on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  have  made  several 
<br/>recommendations  and  those  who  had  spoken  before  me  have  alluded  or  highlighted  a  number  of 
<br/>those recommendations which I wish to add, just a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first recommendation was based on the challenge faced by the National 
<br/>Employment Centre (NEC) to register and track citizens who are unemployed to engage them in a 
<br/>range of activities as part of its selection process.  In this regard, improving the NEC’s ability to 
<br/>register and also to track unemployed citizens can be achieved by imposing several of these measures 
<br/>or strategies which the Government is now going into.  Modernising the registration system which 
<br/>includes  upgrading  the  registration  process  by  implementing  a  renewed  digital  system  and 
<br/>developing an online platform or mobile applications that allows individuals to register very easily. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Database management – Creation of a comprehensive database to store citizens’ information 
<br/>securely but also making them accessible, authorised personnel within the NEC framework to track 
<br/>the  progress,  job  searchers,  job  matching  and  engagement  of  those  who  have  applied  to  various 
<br/>activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regular Outreach and Communication – We also picked up on feedback mechanism, that is 
<br/>important to allow citizens who have enrolled with NEC and provide them with the experience and 
<br/>suggestions from NEC and what services are available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Collaboration  and  Partnership  –  This  is  also  highlighted  in  the  Report  and  that  makes  it 
<br/></span><span>important for forging of partnership and education institutions, NGOs and private sectors so that the 
<br/></span><span>range of opportunities expends that their available to citizens of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Training and Support for the NEC staff is also important, Mr. Speaker, and so Government 
<br/>will now ensure that the staff of the National Employment Centre are adequately trained in using the 
<br/>registration system that is there and improving the database to ensure that they also themselves are 
<br/>within par of what is needed to launch this programme and take it to the next level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regular  Evaluation  and  Adaptation  –  There  is  a  requirement  for  periodic  review  of  the 
<br/></span><span>registration and tracking process to identify areas where there might be bottlenecks so that we can 
<br/></span><span>release them and allow for a free flow of the process there at the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the issue that have been highlighted by the honourable Minister with regard 
<br/>to the review of the four-year ban imposed on villagers of absconding seasonal workers. I am not 
<br/>sure how and why that rule was, I am very glad that it is now being thrown out of the window.  It is 
<br/>a very poorly developed practice, very poorly developed policy where everybody else gets to pay for 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2001 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the indiscretion of one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.K. Bala interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- The villagers are not in Government. These were policies that 
<br/>were put in place by the previous Government which flies in the face of every workers rights that 
<br/>you would probably have known in your time as Minister, honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.K. Bala interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- It has been taken away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what has been done is, in addition to ensuring that people who go overseas to work, they 
<br/>must also have clear expectation of what is required of them instead of punishing people who are still 
<br/>trying to get themselves to work overseas, we provide clear expectations to those who are about to 
<br/>go  into  these  jobs.  Allowing  competitive  compensation  and  also  benefits  is  also  one  of  the  areas 
<br/>which the Government is now going to put more emphasis into and also  providing positive work 
<br/>environment. There is going to be regular check-ins and feedback.  The reason why the Minister has 
<br/>to go and check on those work programmes overseas is to ensure that if there are any places where 
<br/>difficulties have been encountered by those who work overseas, that they are arrested as quickly as 
<br/>they are found and that they be addressed as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exit interviews is also something that we also want to do is to ensure that workers who have 
<br/>returned from tour of duties overseas provide opportunities for the NEC to learn of what were the 
<br/>problems or the difficulties that they encountered when they were there. What we will do is then 
<br/>improve on the programme, uncover systematic issues, areas of disaffection and then improve with 
<br/>the programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bonds have also been suggested that Government needs to have a bond system like they use 
<br/>for scholarships which can be tailor-made to make sure that workers complete their tour of duties 
<br/>overseas also return home in time with their money.   I support the motion that is before Parliament, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, and I thank you for your indulgence.
