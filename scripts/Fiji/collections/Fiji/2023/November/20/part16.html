<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – ITAUKEI TRUST FUND BOARD 2020 ANNUAL REPORT  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  Board  supports  and 
<br/>promotes the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage as guided by the principles enshrined in the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund Act. The core objective of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board is to help develop the 
<br/></span><span>management, leadership and entrepreneurial skills of the indigenous Fijians and Rotumans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  2020,  the  global  pandemic  significantly  impacted  returns  on  the  Fund’s 
<br/>investment.    For  instance,  the  tourism  sector  was  severely  hit  which  affected,  particularly,  the 
<br/>Raddison Blu Resort. The Fund diversified its investment portfolio, including offshore investments 
<br/>which  soften  the  gravity  of  COVID-19  impact  on  its  financial  performances  and  return  on 
<br/>investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The engagement of Mércer Investment of Australia to review its investment portfolio for the 
<br/></span><span>key objective was to review and to ensure the diversification of the Fund’s assets with managed risks 
<br/></span><span>and the delivery of inconsistent returns on investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Fund’s car park space at the corner of Saint Fort and Stewart Street continue 
<br/>to deliver constant revenue annually. Tenants were given a rental concession of 25 percent during 
<br/>the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, for the year under review, the Fund’s net assets decreased from 
<br/>$325 million to $265 million. The Fund plans to diversify its revenue streams and is optimistic for a

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Committee  is  yet  to  receive  the  substantive  response  on  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee Report, as according to Standing Order 121(6)(b), which requires the agency to provide 
<br/>its responses within 21 days of receiving the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floors is now open for debate on the motion. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a list of speakers that have been provided by the honourable Whips: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Minister for iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Koroilavesau 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. J. Usamate 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.S.N. Kamikamica 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  before 
<br/>Parliament.  The Report summarises the core objectives of the iTaukei  Trust  Fund Board to  help 
<br/>develop  the  management,  leadership  and  entrepreneurial  skills  of  the  indigenous  Fijians  and 
<br/>Rotumans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, under item 3.0 on the key findings, the Report highlighted some projects 
<br/>funded by iTTFB. I am thankful with this brilliant idea of establishing a body like iTTFB some years 
<br/>ago, having part of its function to what I observed as powerful programmes that focus on the iTaukei 
<br/>cultural norms, traditions, language, kinship, traditional relationship and customs in general. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recommendations  4.1  says  that  the  Sauvaki  ni  Vanua  Programme  be 
<br/>conducted in other Provinces. The Report simply put it as training on good governance and leadership 
<br/>for the </span><span>i sausau vou</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>From the introduction of the programme in 2017 by the FijiFirst Government, 
<br/>it has slowly progressed across other Provinces as we have heard from the honourable Minister for 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it is only when one takes a very close look on the objectives and contents of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the training to really appreciate why we need to develop our traditional leaders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the </span><span>Sauvaki ni Vanua</span><span> Programme there are six components: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Rara Tabu Vakavanua</span><span> – the</span><span> vanua</span><span> decision making forum. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Na i Tovo ni Veiliutaki Vakavanua</span><span> – the</span><span> vanua</span><span> ethos and values and leadership approach. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Vakasavui ni Lewa Vakavanua</span><span> – the </span><span>vanua </span><span>communication strategies, using of traditional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ties to disseminate information within the </span><span>vanua.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Na  Cakacaka  ni  Lewa  Vakavanua</span><span>  –  the  implementation  of  the  decision  through  the</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>solesolevaki</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Vakayagataki Vakavuku  ni Yaubula</span><span> – the sustainable management of resources. 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Yadrayadravaki</span><span> which touches on monitoring and awareness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  traditional  leadership  plays  as  a  vital  role  in  our  community  development, 
<br/>resilience and sustainability.  The truth is, in my view, we often relegate traditional leadership to only 
<br/>things of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> - cultural practices, ritual, including religion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is this fallacy that these issues and leadership about them cannot have 
<br/>any bearing on a country’s economic and sustainable development, but I want to say that this is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>1976 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the case anymore. Worldwide, the importance of traditional knowledge and leadership is increasingly 
<br/>accepted  in  the  highest  forums  such  as  the  United  Nations.  I  want  to  say  that  understanding  this 
<br/>traditional leadership plays a vital role in our nation’s wellbeing is wisdom.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, traditional leadership safeguards indigenous knowledge and identity.  I want 
<br/>to make a point here, Sir, that I am not only referring to the iTaukei identity, but our multi-ethnic mix 
<br/>have  their  respective  traditional  ethnic  indigenous  identities.  So,  our  multi-ethic  identities  and 
<br/>knowledge systems are as diverse as they are strong.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their knowledge system strengthens their communities and can potentially give strength to 
<br/>others. The most important message I would like to share, if communities are strong and resilient.  
<br/>The sum of multitude strong and resilient communities will result in having a resilient nation.  So, it 
<br/>makes  sense  to  empower  our  traditional  leadership  to  use  traditional  knowledge  and  contextual 
<br/>solutions to build strong resilient communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is critical to understand that these traditional and indigenous leadership is 
<br/>like an anchor that keeps communities and the people rooted in resilience and strength to cope with 
<br/>the rapid change of time, for example, the climate change.  They have done this a long time back, 
<br/>before there was any formal education around.   They know changes and seasons  and the kind  of 
<br/>preparation that is needed, knowing who they are and using their indigenous knowledge to adapt and 
<br/>cope with climate change and its strength.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are things that contribute to our nation’s well-being instead of just 
<br/>enabling  conditions  that  keeping  people  depend  on  Government  to  provide  for  their  challenges, 
<br/>traditional leadership can lead their communities to a place of peace and finding solutions to their 
<br/>challenges.  Traditional leaderships can help their communities navigate social changes, for example, 
<br/>our digitally transformed global world, the good and the bad it brings, its overwhelming changes are 
<br/>transforming the way communities and even family functions communicate or interact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other  examples  are  drug issues, the street  dwelling  problems  we  are currently facing, 
<br/>domestic violence, poverty and child trafficking or even pornographic matters.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>what I am trying to say is that the idea of trained traditional leaders like the </span><span>sauvaki ni vanua</span><span>, is a 
<br/>positive move for building resilient </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities.  Sir, I want to challenge the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  to  take  cue  and  develop  similar  programmes  for  the  traditional 
<br/>leaders of the various multi-ethnic groups under his Ministry.  Six years ago, the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>started with the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities and it is producing great results according to the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for iTaukei Affairs.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a brief on the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 
<br/>2020 Annual Report that was tabled before the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on 30</span><span>th</span><span> March 
<br/>this year.  I take this time to thank the Committee for their time in scrutinising the Board’s 2020 
<br/>Annual Report and providing us with their recommendations, which I am obligated to reply upon 
<br/>today.   The year in review was enormously remembered for the COVID-19 pandemic.  It took the 
<br/>world by surprise.  Our normalcy was disrupted and restrictions were placed.  The operations of the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust  Fund Board were no exception to these disruptions.  The global pandemic affected 
<br/></span><span>most of the Board’s planned projects.  There was a dramatic decline on the return of our investment, 
<br/></span><span>in particular the Radisson Blu Resort in Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To comply with the national safety measures proposed, the Trust Fund was able to continue 
<br/>its operations using hybrid method of operations both in office and virtually, all these efforts were 
<br/>taken into account to minimise disruptions and to extend our services as far as reasonably possible.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1977 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in the Report, three online projects were launched in the same 
<br/>period.  These projects proved to be successful to this day.  In the same period, the iTaukei Trust 
<br/>Fund Board signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the strategic partner Sunshine and 
<br/>AMP  Manufacturing  Limited  with  the  aim  to  establish  a  culture,  art  and  commercial  centre.  The 
<br/>location of this project was to be in Vuda which is also known as the place where our forefathers first 
<br/>settled in when arriving into Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The status of the project was that basic outline drawing and concept had been completed, a 
<br/>feasibility study was in progress however, COVID-19 had prevented the completion of the study.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform this august House that for that same reason of COVID-19 and its 
<br/>prolonged delay which disrupted business operations, the strategic partner has pulled put from the 
<br/>project like many other business who are affected by COVID-19, the strategic partner have decided 
<br/>to  take  stock  and  consolidate  its  operations  and  focus  more  on  their  main  business  which  is 
<br/>manufacturing. In the meantime, the Trust Fund will engage in search for an alternative site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as has alluded earlier I am here to report on the recommendation put forth 
<br/>by the Committee. First the </span><span>i Sauvaki ni Vanua</span><span> Programme be conducted in other province. As of 
<br/>April this year I am pleased to inform this August House that the </span><span>i Sauvaki ni Vanua</span><span> Programme has 
<br/>been conducted in over seven province around the country with the province of Naitasiri held this 
<br/>year.  Mr. Speaker, the program has proven to be a success in other seven provinces and the iTaukei 
<br/>Trust Fund Board is working towards facilitating the same program in the remainder of the provinces 
<br/>around Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the appointment of fund manager: the appointment of fund manager was on hold 
<br/>due to COVID-19 in 2020, however with the uplift of restriction and opening of borders, a board 
<br/>delegation visited Australia in April of this year to scout for a fund manager. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish 
<br/>to report that a fund manager has been appointed in August this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third additional training program to be expanded to other provinces, the iTaukei Trust 
<br/>Fund  Board  through  its  entrepreneurship  framework  continue  to  offer  training  on  areas  such  as 
<br/>entrepreneurship, business continuity, basic cooperative and social leadership training in province 
<br/>around  the  country.  The  board  has  also  embarked  in  the  developing  of  the  resource  owners 
<br/>entrepreneurship  framework  on  that  will  better  connect  resource  owners  from  productions  to  the 
<br/>market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strategic alliance is being encouraged under the framework to ensure Product Development 
<br/></span><span>meets the expectations of the market  and greater return flow back to the resource owners to help 
<br/></span><span>improve their wellbeing. Despite the restrictions, the team was able to train 100 community members 
<br/>representative from Viti Levu and Vanua  Levu. The team will continue to deliver this training to 
<br/>assist iTaukei and Rotumans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourth, increasing on revenue and exploring other opportunities for investing. All investment 
<br/>opportunities are assessed with high level of due diligence to ensure the opportunities are in line with 
<br/>the  investment  policy  of  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund Board.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  team  at  the  Trust  Fund 
<br/>continue to actively seek viable investment opportunities, both locally and overseas for sustainable 
<br/></span><span>future for both iTaukei and Rotuma.  I wish to assure Parliament that the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 
<br/></span><span>has continued to reach out to the most remote places in our beloved country providing awareness, 
<br/>initiating connecting and assisting resource owners in their bid to improve the livelihood of both the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Rotumans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the conclusion of this Annual Report, I must thank the board, management and staff of the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund Board for the programmes and projects carried out during the year 2020. Despite

<div><span>Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  pandemic,  the  team  conducted  their  role  diligently  in  achieving  key  mandated  outlay  and 
<br/>subsequence  results  are  noted  to  this  day.  I  express  my  sincere  gratitude  to  Parliament  for  this 
<br/>opportunity to provide a reply on the tabling of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board Annual Report 2020.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, may I remind each and  every one of us that the 
<br/>Business Committee in its meeting last Friday had agreed that given the amount of reports coming 
<br/>into this august Parliament for this sitting and it being the last sitting,  to have about five reports in a 
<br/>day and if it is possible to allow two speakers from each side before the Right of Reply is given again 
<br/>to the Chairperson of the Committee who is introducing the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it was also decided that the discretion be left with the honourable Speaker to decide 
<br/>on that. So far, I have noticed that the Opposition has given three speakers and the Government has 
<br/>got two. So, I will knuckle down on that one and allow only two from each side so we can cover all 
<br/>five in a day to complete all the reports that are supposed to be coming back from the Committees to 
<br/>Parliament.  I hope each and every one of us will bear with that as time is of the essence here, it is 
<br/>quite important.  Otherwise, we will not finish or we will go late right into the night to complete this. 
<br/>So, for that, the second speaker from the Opposition would be honourable Koroilavesau before I will 
<br/>ask the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica to finish off from the Government side and 
<br/>the Right of Reply given to the mover of the motion.  I hope you will bear with us on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your indulgence, I would like to pass 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my  time to honourable Usamate who is supposed to sum up from our side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this particular Report shows the kind of work 
<br/>that is being done by the iTaukei Trust Fund Board in all things to do with the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>because some 
<br/>of the times we sit in Parliament now and it seems that absolutely nothing was done during all those 
<br/>times. That seems to have been the rhetoric, but you see all the programme that are here, the </span><span>i Sauvaki 
<br/>ni Vanua </span><span>programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to see that the honourable Minister has identified that seven provinces have carried 
<br/>out this successfully, though I would like to know what successful means because when you evaluate 
<br/>the training programme, there are various levels at which it is done.  I am glad to see also that the 
<br/>appointment of the Fund Manager, that is progressing quite well. There are a number of things, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in my five minutes.  One of the concerns that I have, I notice that the iTaukei Trust 
<br/>Fund now has a new programme called “</span><span>Na</span><span> </span><span>Solesau”</span><span>.  I am not too sure whether it was in place in 
<br/></span><span>2020 but I think this is a critical programme for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of young </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> cannot speak the language.  They speak in English</span><span> </span><span>all the time.  It is 
<br/>very important that the funds that are available in order to preserve our authenticity as </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> our 
<br/>young need to know the language. And if this particular programme,  </span><span>Na Solesau</span><span> that I have been 
<br/>going through.  I have used some of the YouTube, it is very important that this be propagated widely 
<br/>because  in  a  lot  of  families  now,  people  are  not  using  the  language  correctly.  That  is  the  thing  I 
<br/>wanted to highlight, in addition to all the recommendations that are here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, this issue of social leadership training – this is very important. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, the Ministers will now know, when you go for </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions, some of our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people have 
<br/>lost that ability to try and do things for themselves, I think in a lot of sense, they ask for everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember once I commissioned a water project, at the end of the project they said, “Thank 
<br/>you Minister but can you replace the small taps, the $5 taps?” So, hopefully in this social leadership 
<br/>training, as the honourable Minister said, what he said, I think I should also tell you that. They have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1979 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lost that capacity to be able to pull people together so they can do things for their own benefit and 
<br/>then Government can come in and help them. I think this is very important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this social leadership training, a lot of our traditional leadership seem to have lost it. They 
<br/>seem to have lost that capacity to build and bring people together. I think this is very important for 
<br/>us because at the end of the day, when you say, if there is a good organisation, there is a good village, 
<br/>there is a good </span><span>yasana</span><span>, it is because the leadership that is there. So, the social leadership training, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker is something that is very important.  One good development that I have seen from the 
<br/>Trust Fund has been the development of the </span><span>Tabua</span><span> Shop. It is providing a big relief to people that 
<br/>need </span><span>tabua</span><span>, and I hope that the Ministry can continue to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want the Trust Fund to do well, it  is very important they 
<br/>always have fit for purpose directors because I notice in Government now, they seem to be allocating 
<br/>directorships according to provincial basis. It is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put the right 
<br/>people in charge of all these organisations. Put fit for purpose directors who know what to do, know 
<br/>what to focus on and do not allocate them on the basis of provinces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It brings me to the point honourable Members, what are we addressing here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- leadership or traditional leadership? That is for you to decide. Quite different.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the Review 
<br/>Report for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Trust Fund Board Annual Report. As part of my contribution, I just thought I 
<br/>would very quickly address some of the utterances by honourable Usamate.  Firstly, this morning, he 
<br/>mentioned that GCC is not being required because the Constitution covered it.  Sometimes I wonder 
<br/>whether the other side was actually tone-deaf. If you ask every single chief in Fiji, Sir, they will tell 
<br/>you,  they  wanted  the  GCC  back;  every  single  chief  in  Fiji  that  I  have  spoken  to.  I  am  not  sure, 
<br/>sometimes the other side seem to be in another planet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, he talked about some of the discussions that the current GCC being illegal. Let us 
<br/>all accept, the GCC has never required a piece of legislation to be legal. We are formalising it as a 
<br/>structure within Government eventually Mr. Speaker, they know that, but to stand here and say that 
<br/>the GCC is illegal, is incorrect. He should withdraw that statement, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  one  I  wanted  to  quickly  address,  Mr.  Speaker,  was,  he  talked  about  concern  for 
<br/>language. What hypocrisy, Mr. Speaker! He said, “we are concerned about the people losing their 
<br/>language - the youth.” They were the cause of it, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- In this Chamber, Sir, what language was spoken to until we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>got to Parliament? What language?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What language are you speaking? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Only one language! The </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>language was not spoken 
<br/></span><span>here, nor the Hindi language. Shame on you guys! Absolute shame! So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my small 
<br/></span><span>contribution in that regard is, to the people of Fiji, we have said that we were going to make changes 
<br/>in this country for the new Fiji and it is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Absolute shame!

<div><span>Sir, with confining the rest of my contribution, I would just like to very quickly talk about the 
<br/>iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Trust  Fund  and  particularly  some  of  the  great  programmes  it  is  undertaking,  and  the 
<br/>commitment from my Ministry particularly to continue working with them in terms of the area of 
<br/>promoting entrepreneurial spirit to communities and the </span><span>vanua.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both the Ministry for Trade and the iTaukei Trust Fund Board have been working very closely 
<br/>in this regard.  Through the MSME Fiji Unit and the Department of Co-operative Business, we are 
<br/>conducting business training across Fiji and I have to say that there is a heightened level of interest 
<br/>in the formation of co-operatives across our great land.  That is something that we are really pushing 
<br/>hard in terms of trying to empower everyone in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Some of the examples as one was mentioned in the Report 
<br/>was the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Matailobau Women’s Co-operative which is based in Nairukuruku, Naitasiri.  The 
<br/>training there was aimed at entrepreneurial skills with the women </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Matailobau in Naitasiri 
<br/>and  with  these  newfound  skills,  they  have  been  able  to  open  their  business  hub  which  houses  a 
<br/>grocery store, a hair salon, a sewing room and an area for screen printing.  Services that used to be 
<br/>very difficult for the women of Matailobau to access, they could only access in urban areas are now 
<br/>accessible in Matailobau.  These types of platforms are now available and will also enable artistic 
<br/>and innovative thinkers in Matailobau to continue to flourish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that the iTaukei Trust Fund Board too has also been an advocate for 
<br/>s</span><span>olesolevaki </span><span>or the idea of co-operation which we are well aware of.  The co-operative model, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, as we all know sits well within that particular </span><span>solesolevaki </span><span>model and my Ministry will 
<br/>continue to support the iTaukei Trust Fund Board and also the Ministry for iTaukei Affairs in order 
<br/>to ensure that we encourage this training across the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I  will now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members who contributed to the motion before Parliament.  I have no further comments, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
