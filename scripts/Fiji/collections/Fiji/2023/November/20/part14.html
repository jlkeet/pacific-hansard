<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overplanted Pine</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the  honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen in the public gallery and those who are viewing 
<br/>the livestream from the comfort of their homes; good morning, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span> and </span><span>namaste</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a Statement on the Coalition Government’s stance through the 
<br/>Ministry of Forestry on the issue of overplanted pine areas which were transferred to Fiji Pine Corporation 
<br/>Limited and later Fiji Pine Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the onset, I wish to simply define overplanted pine areas. These are areas 
<br/>that are planted by the Company outside of its lease boundary. Sir, please, allow me to provide a bit of 
<br/>background to enable us to fully appreciate the position of the Ministry on this important subject matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine Limited is a public company incorporated in 1990 as part of the corporatisation of the 
<br/>Fiji Pine Commission to take over its assets, liabilities and obligations effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 1991. 
<br/>The shareholders of the Company are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Government which holds 99.8 percent shares; and    
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Pine Trust which holds the remaining shares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Pine Trust which owns only 0.2 percent or 100,000 shares represent the pine landowners 
<br/>and  was  established  under  the  Fiji  Pine  Act  1990  as  part  of  the  corporatisation  of  the  Fiji  Pine 
<br/>Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited has a total lease of 83,000 hectares of which 35,000 is currently 
<br/>stocked. Out of the total stocked areas of 35,000 hectares, 28,000 hectares is established in Viti Levu and 
<br/>7,000 hectares in Vanua Levu.  These areas are not surveyed and boundaries during the time of planting 
<br/>were determined based on certain characteristics of the area, for example, creeks, ridges, trees, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited commenced pine harvesting in 1987, at a time when the 
<br/>Fiji Pine Commission was managing the pine plantations.  One of the main issues that arose during 
<br/>harvesting was the ownership of overplanted pines. The Fiji Pine Commission and iTaukei Lands 
<br/>Trust Board (ITLTB) resolved that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Overplanted areas be given to landowners since the area was not leased as confirmed by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTLTB; and   
<br/>for the case of double leasing, revenue generated from the harvesting of pine was to be 
<br/></span><span>equally  shared  between  the  Fiji Pine Commission and the other party leasing  the  same 
<br/></span><span>portion of land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2009, harvesting of the Vanua Levu resources commenced on a large 
<br/>scale  after  the  construction  of  the  Tropik  Woods  Products  Limited.    When  the  harvesting 
<br/>commenced, the company defaulted on its decision regarding overplanting which was implemented 
<br/>since 1987.  Despite the ITLTB confirmation that the areas were overplanted, Fiji Pine Limited  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>1944 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continued harvesting overplanted areas, thus in the process breached its lease conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, so when the Coalition Government came into power, I announced in February 
<br/>2023 that overplanted areas will be harvested by landowners and Fiji Pine Limited will be given first 
<br/>Preference to negotiate with the pine landowners on the purchasing of overplanted pine. This decision 
<br/>is based on the recognition of pine landowners as the most important stakeholders in the process. 
<br/>Once iTLTB, who is the custodian of all Native land, confirms that the subject area is not leased and 
<br/>overplanted, it is only right that the area be released to the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is to be noted also that the landowners were unable to utilise those land 
<br/>for their farming and livelihoods due to the overplanted pine for which they neither received land 
<br/>lease or compensation of any sort.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since that landmark decision, a total of six overplanted areas that have been released to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners and harvested include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Lomate - Tiliva, Bua;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Naicobo -  Nawailevu;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Nakakoso - Bua;  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Raracolo - Naruwai; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Cake - Bua; and 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Naberei in Macuata. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total revenue generated from harvesting this overplanted area amounted to $560,000 and has 
<br/>been used by landowners for purchasing vehicles, tractors, outboard motors, building new houses, 
<br/>community  halls  (evacuation  centres),  maintenance  of  current  houses,  investment  into  financial 
<br/>institutions and tertiary education for landowning unit members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits to the landowners who have harvested their overplanted areas 
<br/>included  not  only  additional  revenue  streams  for  their  livelihood,  but  their  harvested  areas  were 
<br/>replanted with pine and other native high value trees that can fetch greater returns in future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  mention  some  of  the  specific  benefits  incurred  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accrued: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Two vehicles were purchased and a house for </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Cake-Colo is in progress; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Nakakoso invested $100,000 into the Unit Trust and also purchased a vehicle; 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali </span><span>Rara was able to pay $15,000 for school fees for Fiji School of Medicine students 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and also received $40,000 for the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span>  Rara  was  able  to  invest  in  brushcutters  and  chainsaw  to  clear  their  land  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agricultural purpose and cash for village commitments; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Cake invested in a fibreglass boat, as well as timber for building boats, to name a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>few. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is envisaged that after the harvesting of the first crop in Vanua Levu, all 
<br/></span><span>overplanted areas will be utilised, hence Fiji Pine Limited will not be facing similar issues again in 
<br/></span><span>the harvesting of subsequent crops, similar to Viti Levu, thus fostering better relations between FPL 
<br/>and landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, these overplanted areas have been a contentious issue for decades, but this 
<br/>Government  intends  to  address  such  issues  and  ensure  that  our  people  are  treated  fairly  and 
<br/>compensated equitably.  For the past 16 years, the previous Administration was unable to resolve this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue.   It  allowed this action to  continue, and  Fiji  Pine Limited took  advantage of this, depriving 
<br/>landowners.  It was advised that the issue was even brought to Parliament, but no action was taken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This action shall be no more, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I repeat - no more, enough is enough!  The 
<br/>Fiji Pine Limited, together with Government as majority shareholder, needs to be seen as a company 
<br/>to drive Government’s mandate and the Coalition Government’s mandate is to ensure that a company 
<br/>that thrives due to landowners treats their landowners in a fair manner, with empathy and compassion 
<br/>to the communities, who depend on their forests for survival. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited has undertaken several developments in the past for the 
<br/>landowners and I hope that in the case of overplanted areas, they have the foresight and goodwill to 
<br/>continue  engaging  with  these  landowners  effectively  and  meaningfully,  and  not  be  the  cause  of 
<br/>conflict which can be detrimental to a company which boasts compliance to the FSC standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Forestry, is addressing this issue of good 
<br/>governance with the Fiji Pine Board, so as to ensure that fairness and equity is addressed at all levels 
<br/>and with all stakeholders, especially, resource owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to ensure that maximum benefits are received by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resource owners in the course of implementing our projects and programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to deliver this Statement.  May God bless 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. “No More”, thank you honourable Minister. I now call 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe not “No More” but we expect more from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  Statement.  I  wish  to  pay  tribute  to  the  late  Vice-
<br/>Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific, Professor Rajesh Chandra.  We are, indeed, sad to 
<br/>hear of his passing.  May I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he is a proud son of Fiji, who has served the 
<br/>nation and the region proudly as a renowned academic and administrator, and he has left behind a 
<br/></span><span>legacy, Sir, not only in Fiji but for the region as well.  We remember him and, of course, we express 
<br/></span><span>our condolence as well to his family during these difficult times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the Ministerial Statement.  Again, as I have stated, maybe 
<br/>we expect more from the current Government, given the so many initiatives and improvements that 
<br/>we have made in Fiji Pine Limited over the last few years. Everyone in this august Parliament knows 
<br/>the history of Fiji Pine Limited and what they have been going through and it took good leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  It  took  that  visionary  leadership,  that  integrity,  particularly  by 
<br/>Government, and also getting the right people to run Fiji Pine Limited, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fit for 
<br/>purpose Board of Directors, following the performance of the Board very closely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overplanting is undeniable.  I say that again, ‘overplanting is undeniable’, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because of the technology available back then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do about it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the methodology to address this to benefit 
<br/>both, the landowners and Fiji Pine Group, is very important.  Pine plantations were established more 
<br/>than 60 years ago. The technology to clearly demarcate boundaries was not existent in Fiji at the time 
<br/>then  and,  of  course,  we  had  these  issues  as  well  with  mahogany.    The  availability  of  advanced 
<br/>technology in surveying is now available and it is helpful in clearly demarcating boundaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government took on a very practical and pragmatic approach 
<br/>when it came to addressing overplanted pine.  It is not that we did not do anything, let the honourable 
<br/>Minister be reminded that we took the initiative as well to resolve this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we gave the Fiji Pine Group the first right of refusal.  The key reason is 
<br/>because the resources used to plant the pine were public or taxpayers’ funds.  Fiji Pine Limited then 
<br/>worked with the landowners to find an amicable solution which includes ensuring that the returns to 
<br/>the landowners are better than what the private contractors offered.  And may I remind the honourable 
<br/>Minister  that  he  needs  to  be  careful  on  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  I  know  for  a  fact  that 
<br/>landowners were exploited when it comes to harvesting of their resources, particularly on pine in 
<br/>Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited offered the best returns to the landowners, at least, during 
<br/>our time.  It used to be operating in the red, all the decades prior to the Bainimarama and FijiFirst 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That changed when the Bainimarama Government came in and 
<br/>ensured  that  the  Company  was  not  only  operating  profitably,  but  importantly  that  it  was  giving 
<br/>greater  returns  to  the  landowners.  Apart  from  the  lease  money  and  stumpages,  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government, for the first time in the Fiji Pine industry’s history, gave lease security bonus payments 
<br/>from 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- These lease security bonus payments continue to this day and has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amounted to over $30 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many other benefits can be given to the resource owners such as employment opportunities, 
<br/>education assistance, socio-economic support for community and sports projects. These are the kinds 
<br/>of guarantees that Fiji Pine Limited could give to landowners of lands considered to be overplanted 
<br/>if they allowed Fiji Pine Limited to extend its lease formally to include the overplanted areas or to 
<br/>harvest the overplanted pines and give high returns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us also be considerate of environmental factors.  This is 
<br/>very, very critical, particularly, in this age of climate consciousness.  Fiji Pine Limited has achieved 
<br/></span><span>forest certification which includes everything that will make the industry sustainable from economic, 
<br/></span><span>social and environmental perspectives.  Private contractors may not fully understand the minimum 
<br/>environmental standards required during harvesting to minimise the impact on the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of replanting.  That is one of the key questions that I also 
<br/>wish  to  raise  with  the  Ministry  through  the  Minister.  Fiji  is  over-reliant  now  on  plantations, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1947 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly on mahogany and pine.  So, in terms of sustainability in the long term, how are we going 
<br/>to address the replanting issue?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a key question that we need to ask.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  crucial,  and  I  beg  Government  to  consider  the  issue  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overplanting pine holistically and not from a short-sighted and short-term perspective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn the House for tea.  But before doing so, I would like the 
<br/>acknowledge  those  sitting  in  the  gallery  in  today’s  sitting.  I  have  noticed  the  former  Acting 
<br/>Commissioner of Police sitting there, together with Mr. Niko Raikuna from Sydney, who actually 
<br/>hails from Rewa. He has been in Sydney for quite some time, and he is sitting here.  Thank you very 
<br/>much for spending some time with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now adjourn Parliament for tea, and we will resume when the bell is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.33 a.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call upon the Minister for iTaukei Affairs and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Culture, Heritage and Arts, to deliver his Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Great Council of Chiefs Progress Update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  rise to deliver my  Statement  on the Great  Council of Chiefs’ progress 
<br/>update.  Standing before you in this august Parliament today, I am reminded of our solemn duty to 
<br/>steer the governance of our people with wisdom, foresight, and a deep respect for our tradition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) has, for generations, not only been a cornerstone of the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> governance, but a beacon of hope, stability and custodianship over our cherished customs 
<br/>and way of life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  inception  of  the  GCC  in  1875  marked  the  beginning  of  the  governance 
<br/>model.  It uniquely blended traditional leadership with the demands of an evolving Fiji.  Yet, recently, 
<br/>we have witnessed a sad absence in the stewardship of the GCC.    This lapse has had wide-ranging 
<br/>implications through our nation and across all our communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the absence of this guiding institution has been felt in every village meeting, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>every provincial gathering and every national discourse on </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, governance, in its truest form, is about continuity. The seamless integration of 
<br/>the past with the present, to forging a future that is respectful of its roots, yet adaptive to changes that 
<br/>improve all communities. Governance is not just about structures and laws, it is about the spirit in 
<br/>which they are enacted and enforced. It is about the confidence they instil in the people they serve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  for this  reason that  the Coalition Government promised to  restore the  GCC.  After 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coming into Office, Cabinet endorsed the review of the GCC in March this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to this Cabinet decision, my Ministry appointed a seven-member 
<br/>Review Team after an open competitive process, to review the GCC.  Their work begun in April and 
<br/></span><span>concluded in July.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The GCC Review Team embarked on an extensive journey of consultations, dialogue and 
<br/>discovery,  reaching  every  Province  within  our  island  nation.    They  sought  the  wisdom  of  local 
<br/>communities, engaging in deep consultations with Fijians from all walks of life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a profound commitment to inclusivity.  The Team ensured that the 
<br/>voices of Fijians, from the bustling markets of towns and cities to the villages of our islands, was 
<br/>heard.  Their mission was to weave together the diverse array of opinions into a coherent vision for 
<br/></span><span>the future of the GCC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Team listened with respect to the hopes and concerns of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.  It highly 
<br/>recognised that each Province holds a unique place in our cultural space.  Other ethnic groups also 
<br/>gave their opinion.  This was to ensure that they too had a part to play in this important process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Embracing all groups of Fijians ensured that the process was all-encompassing.  Through this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comprehensive  engagement,  the  Review  Team  demonstrated  an  unwavering  dedication  to  this 
<br/>process.  It was not only consultative, but also culturally vibrant and deeply democratic.  It is thorough 
<br/>this  exercise  of  nationwide  engagement  that  underscored  the  unity  and  shared  purpose  of  their 
<br/>mission towards a revitalised governance structure of the GCC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  comprehensive  report  by  the  Review  Team  is  a  testament  to  our 
<br/>collective resolve to fill this governance vacuum.  The recommendations of the Review Team are not 
<br/>merely suggestions - they form a strategic framework to guide the revitalisation and modernisation 
<br/>of  indigenous  governance  structures.    The  recommendations  are  also  aligned  with  contemporary 
<br/>societal values and international governance standards.  They also fully safeguard Fijian heritage and 
<br/>the empowering of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities for the generations to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Review Team came up with eight recommendations as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The GCC be independent and politically neutral. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The GCC be re-established as a Statutory Trust under an Act of Parliament. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The iTaukei Trust Fund be moved under the proposed GCC structure and grow its financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>base. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The  GCC  be  proactive  in  advocating,  directing  and  oversight  of  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  interests  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The GCC maintains and strengthens its advisory function in nation building. 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The GCC champions, strongly advocating and sets strategic direction on eight thematical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas, namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>

<br/>allocated to Christian Churches. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)  That an implementation team be established.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  recommendations  were  endorsed  by  members  of  the  GCC  through  the 
<br/>Vakaturaga Conference and the iTaukei Affairs Board. Cabinet has endorsed the recommendations 
<br/>in principle and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs will continue to update Cabinet on the progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, establishing the Statutory Trust for the GCC is a process that requires careful 
<br/>consideration and time.  Meanwhile, as an interim arrangement, the GCC will be reinstated under the 
<br/></span><span>existing iTaukei Affairs Act.  This will be accompanied by necessary revisions to the iTaukei Trust 
<br/></span><span>Fund Act to facilitate this provisional measure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this step will  allow the reinstatement  of the GCC functions while laying the 
<br/>groundwork for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Review Report. The process, 
<br/>if constantly reviewed, should produce a future where governance by the GCC is closely related with 
<br/>excellence, transparency and inclusivity.  The future GCC with its revised statutory arrangements

<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will become a beacon of trust and the champion of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> issues across the eight thematic areas it 
<br/>is designed to develop.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  revised  GCC  is  not  only  the  custodian  of  our  culture  but  a  proactive 
<br/>participant  in  the  modern  governance  landscape.  It  will  fully  uphold  the  principle  of  democracy, 
<br/>deeply honouring the sanctity of our tradition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  we  are  at  a life changing  juncture, where  a determined decision needs to  be 
<br/>made to reinstate the GCC.   It is critical that we now move with determination to amend the iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs  Act  -  to  enshrine  the  GCC  as  an  institution  that  epitomises  the  very  essence  of  good 
<br/>governance for all races in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interim  measure  will  catalyse 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 
<br/>recommendations.  It  will  set  us  on  a  path  of  genuine  and  sustainable  governance  reform.  In 
<br/>implementing this reform, we are committing to a governance model that is reflective of our values, 
<br/>responsive to our needs, and resilient against the tests of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  phased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the GCC must stand as a lighthouse - a beacon of hope, not just for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, 
<br/>but for all Fijians, illuminating the path towards a future rich with promise and unity.  It is important 
<br/>that this revised GCC transcends its historical roots, evolving into a symbol of national pride and 
<br/>collective aspiration for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Its rebirth must foster a deep-seated confidence among all Fijians, assuring every citizen that 
<br/>it will serve as the custodian of tradition while steering the nation towards equitable progress and 
<br/>justice.    Its  role  in  nation-building  must  be  evident,  promoting  social  cohesion  and  championing 
<br/>issues that fully gel with the common aspirations of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the revised GCC can secure its place not only in the annals of history but in the 
<br/>hearts of the people it is meant  to  serve.   It  is  to  be a testament to  the nation’s resilience and its 
<br/>unwavering pursuit of a harmonious and prosperous future for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  conclusion,  I  call  upon  this  Parliament  to  support  the  path  laid  up  by  the 
<br/>review. We need to trust the process. Our collective effort is required to breathe new life into the 
<br/>GCC. We will erase its memory as a relic of the past.  One decision will change it into a living and 
<br/>thriving institution that guides us into a future of promise and prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, allow me to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to every Fijian who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>played a role in our efforts towards the review of the Great Council of Chiefs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  reply  to  the 
<br/>Ministerial Statement. The honourable Minister has explained the rationale behind the work that is 
<br/>being done to revive the disestablished GCC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the issues that he has pointed out here in terms of GCC being the body which looks 
<br/>after everything in relation to </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> I must say at the outset that all of these things are enshrined 
<br/></span><span>in the Constitution.  The Preamble of the Constitution states very specifically that the Constitution 
<br/></span><span>which is the supreme law of this country recognises the </span><span>iTa</span><span>ukei, recognises the ownership of their 
<br/>land, the unique culture which includes our chiefs and our respect for our chiefs, our customs and 
<br/>tradition and our language.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in terms of the protection of things that are to do with </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> they are enshrined in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Constitution and there are other aspects of this Constitution such as, for instance, Section 28 of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1951 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Constitution which talks about land ownership, the sanctity of the ownership of that land. It also talks 
<br/>about Section 30 of the Constitution which allows for the payment of royalty, and it was only under 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government that for the first time that royalty was ever paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am trying to point out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that these things that we are talking about, the GCC 
<br/>and its role and we have a long history of working together, we are being brought up under the annals 
<br/>of the GCC we are very familiar with. However, I am just trying to point out that these things were 
<br/>actually promoted upfront.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  during  our  time  in  Government,  despite  without  the  GCC,  we  brought  about  equal 
<br/>distribution of leases for all the people in this country.  All the time that we had GCC before, there 
<br/>was never equal distribution. We treated every </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> equally. This Government has now overturned 
<br/>that.  They are saying that some </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are more equal than others. We say, all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are equal, 
<br/>they should get equal distribution of leases. That is what I am talking about here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We came up with a concept also of the lease money that is given to children to be kept in trust 
<br/>for their development. I am not too sure what is happening on that particular front. But, Mr. Speaker 
<br/>Sir, one of the things I am a bit worried about, I am not too sure the legality of all that is taking place. 
<br/>We have already had a GCC convened in Bau earlier this year. On what grounds was that a legal 
<br/>undertaking? I have been told that there has been an amendment, there was an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> regulation of 
<br/>May of this year. But I am not too sure on what grounds that regulation  has any substance if the 
<br/>legislation that set this thing up, has been disestablished in the first place. So, if everything that has 
<br/>been done so far is illegal, then all the recommendations coming after this will also be illegal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes.  The honourable Attorney-General is shaking his head, he has 
<br/>been making a lot of decisions that are illegal. He has brought a Bill before Parliament, the Heritage 
<br/>Bill, we found that it was flawed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Government  has  the  right  to  decide  that  it  wants  to  do  to  the  Great 
<br/>Council of Chiefs or not but let me just quote what the honourable Prime Minister has been saying 
<br/>this year, 26</span><span>th</span><span> October, a report from FBC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka states this includes the amendment to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs Act to provide for the re-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If he is now talking about it in October, that means everything that you have done before this 
<br/>is all illegal. He is saying that there is still a need to change the laws.  What is happening, honourable 
<br/>Attorney General? Your advice is wrong! What is happening here?  Everything that you are now 
<br/>doing is illegal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This, I am quoting from the honourable Prime Minister.  The Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister is saying we have to do his administration, everything you have done so far is wrong. You 
<br/></span><span>have got to do something, you have got to do it legally, do it the right way. Stop abusing the laws of 
<br/>this country, stop abusing the people of this country, stop abusing the laws. That, Mr. Speaker, is my 
<br/>reply to this statement. Stop abusing it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Well, you have really ignited some fire in there.
