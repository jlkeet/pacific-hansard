<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT- 
<br/>MINISTRY OF CIVIL SERVICE 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU. R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Parliament debates the ‘Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of 
<br/>Civil Service 2016, 2016–2017, 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Annual Reports’ which 
<br/>was tabled on the 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I beg to second the motion. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU. R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, allow me to pay 
<br/>tribute to one of the long-serving, former civil servant and Diplomat, also a Cabinet Minister in two 
<br/>previous Governments, Mr. Poseci Bune.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in July of this year, and I wish to proceed 
<br/></span><span>directly to reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that the Committee has captured in the 
<br/>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were a few pertinent issues identified by the Committee 
<br/>which include the independence of the Public Service Commission in relation to the establishment 
<br/>of the Ministry of Civil Service. The types of complaints handled by the Business Unit and Customer 
<br/>Care Call Centre within the Ministry, the measures undertaken by the Ministry to reduce its operation 
<br/>costs, financial discrepancies noted in the Ministries Annual Report for the period 2016-2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recruitment issues identified with the Ministry of Civil Service, which were noted in the 
<br/>2017 and 2018 period. The types of certification which had been issued by the Ministry as noted in 
<br/>the 2018 and 2019 period, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, the efforts put in place by the Ministry in terms of 
<br/>contribution to the achievement of SDG 5 – the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of 
<br/>women and SDG 16 – the promotion of peace, justice and strong institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Ministry of Civil Service, 
<br/>and any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will 
<br/>dive  straight  into  the  recommendations  put  forth  by  the  Committee  for  the  consideration  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, and these are: the Committee has recommended that the Ministry of Civil Service provide 
<br/></span><span>a timely submission of its Annual Reports to Parliament for effective and efficient review by the 
<br/>Standing Committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends the Ministry for responding to the issues raised by the Committee 
<br/>which  it  believes  specifies  the  improvements  and  progress  made  and,  likely  to  be  noted  in  the 
<br/>Ministry’s next Annual Report. The Committee recommends that the Ministry continue to build its 
<br/>Human Resource capacity with an area focused on the gap between new incoming civil servants and 
<br/>civil servant retirees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  implements  a  Policy  that  should  bond 
<br/>Graduates  to  the  Civil  Service  to  serve  within  Fiji.  The  Committee  further  recommends  that  the 
<br/>Ministry works with the National Employment Centre to retain experienced staff. The Committee 
<br/>further recommends that the Ministry strengthens the communication, sharing of information  and 
<br/>data across Ministries to uplift Civil Service in all Ministries.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2169 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee further recommends that there be certain trainings to boost 
<br/>performance and upskilling of civil servants. The Committee further recommends that incentives and 
<br/>benefits are provided to civil servants to prevent mass turn-over of staff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee further recommends that the Ministry adopts the Private Sector strategy by 
<br/>working with the Universities to align graduates to various employment needs required by relevant 
<br/>ministries that is attachment programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that there be an overall review of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS) across Government Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I urge honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members to take note of the Committee’s Report and I commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and having the list 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before me provided by the Whips, order of speakers is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Hem Chand; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Penioni Ravunawa; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate 
<br/>on  the  Review  Report  of  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service.    At  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Civil Service is a critical ministry.  This Ministry was established in 2016 to 
<br/>support  government  ministries  in  carrying  out  their  constitutional  functions  while  maintaining  its 
<br/>central co-ordination of key areas to ensure consistencies across the Civil Service.  The Ministry of 
<br/>Civil Service did very well during the period under review.  I have noted from the Report some key 
<br/>highlights and achievements of the Ministry during the period under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the significant  highlights  is  that the Ministry made significant  strides in  its efforts 
<br/>towards  gender  equality  by  achieving  59  percent  of  female  representation  through  OMRS.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, under OMRS it is open and transparent  and designed to  attract people from diverse 
<br/></span><span>experiences and professional abilities.  Thanks to FijiFirst Government for initiating and introducing 
<br/></span><span>OMRS.  The recent selection and appointment of advisory councillors was not based on merit.  Talks 
<br/>are  that  some  people  got  selected  without  applying.    How  was  the  selection  and  appointment  of 
<br/>advisory councillors done and who did the selection?  This is the question people are asking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are not civil servants, get that right … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Due  to  time  constraints,  I  will  be  focusing  on  two  of  the 
<br/>recommendations made by the Committee.  I will focus on incentives and benefits to be provided to 
<br/>civil servants to prevent mass turnover of staff.  Looking at the mass turnover of Civil Service this 
<br/>year,  I suggest  that certain  incentives and benefits  are provided to  civil  servants  without delay to 
<br/>address the brain and skills drain to overseas employment by members of the Civil Service.   The 
<br/>members of the Civil Service are asking for pay increase and justification of the pay increase by civil 
<br/>servants is based on sky-rocketing price increases in consumer goods as well as for services.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cost  of basic essential food items  has increased, VAT has increased  since 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 
<br/>2023 and this has been putting pressure on civil servants.  I urge Government to prioritise the civil 
<br/>servants’ salary review and increase civil servants’ pay as promised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now I will focus on the second recommendation that the Ministry adopts 
<br/>the  private  sector’s  strategy  by  working  with  the  universities  to  align  graduates  to  various 
<br/>employment needs.  Yesterday, I raised a question on market employability survey, and I was caught 
<br/>by surprise when honourable Minister for Education informed Parliament that Government grant was 
<br/>allocated  to  Pacific  Polytechnic  College  without  carrying  out  market  employability  survey.    We 
<br/>should remember that this is taxpayers’ money and it should be used wisely and not willy nilly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  questionable  and  raise  serious  concerns.  
<br/>Taxpayers are demanding answers on why and how grant was allocated to Pacific Polytech without 
<br/>carrying out market employability survey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Committee’s Report and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support the motion before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also support the motion before the House and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commend the Standing Committee Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Reports that are being reported on by the Committee are very clear and 
<br/>what they have laid out and the Report of the Committee after review of those Annual Reports are 
<br/>also very clear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember the end of 1966 when Fiji was gearing towards Independence.  
<br/>There was a Government Training Centre and it was receiving sixth formers from schools to prepare 
<br/>them for employment in the Civil Service while Fiji was moving away from the colonial service to 
<br/>our own preparing for independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We did a very interesting two weeks and then we were ready to be posted out as Assistant 
<br/>DOs and so forth. I was still waiting for mine when I got a call from camp to come and join the Army 
<br/></span><span>and that was the end of my Civil Service.  Earlier on I had called the Permanent Secretaries to come 
<br/></span><span>for a workshop and I could see that they are very well qualified men and women, all highly motivated 
<br/>to work and I find that the recommendations are very easy to implement and we promised to do that.  
<br/>I am sure we can continue to develop great servants of the people in our Civil Service at the moment, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  Minister  responsible  for  the  Public  Service,  I  take  on  board  all  the 
<br/>recommendations  and the Permanent Secretary for the Public Service and I have already put into 
<br/>place a programme to continue the training of particularly the senior and it go down to the Deputy 
<br/>Secretaries and so forth to try and adapt them and their work ethics and particularly teamwork across 
<br/>all Ministries so that they know what they are there for and they know the population that they are 
<br/>serving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the civil servants for the work they are doing.  They have very difficult working 
<br/>conditions and we also understand the fluidity in the labour market at the moment.  People are so 
<br/>marketable, they are so well qualified and whoever comes up with a better deal they will probably 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2171 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move to.  That does not mean that they are not loyal, they are loyal to their performance, they would 
<br/>like to perform to the best of their ability where the Government can afford what they demand for 
<br/>their services or not it is another matter.  We know there are some very highly qualified people there, 
<br/>who would easily get better paid job outside the Civil Service. When we cannot compete, we cannot 
<br/>compete and I thank the Committee for their work and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  be  given  this  opportunity  to 
<br/>speak on the motion for debate this afternoon.  In fact, I would like to speak on two recommendations 
<br/>outlined by the Committee, consolidated in their review report for the year 2016-2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service Reform came about during this time where the effort was 
<br/>put into excellence in the services of the civil servant across all Ministries and Departments.  It is 
<br/>during this time, I remember honourable Agni Deo Singh and I were also members of the Employers 
<br/>Representatives in the negotiation that led up to a Job Evaluation Exercise that was effective in 2018, 
<br/>which saw an increase in salaries a lot for doctors, teachers and principals for schools and across the 
<br/>Civil Service.   I thank the Committee for the recommendation to  review the OMRS, as there are 
<br/>certain parts of the OMRS system that need to be improved in terms of the performance guideline 
<br/></span><span>and the rewards that are needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report provided a comprehensive analysis of the three year-report with 
<br/>the Committee recommendations.  Specifically, I will be focusing on Recommendation No. 8 and 
<br/>Recommendation No. 10.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 8 put forth by the Committee for the Ministry of Civil Service is to 
<br/>develop  and  implement  incentives  and  tangible  benefit  for  staffs  across  the  Civil  Service.    The 
<br/>objective of this recommendation is to address the issues of massive staff turnover, as mentioned by 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister, within the Civil Service.  It recognises the importance of providing 
<br/>an attractive incentive to employees, which can contribute significantly to staff retention and overall 
<br/>productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of this recommendation, it is crucial for the Ministry of Civil Service to carefully 
<br/>evaluate the existing incentive and the benefit structure and identify areas that can be improved in 
<br/>the process.  By introducing effective and competitive incentive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry can 
<br/>incentivise staff and address the problem of high staff turnover, thus, strengthen its workforce.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on to Recommendation No. 10, the Committee emphasised the need for an overall 
<br/></span><span>review of the OMRS.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, OMRS is defined as a system of appointing employees based 
<br/></span><span>on  their  ability  to  do  the  job  and  assess  against  the  objective  selection  criteria  which  do  not 
<br/>discriminate or give preference to any group or individual.  This recommendation aims to ensure the 
<br/>transparency and fairness in the recruitment process across the Civil Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  implement  this  recommendation,  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  should  undertake  a 
<br/>comprehensive  review  of  the  OMRS  system,  as  I  have  mentioned.    This  review  should  entail  an 
<br/>examination of the existing policy and the regulation pertaining to recruitment, retirement and other 
<br/>relevant factors.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, by providing clarity, the Ministry can bring greater transparency 
<br/>and confidence in the recruitment process, promotion and also promoting a fair and equitable working 
<br/>environment for our Civil Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I extend my gratitude to the Standing Committee of Justice, 
<br/>Law and Human Rights for their diligence scrutiny and evaluation of the Ministry of Civil Service 
<br/>Annual Report, 2016 to 2019.  Their effort has enabled us to commend the deliberation in Parliament 
<br/>today.  I would like to  also  express  my  utmost  support  to  the executives of the Ministry of Civil 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Service and its dedicated staff in embracing and implementing the 10-key recommendations put forth 
<br/>by the Committee.  These recommendations hold significant potential in fortifying the Civil Service 
<br/>and advancing its effectiveness.  I fully support the recommendations put forward by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief.  I want to thank the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  for  pointing  out  the  changes  that  the  Government  has  already  made.  
<br/>When we came into Government, we had promised that we will raise the retirement age from 55 
<br/>years to 60 years.  We have done that and it was very ill-conceived against the international thinking, 
<br/>where most countries were actually raising retirement age, we did the opposite, and we can see when 
<br/>those who were responsible for doing that, never thought about situations like these where the global 
<br/>labour market will change as a result of post-COVID. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2022,  we  lost  the  largest  number  of  people,  particularly  from  the  formal  sector  because 
<br/>countries like Australia and New Zealand provided avenues for work visa where people could go on 
<br/>student visa and work 40 hours.  There was this huge exodus of people from, not only the civil servants, 
<br/>but the formal sector in Fiji as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision by the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of raising the retirement age to 60 and moving 
<br/></span><span>away from contractual employment has actually provided much better incentives and motivation for our 
<br/>civil servants to do better. The recommendations that are there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to go into 
<br/>the details, but the Ministry is working on all of them, in particular, addressing issues of high rates of 
<br/>attrition.   For example, the Ministry is now looking at graduate internship, making sure that we hire 
<br/>people  from universities  who  are coming  out as  new graduates so that they go through  a  process  of 
<br/>training in a workplace, attachments and then be absorbed within the Civil Service as and when needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The use of Section 127(8) of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked about that.  It is 
<br/>in the Constitution, there is nothing we can do about it, but this Government moved the Ministry of Public 
<br/>Service under the Prime Minister, under whom the Public Service Commission is also based.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Public  Service  Commission,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  only  responsible  for  appointing  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries, but under the Constitution, the Permanent Secretaries has absolute power but with 
<br/>the agreement of the Ministers. What was happening in the past, the Ministers were actually making 
<br/>appointments and it happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir in many cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are lying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In many cases, I tell you how it was happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  Enough of your lies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You had Committees, ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We do not work with liars.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...the Constitution, Mr. Speaker,  is very clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Too much lies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Permanent Secretary will hire, fire with the agreement of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister, every Minister, every appointment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Point of Order.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 74. I would request 
<br/>the honourable Minister to bring proof about appointments being made that were made by Ministers and 
<br/>not according to the processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.B.C. PRASAD.- Let me just read this for the honourable Leader of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They do not want to listen to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not 
<br/>want to listen to the truth.   Section 127(8) of the Constitution states, “The Permanent Secretary of each 
<br/>Ministry with the agreement of the Minister responsible for the Ministry has the authority to determine 
<br/>all matters pertaining to the employment.”  The OMRS was a system, where the Committee will meet, 
<br/>make the recommendation, the final …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Point of Order.  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have raised my Point of 
<br/>Order  and  I  demand  that  the  honourable  Minister  bring  proof  to  this  august  Parliament  about  the 
<br/>allegations that he had made, and I would kindly request a ruling on my Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have not made a ruling yet, because his still on the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>made a Point of Order and you have listened to it, but let me just explain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The OMRS, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministers are still signing-off 
<br/>the appointments, so you have a process but the final decision of an appointment through that  process 
<br/>rests with the Minister, he does not understand that.  That is what I mean when I say, the final agreement 
<br/>of the appointment is made by the Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- You are lying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If the Minister does not sign it, the appointment cannot be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done. That is what was happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Enough of your lies. How can we trust this government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Now, the Public Service Commission, despite … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …  what  is  in  the  Constitution,  the    practise  that  this 
<br/>Government has adopted, we have empowered the Public Service Commission, we have given the 
<br/>appropriate budget and the Public Service Commission will review the OMRS. We have allocated 
<br/>$126,000 in the budget for that review so that there is no political interference in the appointment of 
<br/>the Civil Service.

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order ! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- You are lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You are lying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It hurts. The truth hurts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You heard what they are saying.  This is the fact, this is what 
<br/>has happened. I want to ask the honourable Leader of the Opposition, was he not signing the final 
<br/>appointments for his Ministry?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We concur. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I do not make the appointments, I endorse the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  Constitution  says,  “with  the  agreement”  and  if  the 
<br/></span><span>Minister chooses not to, that appointment cannot be done. It is simple, simple language. They cannot 
<br/></span><span>understand this simple language and he is demanding information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One final point, Mr. Speaker, the honourable … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. Absolute hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … Hem Chand said advisory councillors, he does not know, 
<br/>he was a civil servant that advisory councillors are not civil servants. They are community driven 
<br/>and they were the biggest abusers of the appointment process of the advisory councillors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You are making more money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  It actually hurts them, they cannot take it because this is a 
<br/>government which is changing the processes, making it more transparent and accountable. And the 
<br/>civil servants Mr. Speaker, are happy, they are more motivated and they  are coming here and not 
<br/>admitting that what they did in terms of retirement age, in terms of contractual employment destroyed 
<br/>the motivation, the incentive, the work environment within the Civil Service. This Government has 
<br/>restored that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have before me two complaints that were lodged 
<br/>in this august Parliament. One by honourable Sachida Nand, and the other one by honourable Prof. 
<br/>Biman Prasad as well, similar to what has been raised in a Point of Order here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue about the Point of Order raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition is on 
<br/>the comment that was made by the Deputy Prime Minister, but I have allowed time for him to explain 
<br/>the  reason  why  he  said  what  he  said.  Now  he  is  backing  it  up  with  the  OMRS  and  what  the 
<br/>Constitution says, so I will be delivering my two judgements on the two cases now on Friday. So, I 
<br/>will be given enough time for us to look over the </span><span>Hansard Reports</span><span> because we are trying to be very 
<br/>specific here, at the same time we have to allow the process for him to explain himself.  So that will 
<br/>come on Friday before we adjourn.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments, just 
<br/>a little two cent contribution. I am very thankful that the honourable Minister responsible for Civil 
<br/>Service  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  given  confidence  in  this  Parliament  that  all  the

<div><span>On  that  note,  this  was  a  bipartisan  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  am  thankful  that  the 
<br/>Opposition  were  praising  the  OMRS  and  I  am  thankful  to  honourable  Ravunawa,  who  has  also 
<br/>alluded to the point that it needs a review and their recommendation came by way of bipartisan.
