<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Annual  Review  Report  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Fisheries for the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 which was tabled on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  briefly  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  is 
<br/>mandated to  manage and sustain  fishing  activities in  the Fiji  waters to  ensure that Fiji’s fisheries 
<br/>stock  remain

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2163 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  briefly  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  is 
<br/>mandated to  manage and sustain  fishing  activities in  the Fiji  waters to  ensure that Fiji’s fisheries 
<br/>stock remain healthy and this, the Ministry continued to coordinate very well in terms of Fiji’s fishing 
<br/>and  aquaculture  programmes  to  ensure  food  security  and  also  to  facilitate  growth  of  commercial 
<br/>activity that helps grow the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report Mr. Speaker, Sir, highlights the Ministry’s achievements in terms of aquaculture, 
<br/>research and development, inshore fisheries and of course offshore fisheries as well.  Perhaps, we 
<br/>will just focus on the recommendations on aquaculture, particularly on the need for better equipment, 
<br/>the expertise and the advancement of facilities and the supply of fry and feed as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation is for the Ministry to ensure that there is a marked improvement 
<br/>in  the  percentage  of  farmers  that  graduate  from  subsistence  to  semi-commercial  and  commercial 
<br/>farming given the interests in aquaculture in our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On inshore fisheries: two recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Ensure the assessment and management of fisheries stock; and 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Arrange  financial  assistance  to  fishermen,  upgrade  physical  resources  such  as  service 
<br/>centres,  fence  and  strengthen  human  resources,  and  of  course  the  Ministry  to  ensure 
<br/>expansion of inshore farming of oysters, seaweeds, pearl, </span><span>bech-de-mer,</span><span> clams, salt water 
<br/>prawns and mud crabs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On offshore fisheries: two key recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee recommends the review of the policies, Acts and regulations that govern 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fisheries sector to ensure that they are relevant and up to date; and of course 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry to  prioritise the training  and  recruitment of qualified locals and crew  and 
<br/>collaborate with the fishing industry in terms of the acquisition of modern fishing vessels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  recommendation  on  Conservation  which  is  very  critical  as  well  because  of 
<br/>sustainability.  There is a need to ensure that there is proper collaboration with stakeholders and that 
<br/>there is consensus on the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and this is respected by 
<br/>community at large after the MPA has been established. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Ministry resources, there are three recommendations, and I will not go into it.  
<br/>It is in the Report, Sir, and I recommend that Parliament takes it off these recommendations and we 
<br/>welcome the contribution from the honourable Members, and I put the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  and  for  your 
<br/>information I have a list of speakers with me and the batting would be as follows.  The batting will 
<br/>be led by honourable Joseph Nand, to be the followed by the honourable Minister for Fisheries, then 
<br/>honourable Koroilavesau and rounded off by the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before this  Chamber.  
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  deliberated  on  the  Report  and  resolved  that  the  site  visits  be 
<br/>conducted to the three geographical divisions of Fiji. The Committee undertook a one-day site visit 
<br/>to the Central Division and a further one week visit to the Central, Western and Northern Divisions 
<br/>to verity its findings and gather valuable information from staff at the stations.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee consulted and visited several key stakeholders that were actively involved in 
<br/>the fishing industry and those that were in partnership with the Ministry and the Government as a 
<br/>whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding Offshore Fisheries, the Committee noted some of the challenges 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>faced by them and those challenges are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obtaining a Fisheries Licence 
<br/>This takes far too much time as it involves several different agencies including the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries for the IUU Certificate, the Ministry of Health for the Health Certificate and 
<br/>the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  for  conducting  laboratory  tests.    These  delays  have 
<br/>created substantial losses to the fishing companies and have prolonged the sale of fish to 
<br/>overseas markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clearance from the Customs Department 
<br/>The  process  for  obtaining  clearance  from  the  Customs  Department  to  fish  outside  Fiji 
<br/>waters and as a result fishing companies incur unnecessary cost.  The unavailability of right 
<br/>technology and expertise. There is also a need to purchase new vessels so that they can fish 
<br/>in the deeper high seas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inconsistency in data held by the Ministry of Fisheries and the fishing companies.  This 
<br/>needs to be updated and a proper SOP needs to be formulated so that data is valued and 
<br/>updated data is readily available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  stated  in  the  Report,  the  fishing  companies    also  no  longer  receive 
<br/>assistance through the Tuna Stabilisation Fund. The Committee is concerned with the high level of 
<br/>illegal fishing and lack of monitoring taking place in Fiji.  There is a need to strengthen monitoring 
<br/>and partnership with the public and raise awareness with communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker Sir, in regard to Recommendation 3.1.1, the Ministry should address and 
<br/>nullify the key challenges in aquaculture which include the need for the latest equipment, the right 
<br/>expertise and advancement of facilities, supply of fry and quality feed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  all  the  Members  for  their  contribution  and  look  forward  to  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  and  the  Ministry  to  oversee  and  respond  to  the  recommendations  made  in  a 
<br/>timely  manner.    I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  hardworking  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  in  all 
<br/>Divisions. I support the motion before this Chamber.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a response  to the Consolidated Report 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Natural  Resources for the three-year Ministry of Fisheries Annual 
<br/>Report for the period 2018-2021.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Chairperson 
<br/>and the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for their assessments, 
<br/>findings and recommendations as outlined in the Report. This will assist the Ministry in its planning 
<br/></span><span>and  re-focusing  its  priorities  and  resources  allocation  to  enhance  service  delivery  to  our  diverse 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the Senior Executive Team and Ministry staff for 
<br/>the  timely  submission  of  the  Annual  Report  to  this  august  Parliament.  I  also  acknowledge  my 
<br/>appreciation to the honourable Koroilavesau who was at the forefront in the achievements as outlined  
<br/>in these Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2165 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all 10 recommendations of the Standing Committees are well noted.  My 
<br/>response will be based on what the Ministry is currently doing to progress the recommendations.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For aquaculture, the Ministry is working its level best to address the challenges identified in 
<br/>the  report.  These  are  the  challenges  that  have  accumulated  in  the  past  16  years.    The  Ministry 
<br/>recognised that we cannot grow this sub-sector alone, hence, the move to engage with private sector 
<br/>agencies through Public-Private Partnership (PPP).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the assistance of UNFAO, the Ministry is currently developing its 
<br/>5-year Aquaculture Development Plan, which will be finalised in quarter three.  This plan aims to 
<br/>address  the  aquaculture  challenges such  as commodity  development, high  cost of feed, expertise, 
<br/>hatchery production, resource allocation, etcetera, and will be the pathway for rapid growth for the 
<br/>aquaculture sector.  This development plan is indeed long overdue, and the Coalition Government is 
<br/>here to make it happen.  In the interest of time, allow me to list three key initiatives that are well 
<br/>underway to progress the recommendations under Coastal Inshore Fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  PPP  is  signed  for  mass  production  of  seaweed.    This  adopts  an  integration  model 
<br/>between  fisheries,  forestry  and  will  extend  to  agriculture  as  part  of  the  private  sectors 
<br/>corporate social responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>For  promotion  of  diversification  and  resources  allocation,  we  are  strengthening  the 
<br/>formation  of  fisher  cooperatives  and  clusters  in  partnership  with  other  Government 
<br/>agencies as a means of channelling support and the project to fisherfolks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>We are restoring laws and policies restricting trade of specific inshore commodities that 
<br/>were  imposed  by  the  previous  administration.    Apart  from  the  regulations  not  being 
<br/>consulted,  the  decision not only  affected the  industrial players, but moreso  Fijians who 
<br/>depend on these industries for their basic survival.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next months, we will finalise a few more partnership arrangements 
<br/>with the private sector to assist communities who are in dire need of our support.  Some of these 
<br/>proposals  were  submitted  to  the  previous  government,  though  feasible,  but  were  not  considered.  
<br/>More  update  will  be  provided  in  this  august  Parliament  when  the  engagements  are  sealed  and 
<br/>implementation underway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the recommendation on policies and legislations, I wish to advise that the Ministry will 
<br/>be finalising key policy legislative framework in consultation with the Office of the Solicitor-General 
<br/>before the end of this fiscal year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the fisheries policy and laws were shelved by the previous 
<br/>government for reason only known to them.  My Ministry is in full support of the protection on the 
<br/>development of crews on fishing vessels, their safety and well-being.  The approval of Fiji National 
<br/>Offshore  Crew  Policy  in  the  last  months  attests  to  this  strong  commitment  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government.  The Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are areas designated and managed for the long-
<br/>term conservation of marine resources, ecosystems services and/or cultured heritage.  I agree that the 
<br/>establishment and maintenance of MPAs requires greater collaboration and consultation with key 
<br/>stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MPA subject matter unveils the need to maintain a balance between conservation and 
<br/>production as we have multiple users of our waters.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bottom line is to ensure 
<br/>that  the  communities  continue  to  have  a  source  of  livelihood  and  income  generation  when 
<br/>international commitments are made when the MPAs are established.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me, that people are the most important resources in any 
<br/>one organisation.  Capacity building, training, and staff retention strategies are always part of the 
<br/>Strategic Workforce Plan and Succession planning of the Ministry.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my visit to all fisheries stations in the Central, Westen and Northern Divisions in the last 
<br/>10 months, I can attest to the recommendations provided by the Standing Committee that the stations 
<br/>and quarters have really deteriorated and needed immediate renovations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  2023  to  2024,  I  acknowledge  the  support  from  the  Coalition  Government  for 
<br/>mainstreaming  and  upgrading  of  offices  and  quarters  budget  back  to  the  Ministry’s  budgetary 
<br/>allocation.  In the previous administration, this was placed under Head 50 which was very difficult 
<br/>to access.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity 
<br/>and I also thank the Chairperson and the Committee for the Report before Parliament.  At the outset, 
<br/>I would like to state my support to the motion before Parliament.  What else can I say, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>after the honourable Minister of Fisheries has already alluded to the various developments that he 
<br/></span><span>has developed over the last nine months.  I can only say in the background what the recommendations 
<br/></span><span>that have been stated and maybe  give an overview of what the Ministry had done as reported by the 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  covered  2018-2021.  The  development  on  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Fisheries was greatly challenged by a lot of work that were to be carried out when it was established 
<br/>as a different Ministry (an independent one in 2017).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that time the Ministry of Fisheries was tasked to establish an Inshore Fisheries and at the 
<br/>same time we co-chaired the Ocean Conference in New York with the Government of Sweden and 
<br/>then we attended COP23 in Bonn, Germany. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, I wish to mention the first Permanent Secretary, Commander Sanaila Naqali 
<br/>who was very influential in the establishment as an independent Ministry of Fisheries and also his 
<br/>work in Bangkok with the establishment of the various agencies that were able to assist the Ministry 
<br/>in the years after 2017 and 2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  rebuilding  of  Makogai  as  a  fisheries  station  took  a  lot  of  time  after  </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span>. The whole station was totally wiped out. It cost about $11 million to rebuild, that took a lot 
<br/></span><span>of energy and funds to rebuild and then we had to rebuild Caboni.  It was also totally destroyed by 
<br/></span><span>the same cyclone - </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>. I must thank the Ministry staff for being able to continue the work 
<br/>and at the same time they were carrying out the rebuild of these two Fisheries Stations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  has  alluded  to  the  recommendations  that  had  been  given. 
<br/>Recommendation one under aquaculture, he is saying that there needs to be equipment for feed and 
<br/>also the supply of fry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  machine  at  Naduruloulou,  I  think  that  was  supplied  by  either 
<br/>Taiwan or India. It has been broken down for about five years.  Since the equipment was so old, we 
<br/>could not find the spare parts.  The initiation was basically for the aquaculture farmers to bring in 
<br/>their feed, put it through the machine and then collect the feed and go feed whatever they are breeding 
<br/>- tilapia, shrimp or prawns but, unfortunately, we could not get the parts from overseas because the 
<br/>machine was so old.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2167 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I wanted to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Recommendation 3.2.1 on Inshore 
<br/>fisheries  on  the  management  of  fisheries  stock  in  our  coastal  waters.    This  is  a  huge  challenge 
<br/>challenge. Even though we were assisted by MPI New Zealand, the legislation took a lot of time to 
<br/>develop  so  that  we  are  able  to  monitor  and  make  the  assessment.  So,  basically  the  challenge  for 
<br/>Government now is to make sure that the recommendation that has been given is carried out.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite an extensive but a very expensive exercise also. I hope the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Fisheries  will carry that  forward because this will basically assist  the resource owners within the 
<br/></span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>areas.  That basically covers the area from the shoreline to the outer reef. If this is funded 
<br/>properly and governed with the demarcated areas, for the traditional </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners it will assist 
<br/>them in generating revenue out of their various boundaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure we have been throwing bombs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at each other for long enough and I will be very brief in my contribution today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  I have to  say Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  rising  to  contribute to  the Ministry of  Fisheries 
<br/>Report, it is quite clear that the Ministry of Fisheries has been actually investing a lot into trying to 
<br/>develop the fisheries industry in Fiji. So, my comments will be more forward-looking rather than 
<br/>trying to nit-pick the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with the recommendations made and there was one particular comment in the Report 
<br/>that  caught  my  attention  and  is  probably  where  our  Ministry  would  like  to  focus.  That  was  a 
<br/>comment,  Sir, which said that “the Committee  was  impressed  with  the  research undertaken by J. 
<br/>Hunter Pearls, and they appear to have one of the best research facilities in Fiji”.  I think the key to 
<br/>unlocking the fisheries industry and agriculture is a concerted effort to get commercial agriculture 
<br/>and commercial aquaculture going in our country. That is where the Ministry of Trade is actually 
<br/>laser focused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can see that there has been so much work done by all the Ministries over the last few 
<br/>years, but the missing equation is actually the need to attract investors to come and play in this area. 
<br/>I can happily report that I am being talking actively to two possible potential investors, but we need 
<br/>more, and I think if that happens we will surely unlock the potential in fisheries and agriculture as 
<br/>alluded to quite succinctly by the honourable Minister of Agriculture this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  I  just  thought  to  also  acknowledge  the  comments  around  the 
<br/>fishermen  in  the  North  and  the  need  for  the  NDP  programme  to  try  and  link  up  to  the  Northern 
<br/>fishermen in terms of storage access. We are doing a lot on the supply of boats and outboard motors 
<br/>but  I  think  certainly  in  terms  of  trying  to  get  their  produce  to  market  needs  freezers  and  that  is 
<br/>probably an area where the Government and certainly the Ministry of Trade can assist the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries in terms of going forward in this very promising and area of high potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  like  I  promised,  I  will  be  brief.    I  support  the  recommendations  before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament and thank the Committee for their contribution in producing a Consolidated Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wish  to  acknowledge  the  honourable 
<br/>Members  who  have  contributed  and  of  course  the  honourable  Minister  as  well  for  his  response.  
<br/>Because it is a bipartisan report, I will hold back the rod from attacking the honourable Minister, but 
<br/>of course, the importance of the sector and the need for us to raise the production levels and bring in 
<br/>the new technologies and so forth is so important.  I hope that Government will continue to support 
<br/>the Ministry of Fisheries.  
<br/></span></div>
