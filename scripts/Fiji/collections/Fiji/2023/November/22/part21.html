<div><span>REVIEW REPORT-FIJI NATIONAL SPORTS COUNCIL 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Fiji National Sports Council 2017-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018 Annual Report, which was tabled on 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Fiji  Sports  Council  is  responsible  for 
<br/>planning, constructing, maintaining and delivering high quality venues and facilities for sports at all 
<br/>levels from high performance athletes to community recreational activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council has more than delivered on its promise with the official opening of its head office

<div><span>    Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and FMF gymnasium complex in January of 2018. The Fiji Sports Council emphasises the social and 
<br/>economic importance of sports in Fiji through modern sporting facilities that are now beginning to 
<br/>be established around the country particularly in rural areas. Through key investments and support 
<br/>from government more young people are beginning to see sports as a serious career path. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee noted that there were achievements in the 2017 – 2018 financial 
<br/>year, the most memorable one which has the greatest long term impact was the commissioning of the 
<br/>new Fiji Sports Council head office and the reopening of the refurbished FMF gymnasium.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further to this, Government supported redevelopment of the Vodafone Arena which began in 
<br/>March of 2018. Following the renovations, the Vodafone Arena is the first venue in Fiji to assist 
<br/>Weightlifting  Fiji 
<br/>the  International  Weightlifting  Federation  (World  Junior 
<br/>Championships). It was also noted that netball Fiji had also won the bid to host the World Youth 
<br/>Championship in 2022 however, this did not eventuate due to COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in  hosting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the refurbished facilities of the Fiji National Sports Council has contributed to 
<br/>the  health  and  wellbeing  of  all  Fijians  by  providing  venues  and  facilities  for  sport  and  active 
<br/>recreational activities that bring people from all walks of life together. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Empty drum makes the loudest noise and 
<br/>I hope the message reaches to the respective speakers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sports Commission and 
<br/>Ministry of Youth work together, they connect to each other. So that is why I thought that I will 
<br/>clarify, on the National Youth Council and on the National Youth Policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the National Youth Council, this was the initiative of FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Never used it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We ran that Council, when  the term  expired, we did not  appoint any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>members for the Council. The reason being ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The reason was, what we decided at that time, that we need to go around 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the country, form youth clubs ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Still going around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … and then appoint the National Youth Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That was the whole idea. Consult people, listen to people! That is what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we believed in! Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023            Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2183 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Eight years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And on the, not eight years, it was only last year, you go and get your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>facts right, </span><span>yaar</span><span>!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes I do not expect such things from you my brother. On the National Youth Policy, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the works were carried out in regard to the National Youth Policy. There 
<br/>were stakeholders who were involved in preparing this National Youth Policy and we were on the 
<br/>verge of presenting to Cabinet, but at that point in time, the FijiFirst Government felt that this is not 
<br/>the right time to present. More time is needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- More time is needed to go around and consult some other stakeholders 
<br/>and then bring it. That is where the story ended. It is not that we were roaming around, it is not that 
<br/>were not doing anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject).- Overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute on the review of the Fiji Sports 
<br/>Council 2017-2018 Annual Report. Sir, I will be very brief and straight to the point. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Fiji Sports Council was established in 1978 by the Act of Parliament, and I am sorry to say, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through my observation and research, that from 1978 to 2008, there was no or very 
<br/>little works carried out, in particular, capital works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the game changer began from 2007 and onwards at the Fiji Sports Council. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank and acknowledge the work of the former CEO, Litiana. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, Litiana’s contribution to the Fiji Sports Council has been outstanding, and I wish her very well 
<br/>in her future endeavours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will inform this House what is happening at the Fiji Sports Council 
<br/></span><span>right now. They have been talking about accountability, they have been talking about transparency 
<br/>and under the leadership of my good friend, from the West. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  things  are  happening.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  this 
<br/>Parliament, on the award of the project work, one of the Australian Companies for the supply and 
<br/>installation and commissioning of full track works by the Fiji Sports Council which was definitely 
<br/></span><span>approved by the new Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wish to know whether this is the same company that was involved in a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>case whereby an employee of Water Authority of Fiji received $500 from this company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Come on man. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What do you mean ‘come on’, who are you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You keep shut.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this is the same company, then how and why this contract 
<br/>was given knowing very well that the Government financial policy does not allow to engage any 
<br/>contractor or firm who are involved in bribery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister, my good friend from West will table a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report in regard to this after proper and thorough investigation into this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Not  only  that  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  very  reliably  informed  that  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vehicles have been bought, staff salaries have been increased without the Board’s approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Please,  check  on  this,  I  think  this  is  enough  for  my  good  friend, 
<br/>honourable Minister for Youth and Sports and I want to thank the Chairperson of the Committee and 
<br/>the Committee Members for the work that they have been carrying out in regards to the Fiji Sports 
<br/>Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the former Minister for Youth and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports for his contribution this evening.  It is another story like the municipal council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do you want me to open my mouth? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- In the last six financial years, Fiji Sports Council has received around 
<br/>$8.3 million as grant assistance to support its operational activities which include the payment of 
<br/>properties,  insurance  and  utilities  for  all  its  sports  facilities.    In  the  2023-2024  financial  year  the 
<br/>funding of $670,000 is allocated to finance the principal loan payment to ANZ for the refurbishment 
<br/></span><span>of the Vodafone Arena.  The Fiji Sports Council currently maintains 18 sporting properties on behalf 
<br/></span><span>of the Government.  The list is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>HFC Bank Stadium; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Vodafone Arena; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>FMF Gymnasium; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>National Fitness Centre; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Damodar City Aquatic Centre; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>National Netball Centre; 
<br/></span><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>National Hockey Centre; 
<br/></span><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>National Beach Court; 
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Multipurpose Court; 
<br/>(10)</span><span> </span><span>National Sailing Centre; 
<br/>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Victoria Tennis Courts; 
<br/>(12)</span><span> </span><span>Narauyaba Sports Ground in Ra; 
<br/>(13)</span><span> </span><span>Lawaqa Park; 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023            Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2185 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(14)</span><span> </span><span>Veivadravadra in Sigatoka; 
<br/>(15)</span><span> </span><span>Lautoka Regional Tennis Courts;  
<br/>(16)</span><span> </span><span>Stanley Brown Boxing Gym;  
<br/>(17)</span><span> </span><span>Suva Lawn Tennis Courts; and 
<br/>(18)</span><span> </span><span>Thompson Park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To date some of the major sporting development projects attained by the Fiji Sports Council 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>2018 -  the upgrade of the FMF Gymnasium; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>2019 - the upgrade of the Vodafone Arena; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>2023 - the upgrade of the National Hockey Centre; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>2023 - the upgrade of the Damodar City Aquatic Centre; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>2023 - upgrade of the Lautoka Regional Tennis Courts; and  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>2023 - upgrade of the Narauyaba Sports Ground previously known as Ra Sports Ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The HFC Stadium, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continues to be a key premier venue for various sporting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>events and social gatherings.  Currently, the Fiji Sports Council is focused on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Upgrading the HFC Stadium with synthetic tracks and this should be completed by early 
<br/>next year. I know a lot of sporting bodies have been wanting to use the National Stadium 
<br/>but the tracks are in a very bad state and we need to work on it now and dependent on the 
<br/>weather, we need to complete this before the start of school next year.  As you know our 
<br/>students always look up to their athletics meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The construction of the multistorey complex with indoor food sell courts, it is a joint venture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with Unit Trust of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The renovation of National Hockey Centre and the Damodar City Aquatic Centre; works 
<br/>on both projects have been completed and it is now ready to be officially opened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the Fiji Sports Council has put in place the following internal control measures 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to strengthen accountability and transparency processes in the utilisation of funds: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Conduct regular boards of survey for outdated equipment;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Updating current Finance Manuals and Procurement plans; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of  new ERP system to  reduce manual manipulation with the 
<br/></span><span>strict approval processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I respond to the former Minister for Youth and Sports, request, yes, I 
<br/>will be tabling a report later on the contract for the replacement of this synthetic tracks.  Thank you 
<br/>very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise  to  make a short contribution  towards the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion that is before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge  the  Chairperson  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the preparation of the Committee Report 
<br/>and not forgetting the former CEO - Ms Litiana Loabuka and her dedicated team for the overall  
<br/>upkeeping of the Fiji Sports Council venues in previous years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the establishment of the Fiji Sports Council in1978, it continues to 
<br/>play an important role in our nation by providing safe and reliable sports facilities, foster and promote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="98">Page 98</a></div>
<div><span>2186 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the development of sports and associated educational activities in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a former Member of the Committee which deliberated on the Review 
<br/>Annual Report, I wish to speak on one of the findings highlighted by the Committee, that is the non-
<br/>financially viable of seven venues, namely the Victoria Tennis Courts, the Damodar City Aquatic 
<br/>Centre, National Beach Courts, Veivadravadra Grass Sports Ground, National Sailing Centre and the 
<br/>Lawaqa Park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee went on to recommend that the Council should build and 
<br/>enhance its participation on public private partnership for proper execution of sporting development 
<br/>projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although this might be an outdated report it is important that the Fiji Sports 
<br/>Council  consider  the  recommendation  put  forward  by  the  Committee  and  ensure  that  it  is 
<br/>implemented accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the public private partnership, the private sector institution will involve 
<br/>in financing the Fiji Sports Council venues upfront and in return draw revenues from users of the 
<br/>venues  over  the  cost  of  the  public  private  partnership  contract.    To  attract  the  private  sector  and 
<br/>economic feasibilities assessment must be conducted to determine the cost and projected revenue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Sports Council should also consider engaging local communities by 
<br/>forming some sort of partnership with the Provincial Council, youth groups and sports clubs. This 
<br/>will allow the local community to take ownership and involve in the upkeeping of the venues and 
<br/>will reduce the operational cost for this non-financially viable properties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this form of partnership is proven to be successful in most rural schools.  
<br/>Often tournament organisers or sports clubs wishing to host the tournaments, face challenges with 
<br/>the rates when hiring the Fiji Sports Council venues.  Perhaps, this type of partnership, local youth 
<br/>groups and sports clubs can contribute towards the general operation of the venues and in return, be 
<br/>granted concessional rates when hiring one of the 7 non-financially viable venues.  I thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the review of the 
<br/>Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report.  First of all, I would like to join our honourable Minister 
<br/>for Youth and Sports in wishing our Team Fiji in the bid for gold in the Pacific Games in Honiara.  
<br/></span><span>As of now, I think 15 hours ago, we had three silvers and two bronze.  Hopefully we will work on 
<br/></span><span>getting some more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Sports Council, as we heard, was established in 1978 to encourage and promote the 
<br/>development  of  sports  and  recreational  activities  in  Fiji.    Just  a  side  comment,  we  observe  how 
<br/>honourable Members on the opposite side all seem to claim that everything in Fiji is their doing.  I 
<br/>am not sure if they realise it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  How  un-Fijian  that  sounds.    In  our  traditional  Fijian  way,  usually 
<br/>frowned upon when one blows one’s own trumpet.  Usually, we allow others to give us recognition.  
<br/>I believe it is a universal concept, not only in Fiji, who think like that, it is bad form to be praising 
<br/>ourselves what we achieve.  But our honourable colleagues in the Opposition, need to be reminded 
<br/>to tone down on the boastfulness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="99">Page 99</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023            Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2187 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  from  this  one  point,  Fiji  Sports  Council  was  established  in  1978.    We  see  the  vast 
<br/>majority, not all of the developments in Fiji had their origin in administrations and governments of 
<br/>the past.  It is not a thing to be ashamed of.  You did not inherit a blank page.  Fiji already had vertical 
<br/>and horizontal infrastructure, complex communication systems, television stations, regional and local 
<br/>universities, technical institutes, home to many regional and international organisations and NGOs, 
<br/>national plans to keep improving …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Speak on the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- It is the way of the world that we live in.  We do what we can and we 
<br/>hand it over to those who carry on the race.  When the time comes for us to do the same, we will 
<br/>hand  over  as  well.    We  will  let  history  judge  us,  therefore,  what  your  protestations  and  claims, 
<br/>however loud, history will be our judge.  It is futile to try and change that for as many teachers that 
<br/>have counselled their students, you will write your own report and for 16 years, you wrote your own 
<br/>report.   That is why you are sitting on that side, and we are on this side.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have no problems nor difficulty in acknowledging your government’s developments that 
<br/>are  worth  your  praise.    But  I  ask  this  question  in  this  august  House,  have  you  ever  heard  them 
<br/>acknowledge  the  previous  administrations  or  governments?    All  I  heard  was  unprecedented  this, 
<br/>unprecedented that.  Unfortunately, it is beyond the former government to thank anyone, it is not in 
<br/>their DNA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, about two weeks ago the senior officials in our Ministry and I had a meeting 
<br/>with  the  Fiji  Rugby  Union  where  we  discussed  potential  areas  of  collaboration.      We  discussed 
<br/>piggybacking on some of FRUs rugby development programmes as well as expertise in providing a 
<br/>network  of  administrators  and  officials  at  provincial,  district  and  village  level  to  support  clubs, 
<br/>district teams as well as provincial teams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the rural and maritime development point of view, this would help alleviate the rural-
<br/>urban  drift,  provide  training  opportunities,  help  reduce  NCDs,  help  with  socio-economic 
<br/>development as well as provide career opportunities for some in professional rugby or netball.  In the 
<br/>same way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that all sports have enormous potential to help in rural and 
<br/>national development, and I believe that the discussions that we had with FRU could also be something 
<br/>that we and other Ministries could be having with Fiji Sports Commission and those in the same field 
<br/></span><span>seeing  that  the  Fiji  Sports  Council  is  responsible  for  all  the  planning,  constructing,  maintaining  and 
<br/></span><span>delivering  high  quality  values  and  activities  for  sports  at  all  levels  for  high  performance  athletes  to 
<br/>community recreational activities.  As we go around Fiji, we see the deplorable state of some of our 
<br/>grounds in smaller communities and smaller towns, so it is something that is going to be challenging us 
<br/>and I suppose the challenge also for the Fiji Sports Council on what they can do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I congratulate the board and management of the Fiji Sports Council and wish them well for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future. I endorse, support, and commend the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.-  Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comments and constructive and some destructive contributions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I hope that in the near future, the Fiji National Sports Council and the Ministry of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Youth and Sports will consider and assist in the building of a bigger sporting complex in Ra so in time
