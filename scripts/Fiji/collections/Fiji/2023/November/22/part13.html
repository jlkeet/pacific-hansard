<div><span>Banning/Regulating Pornographic Sites in Fiji  
<br/>(Question No. 172/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> There  are  some  reports  that  have  linked  the  increase  in  sexual  related  crimes  to 
<br/>pornography.  Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  inform  Parliament  if 
<br/>there are plans to ban or regulate pornographic sites in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tuinaceva for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>excellent question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when I first saw the question, what immediately came to my mind was, how 
<br/>have we got into this situation where this sort of questions are being asked in Parliament?  Why are 
<br/>we asking this kind of questions?  Sir, in other words, what were the other people doing before we 
<br/>got to this stage? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Oh, come on!  Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You can talk about pornography, you can talk about drugs 
<br/></span><span>– all the social ills that we have inherited in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker.  That is why when I talk 
<br/></span><span>about rebuilding Fiji, it is not only the economy, but there will also be a social rebuild and a moral 
<br/>rebuild that has to happen in Fiji. As Michelle Obama said, “When they go low, we go high”, so the 
<br/>answer to the question, Sir, is my attempt at going high. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Tuinaceva,  once  again,  for  a  very  serious 
<br/>question and it is a question that I rise to respond to, it is a very important question and it is a major 
<br/>problem,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  I  am  also  mindful  that  the  relationship  between  pornography  and 
<br/>increased sexual-related crimes is a complex and much debated topic as it sparks privacy, freedom 
<br/></span><span>of expression, security censorship, technological and individual liberty considerations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, this warrants the nation’s attention, and I am sure that there is consensus, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on both sides of Parliament that any crime, including what is being discussed here 
<br/>today which is sexually related crimes are a major concern, including the potential harms of excessive 
<br/>pornographic consumption.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2125 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the permission of the honourable Prime Minister, I will be tabling a 
<br/>proposition to Cabinet, to create a nationwide taskforce perhaps, on a bipartisan basis to address this 
<br/>issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  some  information,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  web  traffic  to  pornographic  sites,  the 
<br/>information is both, instructive and somewhat concerning. For one network provider in Fiji, Sir, over 
<br/>the past three months, there has been about 626.13 terabyte of data consumed which was related to 
<br/>adult content and porn alone, ranking as one of the top 10 most used data traffic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put this into context, the 626 terabytes of data is approximately equal to 
<br/>the amount of data stored in a 100 million books. For a period of one month, from another network 
<br/>provider in Fiji, they found that the total data content was 92 terabytes, which was about 1.6 percent 
<br/>of their total data volume for one month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, effectively tackling these social ills requires a concerted effort and multi-
<br/>stakeholder  engagement  targeted  at  addressing  the  root  cause  including  increased  education  and 
<br/>awareness  campaigns  to  our  people  on  developing  healthy  attitudes  towards  sex,  including 
<br/>importance of consent and what it means.  That is what we intend to prioritise, Sir, through Cabinet 
<br/>approval.  We will carry out these consultations on a bipartisan basis with diverse stakeholders to 
<br/>ensure that we identify the root causes and assess the solutions available and agree on an approach 
<br/>to address this holistically.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are emerging technological solutions that can be considered as part of 
<br/>our  assessment,  such  as  filtering  systems  which  can  block  child  sexual  exploitation  material  or 
<br/>upcoming  technologies  that  are  still  evolving  such  as  age  verification  or  age  assurance  systems 
<br/>whereby access to explicit content is not accessed by children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also mindful that there are ways to by-pass restrictions or blocking, for example, by 
<br/>using proxy servers or VPNs, you can access blocked websites through mimicking access virtually 
<br/>from another country of all websites including blocked content. So collectively, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>need to identify the appropriate interventions that will address the root cause. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the different approaches, that we are looking and in partnership 
<br/>with the Ministries, Online Safety Commission, the Police, Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, the 
<br/>private sector and of course, Members of the other side, we can turn the tide on this societal blemish. 
<br/>With these few words I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute on 
<br/></span><span>this very important question.  I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important question, and it is not about going 
<br/>high or low. It goes to the level where our young people are affected. Recently, there was an article 
<br/>in one of the local newspapers where there is an App. called “Telegram” and nude images of young 
<br/>girls  have been shared on that  platform. This  was reported to  the Minister for Home Affairs, the 
<br/>Police Force, but since this question has come to Parliament and there are many people also hearing 
<br/>us ask this question and get a response from the relevant Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Will the honourable Minister consider immediately getting the networks to ban such Apps. 
<br/></span><span>which are sharing nude contents of young females who are traumatised and who are at the verge of 
<br/>committing  suicide  because  of  their  images  being  shared  by  these  criminal  offenders  online,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hope the answer was very clear. You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cannot just go around unilaterally, you may have done that in the past, in your Government, but in 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Government, we consult. These are very sensitive issues that need proper consultation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- It is not a matter of consulting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They need proper consultation. We are inviting you. You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did nothing for 16 years. You did absolutely nothing on this issue. That is why we are here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  That  is  why  we  have  ended  up  here.  They  have  done 
<br/>nothing. Honourable Lynda Tabuya had mentioned in Parliament many times and you did nothing! 
<br/>Shame on you!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are asking us to fix your problem. All I am saying is, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>let us work together on it. We will do consultations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Scam taskforce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  You  should  listen,  you  will  learn  a  few  things.  You  are 
<br/>young. What I am saying is that we will actually work together on this and come up with concise 
<br/>solutions for the betterment of the country and I hope that the other side will actually put their hand 
<br/>up and let us work together on it because it is a very serious problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise, I have been having a little bit of a 
<br/>hearing problem today, so I am just not aware that the question has been changed.  I have to re-direct 
<br/>it to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, but I want to thank him for the feedback or response. I 
<br/>am aware of the big task there to get this fixed and done and I want to thank him that he is talking 
<br/>about the consultations and all other talks that you need to go through in order to address this problem.  
<br/></span><span>Something that I want to say, yes, I am the author of the question.  It was nothing really political 
<br/></span><span>when I thought about bringing the question to the House.  I know it is a big problem out there.  I have 
<br/>seen lives being destroyed because of this pornography so when I put the question across to the team 
<br/>to the party if we can this ask this question in Parliament because it was all about saving our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Changes to Bus Fare Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 173/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection 
<br/>update Parliament on the changes to the Bus Fare Programme as announced in the 
<br/>2023-2024 Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>This question has come about as a result of inquiries that have been made by the public as well as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our Members and Members of the Opposition. I was particularly asked by honourable Naivalurua on 
<br/>this issue of the bus fare and the policy of Government but let me explain a bit about the Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bus  Fare  Programme,  as  you  know,  is  one  of  the  many  programmes  targetted  to 
<br/>addressing the needs of our vulnerable population.  It is meant to help our beneficiaries of over 60 
<br/>years old and our people living with disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In order to qualify, Mr. Speaker, Sir, first you provide your birth certificate, as well as a letter 
<br/>from the disability organisation to support the fact that you are living with a disability and there is an 
<br/>application  form.    The  colour-coded  bus  fare  identification  card,  it  is  red  for  persons  living  with 
<br/>disability and yellow for elderly persons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  bus  fare  programme  which  started  in  2011  with  about  22,000 
<br/>beneficiaries, we now currently have 42,000 beneficiaries in August, 2023.  The initial monthly top 
<br/>up ranges from $40 at the commencement and then later was decreased to $20 and then a further 
<br/>reduction to $10 during COVID-19.  Then it was later restored to $25 a month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 Budget, $75 for every three months, it was implemented.  In this financial 
<br/>year, the bus fare programme needed to be amended in terms of the top up and I will explain why.  
<br/>We first changed it to $25 a month because we found out recipients by giving them $75 for three 
<br/>months,  there were recipients  who were running out  of that and were not  budgeting for the  three 
<br/>months so that it lasted them for three months. They would run out quickly, so $25 a month was 
<br/>implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The other change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which I believe is what we have been asked about as a 
<br/>government is that we have found over 50 percent of our active beneficiaries (over 24,000) have been 
<br/>accumulating balances in their e-transport cards, so they have been accumulating these balances. It 
<br/>would range $25 to $300, so the Government has been topping up cards of our recipients and over 
<br/>50 percent,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not  use it or do not  utilise it.  There was a big  budget  from  the 
<br/>Ministry that was going to this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we came into Government by the last quarter, we had a $12 
<br/>million shortfall in terms of our welfare assistance because this was being paid to users accounts and 
<br/>they were not being utilised.  We had to review that, Sir, and look at a better way of doing this which 
<br/>had been done by the previous Government but was changed recently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has happened in this fiscal year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that it is reverted to the $25 a month 
<br/></span><span>but based on utilisation.  The top up is on what you actually use to get back to $25.  Yes, we have 
<br/>those that utilised this full amount and have been affected and they have come to address it with us 
<br/>but the fact that we have over 50 percent we have not utilised and have got balances even up to $300 
<br/>and there is room for abuse in terms of other members of the family using the card, Sir.  The bus 
<br/>drivers do not necessarily distinguish or ascertain if you are over 60 when you are using the card.  
<br/>They just take the money, that is income. They let them swipe, it is being used by others who are not 
<br/>entitled to this particular benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  method  of  this  top-up,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  sustainable  and  it  ensures  that  the  funds 
<br/></span><span>provided to improve accessibility are efficiently use.  There is always room for improvement.  We 
<br/>get the feedback from our people living with disabilities that the buses are not disability-friendly, 
<br/>they cannot use it. We are doing a review of that programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and discussing with 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance whether we need to convert this particular utilisation thing into cash. Just 
<br/>like we have done the Food Vouchers into cash in this current year, we are looking at whether we 
<br/>should do this top-up to cash instead of it being put into their cards and using their cards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>2128 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our elderly do find it difficult to take the bus at times, our people living in rural and remote 
<br/>areas do not have bus services so they want to see how we can help them that they can have access 
<br/>to  carrier  services  and  minibuses  and  this  is  part  of  the  review,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  consider 
<br/>converting this particular allowance into cash something that we could consider in the next financial 
<br/>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you also heard that there is a possible review of the eTransport card system 
<br/>and so if it is converted into cash and perhaps, they can still use it on the bus or use cash on the bus 
<br/>or have it provided also for other forms of transport and not just the public buses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is always room for improvement, but I hope this is clear to the public 
<br/>- the need for the reconsideration of the policy to keep topping up $25 every month regardless of 
<br/>utilisation and the need to look at a more efficient way of assisting our people and that is to replace 
<br/>only what is utilised.  I hope that is clear Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is the response to the question. 
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, are there provisions for special case that 
<br/>have special needs?  People might be travelling up and down because they need to do it, for example, 
<br/>going to hospitals and that will be more than $25, $25 it would take someone travelling from Sigatoka 
<br/>to Suva that is one way.  In those kind of situations, how do we deal with that? Are you planning to 
<br/>give some flexibility on that?  Some allowance?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a difficult one to consider in terms of case by 
<br/>case basis if those who are frequently using for those purposes, but I do note that there is a general 
<br/>increase in the social welfare allowance for our elderly and for our people who live with disabilities 
<br/>all around in the current budget year.  So, we hope that that will assist them, but we need to keep it 
<br/>consistent because of the need to be able to meet the budgetary needs of the bus fare assistance, but 
<br/>hopefully,  we  can  consider  an  increase  year  after  year  as  we  go  on,  depending  on  the  budgetary 
<br/>allowances from the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Government is in the process 
<br/>of changing the e-ticketing system, and of course it is linked to the bus fare programme and the 
<br/>changes to increase efficiency and transparency.  How is that change going to solve some  of the 
<br/>current challenges the bus fare programme has faced? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not in the position to answer what the review 
<br/></span><span>contains,  that  is  in  another  Ministry,  I  think  Ministry  for  Transport,  but  we  certainly  will  work 
<br/></span><span>together in terms of ensuring that they are consistent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is related to this change that took place 
<br/>where previously $75 was given for three months, and now it is $25 a month.  The question is, as 
<br/>asked by the honourable Member, when he mentioned that there are people who want to travel from 
<br/>Western side to come to MIOT Hospital or wherever if they need some assistance.  When $75 were 
<br/>given for three months, they were  able to  adjust the expenses and they  were  able to  utilise that.  
<br/>There was no issue whatsoever, but now, with this monthly payment of $25, can the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister  explain  whether  the  cost  of  dishing  out  this  $25  has  also  increased  every  month?  
<br/></span><span>Previously, when you give $75 out for three months, that was one time cost that means four times 
<br/>it was being processed, and now, it is processed every month, so what is the difference in the cost? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the administrative task of putting it in 
<br/>every month according to Vodafone, it does not cost them.  They are just basically assisting us to 
<br/>deposit it every month into the cards but because we made the appeal that we actually had a number 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of recipients who ran out of their balances before the end of the three months, that they were not 
<br/>able to manage, the $25 a month helped them to be able to budget it.  We have been able to work 
<br/>that out with Vodafone and all the providers that they could top up every month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of Roadside Stalls  
<br/>(Question No. 174/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>the 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications 
<br/>Government’s plans to assist farmers in the rural communities by establishing roadside stalls 
<br/>to help them sell their farm produce? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inform  Parliament  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, basically, the Government will continue 
<br/>the programme of installation of roadside stalls.  It is a very good programme that was introduced 
<br/>by the previous government.  We believe that it has contributed greatly to economic activity amongst 
<br/>the  rural  communities  as  well  as  farms.    The  stalls  in  Navua  are  classic  examples  of  how  well-
<br/>presented  stalls  can  actually  attract  a  lot  of  businesses  and  we  are  keen  to  actually  continue  the 
<br/>support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One other thing, perhaps when  I saw the question, we probably  will look  at  doing  is  the 
<br/>connection between the farmers and where the stalls are actually being installed and how we can 
<br/>overlay that with the other additional MSME assistance that we have available for all farmers around 
<br/>Fiji.  That is just something we will also endeavour to do as part of supporting the farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the support stimulates economic activity and creates economic opportunity for the 
<br/>rural farmers.  To date we have 103 stalls already installed, which is quite significant and they are in 
<br/>Viti Levu and Vanua Levu as well.  We are working very closely with the </span><span>turaga ni koro,</span><span> of course, 
<br/>there is wear and tear on these stalls and we are trying to work with the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> or community 
<br/>leaders to ensure that the stalls are well kept.  Some of the stalls have been there for some time and 
<br/>need improvement or replacement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also looking at exploring Public-Private Partnerships to try 
<br/>and  encourage  the  building  of  more  stalls  that  can  help  assist  farmers.    If  there  are  any  specific 
<br/>requests that the honourable Tuicolo may have in mind, I invite him to contact the Ministry and we 
<br/></span><span>are happy to look at the request and that applies to all of us in the august Chamber.  We are happy to 
<br/></span><span>have a look.  The budget was not that large this year and that is why we are looking at Public-Private 
<br/>Partnerships  but  going  forward, we will continue to  work on what  I believe is  quite a very good 
<br/>initiative in terms of trying to support rural farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many such good initiatives by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, honourable Minister, this is just one of it.  Instead of just microwaving and presenting, 
<br/>if you can tell  us how  many new stalls were made this year?   Also, a caution, for this particular 
<br/>programme, it is not about people bringing requests to the Ministry or to you, there is a transparency 
<br/></span><span>involved where it is advertised, and people apply for it. There is a strict criterion which one has to 
<br/></span><span>follow, just for your information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment like I said, there is a 
<br/>programme of repairs being done to stalls and also we are looking at requests.  There are currently 
<br/>requests from several places, Serua, and other locations that are being looked at.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that intrigued me about the cost of the stalls is they appear quite high, so I 
<br/>have  asked that to  be  reviewed  as well.   At the  moment,  one stall  is  costing between $25,000 to 
<br/>$30,000.  Similar to the road situation, we might just need to have another look at that.  I do accept 
<br/>that it has to be kept Category 5 designed which is probably the reason, but we will just look at that 
<br/>as  well  just  to  make  sure,  even  thinking  that  maybe  perhaps  we  can  get  the  communities  to  get 
<br/>involved … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- As I have said, we are repairing some of the stalls and then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are also looking at where to deploy other stalls.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on the Agreement between the Ministry and the Volunteer Service Abroad 
<br/>of New Zealand? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the Agreement between 
<br/>the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations and the Volunteer Service Abroad 
<br/>of New Zealand and I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  way  of  background,  the  Volunteer  Service  Abroad  (VSA)  is  New 
<br/>Zealand’s largest  and most experienced volunteer agency, working  on international  development, 
<br/>similar to the Australian Volunteer International (AVI) and USA Volunteer (USA Peace Corp).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, VSA is a New Zealand registered charity agency that is non-religious, non-political and 
<br/>a  non-governmental  organisation.  Operating  since  1962,  VSA  is  New  Zealand’s  facilitator  of  the 
<br/>National Volunteering Development Programme funded under the New Zealand Ministry for Foreign 
<br/></span><span>Affairs and Trade as part of the Aotearoa New Zealand Aid Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, VSA brings people together from New Zealand and the wider Pacific to 
<br/>share  skills  and  experience,  working  to  transform  lives  and  create  a  fair  future  for  all.  Sir,  VSA 
<br/>operates under five broad thematic areas, and they are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>business and economic growth; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>health and well-being; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>education; 
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>environment and climate change; and 
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>agriculture, fisheries and food security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Pacific Island countries and organisations that are currently partners with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VSA  are  Vanuatu,  Cook  Islands,  Tonga,  PNG,  Solomon  Islands,  Kiribati,  Bougainville  and  the 
<br/>United Nations and council of regional organisations of the Pacific agencies operating in Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2131 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through VSA volunteers and partnerships, it has helped many Pacific developing countries 
<br/>address  their  development  needs  across  many  sectors  including  education,  agriculture,  fisheries, 
<br/>health, climate change, disaster risk reduction and good governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a wide consultation with key stakeholders and line ministries including the 
<br/>Ministry for Foreign Affairs was conducted before a proposal was submitted to Cabinet for approval.  
<br/>For  the  record,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Agreement  has  now  been  approved  by  Cabinet  for 
<br/>implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final  signing of the agreement  between the Ministry and VSA, New 
<br/>Zealand is yet to be done. The signing formalities and the date is being arranged by the VSA officials 
<br/>of New Zealand and the New Zealand High Commission in Suva has planned for Wednesday, 29</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.    At  the  outset,  I  want  to 
<br/>inform Parliament that the honourable Minister has handed in the report that was promised by him 
<br/>so I want to thank him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Provided it to you after lunch, honourable Member?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A bit later in the evening, Sir, but I got it at the end of the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is still after lunch? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament how 
<br/>many  volunteers  have  been  engaged  from  January  to-date  under  our  current  volunteer  scheme 
<br/>programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, that is a new question, I will get the answer for him later 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You showing some very interesting signs, honourable Premila Kumar.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor is yours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  to  be  corrected  here,  but  I  am  under  the 
<br/>impression that the VSA programme has already been running in Fiji and it is not a new one.  Under 
<br/>the VSA programme, we had an officer from New Zealand working on the Housing Policy at the 
<br/>Ministry of Housing, so I need clarification on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in the process of signing a new Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity.  It is on the idea of 
<br/></span><span>volunteers and I thank the honourable Minister for this new signing which we look forward to a lot 
<br/>of benefits.  There was a programme that we used to have where people who had retired from Fiji, 
<br/>we work with the countries like New Zealand to get them to become volunteers in other countries 
<br/>that they were paid.  I know you will tell me that this is a new question, but is this something you are 
<br/>still pursuing?

<div><span>Policies on Bus Service  
<br/>(Question No. 176/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on policies that are in place when bus companies stop service 
<br/>delivery to the public for any particular route? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You walk, honourable Member.  I am just joking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. Sir, first and 
<br/>foremost all road users, all vehicle owners, passengers and permit holders for Public Service Vehicles 
<br/>are  governed  by  the  Land  Transport  Act  1998  and  its  corresponding  Land  Transport  Regulations 
<br/>2000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 65 of the Act mandates that permit holders must adhere to their permit conditions. 
<br/>Bus  companies  are  provided  with  permits  called  “Road  Route  Licence”,  which  authorises  the 
<br/>transport of passengers and goods in three categories: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>State service which is scheduled service along a specified route between terminating points 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with stops intended to meet the needs of persons along or in the facility of the route. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Express service which is scheduled service between terminating points with or without a 
<br/>limited number of stops at hotels or towns, intended to meet the general needs of the public.  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Shuttle service which is services within a suburb to meet the needs of passengers on a regular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon issued with such permits, bus companies are mandated under the Act to provide the 
<br/>necessary services. The services are provided as approved timetable or schedules under the road route 
<br/>licence. Failing to follow the approved timetable containing the routes and scheduled times, the bus 
<br/>company can be penalised under the Act for not complying to its permit conditions. The onus is on 
<br/>the bus company to inform the LTA if it is unable to provide the services to a particular route so that 
<br/></span><span>the LTA may seek alternative service providers to provide such necessary services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the bus company does not notify the LTA and continues breaching its permit conditions by 
<br/>not providing the services stipulated under the Act and the road route licence, then the LTA must be 
<br/>notified of these lack of services. The LTA will then invoke Regulation 12, these are proceedings 
<br/>under the Land Transport Public Service Vehicle Regulations 2000 where the bus company must 
<br/>show cause to the LTA as to why LTA should not vary, suspend or cancel the road route licence due 
<br/>to its lack of services.  This year the LTA has invoked the proceedings on two road route licence 
<br/>operators and two minibus operators due to breaches in the permit conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Authority has also implemented policies and guidelines derived from the Act to ensure 
<br/>public  transport  is  maintained  or  enhanced  and  this  includes  the  revised  guideline  and  quality 
<br/>assurance  maintenance  system  which  allows  LTA  management  and  board  to  carry  out,  follow 
<br/>internal processes, allow for sharing of routes with other operators and approval is given by Chief 
<br/>Executive Officer if temporary arrangement is for one month.  If temporary arrangement is more than 
<br/>one month to cover that area, the LTA can consider further actions and, of course, the Public Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2133 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vehicle show cause policy. Again, this is derived from Regulation 12, if a condition subject to which 
<br/>the permit was granted has not been complied, the Authority is satisfied that the breach is serious 
<br/>frequent and causes inconvenience or danger to the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  Authority  has  suspended  or  cancelled  a  permit,  the  LTA  also 
<br/>implements internal measures to ensure the public transport services are not affected.  An immediate 
<br/>action  that  LTA  can  take  and  has  set  as  precedence  for  the  PSV  Tribunal  is  that  the  closest  bus 
<br/>operator to the affected area may provide temporary services whilst the Land Transport Authority 
<br/>takes more formal processes such as calling for expressions of interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Transport Authority has invoked certain policies in certain cases in the West where 
<br/>the bus operator was not able to provide the necessary services due to financial constraints, and some 
<br/>of the immediate actions on this in the interior of Nadi enabled other providers such as minibuses to 
<br/>cover that area on a temporary basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, I think you have explained very well all 
<br/>the provisions and the laws involved to deal with those operators who fail to provide the service.  
<br/>You mentioned something about the moving of Regulation 12 to cancel or suspend permits.  But the 
<br/>problem is still there where lots of complaints from the public about services which is still the failure 
<br/>of most operators to provide the service. There is a lot of that coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know Baulevu, there is a lot of theft coming from Nadi and the </span><span>colo</span><span> of Nadi.  I think it may 
<br/>be to do with the lack of response or slow response to deal with those issues. Will the Ministry be 
<br/>able to  look  into that  and get  some kind  of database to  collect  these kinds of complaints coming 
<br/>because it is really getting bad?  We are receiving complaints from people telling and begging us to 
<br/>do something. We promised them that we will take it up to the Minister if they can solve this problem.  
<br/>I know the show cause is there but the process is a bit longer.  By that time most of our people are 
<br/>being affected and continues to be a problem with the travelling public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Coalition Government, we had 
<br/>established that the Land Transport Authority has been under-funded under the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/>In collaboration with the honourable Minister of Finance, we have increased the budget and there 
<br/>was a continuous issue about human resources shortages within the LTA, including poor monitoring 
<br/>and enforcement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Operational? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  With  an  increased  budget,  we  are  engaging  in  more 
<br/>recruitments for the monitoring part which has been a serious problem and that will partially address 
<br/>that. We are looking at other measures too but that was one of the main problems and we are working 
<br/>on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  one  is  catching  up  on  the  LTA  facilities  around  the  country,  we  are  looking  at   
<br/>upgrading  the  North.  So,  with  those  upgraded  facilities,  with  up-to-date  equipment  and  human 
<br/>resources, you will not have the situation where the FijiFirst Government went to do a commissioning 
<br/></span><span>and planted a coconut tree.  That coconut tree is now matured without the office which was supposed 
<br/></span><span>to be built.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition is now bearing fruit by building that office which was commissioned but not built.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, question to the honourable Minister: the service 
<br/>providers want to continue with the licences that they have been provided with, but one of the big 
<br/>factors here is the condition of the roads.  Honourable Minister, travel to Korovou one of these days 
<br/>from Kasavu, you pass Logani down to Nadaro, you have been sleeping on the job.  Come away from 
<br/>the politics and fix the roads.  What are you going to do with the road conditions because that is what 
<br/>the service providers are waiting for.  They want to continue with the service, it affects the people 
<br/>but Government has to fix the roads.  What are you doing with the current road conditions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  we  are 
<br/>always going back to the roads.  That is always a valid concern, but I would like to reiterate again 
<br/>the  situation  we  faced  when  we  came  in  regarding  Fiji  Roads  Authority  whereby  December,  the 
<br/>FijiFirst had already expended everything.  There was nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Admit!  </span><span>Paisa nai he.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is more than one year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- An analysis of the accounts revealed that even the retention 
<br/>funds  normally  kept  for  refund  to  the  contractors  was  used  from  the  bank  and  there  were  no 
<br/>emergency funds put aside for roads by the FijiFirst Government, so these are the complexities we 
<br/>face. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Not only that, as I had mentioned, the removal of Public Works 
<br/>Department (PWD), the depots and all that, but now we are building that up.  It takes a while to build 
<br/>it up, we do not just come in and immediately everything is there.  We reform and rebuild. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Oh, he was the Infrastructure Minister here, but the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister will understand the process that rebuilding takes time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Now, you understand the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- After one budget everything should be in place and the next 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget, everything should be 100 percent but on the roads, we are working. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You might not be there in the next budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- No, definitely that is in the programme and we are working 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Fix the road, otherwise, you will come this side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  We  are  working  on  Vuci  Road.    There  is  a  road  just  past 
<br/>Nausori Airport in front of Nasilai Village, it has been like that for 30 years and now we are fixing 
<br/></span><span>it, so we are gradually moving towards that even though it might look slow to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very slow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- 15 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- But it is not slow,  slow but sure, so let us have patience,

<div><span>2135 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I really admire how the honourable Minister is so 
<br/>confidently incorrect at most times.  The question has spoken about policies and laws but in this 11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>month, a lot of communities are complaining that the service delivery by the bus companies are not 
<br/>provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister that when people are not able 
<br/>to move, the economy is not able to move, education, employment and everything is affected so what 
<br/>magnitude of impact does this have on our economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is hard 
<br/>to analyse the magnitude of the impact of non-delivery of services that sounds like a master thesis 
<br/>which honourable Ketan Lal was supposed to do.

<div><span>Issuance of Business Licences in Municipalities 
<br/>(Question No. 177/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on 
<br/>whether the Town and City Councils will be given the authority to process and issue Business 
<br/>Licences under their Municipality? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  respond  to  the  question  before 
<br/>Parliament this afternoon, I would like to pay my tribute and express my heartfelt condolences to the 
<br/></span><span>Vanua o</span><span> Nabukebuke, Solevu Bua, </span><span>Vanua o</span><span> Nabukebuke Namosi on the passing on of the </span><span>Radini 
<br/>Vanua o</span><span> Nabukebuke, Namosi.  Our prayers and thoughts are with the </span><span>Vanua </span><span>and </span><span>Turaga Vunivalu 
<br/>na Tui </span><span>Namosi in his time of sorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  response  to  this  question is  based  on  economics  of business  licence 
<br/>management.  The focus is on the efficiency and the effectiveness of business licence management. 
<br/>The relocation of Business Licence Act 2020 was a move to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and 
<br/>improve ease of doing business in Fiji.  However, it is regrettable that the execution of this decision 
<br/></span><span>has some shortfalls of some deficiencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to contextualise the issue of doing business, our business licencing 2019 
<br/>World Bank doing  business  Report states that small  or medium  size businesses in  Fiji  require an 
<br/>average of 40 days, remarkably 28 percent to 30 percent of this time which is equivalent to 11 days 
<br/>was consumed by the business licencing process.  An overall cost incurred by individuals to initiate 
<br/>such businesses in Fiji amount to $1,600 with business licence fees ranging from $100 to $500.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issuance of a business licence was contingent upon obtaining approvals 
<br/></span><span>from  various  regulatory  agencies  including  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Labour, the National Fire Authority and the Ministry of Health. In principle a Council was tasked to 
<br/>ensuring  that  all  necessary  approvals  were  granted  before  issuing  the  business  licence.  However, 
<br/>concerning practice emerge Councils through bylaws introduced business licences requirements for 
<br/>the same type of business across different jurisdictions.  This meant that a business aiming to operate 
<br/>a multiple town sets to navigate varying sets of requirements and fees for the business licence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>2136 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in practical terms Councils took an unreasonable amount of time ranging 
<br/>from one to three months and in some extreme cases over a year to issue business licences.  The 
<br/>situation  underwent  a  significant  shift  in  2020  when  the  Business  Licence  Act  was  revoked, 
<br/>subsequently World Bank conducted a survey to gauge the impact of business in terms of savings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2022  findings  revealed  that  the  removal  of  the  business  licence  requirement  led  to 
<br/>substantial  savings in compliance cost, amounting  to  almost $3 million in a single year.   So, this 
<br/>information underscores the significance of streamlining the business licensing process, as it not only 
<br/>reduces bureaucratic hurdles, but  also  contributes to  the substantial  financial relief  for businesses 
<br/>operating in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  perennial  issue  plaquing  our  councils  and  licensing  agencies  is  not  the  absence  of 
<br/>business  licence,  but  the  lack  of  enforcement.    This  problem  has  worsened  over  the  years.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, countries such as New Zealand, Georgia and Singapore are models for not requiring 
<br/>business licence, but we cannot overlook the robust regulatory frameworks and efficient enforced 
<br/>mechanisms these countries have in place.  It takes an average of one and a half day to start a business 
<br/>in these nations, because they have streamlined processes and stringent enforcement, and not because 
<br/>they have eliminated the need for licences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, revoking the Business Licencing Act should have been accompanied by a 
<br/>comprehensive strategy to enhance coordination amongst councils, licensing agencies, and Registrar 
<br/>of  Companies  and  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Services.    Transparency  between  these  agencies  is 
<br/>surely  lacking,  hindering  informed  decision  making  by  councils  and  perpetuating  a  lack  of 
<br/>accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  solution  is  ensuring  seamless  information  flow,  data  sharing  between  agencies  and 
<br/>accountability.  Transparency and coordination must be more than a buzz word it should be the pillars 
<br/>of  effective  governance.  Councils  need  the  tools  to  monitor  business  activities  within  their 
<br/>jurisdiction and act swiftly when violations occur. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to making it easier for businesses to operate in Fiji, the focus 
<br/>would be on strengthening and enforcing enforcement agencies, such as, the Ministry of Labour, 
<br/>National Fire Authority, Ministry of Health and the Liquor Licencing Board.  Legislative reviews 
<br/>should empower these agencies with  the authority to  conduct  spot checks and impose substantial 
<br/>penalties, shifting the burden on compliance rightfully onto business operations.  In our relentless 
<br/>pursuit  of  effective  governance,  the  Ministry  is  actively  engaged  in  collaborative  initiatives  with 
<br/></span><span>councils, aiming to enhance coordination with licencing agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pivotal strategies in this endeavour is the establishment of the MOU between the councils 
<br/>and key entities, such as Registrar of Companies and the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services.  This 
<br/>strategic partnership will facilitate the exchange  of tailored information providing councils with a 
<br/>comprehensive overview of registered businesses within their jurisdiction, including details on the 
<br/>nature of their operations.  Through this MOU, the FRCS will furnish essential data regarding the

<br/></span><span>approved business operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, empowered by this well government information, councils will be able to 
<br/>proactively notify relevant agencies in the event of potential breaches.  This heightened vigilance 
<br/>will  be  further  re-enforced  by  councils  making  readily  available  agencies  the  scheme  plan  for 
<br/>municipal boundaries.  This plan meticulously identifies the permissible types of business activities 
<br/>within the specific areas, ensuring a clear and enforceable framework.  I reiterate, our unwavering

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commitment to fostering an environment where doing business in Fiji is not only streamlined, but 
<br/>also  very  cost  effective.    Elections  are  testament  to  this  dedication  as  we  diligently  rectify  past 
<br/>mistakes,  simultaneously,  as  we  are  steadfast  in  our  resolve  to  safeguard  against  any  potential 
<br/>violation  of  laws,  reinforcing  the  relationship  between  business  facilitation  and  regulatory 
<br/>compliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this collaborative measures underscored education to creating 
<br/>a business landscape in Fiji that is both conducive to growth and in adherence to legal frameworks 
<br/>and I thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir to respond to the question in this august House 
<br/>this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to say that when the honourable Minister 
<br/>was speaking on this subject, it reminded me of 2019 and 2020 where the staff of the Ministry of 
<br/>Industry and Trade worked extremely hard to bring about this reform in the business licensing. So, 
<br/>all  that  was  done,  and  it  is  good  to  hear  that  it  is  continuing  so  this  is  another  initiative  of  our 
<br/>government the FijiFirst Government but we thank you for continuing with it as we say microwaving, 
<br/>so it is continuing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, my question to you is, there was a problem with the explosion of informal businesses 
<br/>that  were  operating  informally  from  residential  houses  and  the  issue  was  mainly  related  to  the 
<br/>registration of businesses/business registry and the problem was that they just gave an address and 
<br/>sometimes the address is residential address and they think that because the companies office have 
<br/>registered it under a residential address so I can operate from here and that was something that the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government was trying to deal with it.  So, if you can tell us whether any work 
<br/>has been done in that area because that is very critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in my response this afternoon, I was just emphasising on the economics of business management.  
<br/>It does not mean that it will continue with its process because there are some issues that have been 
<br/>raised by some of the councils that I had visited on the possibility of reverting to the old process.  It 
<br/>is something that we are also reviewing at the moment, and there is no guarantee that we will continue 
<br/>with the process and that is something that we are going to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we bring about changes, we need to look at all the stakeholders that are involved, one of 
<br/>the issues that some of these councils have forfeited is the fees from issuing business licenses and 
<br/>there are some other benefits that the councils went to do that actually centralised or even regulate 
<br/></span><span>their reducing of business licence. So, that is something that we are also going to consider and review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, on the issue of having difficulties with the registration of businesses, especially by 
<br/>those who live and do not have access to the internet and also for those who live in the outskirts of 
<br/>towns and cities, that is something that the Ministry of Trade and Commerce is working on right now 
<br/>with  our Ministry - an online platform that would be able to  include  all the stakeholders that  are 
<br/>involved in the registration of business because once we digitalise our process, we will be able to get 
<br/>all  the  information  on  one  platform  that  we  will  be  able  to  share  and  gather  information  that  are 
<br/>relevant and also necessary for those that are going to apply or those that are going to register online.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   MR. SPEAKER.- The question by honourable Sachida Nand has been made redundant in 
<br/>view of the statement made by the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  We will jump right to the 
<br/>eighth Oral Question for today.

<div><span>Labour Reforms Consistent with Labour Laws 
<br/>(Question No. 179/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on Labour Reforms consistent with the ideals and principles of the labour 
<br/>laws as required and set out by the International Labour Organization? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I rise to respond to the question and I  thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for asking.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the subject of labour reforms is quite substantial, and I intend to dwell 
<br/>on this topic in-depth when I present a Ministerial Statement in the next sitting.  However, for this 
<br/>response I am, therefore, going to be brief.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  Fiji  has  ratified  39  Conventions  and  one  protocol  of  which  nine  are  Fundamental 
<br/>Conventions, four Governance Conventions and 26 Technical Conventions.  The Fiji Government 
<br/>had incorporated the social justice principles of the 39 ILO Conventions and we have ratified into 
<br/>our  labour  laws.  These  Conventions  include  nine  out  of  ten  ILO  Core  Conventions  and  the  ILO 
<br/>Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, Protocol to the Occupational Health 
<br/>and Safety Convention and four Priority ILO Conventions of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice 
<br/>for a fair globalisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wanted  to  take  you  back  to  2006  when  you  and  I  were  both  in 
<br/>Parliament. You were a Minister; I was with the Sector Committee on Social Services and that is 
<br/>when the Employment Relations Bill came to Parliament.  This Bill came to Parliament after seven 
<br/>to ten years of discussion amongst the ERAB Members as well as the Government and we had six 
<br/>laws that were consolidated to develop the ERA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill went through major consultations with all the stakeholders through the Employment 
<br/>Relations Advisory Board.  The Bill was passed by Parliament unanimously. So, you and I both must 
<br/>get credit for that.  You and I both are owed some pension. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Maybe, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this  process,  the six  different  components 
<br/></span><span>were put together in one document. While the Bill had been passed by Parliament, it could not go 
<br/>through Senate, so it became, instead of ERA, it was ERP 2007 when it was implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The best part was that this law ensured that the rights of all the different stakeholders were 
<br/>equally respected and catered for. It was acclaimed as a law that was in line or in compliance with 
<br/>the standard principles requiring the minimum standard to be met by the ILO Conventions that we 
<br/>had ratified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thereafter, the unilateral amendment that came through the interim regime, 
<br/></span><span>the onslaught on the workers’ rights by way of a Decree after Decree and then in 2015 the elected 
<br/>government  further  exacerbated  it  by  passing  some  laws  and  extending  the  Essential  National 
<br/>Industries (ENI), at lease that we are going to discuss tomorrow; the workers lost out totally. There 
<br/>was nothing left for them in terms of seeking justice. We are all aware of the kind of harassment that 
<br/>union leaders went through. Yours truly is one of them by the way.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2139 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Shame, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, then the Fiji Trades Union Congress had no option 
<br/>but to seek assistance from the ILO.  Somehow, honourable Usamate seems to have a very blurred 
<br/>idea about ILO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- He says, we are following, we are doing things because we are being 
<br/>told, we are following those Conventions that we are signatory to.  We made a commitment and after 
<br/>that we made sure that as per the requirement, those laws are enshrined in our labour laws. That is 
<br/>how Conventions work.  When you are a member of an international organisation like the ILO where 
<br/>there are 187 countries, there are those countries that he had alluded to who may not have signed, but 
<br/>they are the best of thriving democracies where everyone’s rights is fully respected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. J. Usamate interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- They are fully observing the rights of the people.  We are amongst those 
<br/>countries who signed, and we come back and then we breach. There is no point in signing when you 
<br/>do  not  want  to  follow  it.  The  bottom  line  is  that  we  were  depriving  our  own  people  of  their 
<br/>fundamental rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  And  they  are  fully  responsible  for  that.    They  are  100  percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsible!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2016 when the Direct Contact Mission which is a very high-powered 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mission, was going to come to Fiji, the former Attorney-General himself scurried to Geneva… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  …brokered  a  deal,  signed  an  agreement  and  witnessed  by  the  then 
<br/>Director General of ILO – a big photo in the dailies with the tripartite partners and he is standing 
<br/></span><span>there, came back to Fiji and forgot about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were a few changes made here and there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Very good , very good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I know, deep in their hearts, all those three Labour Ministers who were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there, they sympathised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Their conscience will prick them all their lives because they were saving

<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- </span><span>Areh!  </span><span>You talk too much, </span><span>reh</span><span>?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are only undoing what they did, correcting and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going back to what existed prior to 2007 where people enjoyed their full rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- High cost of living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we go through the full labour law amendments, 
<br/>we will go through all the amendments that they made to deprive us of our rights as workers and 
<br/>restore that.  We also are signatories to the SDGs - SDG8, which fosters decent work and sustainable 
<br/>economic growth, where workers’ rights must be respected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- $5 an hour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me answer that one too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now in the process, ERAB is going to sit after this, we are going to get the 10  Wages 
<br/>Councils  that  they  had  disbanded  and  are  coming  back  and  the  minimum  wage  is  going  to  be 
<br/>determined through the ERAB.  We are working closely with the Ministry of Finance to complete 
<br/>that exercise. We will complete that exercise.  First the minimum wage, then the minimum wages for 
<br/>the 10 Wages Councils which they had disbanded, we are putting back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, their conscience will prick them all their lives. There

<div><span>will be more tomorrow, Sir.
