<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Report  of  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the review of the Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 
<br/>Annual Report.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2093 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review was made in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(c) which 
<br/>mandates the Committee to look into the issues related to forestry, agriculture, mining, environment, 
<br/>fisheries, water and marine services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all support the work undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, given 
<br/>its significance in terms of food and nutrition security and, most importantly, in terms of the social 
<br/>and economic benefits.  We thank the Ministry for their commitment and the support provided by 
<br/>Government and all honourable Members of this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just are few issues that I wish to highlight, I will go straight into some of the key issues that 
<br/>I raised in my foreword, the utilisation of funds.  There was a significant increase in funds from 2017-
<br/>2018 to 2018-2019, about $20 million plus, but then when it comes to the utilisation of the budget, it 
<br/>was under-utilised, as well for various reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Opposition! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am sorry to interrupt you, are we on the same page here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Sir,  I  have  presented  the  report,  no  one  has  seconded,  so  I  am 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taking the ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, I was a bit surprised that you continued.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sorry, Sir!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The copy of your text that is in front of me, there is still a lot to be read out, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, but you have done the last bit by presenting the report, and that is the ultimate goal here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(5),  I  hereby 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that the debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence 
<br/>Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  Fiji  Financial  Intelligence  Unit’s  (FFIU)  contribution  towards 
<br/>building a stronger legal, institutional, operational and regulatory environment on AML/CFT in Fiji 
<br/>that  addresses  domestic  risk  of  money  laundering  and  complies  with  the  minimum  international 
<br/>standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In its findings, the Committee noted that FFIU has Memorandums of Agreement in place with 
<br/>several local and international stakeholders which enabled them to exchange information regarding 
<br/>suspicious transactions or possible money laundering activities, gain direct access to FFIU database 
<br/>including second staff with FFIU.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It further noted that in addition to scams, tax evasions were found to be the other top possible 
<br/>underlying criminal activity identified in the Suspicious Transactions Report. Sir, FFIU investigated 
<br/>cases where businesses had not lodged their income tax returns since 2006 and cases where business 
<br/>owners had not registered their business with FRCS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee expressed its concerns on the increase in online scams, pyramid schemes by 
<br/>using mobile money wallets and international debit cards to facilitate various online scams in 2021 
<br/>and 2022. Members of the Committee would like to urge the general public to be vigilant and ensure 
<br/>that they do not fall prey to malicious scams of such nature which would lead to losing their hard-
<br/>earned money and savings. The Members feel that at present there are no coordinated approach to 
<br/>deal with scams and money laundering and that law enforcement agencies need to take action swiftly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A timely report to FFIU from financial institutions can assist in taking quick action. There is 
<br/>a lack of a single agency taking responsibility for ensuring that these scams are filtered out in its 
<br/>initial  stages  and  exposed  to  the  public.  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  extend  our 
<br/>appreciation to the Director of FFIU and his team for being prompt in answering the various queries 
<br/>and questions raised by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I would like to thank our Committee Members who are part of the team that produced 
<br/>this  Report  -  Deputy  Chairperson,  honourable  Sashi  Kiran;  honourable  Tomasi  Tunabuna, 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Semi Koroilavesau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I submit the Consolidated Review 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report of the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit Annual Reports to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.

<div><span>Review Report - National Fire Authority 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.– Mr. Speaker, this morning, I am pleased to present the 
<br/>Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the National Fire  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2095 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Authority  Annual  Report  for  the  seven-month  period  ended  31</span><span>st</span><span>  July,  2016.  This  review  was 
<br/>undertaken in accordance with Standing Orders 109(2)(b) which mandates the Committee to look 
<br/>into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  was  referred  the  National  Fire 
<br/>Authority Annual Report for the seven-month period ended 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 on 17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.  
<br/>As per the normal process of report scrutiny, the Committee was mandated by Parliament to review 
<br/>the Annual Report and report back on its findings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee would like to commend the work carried out by the National Fire 
<br/>Authority (NFA) in responding to emergencies and being able to perform to its level best.  In addition, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, NFA ensured the effective and efficient provision of fire rescue and emergency services 
<br/>whilst pursuing the completion of its capital projects which are the Korovou, Korolevu, Seaqaqa, 
<br/>Taveuni and Savusavu Fire Stations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>devastated most parts of the country during that year.  This did not 
<br/>deter  NFA  from  playing  its  key  role  but  continued  to  assist  the  emergency  partners  in  providing 
<br/>timely assistance to the National Disaster Management Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  also  commendable  to  note  that  Government  continues  to  support  NFA 
<br/>through capital grants for expansion of its essential services to every community in both the urban 
<br/>and the rural centres.  To see firsthand and witness the operation of one of the essential services, the 
<br/>Committee undertook a site visit to three fire stations namely, Korovou, Levuka and Korolevu. The 
<br/>Committee held </span><span>talanoa </span><span>sessions with officers of the three fire stations and compiled its findings and 
<br/>also sought clarifications that assisted the Committee to make its recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for putting the 
<br/>Report  together  -  honourable  Ratu  Rakuita  Vakalalabure,  honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  honourable 
<br/>Parveen Bala and honourable Viam Pillay for their invaluable input and support.  I would also extend 
<br/>my deepest appreciation to honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Penioni Ravunawa, as Alternate 
<br/>Members of the Committee on several occasions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also extend my gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer of the National 
<br/>Fire Authority, Mr. Sowane Puamau, and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all honourable Members to take note of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I remind honourable Members to, please, switch off all cell phones 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when in Chambers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(5),  I 
<br/>hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without a notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I beg to second the motion.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual 
<br/>Report.    The  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  was  referred  the  Public  Rental  Board  2020 
<br/>Annual  Report</span><span> </span><span>on  27</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2023.    As  per  the  process  for  report  scrutiny,  the  Committee  was 
<br/>mandated by Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through its findings, the Committee commends the work performed by the 
<br/>Public Rental Board (PRB) for the year 2020.  It was noted that for the year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2020, 
<br/>the PRB recorded an operating profit of $1.5 million in its revenue collection. The PRB has recorded 
<br/>profits in its books, despite the economic crises that significantly impacted on its business.  Although 
<br/>it was a difficult year as the global pandemic reached our shores, this did not deter PRB in achieving 
<br/>its mandate which was set 33 years ago, to provide affordable rental accommodation to low income 
<br/>earners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PRB is evolving and modifying its products and services to adapt to the 
<br/>changing environment.  It continues to provide affordable and accessible housing to all Fijians, for 
<br/>instance, upgrading of facilities in Kalabu and on Kia Street, Raiwai, in the Central Division, as well 
<br/>as the development of the three-storey building in Simla, Lautoka, in the Western Division.  Sir, new 
<br/>projects  for the PRB include Namelimeli in  Navua and Waitovu in  Ovalau, which are still in the 
<br/>approval process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee witnessed firsthand the work of PRB and its mandate to develop 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>affordable and low-cost housing for Fijians, despite the challenge of capital funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a new initiative that is still under the proposal phase is the Rent to Own 
<br/>Home Scheme.  This Scheme will assist interested first home buyers in owning properties and will 
<br/>assist PRB tenants to graduate from being a tenant to a homeowner.  Although the annual review was 
<br/>for  2020,  the  Committee  acknowledged  the  current  data  and  information  provided  by  the 
<br/>stakeholders.  This assisted the Committee in its review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, commend the work that is carried being out by PRB and extend 
<br/>my deepest gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Timoci Naleba, and his staff, for their timely 
<br/></span><span>assistance in this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social 
<br/>Affairs – honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Parveen Bala 
<br/>and honourable Viam Pillay, for their valuable input and support in the compilation of this Committee 
<br/>Report.  I also extend my deepest appreciation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to honourable Ketan Lal, who was 
<br/>an Alternate Member on certain occasions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all honourable Members to take note of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
