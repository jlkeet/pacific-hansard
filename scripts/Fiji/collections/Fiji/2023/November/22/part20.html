<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF YOUTH AND SPORTS 
<br/>2019-2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Ministry of Youth and Sports 2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 2020 Annual Report which was tabled on 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  core  responsibilities  are 
<br/>focussed on facilitating Youth and Sports Development through the establishment of a conducive 
<br/>policy environment that provides strategic support systems, initiatives for personal development and 
<br/>character building, sports policy implementation and community based youth-led programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  two  core  programmes  coordinated  and  facilitated  by  the  Ministry  of  Youth  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Youth  Development  -  this  programme  centres  on  the  provision  of  assistance  to  youths 
<br/>through advisory empowerment and capacity building including specific skills training. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Sports  Development  -  the  programme  focuses  on  the  development  of  sports  and  its 
<br/>infrastructure  nationwide  through  the  provision  of  grants  to  the  Fiji  National  Sports 
<br/>Commission,  the  National  Sporting  Organisations  and  Fiji  Sports  Council  as  well  as  the 
<br/>provision of basic sports equipment and the development of rural playing field.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the financial year of 2019/2020 was the beginning of an extremely challenging 
<br/>era  and  the  Ministry’s  rapid  response  plan  in  the  wake  of  the  global  pandemic  through  the 
<br/>announcement and implementation of the youth farm initiative programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry continued with  its programmes under the Youth Empowerment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme and simultaneously carried out the implementation of the Civil Service Reforms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  continued  conducting  accredited  training  at  its  five  youth  training  centres, 
<br/>mobile skills training continued to be rolled out across the four Divisions and there was a notable 
<br/></span><span>increase in the number of youth attending these trainings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  development  of  sports  is  ongoing  with  the  Ministry  through  close 
<br/>collaboration  with  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  (FNSC).    In  raising  our  sporting  standards, 
<br/>experts were brought in to enhance the participation of youth in local and international sports.  In 
<br/>addition, the Ministry also conducts programmes through its own initiative targeting youth groups. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years the Ministry continued to uphold an all-inclusive approach 
<br/>towards sports development in the country and ensure that all Fijians receive equal access to sports 
<br/></span><span>and sporting facilities regardless of gender, background or ability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and before I offer 
<br/>the floor, I also have a list before me provided by the Whips.  The first speaker from the Opposition 
<br/>will be honourable Viam Pillay, then we will alternate to the honourable Minister for Youth before 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal and then it is honourable Assistant Minister for Women to round it off.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023             Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, you are speaking honourable Ketan Lal as I have got your name on the list here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Sir only for five minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Five minutes is too little for you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Okay, because you love heckling from the back  there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  make  my  remarks  on  the  findings  of  the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  which  conducted  its  review  of  the  Ministry  of  Youth  and 
<br/>Sports Annual Report 2019 – 2010.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were few Committee findings that the Committee compiled during the 
<br/>deliberation.  These were students dropping out of training centres due to financial constraints, peer 
<br/>pressure, home sickness and disciplinary issues.  To enable a 100 percent graduation of students, the 
<br/>Ministry  worked  on  including  a  parent’s  day  at  Youth  Training  Centres.    The  Ministry  also  in 
<br/>adopting a collaborative approach with the NGO to address peer pressure while providing guidance 
<br/>to youths through training and continuous monitoring from respective divisions which is ongoing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is also having partnerships with its stakeholders, for example, a Memorandum 
<br/>of Understanding (MOU) with the iTaukei Affairs Board for the respective provincial councils to 
<br/>support  development, iTaukei youths inclusion of programmes such as leadership training by having 
<br/>guest  speakers  at  Youth  Training  Centres  to  provide  guidance  and  inspire  youths  to  become 
<br/>successful through the programmes offered and permitting a second chance to the school dropouts 
<br/>for course completion in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the courses offered in different Youth Training Centres, there is a need for the 
<br/>Ministry to diversify the courses offered online with current market demands.  As such, the Ministry 
<br/>is  continuing  to  innovate and explore opportunities with  the stakeholders  to  diversify the courses 
<br/>offered at  the current  facilities and to  work with  Civil  Society Organisations (CSOs), faith-based 
<br/>organisations  and  other  stakeholders  in  addressing  student  dropouts  and  increase  the  number  of 
<br/>graduates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Review, the Committee highlighted various areas that needs to 
<br/>be strengthened by the Ministry and relevant recommendations formulated for resolution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  years  the  Ministry  had  continued  to  uphold  an  all-inclusive 
<br/></span><span>approach towards sports development in the country and ensure that all Fijians receive equal access 
<br/>to sports and sporting facilities regardless of gender, background or ability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the core roles of the Ministry of Youth and Sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is, there are two core roles, one is on Youth Development and second on Sports Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Youth and Sports aims to accelerate sports development in 
<br/></span><span>Fiji by encouraging the promotion of sporting activities through effective networking relationships 
<br/>with communities, voluntary groups, local authorities and national governing bodies such as the Fiji 
<br/>National Sports Commission, the Fiji Sports Council and Boxing Commission of Fiji.  For the past 
<br/>six years, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has been allocated a budget of around $95.2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2023-2024 Financial year the Ministry has been allocated a total 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div>
<div><span>2178 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report  22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget  of  $19.5  million  to  further  expand  and  enhance  sports  development  programmes  whilst 
<br/>simultaneously  ensuring  that  adequate  investment  is  being  made  into  the  upgrade  of  sporting 
<br/>infrastructure around the nation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Youth and Sports also continues to ensure that our youths, 
<br/>the  future  leaders  of  tomorrow  are  empowered  and  that  necessary  capacity  building  trainings  are 
<br/>made available to allow them to improve the individual livelihoods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Youth and Sports continues to ensure that youths in various communities 
<br/>around the nation have accessed conducive sporting facilities and necessary sporting equipment made 
<br/>possible through partnerships with local clubs and schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the Ministry prioritises the development and training of Fijian youth through 
<br/>youth capacity building  and training programme that develop youths life skills for their personal, 
<br/>mental and spiritual development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has five Youth Training Centres around the country namely Nasau in Sigatoka, 
<br/>Yavitu  in  Kadavu,  Naleba  in  Macuata,  Naqere  in    Savusavu  and  Valelevu  in  Suva.    The  various 
<br/>trainings that are covered under this programme include the following Mobile Skills Training, Youth 
<br/>Coast  Care  Club,  Empowerment  Training,  Youth  Group  Registrations,  Youth  Outreach  and 
<br/>Monitoring Youth Entrepreneurship and the Youth Volunteers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These training programmes provide a learning environment for young people that may extend 
<br/>beyond boundaries or classrooms and incorporate the wealth of knowledge and experiences from the 
<br/>experienced trainers.  All training offered at the Youth Training Centres by the Ministry are free of 
<br/>charge and it gives a second chance for our children who have dropped out from formal education.  
<br/>The Ministry is working very closely with the Fiji National University to deliver specialise courses 
<br/>for our youth around the country that will prepare them for employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  talk  about  the  impact  of  sports  development,  sporting 
<br/>infrastructure with assistance of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the following are identified as 
<br/>impacts on the ground: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase in physical activity and sports participation. The smartest way to tackle 
<br/>NCDs and other health issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to invest in sports infrastructure, 
<br/>sports facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  accessibility of  sporting facility is  the  best way to  address  activities among 
<br/></span><span>youths in red zone areas in our urban centres is to invest in sports facilities as well. 
<br/>When we engage our youths to sports activities, they are able to come out from other 
<br/>activities.  The creation of Sports Associations in communities. Sports Development 
<br/>Programme has also assisted the establishment of Community Sports Association 
<br/>and that has been noted to be established around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I wish to highlight here is on the impact of sports on the ground and that 
<br/>it  has  created  income-generation  and  the  marketability  of  our  sports  people.    When  we  invest  in 
<br/></span><span>sports,  we  are  investing  in  sporting  facilities,  and  it  not  only  provides  income-generating 
<br/></span><span>opportunities,  but  creates  a  pathway  for  our  sports  people  to  excel,  to  be  marketable  and  gain 
<br/>employment.  Some of them got their contracts overseas and are now playing overseas because of 
<br/>sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  last  item  I  want  to  highlight  in  my  presentation:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  additionally  the 
<br/>Ministry continues to acknowledge the contributions made by elite sports personnel within the field 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023             Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2179 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of sports,  and the need to  establish the National  Academy.    I think it is  something  that had been 
<br/>pointed by the reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The need to establish the National Academy of sports is something that I wish to highlight in 
<br/>my  presentation  this  evening.    The  Cabinet  papers  for  the  establishment  of  the  National  Sports 
<br/>Academy, were prepared and presented to Cabinet through the Ministry of Youth and Sports in 2013, 
<br/>2014 and 2015.  Regrettably, Cabinet’s approval was not received.  But I wish to reassure Parliament 
<br/>again today that the Ministry of Youth and Sports, in line with its 5-year Strategic Plan, is working 
<br/>towards the establishment of the National Academy of Sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  their  Report,  and  I  support  the  motion  before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know it is quite late, I will try to be as quick as possible 
<br/>and finish within the five minutes.  I rise to contribute to the report that is before us, and I thank the 
<br/>Committee Members and the specific Ministry for their support in getting this report to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note one of the important recommendations that has come to this Parliament, and that is to 
<br/>continue and build on youth grant initiatives that will elevate and strengthen youth development in 
<br/>Fiji.  I also note that in 2019 and 2020 no new sports ground were developed and that is because of 
<br/>COVID-19 and lots of restrictions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, majority of our sports construction materials do come from overseas, and they are of 
<br/>different quality, and they are not made in Fiji.  But, as always, when I speak, I do get something up 
<br/>here.  It is important for us to focus on finding various avenues to strengthen our youth community.  
<br/>Our youth community is the future of Fiji, and I wished the honourable Professor Prasad would be 
<br/>present here but, unfortunately, he left.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  we  fast  track  to  2023,  our  young  people  are  worried  about  how  the 
<br/>Coalition Government will strengthen the youth development, because this Government is already 
<br/>making ill-advised decisions.  One of them is the regular constitutional breaches, and this is in relation 
<br/>to the recommendation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member you should be speaking on the content of the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is on strengthening youth development.  We 
<br/></span><span>need to find avenues and the youth are worried that the Government’s decision so far has not allowed 
<br/></span><span>them to have confidence in having the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Potholes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Not potholes but there are many other things. Youths are worried about 
<br/>the recent reshuffle by the Government. The recent vote at the UN, the recent decision on Japan’s 
<br/>Nuclear Waste Released and just today we highlighted an important issue about a social media app. 
<br/>which was used to share nude photos of girls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about the Ministry of Youth. It is our Ministry, it is for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>youth. They are there for the youths. It is the Ministry’s responsibilities to look after our needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  needs  to  make  sure  that  their  policies  must  be  youth-
<br/>focussed because youths are the future of Fiji. If the Government’s policies are not youth-focussed 
<br/>the youth will not have any confidence in the Government.  I urge the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report  22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Youth and Sports to continue the collaborations you have with youth organisations. You can also 
<br/>come to us. We can also give you some advice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said that there is a lot of ill-advised decisions by 
<br/>the Government, just like the reshuffle. We hope that there was no reshuffle but unfortunately the 
<br/>new Attorney-General, I am sorry the Attorney-General is still here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted before that our youths are the most important citizens 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have said that three times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. Sir, since you have picked up what I have said three 
<br/>times I hope the Government picked it up because they have called us a lot of names. Just a while 
<br/>ago I think, honourable Prasad called us looters. Unfortunately, we are youth MPs here as well. We 
<br/>are not looters. We are here representing the people and the youths as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words,  I  commend this Report to  Parliament and  I hope this  Government  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to work towards or for the youths, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  Opposition,  Ministers,  Assistant  Minister  and  Members  of  Parliament:  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to share some thoughts since the honourable Minister has 
<br/>covered a lot on what sports is doing for our youths.  Let me respond to the last Member who has 
<br/>talked about youths development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current Coalition Government is extremely concerned about youths and has done a lot 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within the last few months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Tell them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, the National Youth Policy was not updated since 2014 and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry had stopped working with the National Youth Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the current  Government this year the National  Youth Council has been recognised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an AGM planned later this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- The National Youth Policy has been approved by the Cabinet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Why Cabinet? Why not youths? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- For the National Youth Policy to be adopted it has to go through Cabinet. 
<br/>Maybe, you, I am not aware of that.  Youth can be very wide age range and needs a vision to ensure 
<br/></span><span>youth development programmes are relevant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I personally have been very inspired by the vision of the current  Youth  Minister who has 
<br/>taken  the  time  to  listen  to  the  National  Youth  Council  that  the  Ministry  had  previously  stopped 
<br/>working with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister also took his time to spend time with and listen to street kids living 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023            Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2181 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in a vacant house in Lautoka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, listening to a wide range of voices, the Ministry and 
<br/>the honourable Minister has evolved a wide range of programmes for youth. This year we saw the 
<br/>Ministry of Youth evolve youth fields in three districts encouraging unemployed youths to come and 
<br/>engage and learn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of iTaukei worked with the Ministry of Youth to try and encourage unemployed 
<br/>youths  to  attend  the  fair.  Training  institutes  and  employers  had  booths  and  enrolled  youths  in 
<br/>employment and training courses, a batch of street kids also joined the fair.  A hotel chain was able 
<br/>to get 130 CVs in the West from this youth fair, a construction company in Suva and another hotel 
<br/>in Suva said that they were able to recruit 30 youths each through this employment fair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Having  engaged  with  private  sector  the  Ministry  has  developed 
<br/>programmes relevant to the market, has created the database and employment pathways. Ministries 
<br/>have  open  its  doors  for  unemployed  youths  including  street  kids  to  its  programmes  and  training 
<br/>institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  Ministry  works  on  youth  development  through  sports  and  music  the  current 
<br/>Minister  has  ensured  youth  engagement  in  development  programmes  including  operationalising 
<br/>Kadavu Vocational Training Centre as a shared partnering with Fiji National University to offer 14 
<br/>market relevant courses. So I wish to commend the Ministry’s work under the visionary leadership 
<br/>of honourable Jese Saukuru that have  engaged in  a wide range of partnerships to  ensure relevant 
<br/>programmes for all youth in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to say thank you to the Committee for the report and I wish to support the motion, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the honourable 
<br/>Members that contributed to the motion before the House and I would like to also wish the honourable 
<br/>Minister a very best in taking on board the Committee recommendations and hope that the honourable 
<br/>Minister will take the Ministry to greater heights in future. With that being said Sir, I have no further 
<br/>comments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
