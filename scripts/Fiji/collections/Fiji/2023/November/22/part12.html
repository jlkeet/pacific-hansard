<div><span>Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All – APEC Leaders Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  good  morning  to  you  and  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Members and also, to our friends and those interested in the affairs of Parliament and the affairs of 
<br/>Fiji who have joined us in the gallery this morning, and those who are watching the live telecast of 
<br/>the proceedings of this august Parliament; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>.  I trust that life goes on and we are all 
<br/>enjoying it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would  like to start  on a solemn note to  announce the death  of a loyal 
<br/>servant  of  Fiji,  former  Secretary  to  Government,  Secretary  of  the  Public  Service  Commission, 
<br/></span><span>Ambassador and even Cabinet Minister, the late Poseci Waqalevu Bune, who passed away early this 
<br/></span><span>morning at the Nadi Private Hospital.  Earlier this week, we had one of our local daily newspapers 
<br/>highlighting the fact of the number of deaths due to prostate cancer.  I would like to reiterate the 
<br/>words of the writers of that article and the doctors who called upon men of Fiji to get clearance, get 
<br/>tested and make sure you are fine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our condolences go to the late Mr. Bune’s relatives.  I was fortunate to be able to divert my 
<br/>return journey on a recent visit to go and talk to him in the RSL Hotel in Lautoka.  He sounded very 
<br/>well and strong, but I knew he was not well.  So, our condolences go out to his relatives, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise today to report to this august Parliament on my recent participation in the 30</span><span>th</span><span> Asia-
<br/>Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Leaders’  Week.    I  was  invited  as  a  guest  economy  by 
<br/>President Joseph Biden - the President of the United States. Fiji is not a member of APEC, but we 
<br/>could  be  invited  by  the  Leaders  of  countries  that  are  members  of  APEC.    Last  week’s  meeting 
<br/>focussed on the theme, “Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All”.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the premier platform for the United States to advance its economic policies 
<br/>in the Asia-Pacific region has been APEC, for some time.  It promotes free, fair and open trade, and 
<br/>advances sustainable and inclusive economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 21 APEC Member Economies account for nearly 40 percent of the global population, 50 
<br/>percent  of  global  trade  and  more  than  60  percent  of  US  goods  exports.    Additionally,  Sir,  these 
<br/>economies have investments in the United States estimated at 1.7 trillion dollars and employing 2.3 
<br/>million American workers as of 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  APEC  2023  brought  Leaders,  Ministers,  the  private  sector  and  other 
<br/>stakeholders  together,  to  engage  in  discussions  on  the  global  challenges.    The  Leaders  Meeting 
<br/>provided a platform to advocate for immediate and urgent action to address the impacts of climate 
<br/>change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  addressed  the  Leaders  on  the  topic,  “Sustainability,  Climate  and  Just  Transitions  on 
<br/>Energy”.  Those who are going to the next COP meeting will be including the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition because he has been involved in these talks before and will continue this discussion 
<br/>at the COP discussions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Leaders to take affirmative action in terms of trade 
<br/>and investment, aligning our ambitions for a ‘Zone of Peace’.  I continue to promote that, Sir.  I first 
<br/>mentioned it at the UN General Assembly, and I am continuing to promote the “Zone of Peace” in 
<br/>the  Pacific  with  a  just  transition  towards  a  sustainable  future.    Fiji’s  emphasis  on  sustainability, 
<br/>climate, and a just energy transition is grounded in the imperative to protect our people, preserve our 
<br/>cultural identity and ensure economic stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given our high disaster risk profile and limited access to transformational technologies, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I appealed to APEC Leaders to aid the Pacific in addressing the immediate and urgent 
<br/>threats of climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our involvement in events like APEC is not merely symbolic but a strategic and pragmatic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approach to advancing Fiji’s interests and our development goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the Leaders Week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also participated in the Investor Forum of the 
<br/>Partnership  for  Global  Infrastructure  and  Investment  (PGII)  and  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic 
<br/>Framework  for  Prosperity  (IPEF)  Forum.    The  discussions  centred  on  collaborative  actions  to 
<br/></span><span>increase private investment in the Indo-Pacific region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji fully supports the vision of a greener global economy, as articulated under IPEF. That 
<br/>aligns with the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, emphasising the need for nations to 
<br/>coexist peacefully and collaborate on trans-boundary issues, including climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to realise that vision and respond to climate change, sustainable investment in 
<br/>infrastructure and innovation is imperative.  Our firsthand experiences with the effects of the climate 
<br/>crises, underscores the urgent need for coordinated actions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investment in resilient trade-related infrastructure, such as the trans-Pacific 
<br/>submarine cables as discussed yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-
<br/>operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications,  is  crucial  for  our  economic 
<br/>growth and regional economic integration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2099 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Google  commitment  to  investing  in  trans-Pacific  submarine  cables  is  a  promising 
<br/>development, enhancing capacity and fostering economic growth in Fiji and the Pacific region.  In 
<br/>line with these efforts, the Government is fast-tracking Fiji’s transition to a greener future, mobilising 
<br/>finance for green investments and exploring avenues to de-risk investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent launch of Fiji’s first (not FijiFirst) Sovereign Blue Bond, the bond 
<br/>issue  was  oversubscribed  three  times.  We  were  hoping  for  $20  million  and  $60  million  was 
<br/>subscribed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, agreements forged and partnership established through IPEF are pivotal to 
<br/>enhancing  our  integration  into  the  global  economy  and  advancing  the  goals  of  the  Blue  Pacific 
<br/>Continent.  Interestingly, Sir, when I asked the honourable Deputy Prime Minister if he knows how 
<br/>much capital we have locally available, he said that it would be a very good idea if we can do another 
<br/>one, and then another one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  sidelines  of  APEC,  a  bilateral  meeting  was  conducted  with  His 
<br/>Excellency President Xi Jingping of the People’s Republic of China.  That was before I challenged 
<br/>him and President Biden to get together again and talk about peace in the world.  I said that when 
<br/>everyone was sitting around, listening, and they all smiled with hope.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That bilateral, Mr. Speaker, Sir, presented a valuable opportunity to enhance our economic 
<br/>and diplomatic ties with China.  We have had diplomatic relationship with China since 1973.  Before 
<br/>that, we had it with what we now know as ‘Taipei’ because they were the China when Fiji became 
<br/>independent.  But when the United Nations recognised the People’s Republic of China as ‘China’, 
<br/>countries  and  governments  around  the  world  switched  their  recognition  of  China  from  Taipei  or 
<br/>Taiwan, to the People’s Republic of China, now known simply as China. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>China’s  global  initiatives,  notably  the  Belt  and  Road  Initiative,  align  with  our  nation’s 
<br/>development agenda.  President Xi’s Global Development Initiative provides a timely call to action, 
<br/>to address the challenges hindering the progress to implement sustainable development goals.  We 
<br/>commend China’s unwavering commitment to tackling climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) stands out as a transformative force that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can empower nations to shape their own destinies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also support China’s Global Security Initiative aimed at establishing a diplomatic and 
<br/></span><span>security architecture based on multilateral treaties, alliances and institutions.  We intend to participate 
<br/></span><span>in those, in our promotion of the Pacific as a regional zone of peace.  That aligns with my advocacy 
<br/>for the “Pacific as a Zone of Peace”, reflecting our shared vision for global security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  reaffirmed  our  commitment  to  the  One-China  Policy,  the  cornerstone  of  our  formal 
<br/>diplomatic relations for nearly five decades.  China’s recent contributions to Fiji include the COVID 
<br/>recovery  package,  grants  assistance  for  infrastructural  rehabilitation,  and  the  establishment  of  a 
<br/>regional centre for Juncao Technology, that have been pivotal to Fiji’s post-COVID economic  
<br/>recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  navigate  economic  challenges,  discussions  are  underway  to  address  our  debt  crisis 
<br/>responsibly.    A  key  focus  for  Fiji’s  sustainable  economic  growth,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the 
<br/>comprehensive upgrade and expansion of our infrastructure, particularly the modernisation of port 
<br/>facilities  and  shipyards.    I  anticipate  potential  collaboration  with  China  in  that  endeavour,  given 
<br/>China’s globally competitive shipbuilding methods.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  my  capacity  as  Minister  responsible  for  climate  change  and  environment  (for  the  time 
<br/>being),  I  expressed  keen  interest  in  learning  from  China’s  experience  in  industrial  recycling 
<br/>processes, particularly in Guangdong Province, a province we have had a very long association with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had a Tripartite Meeting with the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister and the President of 
<br/>Indonesia, President Joko Widodo.  On the sidelines of the meeting, we had that meeting and the tail-
<br/>end of that, I got invited by the President of Indonesia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The meeting marked a significant step in addressing regional concerns, particularly regarding 
<br/>West Papua.  Our discussion with President Widodo focused on fostering dialogue and expressing 
<br/>respect for the sovereignty of States. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister James Marape, and I, were recently appointed as Special Envoys to Indonesia 
<br/>by the Melanesian Spearhead Group and the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, to go and talk to the 
<br/>leadership of Indonesia about the plights of our kinsmen of West Papua, who are Melanesians like 
<br/>us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, APEC as a multilateral forum, provided the opportunity to hold 
<br/>crucial bilateral even trilateral meetings to promote our nation’s interest as well as free, fair and open 
<br/>trade to foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I extend my gratitude for the support of this august House and look forward to furthering our 
<br/>nation’s growth and prosperity through continued engagement on the international stage.  There has 
<br/>been a lot of anti-trip comments and I will address that in the motion later on today, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I open the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his 
<br/>designate  for  the  reply,  it  would  be  remiss  of  me  not  to  show  our  appreciation  to  the  great 
<br/>achievement that the country of Fiji has gained.  They have been invited to attend the APEC meeting, 
<br/>not as a member but they have been invited and the amount of goodies that you brought back to the 
<br/>country from that particular meeting and the side meeting is something to be acknowledged.  So we 
<br/>thank you sincerely, honourable Prime Minister and your Government for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the Ministerial Statement by 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister, I also wish to pay tribute now, knowing that the late Poseci Bune has 
<br/>also passed on.  We do convey our sincere condolence as well to his family for the sad passing of 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Bune.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to pay tribute to the passing of the late Justice Kamal Kumar who, unfortunately, 
<br/>was called home yesterday in the afternoon and we also convey our sincere condolences to the family 
<br/>- his son who is here in Fiji and, of course, to his wife and son who are in Brisbane, Australia.  They 
<br/>were sons of Fiji who have contributed significantly, and we are with their families during this time 
<br/>of sorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to welcome our friends from Australia who are here in Parliament, and we hope 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that they will enjoy their short stay here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do appreciate, honourable Prime Minister, the statement that you have made yesterday. I 
<br/>know for a fact that there were some anti-comments, but it is vital that Government, your Office and 
<br/>all the agencies of Government are aware of the trips and the reasons behind it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I 
<br/>say this because when the request was made by Government to cancel last week’s Parliament sitting, 
<br/>I raised, “why do we need to cancel this Sitting?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2101 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reasons that were given by the Leader of Government Business in Parliament said, “Oh, 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister is attending the MSG Meeting, the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders 
<br/>Meeting and preparation for COP28”, but in the evening news before that, we have already seen the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  landing  in  the  Cook  Islands.    He  has  had  his  meeting  with  the  MSG 
<br/>Leaders and, of  course,  with  the Pacific  Islands  Forum. So, it took  place  a week before we were 
<br/>supposed to sit which was last week. The COP 28 is going to be happening next week, so we do not 
<br/>see the logic behind it, but we understand the importance of such meetings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, this is your responsibility, and we support you because 
<br/>this is beneficial for Fiji.  Fiji is punching above its own weight when it comes to our representation 
<br/>in the international forum.  You have alluded to it yesterday, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, through 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are small, we do not have much to influence in terms of political power, in terms 
<br/>of economic power, but it is about relevance.  How do we make ourselves relevant in the context of 
<br/>the global issues that are happening?  Of course, we need to take into consideration our interests, 
<br/>values and perceptions - that is very critical, and you have highlighted on a few of it this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know how important trade is.  We are living in a globalised world where connectivity, 
<br/>not only in terms of trade but customs and traditions, and there are so many impacts that are being 
<br/>brought about by globalisation.  So how are we adapting to the changing environment?  This is the 
<br/>relevance that I am talking about, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Multilateralism,  at  some  stage,  was  questioned,  particularly  when  it  comes  to  the  global 
<br/>issues.  Is multilateralism still effective?  That is where our hope is as small island countries.  We 
<br/>have been able to attend G20 meetings.  Although not a member of APEC, we have now been invited.  
<br/>This is the level of representation, and it is a challenge for everyone here in this Parliament because 
<br/>when  you  go  to  global  forums,  they  see  Fiji  differently  and  we  need  to  rise  to  that  and  that  is  a 
<br/>challenge  for  all  of  us  -  the  benefits  that  we  get  out  of  it.    But  when  it  comes  to  sustainable 
<br/>development and resiliency, money is not everything.  I will say that again, money is not everything.  
<br/>What are the values that we want to protect?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you have been talking about a region of peace.  Of course, 
<br/>we need that peace, but how can we have peace when our very life is threatened because of climate 
<br/>change?  Your  statement  in  Australia  on  fossil  fuel,  particularly  coal,  compromises  our  position 
<br/>according to the Suva Declaration which was one of the key issues that we took with us into the Paris 
<br/>Agreement in COP and that also landed up in the text of the Paris Agreement.  This is the interest 
<br/>that we want to protect.  We need them, but at the same time, let us be honest with the issues that we 
<br/></span><span>bring, particularly because we have a responsibility, not only for the people of Fiji, but for the people 
<br/></span><span>of the region - sustainability and resilience.  That is why our position must always be emphasised 
<br/>regardless of the gains and the benefits which we need because of our development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note, I am quite worried that the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has decided not to go to COP28.  This is a responsibility that he should not and could not delegate.  
<br/>He has to take it by the horn and lead it from the front, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because this is the single 
<br/>and existential threat that is really going to be the biggest worry, not only for Pacific islanders but 
<br/>globally, particularly the Small Island Developing States (SIDS).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  talked  about  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea</span><span> </span><span>(UNCLOS)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>yesterday and Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (BBNJ).  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a huge 
<br/>problem  about  internal  displacement  and  forced  migration.    That  is  a  biggest  concern  for  Pacific 
<br/>Islanders  today.  What  happens  if  Tuvalu  goes  under  water?    What  happens  if  Kiribati  goes 
<br/>underwater?  What happens to their sovereignty?  What will happen to their migration?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  internal  displacement  and  forced  migration  are  issues  that  our  Leaders 
<br/>should take to COP because it threatens our existence.  That is the region of peace that we want. How 
<br/>can we have peace when we are threatened?  Human right is about life, we have a right to life and 
<br/>that is the issue that we want to take and fight for, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our relationship with China is very important - the One China Policy and let us stick to that.  
<br/>It is not that we have neglected it, honourable Minister for Fisheries, it is not that we have treated 
<br/>China as a karate kid.  China was with us when all our friends and partners deserted us,  so let us 
<br/>maintain the One China Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are thankful to the MSG for appointing the honourable Prime Minister and Prime Minister 
<br/>James Marape.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we respect the sovereignty. but at the same time, it is 
<br/>our interests and values that we need to bring as well and we wish Prime Minister James Marape and 
<br/>our honourable Prime Minister every success in the meetings with Indonesia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That basically is what I wanted to say on the motion this morning on the Statement by the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister.    Again,  we  appreciate  the  work  undertaken  by  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  the  gains  that  we  get  out  of  it,  but  let  us  not  make  compromises,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>because in the end, we will be answerable to every Fijian and every Pacific Islander on the issue of 
<br/>the right to life, resilience and sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition, for that interesting reply 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in your response to the honourable Prime Minister’s Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to add on, honourable Prime Minister and honourable Members of the Government side, 
<br/>that is a very humble plea from the honourable Leader of the Opposition – our attendance in the next 
<br/>COP28 meeting and I sincerely hope that that humble plea will not fall on deaf ears. I am willing to 
<br/>step down and not lead my delegation in attending the COP28 meeting because of the climatic issue 
<br/>under IPU so that only two who are in charge of our Executive attend this very important meeting 
<br/>because we are worried about the plight of the Small Island States that has come out quite well in our 
<br/>recent meeting of the IPU in Angola as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The plight of our Small Island States is a bit too late, honourable Prime Minister, to go on 
<br/>this  emission  reduction  to  1.5  percent.  The  target  was  2  percent  but  as  we  speak  and  as  we 
<br/>contemplate things in these historic meetings, the islands are sinking.  Our neighbours are suffering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our taking over the Chair of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Leader of the Opposition and heavily supported by the Office of the Speaker is  just to  show our 
<br/>concern regarding the plight that we are in and I must convey here that we were quite fortunate that 
<br/>the  Australian  Federal  representation,  led  by  the  honourable  Federal  Speaker  of  Parliament, 
<br/>honourable Milton Dick, and supported by Senator honourable Deborah Mary O’Neil and a few  
<br/>others, that saw to this - raising and registering our concern regarding the plight of our Pacific people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 13 nations in the Pacific, and you have just come back from attending that meeting, 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  You even attended this APEC Meeting, being invited by the President 
<br/></span><span>of the United States, but this is another meeting that all of us who have been attending these side 
<br/></span><span>meetings have come to  realise that it is  a bit too late. The islands are sinking.  Our coastlines are 
<br/>sinking.    What  is  there  to  be  done?  It  can  only  be  addressed  in  these  very  meetings  that  we  are 
<br/>supposed to be attending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will attend, honourable Prime Minister.  But the plea from our side, it is now or never.  
<br/>The islands are sinking, and I plead very strongly to your good Office and to your goodself that our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial 
<br/>Statement and before I do so, I just want to confirm to this august Parliament and to your good-self, 
<br/>Sir, that the honourable Prime Minister has taken heed of the plea from the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition and that he will now attend the COP 28 Meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Cabinet  colleagues  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament;  I  rise  to  deliver  my 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on the issue of climate change and health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The relationship between climate change and health is undeniable and well documented such 
<br/>that climate change is now considered a single biggest health threat facing humanity of this century. 
<br/>Climate change contributes directly to humanitarian emergencies over the tropical storms, floods, 
<br/>heat  waves,  wildfires,  rising  sea  levels,  cyclones,  hurricanes  and  they  are  increasing  in  scale 
<br/>frequency and intensity. The impacts are already harming health through disease outbreaks, physical 
<br/>injuries and trauma from extreme weather events, forced displacement as mentioned by honourable 
<br/>Leader of Opposition, food insecurity, air pollution and pressure on mental health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services,  a  number  of  health  facilities  have  been 
<br/>identified since 2016 to be affected or at high risk from climate change impacts. Health facilities, 
<br/>such  as  Vatoa  Nursing  Station,  Ogea  Nursing  Station  and  Nayau  Nursing  Station  in  the  Eastern 
<br/>Division; Beqa Health Centre in the Central Division; Teci Nursing Station and Nacula Health Centre 
<br/>in  the  Western  Division;  and  Saqani  Health  Centre  and  Tukavesi  Health  Centre  in  the  Northern 
<br/>Division are affected by or at risk from rising sea levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A number of them have been identified for urgent relocation. Korovisilou Health Centre is 
<br/>amongst our facilities at risk from flooding, while Qamea Health Centre as you would have known, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, was destroyed by landslide and awaiting the construction of a replacement facility at a 
<br/>new site. Tonia Nursing Station  which was also  affected by landslide is  also  awaiting  relocation, 
<br/>while the nurses’ quarters have been relocated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  note  the  climate  change  impact  on  the  environment  around  our 
<br/>health  facilities  that  have  necessitated  the  need  to  consider  the  relocation  of  health  facilities  to 
<br/></span><span>improve  access  to  health  facilities  by  the  local  population.  Tokaimalo  Nursing  Station  in  Ra  is 
<br/></span><span>planned for relocation because the access bridge to the facilities have been damaged by flooding. 
<br/>Similarly, considerations are being taken for Laselevu Health Centre and Nasauvere Nursing Station 
<br/>in Naitasiri, given the assessed climate risks that exist for the current sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the impact on health infrastructure, every year the Ministry 
<br/>also continues to tackle multiple surges and outbreaks on climate sensitive diseases and leptospirosis, 
<br/>typhoid fever, dengue fever and diarrheal  diseases in  our population.  On the optimistic side, it is 
<br/>estimated that avoiding the worst climate impacts by meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could 
<br/></span><span>save about a million lives worldwide each year and helps prevent 250,000 additional climate-related 
<br/></span><span>health deaths per year worldwide from 2030-2050 mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and 
<br/>heat stress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the environmental and health impact within the Pacific region, Mr. Speaker Sir, for Fiji 
<br/>and the Pacific region, the impact of climate change on health is no longer a theoretical proposition, 
<br/>but a visible everyday living reality.  The devastation of severe tropical cyclones on human health,

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agriculture, environment, national and family economic health, and our social structures are inflicting 
<br/>its toll on our health and wellbeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rising sea levels are infiltrating arable land for farming and physical activity driving people 
<br/>towards  processed  calorie  dense  and  nutrient  poor  foods,  reducing  opportunities  for  physical 
<br/>activities, thereby contributing further to the NCD crisis and malnutrition status in our communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the visit of the Director General of WHO, Dr. Tedros, to Tonga in 2019, he was shown 
<br/>a playing ground in which Fiji and Tonga played their first 15s rugby test match in 1924, now fully 
<br/>submerged underwater from the rising tides, and unusable – a story not uncommon in our coastal 
<br/>communities! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Landslides from excessive rain have washed away homes and farms, and threatened whole 
<br/>communities that now warrant relocation, and inflicting additional emotional and mental trauma on 
<br/>its occupants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specifically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change impact on health is threefold: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The direct impact caused by weather or climate extremes, resulting in injuries and illnesses 
<br/>during  or  after  floods,  droughts,  windstorms  and  heat  waves,  and  worsening  the  health 
<br/>conditions of the vulnerable in our communities particularly in the elderly, children and 
<br/>babies, pregnant mothers, disabled, and those with chronic diseases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  encompasses  the  impacts  of  environmental  and  ecological  alterations  due  to  climate 
<br/>change that impacts the geographical distribution and intensity of communicable diseases 
<br/>that spreads by vectors, rodents, food and water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It relates to the diverse health impacts on mental and emotional trauma and stress caused 
<br/>by  social  disruptions  to  communities,  such  as  loss  of  belongings,  homeland  or  natural 
<br/>resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In tackling climate change and health, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our health systems are the main line 
<br/>of defence for populations faced with emerging health threats, including from climate change. To 
<br/>protect health and avoid widening health inequities imposed by the impact of climate change, our 
<br/>countries must build climate-resilient health systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Acknowledging that the climate crisis is a health crisis and taking its cue from the aspirational 
<br/></span><span>vision of the </span><span>1995 Yanuca Declaration on Healthy Islands</span><span>, Health Ministers of the Pacific have come 
<br/>together  over  the  last  three  decades  to  advocate  for,  plan  and  promote  mitigation  and  adaptation 
<br/>measures to tackle climate change impact on our health systems and communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 61</span><span>st</span><span> World Health Assembly in 2008 endorsed that Member-States should support the 
<br/>work on the protection of human health from risks related to climate change.  Since then, a number 
<br/>of critical global and regional mandates and initiatives such as the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Madang Commitment of 2009;  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Green Growth Framework for Fiji 2014;  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS)  Special  Initiative  on  Climate  Change  and  Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Pacific Islands Action Plan on Climate Change and Health 2018 have helped to highlight the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>impact of climate change and health in climate vulnerable regions such as Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2105 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The action plans acknowledge that Fiji like other SIDs are among the countries most affected 
<br/>by  a  range  of  acute  and  long-term  risks  caused  by  climate  change,  and  yet  make  a  very  small 
<br/>contribution to the overall global emissions. They also presented short-term and long-term actions 
<br/>and indicators along four strategic lines of action - empowerment; evidence; implementation; and 
<br/>resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, the five-year research project titled, “Piloting Climate Change Adaptation to Protect 
<br/>Human  Health”  (PCCAPHH)  undertaken  in  Fiji  and  six  other  participating  countries  -  Barbados, 
<br/>Bhutan, China, Jordan,  Kenya  and Uzbekistan  concluded amongst  its findings that Leptospirosis, 
<br/>Typhoid fever, Dengue fever and Diarrhoeal diseases (LTDD) were Fiji’s climate sensitive diseases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strong climate change political mandates such as the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement and 
<br/>the 2015 Suva Declaration where the leaders of Pacific Islands leaders called for increased support 
<br/>for adaptation measures that addresses all vulnerable sectors including health, water and sanitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COP 26 meeting in Glasgow, United Kingdom in 2021 was an additional 
<br/>step forward in bringing human health to the forefront of climate change work with the UNFCCC 
<br/>for the first time including two key programmes to support countries in developing climate resilient 
<br/>and low carbon sustainable health systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of slow implementation, unfortunately, despite the high level 
<br/>of  political  attention  and  commitments  and  many  countries  identifying  health  as  a  priority  sector 
<br/>vulnerable to climate change, a significant financing gap remains.  Necessary actions to safeguard 
<br/>healthcare facilities and build climate resilience are delayed.  These actions include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Relocation of health facilities that are at risk from rising sea levels, floods and landslides; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Retrofitting of existing health facilities to become more climate resilient; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Repairs and refurbishment of facilities affected by cyclones; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Reducing carbon emissions from health facilities through prudent utilisation of medical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>products and improved medical waste management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the global level, public and private climate finance have doubled from 2011 to 2020 and 
<br/>is  estimated to  have reached up to  $940 billion in 2021.  However, Mr.  Speaker, Sir, less than 2 
<br/>percent of multilateral climate finance goes to health projects, and this needs urgent addressing at  
<br/>global  and  national  level  as  well.    The  mainstreaming  of  health  considerations  in  climate  change 
<br/>discussion and considerations at  all levels  nationally and globally  over the last decade have been 
<br/></span><span>slower than what is required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In talking about Fiji’s actions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>acknowledges the work of all the previous governments on this important health determinant and is 
<br/>continuing its effort to address the impact of climate change on the health system and the health of 
<br/>the population in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to talk about the SHAPE project between the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and  Medical  Services,  World  Health  Organisation  as  the  project  implementer  and  KOICA  as  the 
<br/></span><span>funder with a budget of US$6.4 million was delayed in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic.  The 
<br/></span><span>pace of the project has picked up and the outputs will contribute to the protection of the health of 
<br/>Fijians from the adverse effects of climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the intervention sites, the SHAPE project will be looking after:

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.19 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  shall  now  continue  and  I  now  call  on  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Good morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to respond to the 
<br/>Ministerial Statement provided to us this morning by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical 
<br/>Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  climate  change  has  become  a  fancy  word  locally,  regionally  and 
<br/>internationally.  Climate change came out during Fiji’s Presidency to the COP and aligned to the 
<br/>SDGs  and  I  hear  the  Ministers  in  their  speeches  using  the  words  “climate  change”  in  all  their 
<br/>undertaking. So, it is out of Fiji’s Presidency to the Paris Agreement that we can create a milestone 
<br/>in the area of climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to  the honourable Minister’s Statement this morning Sir, climate change, he 
<br/>rightly  mentioned  comes  in  many  shapes  and  forms.    In  fact,  climate  change  posed  significant 
<br/>challenges to the Fijian healthcare system including the relocation of facilities in vulnerable areas 
<br/>identified by the Ministry of Health due to sea level rise and landslide and flooding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires attention from various aspects including funding 
<br/>and disaster resilience.  Many of the identified facilities for relocation as alluded to by the honourable 
<br/>Minister this morning are primary healthcare facilities.  Again, this poses a pressing concern as rising 
<br/>sea level can damage existing infrastructure.  I thank the honourable Minister for identifying nursing 
<br/>stations and health centres that are affected by the climate change Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I hope that 
<br/>the honourable Minister will be given the critical support in restructuring new facilities and ensuring 
<br/>smooth transition of the healthcare services that are provided in the various stations in the affected 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Securing  funding,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  such  endeavour  is  crucial  for  government  and 
<br/>international agencies.  The honourable Minister mentioned about KOICA support in the SHAPE 
<br/>Project  for  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services.    They  play  a  pivotal  role  in  providing 
<br/>financial resources to support the relocation of health facilities.  It is essential to allocate adequate 
<br/>funds to cover not only the construction of new infrastructure, but also essential equipment, supplies 
<br/>and staffing required to maintain the uninterrupted healthcare services during and after the relocation. 
<br/>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  disaster  resilience  must  be  a  key  consideration  in  designing  and 
<br/></span><span>constructing new health facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate  change  increase  the  frequency  and  intensity,  natural  disasters  like  hurricanes, 
<br/>cyclones and storm surges, therefore these facilities should be built to withstand events ensuring the 
<br/>safety of patients, staff, critical medical equipment and also incorporating the features like reinforced 
<br/>structure  at  a  level  that  will  minimise  the  risks  identified  and  also  the  robust  emergency  service 
<br/>system  are  essential  components  of  disaster  resilient  health  facility.    I  know  that  the  previous 
<br/>government had adopted the new building code to build back better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, physical infrastructure, capacity building is also important and the preparedness 
<br/></span><span>for  healthcare  who  will  be  manning  the  stations.    So,  the  training  of  healthcare  professionals, 
<br/>emergency  response  team  to  handle  climate  health  challenges  and  coordinating  with  the  local 
<br/>communities and authority and developing response plans are vital to ensure the healthcare services 
<br/>can effectively adapt to changing environmental condition.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2109 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addressing  the  impact  of  climate  change,  there  is  a  need  for  the  relocation  of  health 
<br/>facilities, as mentioned.  It encompasses good financial support, disaster resilient, capacity building, 
<br/>stakeholder  collaboration,  climate  change  mitigation  in  various  sectors  like  transport,  energy, 
<br/>housing  and  agriculture  which  are  critical,  to  strengthen  collaboration  with  health  sector  on 
<br/>addressing the impact of climate change on health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important innovation in multi-sectoral policymaking is the shared 
<br/>practical  lessons  that  are  learnt  and  practised  to  strengthen  action  on  climate  change  mitigation, 
<br/>adaptation and health system resilience.  In recognising and investing in these key areas, then only 
<br/>we can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on the medical services and healthcare and 
<br/>ensure the wellbeing of our Fijian community are not affected with the rising sea level in Fiji and 
<br/>other vulnerable region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the whole of Government, especially the Ministry of Finance, to look into the provision 
<br/>of  funding  to  accommodate  the  proposed  mitigations  strategies  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Health and Medical Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recent Developments in the iTaukei Land Trust Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I .VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  members  of  the  public  who  are  here  at  the 
<br/>gallery and those who are listening from home, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I rise to present the Ministerial Statement on the recent developments in the 
<br/>iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB) in 2023, a year marked by groundbreaking decisions and actions 
<br/>in favour of iTaukei landowning units and tenants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Board today has a vision for Fiji, where every iTaukei landowner thrives, 
<br/>where our youth’s future is financially secure and where our cultural heritage is firmly preserved.  
<br/>This vision is not just a dream, it is a future that the iTLTB is actively working towards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently,  some  iTaukei  communities  face  uncertain  land  ownership,  under-utilised 
<br/>economic  potential  and  a  need  for  empowering  our  youth  and  landowners.  We  seriously  need 
<br/>transformative actions to turn the tide.  Mr. Speaker, in  response, we have implemented strategic 
<br/>measures to address these situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTLTB has successfully processed and amended 101 Schedule A and B 
<br/></span><span>cases, securing land ownership for iTaukei communities of over 6,660 hectares. This strategic move 
<br/>not only safeguards our land, but also promises substantial annual lease revenue of $100,915.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  our  bold  venture  into  overseas  investment  with  Morgan’s  Financial  Limited 
<br/>represents  a  significant  diversification  of  our  portfolio,  promising  maximum  returns  and  aligning 
<br/>with  our  custodian  responsibilities.    As  a  careful  steward,  iTLTB  is  committed  to  enhancing  the 
<br/>financial  assets  of  the  landowning  units.    For  this  reason,  we  have  chosen  to  pursue  offshore 
<br/>investments as a strategic approach to fund growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have established a sinking fund to empower landowners in acquiring 
<br/>commercial properties, demonstrating our commitment to their financial independence and growth.  
<br/>The sinking fund is  designed to  assist  landowning units in  repurchasing leases when they expire, 
<br/>providing reliable financial support system for our landowning units to buy back those leases.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under this initiative, the iTLTB recently assisted </span><span>Mataqali Etuba </span><span>of Sigatoka to purchase an 
<br/>expired lease within the Sigatoka Town area.  The property was acquired for $360,000, including a 
<br/>two-storey building in the heart of Sigatoka.  Other ventures are being planned with landowning units 
<br/>in  Ba,  Nadi,  Rakiraki,  Nausori  and  Labasa,  to  become  property  owners  within  Central  Business 
<br/>Districts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to save iTLTB from the annual rent of $1.3 million for its Offices throughout 
<br/>Fiji, the iTLTB has moved to acquire its own properties to house its regional offices.  Any excess to 
<br/>the Board’s need, would be commercially rented out for extra income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for increased visibility and improved accessibility to our services, iTLTB 
<br/>has initiated the opening up of our sub-regional offices.  The first has been opened in Nabouwalu, 
<br/>with others being planned for Keiyasi, Taveuni and Vuda.  This initiative will be of great help to 
<br/>numerous  tenants  around Fiji,  who  currently have to  travel  long  distances to  access our services.  
<br/>Further,  the  Board,  while  awaiting  the  establishment  of  sub-regional  offices,  has  organised 
<br/>roadshows where customers are able to select their land on the spot and are given their offer letter on 
<br/>the same day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB, through its Board, has also approved the increase in title holder 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>distribution to the traditional leaders, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turaga i Taukei</span><span> – 3 percent; 
<br/></span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> – 5 percent; and 
<br/></span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span> – 7 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB has shifted the investment of minor’s funds from Home Finance 
<br/>Company  (HFC)  Bank  to  the  Unit  Trust  of  Fiji  (UTOF),  securing  higher  returns  and  ensuring  a 
<br/>successful  future  for  our  youth.    The  allocation  of  40  percent  of  these  funds  for  educational  and 
<br/>medical needs, while preserving a bigger amount of 60 percent for their adulthood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Empowering  our  youth  through  accessing  their  funds  for  crucial  educational  and  medical 
<br/>needs is not just a policy, but an investment in our future. By allowing minors to use these resources, 
<br/>we are not only addressing their immediate needs but also laying the foundation for a healthier and 
<br/>a more educated generation - the foundation of our nation’s future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our effort to correct and amend lease boundaries for pine plantations, we 
<br/>have returned valuable overplanted land of 553 hectares to 74 landowning units in the Bua Province, 
<br/>enhancing their economic potential.  This was in response to the longstanding appeal of landowning 
<br/>units for the return of overplanted pine land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  collaboration  with  stakeholders,  such  as  Lion  One  Limited,  has 
<br/>encouraged economic growth, job creation and big returns for landowners. This demonstrates our 
<br/>commitment to sustainable development.  On 10</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, we witnessed the first gold pour at 
<br/>the  Tuvatu  Gold  Mine.    The  Gold  Mine  is  not  just  a  beacon  of  hope  for  our  landowners  and 
<br/>employees, but also a good source of revenue for our Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the crux of this progressive report may be predominantly landowner 
<br/>focussed, we have also devised a number of programmes of assistance for our tenants.  This includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the staggering of premium payment due to financial difficulties faced by the tenant; 
<br/>opportunity to stagger arrears if facing economic hardship; and 
<br/>tenants are advised to take the opportunity to visit iTLTB Office for any assistance required.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the endorsement of open contracts for iTLTB staff marks a new era of job 
<br/>security  and  motivation,  fostering  a  more  efficient  and  productive  workforce.    Aligning  with 
<br/>Government policy, we have raised the retirement age to 60 years, reflecting our commitment to our 
<br/>staff’s wellbeing and experience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, our increased engagement with landowners confirms our dedication 
<br/>to our core role.  This engagement and dedication demands a robust human resource backbone.  The 
<br/>iTLTB  has  undergone  major  human  resources  changes,  positioning  qualified  and  experienced 
<br/>personnel in key positions. The Board has also approved a 2 percent reduction in iTLTB operational 
<br/>cost to 8 percent, in view of the forecasted improved financial performance.  These measures are not 
<br/>just steps but leaps towards a future where </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land ownership and management will contribute 
<br/>significantly to our nation’s prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  let  us  embrace  this  change,  support  our  youth,  secure  our 
<br/>landowners’  future,  improve  our  services  to  our  tenants  and  propel  Fiji  towards  a  prosperous 
<br/>tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement made by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs in relation to the recent developments 
<br/>done by the iTLTB this year, which I really commended iTLTB for, together with its trustees and 
<br/>interim CEO as well as the honourable Minister.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB should always stick to its mandate under section 4 of the iTaukei 
<br/>Land Trust Act 1940, which is to administer land for the benefit of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners and that 
<br/>should remain intact.  This includes utilisation of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land and also to assist landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister, for he has continued from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where the previous Government has left off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- I really commend the honourable Minister for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen that now, iTLTB has moved ahead to purchase properties for 
<br/></span><span>the landowners which I am really delighted for.  In the past, the previous Government has started off 
<br/></span><span>with land subdivisions for the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners.  We have seen that in Wairabetia, Tavua, Vuda 
<br/>and lately, in Namata, Tailevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the SEED Fund Grant where landowners have grown wealth from the resources 
<br/>that they own, I really thank the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, together with iTLTB.  However, I wish 
<br/>to comment on the honourable Minister’s statement in regards to financial security of youth of to 
<br/>indigenous community or the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, particularly on the issue of equal lease distribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe the removal of equal lease distribution made by the Government is so quick, it should 
<br/></span><span>have  been  treated  cautiously  by  the  honourable  Minister,  together  with  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs, as well as the iTaukei Land Trust Board.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have seen that in the equal lease 
<br/>distribution, at least, some funds are reserved for those who have not reached 18 years.  So, once they 
<br/>turn18, there is something for them.  They can use it for their education or to buy what they want.

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, with the current projection that has been made by the honourable Minister, there is 
<br/>no clear indication as to how these funds will benefit the youth of indigenous community or </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>youth, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Lately, in my area, a </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span> managed to purchase a car from 
<br/>his grandson’s savings once his grandson reached 18 years old.  He went with his grandson and just 
<br/>purchased a car from his savings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the issues I wish to bring to the attention of the honourable Minister, which 
<br/>I think the Ministry of the iTaukei Affairs as well as iTLTB should look into - the future of iTaukei 
<br/>youth in this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Listen honourable Members!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge iTLTB, together with all the staff, to come up with 
<br/>innovative ideas.  I really like this new funding initiative which is available now for landowners in 
<br/>terms of purchasing properties.  However, the problem is that there is less capital resources for the 
<br/>landowners. They should go ahead purchase more tractors, diggers and bulldozers. We cannot take 
<br/>the knife and keep on cutting grasses in the village.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Time has changed, Mr. Speaker. During their time we used cane knives. Now with our age 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coming up we need tractors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now the cooperatives in Ra we thank the honourable Manoa Kamikamica for giving us a new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tractor for our cooperative so that it goes with the time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the second tractor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  again  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei Affairs for his Statement this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Niudamu, thank you for acknowledging the second tractor.

<div><span>Appointment of the University Review Committee  
<br/>by the Higher Education Commission of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/></span><span>Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, fellow honourable Members of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and ladies and gentlemen: I warmly greet you all this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  brief  this  august  House  on  the  recent  appointment  of  the  five-
<br/>member  University  Review  Committee  by  the  Higher  Education  Commission  in  Fiji  on  5</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>November, 2023.  This independent intentional and comprehensive evaluation of universities is done 
<br/>to ensure that our Government commitment to world-class education is not only in words but also in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>action.    There  are  legislations  that  we  are  bound  by,  and  it  is  through  those  legislations  that  this 
<br/>comprehensive review will be completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  appointment  of  the  Review  Committee  Members  was  based  on 
<br/>consultation  and  recommendations  of  the  Higher  Education  Commission  of  Fiji  in  line  with  the 
<br/>Higher  Education  Act  2008.    The  purpose  of  the  University  Review  Committee  is  to  assess  and 
<br/>evaluate  the  overall  performance,  progress  and  quality  of  a  university  including  its  educational 
<br/>programmes,  faculties,  facilities  and  administrative  processes.  The  Committee  ensures  that  the 
<br/>university is meeting its educational objectives and maintaining academic standards and it may also 
<br/>make recommendations for improvements and changes.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is well-documented that 
<br/>a university review should take place regularly to ensure that the institution remains aligned with its 
<br/>goals  and  objectives.    The  frequency  of  these  reviews  will  depend  on  the  specific  needs  and 
<br/>requirements of the university and are often conducted every few years or on a cyclical basis.  In Fiji 
<br/>this review has lapsed due to COVID-19 that impacted the university review in several ways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  pandemic  has  led  to  widespread  disruptions  in  higher  education 
<br/>including shifts to online learning, changes in enrolment patterns and financial challenges. Part of 
<br/>this review will also need to consider evaluating the university’s response to the pandemic and its 
<br/>ability to adapt to the changing circumstances. The terms of engagements of the Committee I have 
<br/>been  advised  by  the  Board  Chairperson  that  the  review  will  be  completed  six  months  after  their 
<br/>appointment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Higher Education Commission of Fiji is mandated under Section 7 of 
<br/>the Higher Education Act, 2008 to register, review and renew the registration of Higher Education 
<br/>Institutions (HEI) including the three universities offering post-secondary qualifications and training 
<br/>in Fiji.  Under Section 9 of the Act and Section 36 to 45 of the Higher Education Regulation 2009, 
<br/>and institutions registered with the Commission shall be reviewed for quality assurance periodically.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Review Committee was established in accordance with the following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provisions of the Higher Education Act 2008 and Regulations 2009. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Commission  under  Section  8  of  the  Higher  Education  Act  can  establish 
<br/>Committees consisting of its Members and other people it considers appropriate to assist 
<br/>it in the performance of its functions and under Section 12(4) of the Act the Commission 
<br/>may  occasionally  appoint  such  other  officers,  employees,  consultants,  agents  or  other 
<br/>personnel as it thinks fit for effective performance of its functions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the position of the Ministry of Education and the Higher Education 
<br/>Commission of Fiji that any review of the Higher Education Institutions cannot be done in isolation 
<br/>of the industry and consumers. Industry and consumers are core stakeholders and beneficiaries of 
<br/>Fiji’s  Higher  Education  Sector.  In  other  words,  consumer  and  industry  perspectives  on  the 
<br/>experiences of how they have benefitted and we would like to see the future of Higher Education 
<br/>Institutions in light of the dynamically changing labour market and consumer expectations. The latter 
<br/>is imperative because Fiji aims to develop its TVET sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consumers  have  had  a  negative  perception  that  TVET  is  not  an  area  of  consideration  for 
<br/></span><span>children. This review therefore aims to hear from parents, guardians, teachers and stakeholders and 
<br/>ensure  that  we  have  a  clear  awareness  programme  that  create  industry-demanded  pathways  for 
<br/>graduates of the TVET programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  historically  it  is  viewed  that  Higher  Education  Reviews  have  become 
<br/>academic-oriented  or  academic-focussed  with  committees  dominated  by  academics.  In  such 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committees  there  is  little  or  limited  weight  given  to  industry  and  consumer  perspectives  and 
<br/>expectations and such reviews are abstract from reality and practice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Higher Education  Institutions need to  produce graduates that meet  consumer and industry 
<br/>needs, enhance consumer and industry welfare and impact public policies in more than one way. For 
<br/>these reasons, Fiji’s Education Review Committee is different and departs from ancient thinking. The 
<br/>Committee is broad ranging: it has only two academics, it consists of civil society representatives 
<br/>and  experts  that  not  only  represent  industry,  but  it  also  captures  consumer  perspectives.  The 
<br/>Committee’s composition is fair and therefore, innovative and unique and sets a new approach to 
<br/>reviewing institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Equally importantly, the Terms of Refence  allows the Committee to  consider and appoint 
<br/>technical  subject  advisors  to  assist  in  reviewing  and  assessing  programme  materials  and  learning 
<br/>resources. It is envisaged that the Committee will use its power intentionally to promote the quality 
<br/>of its works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just briefly allow me to introduce the Committee Members:

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have outlined clearly to this august Parliament, the appointment process, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the purpose and the intention of the University Review Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of Education will continue to engage 
<br/>with our universities and our regulator (the Higher Education Commission of Fiji) to ensure that we 
<br/>build  our  capability  to  world  class  standards.    I  believe  this  review  exercise,  the  critical  legal 
<br/>requirement that will enhance our strengths as well as one of learnings of areas that we need to work 
<br/>more collaboratively in and this review process is part of the commitment to ensuring that we remain 
<br/>relevant and competitive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, I wish to extend our deepest appreciation to the members for 
<br/>agreeing to be part of this process and we look forward to receiving a comprehensive report when 
<br/>the review is completed in six months’ time and we anticipate the cooperation and collaboration of 
<br/>all stakeholders in this process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delivered by the honourable Minister for Education and I thank him for his Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  external  reviews  are  good  intentions  for  tertiary  education  in  nation 
<br/>building, however, fundamentals need to be corrected first otherwise it is the same as building a roof 
<br/>without the foundation.  The roof will continue to collapse, the fundamentals or imperatives that I 
<br/>want  to  talk  about  is  Higher  Education  Commission  Fiji  and  the  composition  of  expertise  of  the 
<br/>review committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Higher Education Commission Fiji is to be partly responsible for the issue 
<br/>that we are faced with today.  They regulate quality and relevance in the country.  I want to ask the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  to  first  review  the  effectiveness  and  performance  of  Higher  Education 
<br/></span><span>Commission Fiji and see they are operating within their mandate.  At this point in time, I want to 
<br/></span><span>draw attention on the requirements to be a Commission Chair at Higher Education Commission Fiji.  
<br/>The  Act  is  very  clear  that  one  should  have  post  graduate  qualifications  and  tertiary  education 
<br/>experience.  Does the current Chair meet the requirements?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need someone as chair of Higher Education Commission Fiji with good 
<br/>qualification  and  vast  tertiary  education  experience  because  the  Commission  has  fundamental 
<br/>responsibilities which include establish national  standards for different  qualifications,  oversee the 
<br/>review process of higher education institutions, provides assurance that the programme developed 
<br/></span><span>by the institutions meet national standards, foster cooperation amongst higher education institutions 
<br/></span><span>and  linkages  between  Higher  Education  Institutions  and  Industry,  maintain  a  database  of  higher 
<br/>education information.  So honourable Minister Sir, your intention to carry out external review of the 
<br/>three  universities  is  good  for  the  country,  but  please  fix  Higher  Education  Commission  Fiji  first 
<br/>which is an imperative to review three universities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also feel that the Higher Education Commission Fiji should align the progression of students 
<br/>from  secondary  schools  to  the  universities.    This  week,  I  saw  a  handing  over  of  a  report  of  the 
<br/>scholarship and a way forward plan for three to five years by Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Service 
<br/>(TSLS).  Out of interest, I googled and found the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  report  is  done  by  an  international  expert.    The  report  is  crystal  clear  that  quality  and 
<br/>relevance is  the big  issue in  the programmes offered by the three  Universities.   The employment 
<br/>market information is showing that the programmes offered by the universities are not relevant or 
<br/>are outdated and do not match the unfolding and emerging skillsets required in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What else? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my concern on the composition 
<br/>of the Committee to review universities namely; the University of Fiji, Fiji National University and 
<br/>University  of  the  South  Pacific.    The  academic  members  come  from  only  Australian  University, 
<br/>Monash and who are both members of the same school of this institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- There are many other renowned universities in Australia... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- …which are highly ranked.  Why are both members of the Committee 
<br/>from the same university?  How was the Committee chosen?  How will they assess the broad range 
<br/>of discipline and programmes offered by the three universities?  It is a matter of concern.  Moreover, 
<br/>Monash and Fiji National University are tied up in a project. Here is a clear case of conflict of interest 
<br/>and inherent bias in the choice of Monash University staff to carry out a supposedly independent 
<br/>external review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  members  on  the  Review  Committee  lack  university  governance  experience,  quality 
<br/>assurance knowledge and experience. I have also noted from the honourable Minister’s presentation 
<br/>that  no  one  has  been  a  Vice  Chancellor,  Deputy  Chancellor  or  Pro  Vice-Chancellor  and  the 
<br/>Committee also lacks expertise in the labour market.  Honourable Minister, my suggestion is to have 
<br/>a serious review of Fiji Higher Education Commission and relook at the composition of the Review 
<br/>Committee.

<div><span>Establishment of Fiji’s National Anti-Doping Organisations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Cabinet,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament;  thank you for the opportunity to make my Ministerial Statement.  
<br/>Before that, I wish to take this opportunity to wish Team Fiji well as they participate in the 2023 
<br/>Pacific Games in Honiara.  I also wish to thank Fiji’s Honorary Consul in the Solomons, all our Fijian 
<br/>population living in Honiara and the Fiji Military Forces for supporting Team Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought you were in the Solomon Islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- He just flew in this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to address this noble Parliament by 
<br/>providing  an  updated  report  on  the  establishment  of  Fiji’s  National  Anti-Doping  Organisation

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(NADO). The main objective of NADO is the proper implementation and compliance of the world 
<br/>anti-doping  agency  code  on  creating  a  more  accountable  framework  which  will  provide  strategic 
<br/>direction, guide and monitor clean sports and sports development in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The NADO will ensure that the rights of clean athletes is protected and that clean sports is 
<br/>promoted and practiced at all times. Doping undermines the fundamental values of sports such as 
<br/>health, fairness, commitment, integrity and equal opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given our geographical size, the sudden influx of illegal substances in Fiji 
<br/>has increased.  It is only a matter of time that athletes will resort to using illegal substances to enhance 
<br/>their  performance  in  their  respective  sports.    Doping  is  deceptive  and  harmful  to  athletes  as  it 
<br/>diminishes the sanctity of clean sports and undermines the rights of clean athletes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  budget  allocation  for  Youth  and  Sports  Development  provides  the 
<br/>necessary resources to establish the NADO and progressively as part of the Ministry’s strategic plan 
<br/>to equip us with the infrastructure, personnel and testing facilities required to effectively carry out its 
<br/>mandate.  The NADO is a new initiative and is independent to an extent of its operations.  A budget 
<br/>of FJ$386,700 was approved from the 2023-2024 Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are currently finalising the recruitment for a coordinator to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coordinate and assist the establishment of the NADO; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>develop, implement  and  update anti-doping  policies  and procedures in  accordance with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>international standards and regulations; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>develop  and  deliver  educational  programmes  to  athletes,  coaches  and  support  staff 
<br/>regarding the consequences of doping, the importance of clean sports and the anti-doping 
<br/>rules. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition,  the  NADO  Working  Committee  has  engaged  an  expert 
<br/>consultant who has already assisted in the completion of the outstanding 17 corrective actions by the 
<br/>World Anti-Doping Agency.  These corrective actions are critical in ensuring Fiji’s participation at 
<br/>international sanctioned tournaments such as the Rugby 15s World Cup that just recently concluded.  
<br/>With the completion of the corrective actions, the World Anti-Doping Agency has  given us until 
<br/>mid-2024 to successfully formalise the establishment of the National Anti-Doping Organisation and 
<br/>NADO Bill and the Ministry is working closely with Drugs Free Sports Fiji to facilitate this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  important  aspect  of  this  exercise  is  the  development  of  the  NADO 
<br/></span><span>legislation. This is currently under review with the Office of the Solicitor-General and the World 
<br/>Anti-Doping Agency hence  after the legislation  has been finalised by the Office of the Solicitor-
<br/>General, a public consultation will be conducted prior to Cabinet approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an unprecedented development, not only for Fiji but for the Pacific 
<br/>with the central and specialised organisations to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies in 
<br/>Fiji.    The  rights  of  clean  athletes  will  be  protected,  and  clean  and  fair  sports  will  be  effectively 
<br/>promoted and practiced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  Fiji  taking  the  lead  in  sports  development  in  the  Pacific,  establishing  NADO  will 
<br/>enhance  our  position  and  reach  to  the  Pacific  region.    Fundamentally  it  will  protect  the  right  of 
<br/>athletes to participate in doping free sports and thus promote health, fairness and equality for our 
<br/>athletes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also  wish to pay tribute to the late Mr. Sitiveni 
<br/>Moceidreke.    Mr.  Moceidreke  participated  in  the  100  yards  and  200  yards  in  the  1960  Rome 
<br/>Olympics. In 1962, he also participated in the Seventh Commonwealth Games.  Mr. Moceidreke is 
<br/>from Viseisei, Vuda, and we take this time to honour him for his contribution to sports in Fiji. We 
<br/>wish the family all the very best, for a life so important to Fiji in the name of sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have labelled our response to the honourable 
<br/>Minister’s  Ministerial  Statement  as  titled  "Clean  Athletes,  Clean  Sports  for  a  Safe  and  Peaceful 
<br/>Community”.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2010, Fiji became the 150</span><span>th</span><span> nation to ratify the UN Treaty against the practice of doping in 
<br/>sports. Since then, much has progressed and has been done by the previous government. So, I am so 
<br/>thankful to the Government and the honourable Minister’s update and statement today to complete 
<br/>the exercise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Olympics stature, Sir, in the Olympics we have gained two Gold and one Bronze through 
<br/>clean athletes and clean sports.  In our response this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have extracted 
<br/>three important thoughts: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Sports as a nation builder; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Sports as an industry; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Sports as a foreign policy tool.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the establishment of this National Anti- Doping Organisation for Fiji is timely indeed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports as a nation builder, the next or the future generation, if they are well and clean, we 
<br/>have a degree of certainty for our future. When I say clean, they are healthy, they are not into all sorts 
<br/>of other things to keep them clean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports as an industry, this can become as we have witnessed as a major export commodity.  
<br/>We have witnessed that through remittances and we continue to see that in the future if we are able 
<br/>to direct the right energy and resources in ensuring that our commodity in this particular case, our 
<br/>athletes are clean. There will be a greater demand for much more Semis and so forth, to name one in 
<br/>this particular industry in sports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports as a foreign policy tool, there is huge potential in sports as many other countries have 
<br/>used to use sports as the basis of establishing, promoting and sustaining good relationship.  We have 
<br/>a huge potential in this particular area, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for peaceful relations which we have heard the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister talking about a peaceful zone, the Pacific region which is peaceful Fiji can 
<br/>contribute to this in a major way through clean athletes and clean sports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we sit this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we  heard from the honourable Minister conveying, 
<br/>we also would like to convey our best wishes and congratulations to team Fiji in Solomon Islands, 
<br/></span><span>especially those that have progressed into team sports, semi-final status, those that have one medals 
<br/></span><span>and for me, in particular,  as the president of Basketball Fiji both the men and women’s teams are 
<br/>playing well.  I am sure the men are now in the semi-final status. We look forward for a successful 
<br/>outcome of their games.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Congratulations to the team.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dairy Industry in Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise this morning to speak on the Dairy Industry 
<br/>in Fiji and the support that Government offers to the Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited. Before I 
<br/>move into the statement proper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to some of the issues raised by 
<br/>my colleague, honourable Sachida Nand, yesterday regarding subsidies.  Subsidies are also offered for 
<br/>non-sugarcane crops like rice, cassava and dalo and also for ginger for the purchase of fertilizers and 
<br/>chemicals.  We are looking to extend that to other commodities in the next budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I talked about beef cattle, but today it is about dairy.    It is still the 
<br/>cattle business anyway. The dairy industry in Fiji is one of the critical agro-based industries that supports 
<br/>a significant number of farmers and farming families in the production of milk on a small and large scale. 
<br/>Government has a vision for a dairy sector that not only meets the nation’s milk demands, but also as a 
<br/>future strong player in Fiji’s socio-economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward, we plan to increase milk production, reduce the milk 
<br/>import  bill  and  expand  the  export  base  for  milk  and  dairy  products.  Let  me  say  that  there  is  a  huge 
<br/>potential for investment in the dairy sector as we rely heavily on imports to meet our domestic demand.  
<br/>In 2022, Fiji’s milk production was around 12 million litres.  While we imported around 7.2 million litres 
<br/>with a total national demand at around 22 million litres of milk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, as I have already alluded to, our vision is for the industry to expand beyond 
<br/>the borders of Fiji, with a commitment to position Fiji-made dairy products internationally beginning 
<br/>with our neighbouring Pacific Island Countries. Export opportunities include a diverse range of dairy 
<br/>products that focuses on value addition to meet the demands of consumers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has its core role to support the 
<br/>dairy industry.  To that end, the Ministry has allocated funds through a grant of $5 million to the Fiji 
<br/>Co-operative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL) for that very purpose - to improve the supply and 
<br/>quality of milk from our farmers. This grant support to FCDCL, apart from other interventions, is 
<br/>meant to address the fundamental issues facing the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  committed  to  assist  farmers  through  the  provision  of  support  services  in 
<br/>collaboration  with  FCDCL  on  areas  such  as  capacity  building,  infrastructure  development,  breed 
<br/>improvement, nutrition improvement, price incentive, feed subsidy, farm development, milk cartage 
<br/>and provision of veterinary and extension services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information  of Parliament, the honourable Assistant  Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture will elaborate on the Breed Improvement Programme for the dairy industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $2 million has been released by the Ministry for the following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>activities by FCDCL: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Operation and support for stock import; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Milk price top-up per litre to sustain costs; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>Cartage of milk from farm gate; 
<br/></span><span>Pasture establishment; 
<br/>Top 40 supplier subsidy on milking machine; 
<br/>Semi intensive machinery purchase incentive and water reticulators; 
<br/>Recruitment of Dairy Advisory Officers; and  
<br/>Hire of a registered Veterinary Officer.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2121 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCDCL bears the cost that is incurred in the milk collection process that 
<br/>directly benefits the smallholder farmers. This grant which pays for the collection costs allows milk 
<br/>cartage  contractors  to  collect  and  cart  raw  milk  to  the  chilling  centres.  Currently,  a  total  of  230 
<br/>farmers are assisted with this provision, and so are new farmers who are willing to supply milk to the 
<br/>chilling centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, livestock feed, such as soya bean meal and mill-mix is subsidised where 
<br/>farmers pay one-third, and the grant contributes two-third of the cost. This subsidy is based on the 
<br/>farmers’ milk production, considering the number of milking cows and calves.  A total of 368 farmers 
<br/>will be assisted - 240 from the Central Division and 128 from the Western Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recruitment of the four Dairy Advisory Officers in the Central Division 
<br/>will  further  strengthen  the  extension  advisory  services  to  the  dairy  farmers.  Their  role  includes 
<br/>assisting and advising farmers on good husbandry and management practices, such as calf rearing, 
<br/>feeding, breeding, recording and offering training for dairy farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Veterinary Officer based at FCDCL will ensure that veterinary services 
<br/>are provided to the industry stakeholders in a timely manner. The Veterinary Officer will also be able 
<br/>to  guide  the  Daily  Advisory  Officers  in  performing  minor  surgeries  and  administering  veterinary 
<br/>medicine.    This  position  will  also  ensure  smooth  collaboration  with  other  agencies,  in  particular, 
<br/>Biosecurity Authority of Fiji and the Ministry of Agriculture on the importation of dairy cattle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nutrition assistance will provide packages for farmers to invest in pasture 
<br/>establishment. The package will assist in land preparation, provision of fertilizer at a cost sharing 
<br/>basis and a total of 50 hectares of improved pasture is to be established under this activity.  Better 
<br/>quality pasture would mean better quality milk and increased milk production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Minister for Agriculture, I am also advocating the mass planting of juncao grass on a large 
<br/>scale for use as feed for livestock, especially in the intensive rearing, as alluded to by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister in his earlier speech.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, juncao grass is high in crude protein value 
<br/>and can be stored as fodder for a variety of livestock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for price incentive, all farmers will be paid 18 cents per litre top-up on their 
<br/>current production, effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023 on a weekly basis.  In the past 10 years, farmers 
<br/>were paid below their cost of production.  Thus, the industry was not able to recover.  The 18 cents 
<br/>top-up will lead to sustainable income for farmers, which will enable them to reinvest into their farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers will also  be  assisted with some incentive  and  water  reticulation 
<br/>packages to increase and also improve quality of milk.  Farmers will be assisted with line and portable 
<br/>milking  machines,  to  reduce  labour  cost  from  hand-milking,  and  water  supply  materials  for 
<br/>maintaining hygiene and quality of milk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  will  continue  to  support  the  dairy  industry 
<br/>through FCDCL and work closely with the industry stakeholders, such that the industry benefits all 
<br/>dairy farmers and the Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  for  providing  me  the  opportunity  to  deliver  this  Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, thank you and </span><span>dhanyavad</span><span>.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch.  When 
<br/>we return, the honourable Leader of the Opposition or probably the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/>for Agriculture will be elaborating more on the breeding aspect of dairy cows.  Yesterday, was to do

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Parliament resumed at 2.28 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  shall  continue.    Is  the  honourable  Assistant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Agriculture going to make another statement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, I request to present it on Friday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Leader  of  Opposition  or  his  designate  to  deliver  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I contribute to the Ministerial Statement by the 
<br/>honourable Minister, I would like to pay tribute to the late Chief Justice – Justice Kamal Kumar, who 
<br/>passed away in Suva yesterday.   Justice Kumar served the Judiciary, the nation and the people well 
<br/>and his contribution to the society is well noted.  Our condolences to his grieving family.  May God 
<br/>grant him eternal peace and may his soul rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the dairy sector, like the honourable Minister has said, holistic approach 
<br/>to the improvement of dairy is needed, and I am glad that this year, the Ministry has done a holistic 
<br/>approach.  They have contributed to animal health, animal feed, farm management, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was taken aback at the honourable Minister’s production figures. He mentioned that in 2022, 
<br/>they produced 12 million litres of milk. In Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL), I 
<br/>know the production figure.  Somehow, I think there was an error in their figure. I think they said 
<br/>they produced 6.07 million litres.  In 2023, they are expecting 5.39 million litres; in 2024, they are 
<br/>expecting 5.99 million litres (according to their draft Business Plan); and in 2025, they are expecting 
<br/>7.05 million litres.  So, 12 million litres is way above the target. I do not think the production is 12 
<br/>million litres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaving that aside, this assistance in the dairy sector cannot be here for a year and then left - 
<br/>it has to be continuous. There may be a selection of farms, you assist for one year and  monitor it for 
<br/>another two to three years.  The monitoring and evaluation of farms is missing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extension Officers or Dairy Advisory Officers  which the honourable Minister has spoken 
<br/>about,  need  to  be  on  the  farm.    They  need  to  monitor  all  these  assistance.  It  is  Government  and 
<br/>taxpayers’ money that is going to the dairy industry, so it has to be monitored.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know many farms where the barbed wire and fencing posts have been given to them but are 
<br/></span><span>still lying on the farm and has not been used. So, the taxpayers’ money has to be well utilised. Also, 
<br/>it has to be a controlled assistance so that assistance had to be given in phases. They complete one 
<br/>phase, then the other assistance should be released.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When assistance is given to the farmers, I would request the Ministry that the full assistance 
<br/>reaches the farmer. Part of it should not be taken as administration expense or a markup by the person 
<br/>delivering that assistance to the farmers. So, if feed is bought at $5 or $6 a bag at Flour Mills using 
<br/>Government funds, it should reach the farmer at $5 or $6 a bag, not at $8 or $9 a bag, making of 
<br/></span><span>margin in between.  The assistance is directed to the farmers and the farmers should receive it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCDCL  which  the  honourable  Minister  has  talked  about,  is  a  small  organisation  and 
<br/>according to their draft Business Plan, their salaries and wages budget is $450,000. It is quite big for 
<br/>a small organisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, uniforms, for example, is $9,000, so on an average it amounts 
<br/>to $400 to $450 per person.  I do not think they are buying blazers, ties and everything, so it is quite 
<br/>exorbitant. That needs to be controlled. This money should be directed to the farmers so that they

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can increase production, not used exorbitantly as administration expense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that the $5 million which the Government has allocated, every cent of that $5 million 
<br/>reaches  the  farmer  and  the  dairy  farmer  benefits  because  they  need  the  assistance.  They  need 
<br/>Government support, and they are willing to increase production, provided we assist them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, again, thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture for allocating that $5 million in his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry to the dairy industry, and I hope to see the dairy industry grow.
