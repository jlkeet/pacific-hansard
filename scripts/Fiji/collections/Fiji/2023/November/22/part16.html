<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Obviously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have never seen the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, only you’re confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The current Opposition which was back then the Government 
<br/>and Mr. Speaker, Sir, they cannot even up to this point further the fact that they are sitting in the

<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition.  I think it will take them four years to learn the Opposition role and maybe another four 
<br/>years before they become the real Opposition. The then honourable Leader of the Opposition now 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  then  Minister,  honourable  Faiyaz  Koya,  honourable  Parveen  Bala 
<br/>honourable Viam Pillay, honourable Mosese Bulitavu, honourable Semi Koroilavesau, honourable 
<br/>Alvick Maharaj and, of course, honourable Jone Usamate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Why you say my name? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth recalling what honourable Jone 
<br/>Usamate said on the day in support of the recommendations of the Emoluments Committee and I 
<br/>quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Ideally in an ideal world we would get an independent party to come but in this 
<br/>particular instance the Emoluments Committee has decided that  it will not  look  at  the 
<br/>remuneration but it must take into consideration those aspects of allowances that have an 
<br/>impact on the livelihood of how well the Parliamentarians themselves can carry out their 
<br/>roles”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what we are looking at today. This is what he said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Emoluments Committee and his suggestions is probably something people 
<br/>will not like it politically because it has an impact on how people reflect on Members of 
<br/>the House but it is something that needs to be done  because it has an impact on the 
<br/>ability of Parliamentarians to fully engage themselves in the process to which they are 
<br/>called in this House.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the voting record of the day for the motion on a so-called Emoluments Report 
<br/>of four Members of Parliament will prove that there were two votes against the increase.  And I can 
<br/>say very proudly honourable Prem Singh and I actually voted against the increases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  position  back  then  now  and  now  that  we  are  in  Government  remains  the  same.  It  is 
<br/>unethical and worst of all Members of Parliament to determine our own salaries and that is why, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, this Emoluments  Committee that this Parliament has appointed  is  engaging  independent 
<br/>experts to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  you  rightly,  Mr.  Speaker,  have  allowed  the  Committee  more  time  to  come  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report done fairly, transparently and in accountable manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am sure we all agree that the means for achieving the end is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, allow me to compare the new proposed rate of Overseas Travel Allowances and 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister has done that but let me just repeat some of those. This is in respect 
<br/></span><span>of the honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span><span>and Members of Parliament. Let us use the amount of US$300 per day and a conversion rate of $2.20 
<br/>from US dollar to Fiji dollar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Purely as an example of an UNDP rate which is the accepted standard for allowances. This, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, will demonstrate that the reduction is not a cosmetic exercise but then the Peoples 
<br/>Coalition Government is more than walking its talk of reducing salaries and allowances by 25 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2155 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent. It is actually much more than this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the current provisions of the Remunerations Act the Prime Minister will receive a daily 
<br/>overseas travel allowance of $2,910 under the new reduced rate. The allowance will be $1,320 per 
<br/>day.  This is a big reduction, Mr. Speaker, of $1,590. Even if you double the reduced allowance of 
<br/>$1,320 it does not reach what would be paid under the current provision which is $2,910 per day. 
<br/>Therefore, it is the reduction of not 25 percent but well over 100 percent and this is substantial. That 
<br/>is why the 250 percent loading on US dollars is being revoked and replaced with 100 percent. The 
<br/>$600 a day as Incidental Allowance is being removed altogether.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  case  of  Cabinet  Ministers,  Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  a  similar  scenario  and  again  the 
<br/>reduction is more than 100 percent. The honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, will get 
<br/>the same allowance as that of Ministers under the current provisions and as I said, it is the same as 
<br/>the Ministers. Assistant Ministers will receive the same allowance under the new provisions from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>December. So Mr. Speaker, it is very important for us to understand that this process that we have 
<br/>adopted, and the honourable Prime Minister explained why this has taken this much time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  been  blamed  for  benefitting  from 
<br/>exorbitant  travel  allowances,  but  it  is  only  justified.  You  know  if  you  look  at  the  previous 
<br/>government’s travel budget for the Prime Minister, the critics will have to understand.  Let me just 
<br/>give you some statistics, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Say it loud.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In the last eight years, they spent a total of $74 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  In  domestic  and  overseas  travel,  this  is  travel  cost  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>previous Government. The honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, is … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, I am just talking about the extent of the expenditure, and 
<br/>let me give them some facts.  From 2014 to 2022, total domestic travel of $50.4 million, for overseas 
<br/>travel from 2014 to 2022 - $24 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is the figures from the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is the figures from the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker it is quite interesting that the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition become so confused because he was part of the decision in 2016 to increase the 
<br/>allowance in a way that it became so exorbitant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is again, Mr. Speaker, absolutely important for us to remind those people on the other side 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that these are the very people who did not follow the process, who hid the information from the public 
<br/>and  here  is  the  Government,  here  is  the  Prime  Minister  who  at  the  beginning  of  the  term  of  the 
<br/>Government announced that we will be reducing the allowances and salaries. We have kept the 20 
<br/>percent reduction on the salaries as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am raising this Mr. Speaker because it is important for the people of this country to know, 
<br/>and the confusion that is coming from the Opposition. But tomorrow what they will do Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, when they go out, they will still go and talk about overseas trips.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ketan Lal posted it on his </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page.  He talks about the Prime Minister’s 
<br/>travel allowance, he talks about the $10,000 allowances. This is what they do but when they come 
<br/>here in Parliament they talk about the processes. The honourable Leader of the Opposition should 
<br/>actually look at what some of these Members of Parliament are writing and saying before he comes 
<br/>here in this Parliament and says …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. K.K. Lal interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  is  the  hypocrisy  that  I  am  talking  about  from  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is a very timely motion by the honourable Prime Minister, and I hope the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition will change their mind and they will support this motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Discipline Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.  Honourable Ketal Lal, I heard you very clearly when you uttered the 
<br/>words “hopeless Government”.  I want to caution you, again, please those who are seating on this 
<br/>side have received the mandate from the people to be on this side and as well as on your side, so let 
<br/>us respect it. There is no such thing as a hopeless Government.  I hope you will be mindful of that, 
<br/>honourable Lal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  all  the  honourable  Members  for  their 
<br/></span><span>contributions. I reiterate that the motion is for a reduction in the allowances and is based on section 
<br/></span><span>13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014. I read again section 13 and quote: “Parliament may 
<br/>issue separate determinations at different times for different positions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based  on  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  based  on  an  earlier  attempt  in  accordance  with  our 
<br/>promise to reduce our salaries and allowances, we tried earlier but we were advised to go about it 
<br/>this way while the Remunerations Committee continues its work.  That is why we have come up at 
<br/>this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those of us that started at the very bottom scale of our careers know the difficulties that are 
<br/></span><span>currently faced by those that are at the bottom rung of their careers. So, when you come to this age 
<br/>and to these positions and realise that you are comfortable, perhaps, too comfortable. In fact, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this issue was raised in Cabinet when I came back from my first trip to Kiribati, and I 
<br/>realised that I did not use the allowances given to me. I said, “what are these allowances for, why do 
<br/>we get them if we are not going to be needing them?” So, I asked the staff in the office and we have 
<br/>been working at it and we have arrived at this.

<br/>and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members for their contributions and because we are allowed 
<br/>to do that under section 13 of the Act, we brought it up this time and I am sure we will be voting, 
<br/>probably according to our party instructions, but, voting with a clear conscience that we are doing 
<br/>this, not only for ourselves but for the people who have a more difficult life than we are enjoying at 
<br/>this time.  I commend the motion to the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Just a point of clarification, again, honourable Members, on the mentioning 
<br/>of honourable Radrodro.  There were ae few of us in the Opposition then that did not agree to this 
<br/>rise in the allowances. That included  me, honourable Radrodro, honourable Bulitavu and are few 
<br/>others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After so many years, the honourable Prime Minister had to go between us and our fellow 
<br/>Members to try and get a better understanding of each other and a way forward for us Members of 
<br/>the SODELPA Party then. That, in a nutshell, is how it affected us.  When we started receiving the 
<br/>allowance,  after  becoming  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee,  then  we  realised,  it  was  a  hefty 
<br/>increase - very, very big increase, and now we have this motion before us.  
<br/></span></div>
