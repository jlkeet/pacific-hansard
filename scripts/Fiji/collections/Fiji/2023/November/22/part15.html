<div><span>OVERSEAS TRAVELLING ALLOWANCES – MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister for his motion, in light of queries that have been raised with Parliament,  I wish to provide 
<br/></span><span>some clarity on the Emoluments Committee process and as well as the motion that will be moved 
<br/></span><span>by the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before we proceed to that and pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2023, the Emoluments Committee is still undertaking its assignment and will continue 
<br/>in existence until it completes its assignment as resolved by Parliament.  As I had alluded to on 
<br/>Monday,  20</span><span>th</span><span>  November,  2023,  the  Emoluments  Committee  through  the  Chairperson,  had 
<br/>informed the Committee that it would table its report at a later sitting in line with the resolution of 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to the motion that will be moved by the honourable Prime Minister, this was 
<br/>unanimously agreed to by the Business Committee.  The motion as listed on the Order Paper has 
<br/>been moved pursuant to section 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 and to provide 
<br/>further clarity, the honourable Prime Minister will move the motion to reduce the allowances given 
<br/>that under his ministerial assignments.  Parliament business and the Parliamentary Remunerations 
<br/>Act of 2014 fall under his portfolio.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, sections 3, 9, 12 and 13 of the Parliamentary 
<br/>Remunerations  Act  2014  provide  the  means  for  determining  the  remuneration,  inclusive  of 
<br/>salaries, allowances and benefits for His Excellency the President, Prime Minister, other Ministers 
<br/>and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Speaker,  the  Deputy  Speaker  and 
<br/>Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next motion by the honourable Prime Minister can be undertaken simultaneously and 
<br/>this is further emphasised in the honourable Minister’s motion whereby the amendment to take 
<br/>effect from 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023, until such time that the Emoluments Committee tables its report 
<br/>in Parliament and the subsequent debate and vote on the Committee’s Report has to take place.  I 
<br/>hope that clarifies the issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>That pursuant to section 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014, Parliament 
<br/>makes a determination to reduce the rates payable for Overseas Travelling Allowances 
<br/>of the following positions by amendments to Part B of the Schedule to the Parliamentary 
<br/>Remunerations Act 2014, as set out below –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister  
<br/>“9.  Overseas  Travelling  Allowance  –  UNDP  subsistence  allowance  plus  100 
<br/>percent.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>Cabinet Ministers  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“8.  Overseas  Travelling  Allowance  -  UNDP  subsistence  allowance  plus  50 
<br/>percent.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>Assistant Ministers  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“8.  Overseas  Travelling  Allowance  -  UNDP  subsistence  allowance  plus  25 
<br/>percent.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iv)</span><span> </span><span>Leader of the Opposition  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“8.  Overseas  Travelling  Allowance  -  UNDP  subsistence  allowance  plus  50 
<br/>percent.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(v)</span><span> </span><span>Members of Parliament (including Deputy Speaker, Government/Opposition Whip 
<br/></span><span>and Leader of the Government in  Parliament and excluding the Prime Minister, 
<br/></span><span>Ministers, Speaker and the Leader of Opposition)  
<br/>“6.  Overseas  Travelling  Allowance  –  UNDP  subsistence  allowance  plus  25 
<br/>percent;” and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)  That this amendment to the Determination to take effect from 1st December, 2023 until 
<br/>such  time  that  the  Emoluments  Committee  tables  its  report  in  Parliament  and  the 
<br/>subsequent debate and vote has taken place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion by the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you had pointed out prior to the moving of this 
<br/>motion, this motion in my name in today’s Order Paper is for the reduction of travel allowances for 
<br/>Members of Cabinet, Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I go into it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I add my words of congratulation to our sportsmen and 
<br/>sportswomen  in  the  Solomons  at  this  time  and  also  our  words  of  condolences  to  those  that  had 
<br/>represented  Fiji,  particularly  the  Late  Sitiveni  Moceidreke  and  the  </span><span>Vanua  o</span><span>  Vuda.    I  have  a 
<br/>granddaughter playing in the South Pacific Games and I sent out my greetings to them, having been 
<br/>the Captain of the Fiji Team at the Pacific Games and also at the Commonwealth Games.  I believe 
<br/>they are enjoying themselves but working very hard to get back up the medal scale. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, salary and allowances in the public sector were somewhat distorted by the 
<br/>previous  Government  and  it  was  our  policy  to  review  this  for  parity  and  relativity.    Prior  to  the 
<br/>Promulgation  of  the  Parliamentary  Remuneration  Act  2014,  the  salaries  of  the  interim  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers stayed secret and paid through a private accounting firm, despite being the subject of audit 
<br/>query.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Soon after assuming office in December last year, I announced my intention for the reduction 
<br/>of exorbitant ministerial salaries and travel allowances. Unfortunately, that was not operationalised, 
<br/>because of some legal opinions that came to us, and probably to you too.   Therefore, this motion is 
<br/>being tabled today to put in place the reductions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government as an employer, has a legal obligation to ensure its officials 
<br/>have sufficient funds to carry out their duties necessitated by travels.  These are costs to the taxpayers 
<br/>and the host organisations that engage our Government Ministers and officials.  However, the current 
<br/>rates  are  still  exorbitant.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  this  Parliament  under  the  Parliamentary 
<br/>Remunerations  Act  of  2014,  to  ensure  that  Ministers  and  officials  on  duty  travel  stay  in  decent 
<br/>accommodation  and  are  able  to  safely  move  from  one  point  to  the  other  to  undertake  their 
<br/>engagements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the requirements arising from the nature of engagements 
<br/>may differ from official to official, depending upon their seniority and responsibility.  These costs 
<br/>vary between countries and within countries.  For instance, the cost in Canberra would be different 
<br/>from the costs in Brisbane.  However, the current formula put in place by the past government for 
<br/>calculating these allowances are excessive.  This motion seeks to correct that anomaly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formula before this august Parliament today significantly reduces the 
<br/>daily  allowance  while  remaining  adequate  for  the  officials  concerned.    The  starting  point  for  the 
<br/>calculation of the allowances in  Fiji  has been pegged at  the UNDP  Daily Subsistence Allowance 
<br/>(DSA) rates.  The UNDP DSA rates are updated and published every quarter and are reliable.  It is 
<br/></span><span>the standard used by almost all countries in calculating the travel allowances for Ministers and the 
<br/></span><span>officials.    For  Fiji  and  other  countries,  the  extra  loading  for  Members  of  Cabinet,  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and Permanent Secretaries is to facilitate additional meetings that may be held.  The extra 
<br/>loading also covers for representational events where these officials are hosting their counterparts.  
<br/>However, the formula for the increase made in 2016, despite the devastations of severe </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, 
<br/>was excessive and sad to say, ill-advised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In comparison to the previous administration led by late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the late 
<br/>Laisenia Qarase and the SVT Coalition of the 1990s, the 2016 increases were exorbitant.  This motion 
<br/></span><span>is intended to rectify the anomaly in travel allowances brought about in 2016.  Under the proposed 
<br/></span><span>formula, for example, the Prime Minister’s DSA for Auckland, New Zealand is reduced from $2,826 
<br/>to $1,590.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly for the Ministers, the new formula will reduce their DSA for Auckland from $2,090 
<br/>to $954.  This is the same DSA for the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  For Assistant Ministers, 
<br/>the allowance declined from $1,572 to $759.  This is the same DSA for the Opposition Members of  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2145 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  The new formula will apply to all destinations for consistency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  exorbitant  salaries  of  Cabinet  and  in  public  sector  are  also  areas  of 
<br/>concern to taxpayers and we read about them in the social media everyday.  It is also our policy to 
<br/>review and correct the severe distortion of salaries and allowances in the public sector and restore 
<br/>parity and relativity.  It is, therefore, appropriate that if the Emoluments Committee of Parliament 
<br/>has been established and now carrying out its work with the assistance of an independent consultant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Parliament agrees these revised travel allowances will be effective 
<br/>from 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023 until the Emoluments Committee completes its work and reports back to 
<br/>this august Parliament.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before offering the floor, I have with me a list provided by the Whips: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J. Usamate; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute in the debate on the motion 
<br/>before Parliament.  Again, we want to say to the Government that you are the government, you call 
<br/>the shots.  It is your prerogative as you regularly quote in your responses to most of the interviews 
<br/>that you have been having but we have a few questions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>What is the objective?   
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>What are the reasons behind this?   
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Are they merely political or is it a question of availability of funds?   
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>As the previous Opposition used to say, there is no money or where is the money?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It leaves us confused because on 12th July, we had already agreed and you had alluded to 
<br/>this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  129  that  the  Emoluments  Committee  be 
<br/>established to review the salaries and allowances.  Again, on 1st August, the submission because they 
<br/>were not able to submit, and we understand that the work is still going on and we are represented in 
<br/></span><span>the Committee by the honourable Whip and honourable Mosese Bulitavu and are well aware of the 
<br/></span><span>discussions that are taking place in the Emoluments Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So where do we 
<br/>stand?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question that we will ask is this, this is going to be effective from 1st December and when 
<br/>the work of the Emoluments Committee is completed next year and submitted and it is contrary to 
<br/>what we are going to agree on today, what will be our position because we have given the mandate 
<br/>to the Emoluments Committee and now, the honourable Prime Minister is coming up with a motion 
<br/>on the determination of allowances of the positions already highlighted, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then the question of timing, why now, not earlier.  Is this just to satisfy the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance who has been talking about this in the interviews that he has been having lately with Vijay 
<br/>Narayan?  So  is  the  Minister  of  Finance,  again,  like  he  did  previously,  forcing  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister to come up with this motion? ‘

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Who is really in  charge, Mr. Speaker, Sir -  the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister or the honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may use one of the favourite lines of the honourable Nawaikula as you are all aware, “Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister, sack your Finance Minister.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has been telling Vijay Narayan in all the interviews that he is going to come 
<br/>up with a motion to reduce this, but why not earlier, why not in January, why not in the first hundred 
<br/>days? You have made full use of what was available, you have milked it dry and now you come into this 
<br/>House  so  that  you  can  look  good  politically  while  the  Report  of  the  Emoluments  Committee  is  still 
<br/>pending – you want to reduce this. It is illogical, it does not make sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us stand on principles.  The former Leader of the Government in Parliament 
<br/>is behind you, she is in charge of the Emoluments Committee, and she is doing all her best in trying.  The 
<br/>current Leader of the Government in Parliament is also in the Emoluments Committee, Mr Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>Do you have faith and trust in the work that they are doing, or shall we just disband the Emoluments 
<br/>Committee because they are ineffective and inefficient? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, where do we stand? It is the question of timing as well, Mr Speaker Sir.  I am well aware 
<br/>of section 13, that is, on the determination of a few of the positions but at the same time, Sir, particularly 
<br/>section 6, the principles to be applied when setting allowances and benefits. You have always talked 
<br/>about Parliamentary processes, listening and consulting that is the process but now you want to short 
<br/>circuit it again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 6 of the Remunerations Act of Parliament 2014, when setting the remuneration to be 
<br/>prescribed the determination that it lays to allowances and benefits Parliament must also have regards to 
<br/>the following principles but the allowances and benefits shall be determined in a way that recognizes the 
<br/>need of the public understanding of the work of those persons and in the case of Members, their parties 
<br/></span><span>and the services they require to enable them to carried out their roles and functions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  make  it  clear  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  are  not  against  this  reduction.  But  as  a  matter  of 
<br/>principles, we are arguing about the Committee that has been formed to look into this and they would 
<br/>have been a better position to go through the processes outlined the part 6 of the Act, Mr Speaker, Sir. As 
<br/>I’ve said you are the Government, you call the shots it is your prerogative, we are not against it because 
<br/>in  terms  of  fairness  as  well  it  takes  into  consideration  the  need  to  be  fair  to  the  taxpayer.  We  are 
<br/>considerate of that, Mr Speaker, Sir. But, again, we have an Emoluments Committee, our decision, we 
<br/>will await the Emoluments Committee that we have already agreed to on 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is a matter of principle because otherwise, again, this is a 
<br/>confused  Government,  this  is  a  rudderless  Government.    Where  do  you  stand?  There  is  a  lot  of 
<br/>inconsistency in the things that you bring to the floor of Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministers are flip floppy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is what I am trying to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is excessive … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … the process is there and of course 17 as well allows for this to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be reviewed.  I will not go into it, honourable Deputy Prime Minister …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You are one of the Ministers who benefited a lot. You had been 
<br/>globetrotting in the last few months, that is why you cannot fix these stalls on the roadside because 
<br/>you spent too much time overseas, not here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You have milked the system dry and then you want to come to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament and want to reduce it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Logic. Again, he is the Prime Minister of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we are aware of the UNDP allowance, we are aware of the subsistence allowance but there is a reason 
<br/>behind  this  incidental  allowance.  This  is  not  only  for  the  honourable  Prime  Minster,  but  also  for 
<br/>everyone.  Again, I have talked about us punching above our own weight, we need to be relevant in 
<br/>the global world, we need to be well represented, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Diplomacy, the art of diplomacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not only the work of our diplomats, it is no longer the case now in this 
<br/>modern world. We, as Ministers we are an extension arm of diplomacy. There are issues that needs 
<br/>to be socialised. They do this well in the private sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because they have the funds.  
<br/>That is why they have all these functions, that is the art of diplomacy at work.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last IPU meeting, Fiji has been given the chairmanship of Small Island 
<br/>States in IPU. We have to meet the honourable Speaker from the Seychelles and the Deputy Chair as 
<br/>well; I have forgotten the name of the country.  It was meeting over lunch, we have to pay for it, that 
<br/>is why the incidentals are there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is not everyday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- $200, $300 for a Minister, a meal in New York, take five people, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>otherwise we are just …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diplomacy, Sir.  It is there for a reason. We all live in a benefit-oriented society but again, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister talked about what was there previously but what 
<br/>came into effect in 2014, let me put it into perspective.  While salaries and allowances were increased 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>although exorbitant as you may say, but we took away most of the other benefits as well; medical 
<br/>benefits, insurance benefits, housing benefits …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- That was a disaster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … tax free whatever for a vehicle during a term. So, you are just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>given the salary … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You did not consult. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … and then you look after all your other expenses from the salary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and allowances that you are given.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That was a disaster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- So it was balancing of the expenses and the income that you are 
<br/>getting. That was the logic behind it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Again, we are not against it, but as a matter 
<br/>of principle, we await the work of the Emoluments Committee as we agreed to on the 12</span><span>th</span><span> July and 
<br/>when that report comes into this Parliament, we will then debate and make the right decisions 
<br/>accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is my contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes I really feel for the other side 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Parliament. I think if they look in the mirror, Sir, they will not like what they see.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- But we feel for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The honourable Leader of the Opposition is a good orator, 
<br/>I have to give him that much. He is a great orator maybe because he is from the same province as I, 
<br/>but he was struggling today for fresh air and I will explain why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been in the private sector for 30-plus years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Disaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I have never in my life seen the type of allowances that were 
<br/></span><span>paid to that side of Parliament; I have never seen it. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the private sector, 
<br/>the allowances of the  UN are regarded the highest.  So, we actually go below the United Nations 
<br/>allowance. We find out what the real cost is to the companies and then we will work out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These allowances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were absolutely excessive and it is funny now that we 
<br/>have actually been visiting, some of the things that the honourable Leader of the Opposition was 
<br/>saying  about  entertaining  or  whatever,  most  of  the  time  when  they  go  on  these  trips,  they  get 
<br/>entertained.  They  never  spend  any  money  anywhere.  It  very  rarely  happens.    It  is  a  nonsense  to 
<br/></span><span>suggest that you are going around with 300 percent a day or 200 percent a day to actually go and 
<br/></span><span>entertain somewhere else. That probably happens only once or twice in that whole week or whatever 
<br/>when you are away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the big reasons why we are so concerned on this side of Parliament 
<br/>was the excessive nature of these allowances. It is too much. In fact, I was not going to say it, but I 
<br/>am going to say it. They were making money on the allowance.  That side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, were making money on of the allowances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Enjoying it for the last 10 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, they sit here and claim about the allowances. The reality 
<br/>is that they were making money on the allowances.   Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to address 
<br/>the question about me making money on allowances. I will share this just so that everyone knows. 
<br/>As soon as I got into office, I reduced my allowance to 100 percent ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Grace Road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- … out of principle, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just share that for 
<br/>him to know. Some of the other honourable Ministers did the same because we just felt that it was 
<br/>almost like thievery of the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is almost like stealing from the people of Fiji, that was how excessive it was. This load, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, are a waste of taxpayer’s money. That is one of the main reasons we are actually through 
<br/>with the honourable Prime Minister in deciding to reduce the allowances.  I agree, it should have 
<br/>been done a long time ago which brings me to my second point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  soon  as  we  got  into  office,  we  started  talking  about  how  to  reduce  these 
<br/>allowances. We ended up having a Cabinet decision in April, I believe. Sir, we formally decided on 
<br/>it and then we were told, “oh no, it has to go through the Emoluments Committee”.   And then we 
<br/>say, “okay”.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the first time in Government for a lot of us. We actually 
<br/>allowed the Emoluments Committee to operate and then we felt that we needed to do it because it 
<br/>just taking too long.  It was absolutely taking too long. We made a decision in April and now we are 
<br/>going to wait for the Emoluments Committee until next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we felt, maybe we are deviating from due process but who is benefitting? 
<br/>The people of Fiji are benefiting by us putting money back into the coffers for greater use for the 
<br/>bubbly good of Fiji. So, that is why we are doing it.  We are not doing it because of any press release 
<br/>or because of honourable Biman Prasad. We are doing it because we had made a decision in April 
<br/></span><span>and we felt it was taking too long.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just thought that I clarify that so that that side of Parliament would know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they look in the mirror, Sir, they will see what we are seeing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point to make Mr. Speaker, Sir, is we had a promise that we had made to the people 
<br/>of Fiji about these allowances.  If you look at the way we have been operating since we started, we 
<br/>are keeping up with our promises to the people of Fiji.  The honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>just talked about the GCC coming back.  The honourable Minister for Employment talked about the 
<br/></span><span>reforms that we are going to do in industrial relations that would put us back in a position where we 
<br/></span><span>really become a true democracy in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third reason and the obvious one, we had made a promise to the people 
<br/>of Fiji like all the other things we are doing to deliver on that promise, we are delivering on that 
<br/>promise here today and besides, that side of Parliament was enjoying these allowances for eight years 
<br/>or 16 years ...

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And you are just one year now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …because they were keeping it as a secret in terms of hiding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the books from the people of Fiji.  Maybe it was for 16 years.  So: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the allowances are excessive and need to go; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>we were just following process and the process was taking too long; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>we are keeping our promises to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not heard so much drivel and hogwash in such 
<br/>a long time.  I think the honourable Prime Minister has spoken at length about why these allowances 
<br/>are in  place in the  first  place.   He has expressed his  feelings; he thinks that  it is  too  much.  The 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition has also spoken about why these things are put there in the first 
<br/>place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When our Prime Minister and Ministers go out, they carry the status of their positions with 
<br/>them.  They represent Fiji, they need to be able to demonstrate Fiji in good stand, they need to live 
<br/>in a nice place that has a good representation of Fiji.  They must be able to do the kind of things 
<br/>diplomatically that we had talked about, not only in the meetings but outside of the meetings that 
<br/>allow them to get the results.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning when we heard the Ministerial Statement from the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>we saw the impact of good visits, where they make visits that bring good kinds of results.  In order 
<br/>to do that, whenever Cabinet Ministers or Prime Minister goes, they need to carry themselves well 
<br/>because they reflect Fiji, and it is important that they represent Fiji well so that they can deliver good 
<br/>service for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Leader of the Opposition says, a lot of the business that takes place, it 
<br/>takes place on the margins, not only in the meetings themselves.  I hope that the people travelling to 
<br/>these meetings they actually go and say something, and they participate in all the side events and 
<br/>they try to create for themselves programmes where they go and meet people, have coffee, buy some 
<br/>lunch for someone to get some actual benefit out of it because that is where a lot of benefits come 
<br/>from.  Benefits in the meeting but then there are things that you do outside and over and above that, 
<br/>the personal relationships that you create over time by meeting people, buying them coffee, buying 
<br/>them dinner, that is why all these allowances were there.  I know some Ministers are probably just 
<br/>going to the meeting, they travel thousands of miles, they go there, they do not even make a statement, 
<br/>they do not go to any event, and they just come back, I hope that that is not happening.  That is what 
<br/>it is meant for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Do not lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is why all these things are important.  That is what is reflected in 
<br/>the allowances that they make.  As the honourable Leader of the Opposition had said, when all the 
<br/>benefits  have been put  into  the salaries, that means a lot of the  other benefits  that were there for 
<br/>Ministers,  Assistant  Ministers  and  Members  of  Parliament  were  removed.    It  all  became  just  the 
<br/></span><span>salary itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister said that they had to take this step because it was too 
<br/>slow.  It is too slow because you were too slow.  Everything that you do is too slow.  Your processes 
<br/>are not right, that is  why it is  too  slow.   If it was so important,  you could  have done it in  April.  
<br/></span><span>Everything was too slow because you are probably blind, still trying to find your way around, you 
<br/></span><span>do not know what to do. Probably, the people who are advising you are giving you the wrong legal

<div><span>advice, whoever those people were. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What we are seeing here is a Government that does not follow the due 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processes that we have here in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Responsible Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE- We have decided to have an Emoluments Committee and then you are 
<br/>shortcutting the Emoluments Committee. If you want to shortcut the Emoluments Committee, why 
<br/>not  do  the  whole  hog  -  do  the  whole  salaries,  do  everything  else,  do  not  just  look  at  the  travel 
<br/>allowance, do it all because that is what you seem to be doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not new, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few years ago the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad used to be the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  This is the purpose of 
<br/>the Public Accounts Committee, you look at all these reports then you make your findings and your 
<br/>submission and you present it to Parliament where it is discussed.  But during that time, what he 
<br/>would as the Chairman, he would give off the cuff interviews to the press telling them what is actually 
<br/>happening when his focus as a Public Accounts Committee was to do the discussions and bring it to 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He was trying to shortcut the processes of Parliament and that is what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he is doing again now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have set up the Emoluments Committee to do this job and you are trying to shortcut it. 
<br/>The same thing that was done in the Public Accounts Committee, he is doing it again.  Once we set 
<br/>up a process, we need to abide by it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All the consultations have taken place in the Emoluments Committee.  We have presented, I 
<br/>was part of the team from FijiFirst that presented there, other parties must have presented, we brought 
<br/>in a third party consultant.  I think the report should be, if I am not mistaken, towards the end of this 
<br/>year.  Hopefully the report should be ready, it should come out early next year.  Why can we just not 
<br/>complete that particular process? As the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, I think what you 
<br/></span><span>are trying to do is trying to create a false political image of yourselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a political gimmick, that is all what this is.  The process is just about to go, to finish 
<br/>and then you bring this in. There is absolutely no bases upon which to do this. We do not agree with 
<br/>what you are proposing here, we believe that we need to go through the Emoluments Committee, let 
<br/>them produce the report and complete the process as it should be done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for afternoon 
<br/>tea and when we return, I will offer the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 5.17 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to fully endorse the motion tabled by 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and the Head of our Coalition Government.  Let me also confirm that 
<br/>this motion is not only a knee jerk reaction to public concerns about travel expenditure, but as valid 
<br/>as the concerns that have been for almost 11 months, and were indeed so for more than six years 
<br/>since 29</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2016 up to 14</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022 when the FijiFirst Government was in power.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  understand  why  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the 
<br/>honourable Usamate would oppose this motion, and they camouflaged their Opposition to some kind 
<br/>of dubious argument about process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Very dubious argument about process.  Let me remind them 
<br/>because some of them were part of that.  When the Standing Committee on Public Accounts under 
<br/>my chairmanship, at that time the Opposition was chairing the Public Accounts Committee, came to 
<br/>a point where we demanded the secret salaries payment and the terms and conditions on which it was 
<br/>determined to be brought before the Public Accounts Committee, thereafter, I was sacked through an 
<br/>amendment to the Standing Order in this Parliament.  All of them were sitting there supporting it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Dictatorial. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Then,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  talk  about  process.    On  3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>October, 2014, three days before the new Parliament was supposed to sit, the Interim Government in 
<br/>which their leaders were part of brought a decree and determined for themselves for the Opposition 
<br/>the salaries and pays that they were getting after knowing that they had won the elections and were 
<br/>going to sit on the Government side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What processes are they talking about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hypocrisy! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You are going against your own Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the hypocrisy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hypocrisy that side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You know that is coming from them. We know Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, that it has taken the People’s Coalition Government nine months to bring this motion to the floor 
<br/>of this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Degrading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Prime Minister quite clearly explained why 
<br/></span><span>and despite that, despite the fact that all Members of Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, continued to endure 
<br/>a  20  percent  salary  cut,  first  imposed  as  a  restorative  measure  from  April  2020  by  the  former 
<br/>government and we know that our critics have generally demanded for a reduction in the overseas 
<br/>travel allowances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not blame them Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are speaking out because we have given them 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2153 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the full freedom to do so.  We also do not blame them Mr. Speaker, Sir, for not talking about these 
<br/>things before because they were afraid, there was a fear of being victimised, harassed, intimidated by 
<br/>the former government. We have abundance of examples of that kind of victimisation, harassment 
<br/>and intimidation from 2014 to 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Say it loud! Loud! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because they are confused, they do not support the reduction 
<br/>because they were part of the loot of the increase in the allowances for that many years and they are 
<br/>actually confused.  So, they are camouflaging and say ‘Oh, this is a political thing.’   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you were not in Parliament and due to two years of unfair suspension from 
<br/>May 2015 when the overseas travel allowances skyrocketed because at that time an overwhelming 
<br/>majority  of  50  Members  of  Parliament  who  occupied  this  august  Chamber  decided  to  vote  for 
<br/>ridiculously high allowances on 29</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Neither was the honourable Prime Minister and indeed many other honourable Members on 
<br/>both  sides  of  this Chambers  as  part  of  our  Coalition  Government  only  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister Viliame Gavoka, honourable Aseri Radrodro and I were back then sitting in the Opposition.  
<br/>The  current  Opposition  which  was  back  then  the  Government  and  in  fact  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition when he was speaking, he actually … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Let me correct you, honourable Professor Biman Prasad, honourable Aseri 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Radrodro never agreed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am saying, he was with us in the Opposition, that was what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What I am saying is that at that time, there were only three of 
<br/>us sitting on the Opposition who are in Government at the moment, that is what I am saying, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir.    Myself,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  and  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua, honourable Tikoduadua? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am talking about 2016.
