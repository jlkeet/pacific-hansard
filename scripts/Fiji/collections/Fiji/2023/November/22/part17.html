<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF  
<br/>DEFENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 2017–2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Security 2017–2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the review of the Ministry of Defence and 
<br/></span><span>National Security 2017-2018  Annual Report.  It was reinstated from the last Parliament term, most 
<br/>of the work was done by the previous Standing Committee pm Foreign Affairs and Defence, we just 
<br/>carried on from there, hence this very short report.  It has recommendations and the recommendation 
<br/>in the Report are made applicable to that reporting period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I make this point to underscore the fact that a lot has been done by the Ministry up to when 
<br/>we were doing the reporting, even from when we tabled the report until today.  As we had heard 
<br/>announcements made by the current Minister, a new ministry, now the Ministry for Home Affairs 
<br/>and Immigration, announcements that were made along the vein of some of the recommendations 
<br/>that we made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendations in this Report, again, is a five-year old Report: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  priority  be  given  to  reviewing  both  the  Police  Act  1987  and  the  Republic  of  Fiji 
<br/>Military Forces Act 1949 and I am sure the Minister can update us on that today.

<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Defence   
<br/>and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendations in this Report, again, it is a five-year old Report: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  priority  be  given  to  reviewing  both  the  Police  Act  1987  and  the  Republic  of  Fiji 
<br/>Military Forces Act 1949 and I am sure the Minister can update us on that today.   
<br/>That  required  resources  both  funding  and  training,  be  given  to  the  development  of  the 
<br/>Incident Response Management Framework. This Framework is, according to the report 
<br/>developed by the Ministry is for our borders.  It is to complement border security where 
<br/>their policies and plans to enhance contingency responses in the event of a security threat 
<br/>to Fiji’s territorial borders.  Hope that we will identify relevant agencies that are required 
<br/>to  respond  to  any  threat  or  security  issue  and  also  outline  clear-cut  lines  of  command, 
<br/>control and communication; easy for decision making and also for the effectiveness of the 
<br/>operation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are three documents that we mentioned in the report: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Search and Rescue Bill; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>National Security Strategy; and 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>National Security Defence Council Bill  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are recommending that effort be made to make sure that these documents are completed, 
<br/>the Bill to be passed, again that was five years ago and maybe there is development around this. I 
<br/>know for the National Security Strategy, if the review began five years ago, it will be totally irrelevant 
<br/>now.  So, I think it will have to be re-written so that it is line with the current security landscape, now 
<br/>and into the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was reported that for this Ministry, there were 55 percent female and 45 percent male. In 
<br/>the  reporting  year,  congratulations  to  the  Ministry  and  the  effort  towards  equal  opportunity 
<br/>employment and gender, but we ask in the report that they not only give us numbers but perhaps 
<br/>outline the levels of posts that females are holding.  Sir, that is an introduction to this report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to inform this august Parliament that I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also received a list of speakers from their Whips: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A. Bia; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  make  my  contribution  on  the  motion  before 
<br/>Parliament. At this juncture, I would like to thank the Chairman and his Committee Members for a 
<br/>job well done in complying the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  bring  our  attention  to  some  of  the  key  important  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations of the Report where we can raise questions as to what has been done to try and 
<br/>improve the services provided by the Ministry of Defence and National Security and which report is 
<br/></span><span>under review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key issues highlighted in the report was the collaboration between 
<br/>the Ministry and various border agencies to work on upgrading and digitising Fiji’s border systems 
<br/>in pursuit of a contact-less process with a seamless flow of passengers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Defence   
<br/>and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2159 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this digitisation process is the way to go for our border agencies and at the 
<br/>same time improve service delivery and improve waiting time as well for Fijians and tourists who 
<br/>will cross our borders.  The report under review is from 2017 to 2018 and we do know that work  
<br/>and discussions have progressed over the years to try and implement the digitisation process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In February this year, a national consultation was organised to discuss the digitisation of the 
<br/>arrivals  process  at  Fiji’s  borders,  as  well  as  the  guiding  principles  needed  to  achieve  its  national 
<br/>border upgrade strategy.  The consultation was to allow the Ministry to work with the UNDP Suva 
<br/>Office to align immigration processes to the Government’s overall digital transformation strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the honourable Minister responsible is aware of the progress 
<br/>being made on this consultation report.  This digitisation project at our borders will re-enforce our 
<br/>capacities, capabilities and systems for effective and efficient movement of travellers and cargo and 
<br/>strengthen links for data and knowledge sharing inter-agency and across regional cooperation.  At 
<br/>the outset, as stated in the report and I quote, “this will greatly complement Fiji’s border security 
<br/>policies and plans and also will enhance our contingency responses in the event of a security threat 
<br/>to Fiji’s territorial borders”.  With that contribution, I once again thank the Committee and support 
<br/>the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament.  First of all, let me 
<br/>thank the honourable Naupoto and his Committee for the Report that they have tabled in Parliament 
<br/>today.  As he had rightfully said that this has been a report from sometime back - 2017 to 2018.  As 
<br/>he has rightfully commented, a lot has changed since then, from the term of the last government and 
<br/>the continuation of what we are doing now.  So, much of these recommendations today have been 
<br/>addressed in one form or another.  I would like to maybe just concentrate on the recommendations 
<br/>that are here, and inform Parliament where things are, with regards to the five recommendations so 
<br/>to speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very briefly I would say, before going to the recommendations and what they are proposing, 
<br/>a lot really hinges on the process of the national security and defence review, but as we all know was 
<br/>faced in Parliament by His Excellency the President when he opened this session of Parliament.  That 
<br/>really is perhaps the overarching strategy, the process that will guide much of these changes that are 
<br/>presented here as part of the recommendations.  We are going by that, and I will try just in the short 
<br/>time that I have just to cover it very briefly, and I know there is not enough time to do all that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, suffice to say that the review of the RFMF Act as it is proposed is now before 
<br/>the Office of the Solicitor-General.  There is liaison between the Office of the Solicitor-General, the 
<br/>Commander of the RFMF and the staff and the Ministry in addressing, particularly the new RFMF 
<br/>Act that has been proposed to Government by the RFMF; the current one which is the RFMF Act 
<br/>1949.  As for the Police, under the strategic review, looking at security in its entirety, I had spoken 
<br/>about Restore Blue as the process and that is the professionalisation of the Police Force.  This is an 
<br/>intensive work on the Police Force and what they are and what we want them to be, the restoration of 
<br/>professionalism in the service. It is a lot of work Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, the Ministry and the Government is working with the UNDP, so there is a national 
<br/>consultation that begins next week on Monday and Tuesday and there is a few more to come in the second 
<br/>phase. So, there is public participation on how the public of  Fiji can say how they want their  police 
<br/>services to be and that is part of that process, and we see that, we will then look at the development.  There 
<br/>are some consultations going on right now with regards to the Police Act 1987, that needs to be reviewed 
<br/>also to bring the police up to par, but as part of the security and strategy review in terms of our whole of 
<br/>our national security the Police review is also part of the process and its laws.

<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Defence   
<br/>and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the incidental and management response, that honourable Naupoto has alluded to, at 
<br/>the  moment  the  Government  is  working  with  the  Government  of  Japan,  there’s  been  a  number  of 
<br/>processes, number of exercises not only with the government of Japan but also UNDP to strengthen the 
<br/>framework of this incident response management team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Search and Rescue Bill, that is currently under review but at the moment we have 
<br/>a Search and Rescue Handbook, which was developed after this report period and that was published, I 
<br/>think, in 2021. The National Security Strategy of course as I said is part of the national security and the 
<br/>defence review and we also reviewing the National Security  Defence Council per say as part of the Bill 
<br/>which is refer to here but at the moment it has to be reviewed also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of Recommendations No. 4, Mr Speaker, I take that into account and hopefully this is 
<br/>something that we must improve on as noted by the Committee and hopefully when we table our next 
<br/>report as a Ministry into this Parliament, it is going to take cognisance of this so the Parliament can 
<br/>specifically recognise the kind of work that we are already doing, in terms of key performance \indicators 
<br/>and how it should work in the workplace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I first wish to acknowledge the Committee once 
<br/>again for the excellent work and the preparation of this Report and of course I do not have much to add 
<br/>as well after the statement by the honourable Minister. But I am glad to see the continuity in most of the 
<br/>work that had been undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, we know the importance of National Security particularly in terms of the creation of the 
<br/>environment for our economic growth and development as well.  We are faced with so many challenges 
<br/>in this unpredictable world, we can say that we are safe, particularly from conventional threats but at the 
<br/>same time, we know how vulnerable we are when it comes to non-traditional threats, things like human 
<br/>trafficking, climate change, cybercrime, terrorism, drugs, et cetera, Mr. Speaker , Sir, and this is why as 
<br/>the honourable Minister has correctly stated, the overarching framework which is the National Security 
<br/>strategy is so important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Work has been undertaken.  It took a lot of time for it to be cleared by the Attorney General, 
<br/>Solicitor’s General office and although the work had started before I came in as Minister very briefly in 
<br/>2018, but we have managed to submit this to Cabinet, but it has not the Cabinet office, but it has not made 
<br/>its way into Cabinet. There are a lot of factors coming in as well, because economic security is very much 
<br/>related to our National Security as well, because when we have the strategy in place and the capability 
<br/>development particularly and other aspects that will support the National Security Strategy, that is why 
<br/>the status of the Economy is so important, we know what we went through, Mr Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019, of course, we are still recovering from that Mr Speaker, Sir, but that is where it is and 
<br/>our security landscape has changed and the honourable Minister did respond to the question that was 
<br/>raised in this House by the honourable Assistant Minister of Finance and he has stated his intentions on 
<br/>the work that will continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Search and Rescue Bill, just very briefly when we had the opportunity earlier in this 
<br/>Parliament  to  talk  about  our  response  during  COVID,  I  did  mention  about  the  idea  of  bringing 
<br/>together a common or one document to coordinate our National Emergency Response Framework or 
<br/>whatever we will call it.  The same thing with the Search and Rescue Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as this 
<br/>is one of the recommendations. We had a difficulty when we had the incident in Vanua Levu a few 
<br/>years back because in the current laws aeronautical search is with AFL based in Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Search and Rescue, in our maritime waters even going to Tuvalu and Wallis and Futuna, is 
<br/>under the Fiji Navy, RFMF and it is based in Walu Bay.  Land Search is under the Fiji Police Force. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Defence   
<br/>and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  that  overarching  framework  was  to  bring  them  together  and  the  Bill,  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General, I know that it is before the Solicitor-General’s Office and I hope that between the honourable 
<br/>Minister and yourself, Sir, this can be expedited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Human Trafficking is a major issue. I have stated it already in this Parliament. I think the only 
<br/>major National Taskforce has been established and the Ministry is responsible. Perhaps the major 
<br/>issue that we were trying to work on particularly between the two Committees particularly with the 
<br/>US Government as well is just the laws because they have very specific laws on human trafficking 
<br/>but for us our laws is very general and perhaps this review will help us to look at some of the existing 
<br/>laws and particularly laws for the agencies that will be responsible: all the stakeholders that come 
<br/>under the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, on the RFMF Act Review and of course the Fiji Police Force we are thankful to the 
<br/>New Zealand Government for assisting in the RFMF Act review and I am sure as already alluded to 
<br/>by the honourable Minister it is ready now or on its way to Cabinet and of course the Police Review.  
<br/>There was a blunder by the Fiji Police Force because after the endorsement by Cabinet instead of just 
<br/>going for the consultations they used the word ‘Bill’ in that consultation when it has not come into 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to,  it  was  sponsored  by  UNDP  and  the  New  Zealand  Government,  and  I  am 
<br/>thankful that they are going to pick it up now and continue with the work.  So, in a nutshell, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, again, it is important that we support the work particularly behind National Security 
<br/>because this will create the environment for us, whether it is investment or our economic growth and 
<br/>development  and  social  protection  as  well  and  we  need  to  support  the  honourable  Minister,  the 
<br/>Ministry and the agencies involved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide 
<br/>some remarks on this Review Report that is being tabled before the House.  I agree with the mover 
<br/>of the motion that this Report is five years old and most of the works that are being reported here the 
<br/>update has been given by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs this afternoon or this evening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  let  me  just  give  some  brief  overview  in  terms  of  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and 
<br/>National  Security  responsible  for  Fiji’s  National  Security  including  the  defence  of  the  coverage 
<br/>sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.  The  Ministry  carries  out  this  responsibility  through  the 
<br/>implementation of Fiji’s National Security Strategy and by conducting policy oversight of two of 
<br/>Fiji’s Discipline Forces – the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Fiji Police Force.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  Budget  update,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  National 
<br/>Security was allocated a budget of $5.2 million in the 2017 and 2018 financial year for which they 
<br/>were able to expend $4.8 million which is around 91 percent of the overall budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>of the overall budget 80 percent of the budget was allocated for the operating expenditure while 14 
<br/>percent was earmarked for the capital projects. The largest component of the Ministry’s budget is 
<br/>under SEG 1 - $1.4 million for salaries and SEG 8 - $1.8 million which caters for special expenditures 
<br/>including the National Security and Defence Review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 2023 and 2024 the current Budget the Ministry has allocated a Budget 
<br/>$12.4. million.  Of this around 89 percent of the Budget is allocated for Operating Expenditure while 
<br/>5 percent is earmarked for the capital projects.  The largest component of the Ministry’s Budget is 
<br/>under SEG 1 which caters for salaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the major increase in expenditure in 2023 and 2024 financial year results 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the transfer of the Department of Immigration from the Office of the Prime Minister to the
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Home Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  looking  at  the  recommendations  that  have  been  tabled  by  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee,  most  of  the  recommendations  have  been  updated  to  the  House  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister as well as the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  However, I would just like to express 
<br/>more on the need to prior and fast track the Search and Rescue Bill.  It  is very important for our 
<br/>country looking at the number of issues that are taking place in the country in the meantime.  I can 
<br/>just recall back in 2019 when I was the Commissioner Northern when this Cessna 172 that belongs 
<br/>to Pacific Flying School was involved in an accident in the very rugged terrain in Delaikoro Mountain 
<br/>in Macuata. We tried to mount search and rescue and the Disciplined Forces together with National 
<br/>Fire Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the first instance, we were very confused because there was no SOP for us to follow in 
<br/>terms  of  that  operation  however  due  to  commonsense  we  were  able  to  undertake  that  rescue 
<br/>operations  very  quickly,  and  I  would  urge  the  Ministry  and  those  responsible  for  the  Search  and 
<br/>Rescue Bill to please enhance its enactment so that those relevant agencies are able to comprehend 
<br/>whenever a similar disaster takes place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to round off, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of some of the issues that were raised by the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General and I want to mention it in this Report because it was during the time 
<br/>that this Report was being scrutinised by the Standing Committee in terms of Standing Operating 
<br/>Procedures and some of the things that were lacking in the Ministry during that time. The Ministry 
<br/>should ensure that the names of the issues that have been raised by the OAG in terms of the SOP and 
<br/>the operation in the Ministry should be try and addressed so that encounter this same problem when 
<br/>a similar situation comes into place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee once again for a very spending their effort in trying to come up with a 
<br/>Report that is five years old. I thank the Chairperson and all the Members, and I do support the Report 
<br/>before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- If I can just thank the staff of the Ministry, past and present, wish you 
<br/>well in the big role that you play in the security of our nation.  I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/>for noting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
