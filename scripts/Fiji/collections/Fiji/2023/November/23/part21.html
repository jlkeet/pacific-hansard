<h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW ONLEVUKA TOWN COUNCIL 2012 AND 2013 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3>
<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW ON  
<br/>LEVUKA TOWN COUNCIL 2012 AND 2013 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on Levuka Town Council 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for years 2012 and 2013 which was tabled on 12</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka was the first municipality that was 
<br/>proclaimed in Fiji after the passing of the Town Ordinance in 1877. Through this, the residence of 
<br/>Levuka were given the right to govern the town thus appointing wardens to oversee the work being 
<br/>carried  in  Levuka.    However,  changes  came  into  effect  after  Independence  when  the  Local 
<br/>Government Act of 1972 was passed, giving all townships in Fiji municipality status and the power 
<br/></span><span>to elect their own town councils, councillors and mayors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the year 2012 and 2013, the Council highlighted a few events that 
<br/>was  quite  significant  for  them.    For  instance,  these  were  courtesy  visits  from  the  Special 
<br/>Administrator Rakiraki  for Levuka/Rakiraki  Tourism Partnership.  The visit from  the  Director of 
<br/>Local Government and Chief Executive Officer of Nadi, the Minister for Labour, Industrial Relations 
<br/>and Employment and the Parliament Standing Committee on Public Accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to the above, the Council carried out the following activities.  They 
<br/>launched the nomination dossier and later Levuka Town was inscribed in the World Heritage Listing.  
<br/>They also hosted the arrival of the </span><span>Uto ni Yalo </span><span>and increased human resource capacity to enhance the 
<br/>services provided by the Council.  The Committee acknowledged the work carried out by the town 
<br/>council in 2012 and 2013.  It also noted the challenges and opportunities that Levuka can build on to 
<br/>boost its economic viability and its status as a municipal council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that the Council build on the Private-Public 
<br/>Partnership model and strengthen partnership with civil society organisations to improve the image 
<br/>of Levuka as a heritage site. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span><span>I also have a list of speakers before me and four speakers have been identified.  The batting will be 
<br/>led by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Viam Pillay; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Premila Kumar; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as soon as the first bell is sounded, we will humbly ask you to resume 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your seat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to give a few remarks on the Consolidated 
<br/>Review of Levuka Town Council’s Annual Report for the years 2012 and 2013.  I know it is an old 
<br/>report and a lot has been said about Levuka, so I will be very brief.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report - 
<br/>Levuka Town Council 2012 &amp; 2013 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2279 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Levuka  Town  Council’s  vision  to  preserve  the  heritage  of  Levuka  for 
<br/>sustainable  livelihoods  and  its  mission  to  promote  economic  growth  through  partnerships  and 
<br/>efficient service delivery resonates deeply with the aspirations of our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  recognition  of  the  Council’s  effort    in  hosting  notable  events,  receiving 
<br/>courtesy visits and achieving World Heritage Listing status is a testament to the significant strides 
<br/>taken  by  Levuka  in  preserving  its  cultural  and  historical  richness.  The  launch  of  the  nomination 
<br/>dossier  leading  to  Levuka  Town’s  inclusion  in  the  World  Heritage  Listing  is  a  milestone  worth 
<br/>celebrating.  It not only recognises the historical significance of Levuka but also positions it on the 
<br/>global stage  as  a  custodian of  cultural  heritage.  Such achievements underscore the importance of 
<br/>local governance in shaping the identity and the reputation of our municipals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to provide some insights and also address the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>august Chamber  on the motion before us which is on the report provided by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Chairperson  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give my comments this evening, I wish to extend my appreciation 
<br/>to 
<br/>the  assessment  and  constructive 
<br/></span><span>recommendations.  Furthermore,  I also  thank the Special Administrator, CEO and staff of Levuka 
<br/></span><span>Town Council for diligently serving the people of Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Committee  Members  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka was the first capital of Fiji and the recommendation given by the 
<br/>Committee is timely because it encourages more participation with the private as well the public to 
<br/>promote some of the developments that happened in Levuka. Based on the size of the Council, it 
<br/>needs the cooperation assistance of the civil society as well as private organisations to assist in the 
<br/>development of Levuka Town.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising effective collaboration stringent on open communications subjective and mutual 
<br/>respect  and the Ministry is  committed in  enhancing  partnership to  elevate the image of Levuka’s 
<br/>heritage sites. It is also pertinent to highlight a note the significant aid provided by the Government 
<br/>of Japan to the Levuka Town Council.  This include essential equipment such as garbage trucks, ride-
<br/>on lawn mowers, skipper trucks and more not only supports the Council but also generates additional 
<br/>revenue  through  hiring.  The  Government  of  Japan’s  assistance  in  building  seawalls  post-cyclone 
<br/>destruction underscores their commitment to Levuka’s wellbeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, under the UN Women’s Market for Change Project of $400,000 has been co-
<br/>funded for the construction of the new Levuka Market. The Ministry stands in support of civil society 
<br/></span><span>organisations committed to preserving our cultural heritage.  We are so blessed that Levuka is one of 
<br/></span><span>the sites because of it being the first capital of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I express my gratitude for the opportunity to respond to the motion before us 
<br/>and from the Ministry’s perspective, it looks forward to continue to support the operations of Levuka 
<br/>Town Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on 
<br/>this motion. Levuka’s rich history is easily identifiable by having among the first of many things; the 
<br/>first trading hub, the first schools and hotels, the first banks and post office, the first police station, 
<br/>the first church, mosque and mandir, the first market and the first capital of Fiji. This is a huge part 
<br/>of Levuka’s historical identity for Fiji. It was in Levuka that education, politics, trade, investment 
<br/>and  other  things  began  to  take  shape.  It  is  worth  noting  that  Levuka  Town  Council  was  the  first 
<br/>municipality proclaimed in Fiji which dates back to 1877. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2013, was a momentous year for the people of Levuka, when Levuka was
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report - 
<br/>Levuka Town Council 2012 &amp; 2013 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>listed  as  a  UNESCO  World  Heritage  Site.  Just  after  three  years  of  being  declared  a  UNESCO 
<br/>Heritage  Port,  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  in  2016  and  subsequent  cyclones  damaged  majority  of  the  historical 
<br/>buildings,  in  total,  about  76  buildings  were  destroyed  at  that  time,  including  seawalls  and  other 
<br/>monuments in Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was a major setback for a small town. It is to be noted that Fiji faced 14 cyclones from 
<br/>2016 of different strengths, example, </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, which was Category 4 and </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>, Category 5. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite all the cyclones, at that time the FijiFirst Government tried to do its best to 
<br/>uplift, repair and restore Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  recommendation  is  appropriate  because  Levuka  is  a  small  town,  the 
<br/>community there is close knit, and they want to promote Levuka as a tourist destination. But, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it must be noted that, Levuka Town Council is not in a financial position to look after 
<br/>Fiji’s only heritage town on its own. They barely have about 152 ratepayers, and they are limited by 
<br/>other  resources,  so,  there  is  a  greater  dependence  on  the  National  Government,  NGOs  and  other 
<br/>development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka Town Council barely collects around $150,000 in rates, and through 
<br/></span><span>other  fees  and  charges,  they  can  come  up  to  around  $400,000.  There  is  absolutely  no  way  and 
<br/>maintain  the  historical  sites  and  provide  basic  services,  when  it  collects  such  a  small  amount  of 
<br/>money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka  is  our  pride,  Fiji’s  only  world  heritage  site,  so  we  must  continue  to  invest  in  the 
<br/>upkeep of the infrastructure as much as we can. The FijiFirst Government had been supporting the 
<br/>heritage town, to restore the seawall and the road. Mr. Speaker, Sir, every year, Levuka Town Council 
<br/>was receiving around $200,000 from the Government to manage their operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have heard from the Minister, the FijiFirst Government also, at that point, designed 
<br/>and started working on the new and modern Municipal Market, and the reason why this was being 
<br/>done, was for two purposes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Municipal Council can start collecting fees etc. and they can slowly become self-sufficient; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>To allow the vendors from nearby islands to come to Levuka to sell their produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, with the help of the Government of Japan, we managed to 
<br/></span><span>secure a nine-tonne tipper truck and a 5.7 tonne excavator. With these two machineries, they are not 
<br/></span><span>only  managing  the  dumpsite,  but  they  are  also  hiring  it  out  to  the  ratepayers  at  a  cost.  They  pay 
<br/>money, and that is another additional revenue for the Municipal Council. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to take this opportunity 
<br/>to thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs and support staff, for reviewing 
<br/>and finalising the Levuka Town Council Annual Report for the 2012 and 2013.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Levuka  Town  Council  through  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  has 
<br/>received a total of $5.3 million over the last 11 years.  The substantial amount that we have seen here 
<br/>was in – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2012  -   $500,000;  
<br/>2013  -   around $210,000; 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2014  -   same amount of $210,000; 
<br/>2015  -   Fund for Challenge Investment Fund around $62,000; 
<br/>2016-2017 - Drainage and Flood Mitigation -  $50,000, Challenge Investment Fund around 
<br/>$299,000 and the completion of the Levuka Market; 
<br/>2022-2023 - around $1.7 million; and  
<br/>2023-2024 – we have budgeted around $1.37 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the Government has supported Levuka Town Council for the last 11 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a comment on Recommendations (6), that is the Councils 
<br/>should build on Public-Private Partnership Model and strengthen the partnership with Civil Society 
<br/>Organisations  to  improve  the  image  of  Levuka  as  a  heritage  site.  This  collaborative  approach 
<br/>envisions a concerted effort between the Private Entities and Civil Societies, to leverage resources, 
<br/>expertise and community development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Levuka  Town  Council,  is  impacted  by  the  deploring  state  of 
<br/>infrastructure. Our heritage site is in a deplorable state currently. A once, booming economy is now 
<br/>in a battle against aging infrastructure. With businesses relocated and people migrating to other parts 
<br/>of the country, this has resulted in the reduced number of ratepayers leading to economic down-turn 
<br/>of the town.  Sir, the Coalition Government recognises this problem and is looking at ways to assist 
<br/>Levuka  Town  Council,  also  having  the  Municipal  Elections  and  having  elected  members  will  be 
<br/>better planned for the towns and cities including Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 2013, the Council recorded an operating deficit of $64,000 and also into 
<br/>2014  and  2015,  owing  to  maintenance  of  properties,  roads,  drains,  streets,  streetlights  and  the 
<br/>payment of salaries and wages. They need Government and other grants to support itself to make 
<br/>surpluses, every year.  The previous Government neglected Fiji’s heritage site, Levuka. I have been 
<br/>told that Levuka, despite being isolated from the centre business district, is one of the most serviced 
<br/>town with a record of 26 ships serviced per week. The economy is surviving on the operation of the 
<br/>Pacific Fishing Company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, heritage tourism has been noted to be one of the desired tourism in other 
<br/>countries, but our first Capital fails to attract tourists. Levuka Town is also exposed to environmental 
<br/>degradation,  which  leads  to  depletion  of  Fiji’s  natural  resources.  The  human  factors  lead  to 
<br/>environmental degradation, Sir.  I wish to speak for a few minutes on the financial accounts, which 
<br/></span><span>needs to be updated. Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wish to thank the honourable 
<br/>Members that contributed to the motion before the Parliament, noting the Reporting here. Levuka 
<br/>Town  Council  has  been  encouraged  to  work  towards  to  the  submission  of  their  pending  Annual 
<br/>Reports. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you  honourable  Members,  Parliament  will  now  vote  to  note  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
