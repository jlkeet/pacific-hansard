<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  fellow 
<br/>Government Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today to deliver my Ministerial 
<br/>Statement  on  the  country’s  largest  and  one  of  the  oldest  hospitals,  the  Colonial  War  Memorial 
<br/>Hospital, which is celebrating its 100</span><span>th </span><span>birthday in nine days’ time.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Colonial War Memorial (CWM) Hospital, as we fondly call the hospital 
<br/>by, celebrates its century of existence on Saturday, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2023. This will be a proud moment 
<br/>for the Hospital and the Ministry and as the Minister for Health and Medical Services and a former 
<br/>staff of CWM Hospital, I am indeed proud to be part of the celebration of this achievement by an 
<br/>iconic health facility for the nation and the region.  The CWM Hospital is not the oldest health facility 
<br/>in Fiji however its achievements and contribution to the health of the people of Fiji over these 100 
<br/>years is most certainly worthy of our acknowledgment and appreciation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  a  brief  history  of  CWM  Hospital  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  original  colonial  Hospital  was 
<br/>located at Levuka the Old Capital of Fiji in Ovalau built by the local business community with the 
<br/>support of the British Subjects’ Mutual Protection Society in the 1860s.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1894, the Hospital was then relocated to Walu Bay in Suva, some 12 years after the Capital 
<br/>was officially relocated  from  Levuka Town to  Suva Town in  1882.  In 1918, the deadly  Spanish 
<br/>influenza pandemic that caused a high number of sickness and the demise of about 5 percent of the 
<br/>population in Fiji put a lot of pressure on the Hospital.  The Hospital was overwhelmed with cases 
<br/>and temporary hospitals were set up in the nearby schools and halls around Suva to cater for patients 
<br/>coming to the Hospital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was reported that from this experience, the then Government considered 
<br/>building a new and bigger hospital. With the end of World War I in 1918, the decision was made to 
<br/>build  the  new  hospital  as  a  memorial  to  Fijian  citizens  who  served  in  the  war  -  hence  the  name, 
<br/>“Colonial War Memorial Hospital”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1923, the new CWM Hospital was constructed and completed with the aid of £319,500.  It 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was officially opened by the then Governor of Fiji, Sir. Cecil Rodwell on 2nd December, 1923.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the time of its opening, the new Hospital boasted a total of 108 beds with 
<br/>a staffing of two doctors and a total of 27 staff.  Out of the 27, 17 were European staff and 10 were 
<br/>native staff, as they were called then. The new CWM Hospital contained an out-patient department, 
<br/>administration  offices,  inpatient  ward  beds  for  28  Europeans  and  80  natives,  kitchen,  laundry, 
<br/>operating room, x-ray room, clinical laboratory, nurses’ home, and lecture room. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an interesting and probably not well-known bit of the history of the Hospital 
<br/>is that the Hospital was said to be the brainchild of Sir Henry Marks, an Australian born businessman 
<br/>of  Jewish  descent,  and  Legislative  Council  member,  who  personally  donated  £5,000  towards  its 
<br/></span><span>founding and gave another £5,000 through his company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, Sir Marks, who was then elected as Mayor of Suva from 1926 to 1930, also 
<br/>held  the  rank of Major in the  Fiji  Volunteer  Force, before being  made  Honorary Colonel of the  Fiji 
<br/>Defence Force in 1937. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CWM Hospital today, as we have witnessed over the 100 years, the Hospital 
<br/>has evolved and expanded its services. The Hospital’s infrastructure has expanded tremendously from 
<br/>the original ferro-concrete building which constituted the current West Wing of the Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Hospital now has more than 500 inpatient beds and a workforce of more 
<br/>than 2000 workers and the scope of health provided by the hospital has expanded manyfold. Tertiary 
<br/>healthcare services like those available in tertiary hospitals abroad are now provided at the hospital by 
<br/>well trained and competent Fijian healthcare workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Hospital has continued in its teaching role, which started when the Colonial 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hospital  was  in  Levuka  and  continues  to  this  day.    Preparing  the  regions  next  generation  of  health 
<br/>practitioners  through  hand-on  training  for  thousands  of  undergraduates  and  post  graduate  trainees  in 
<br/>medicine, nursing, dental, allied health, health management, support services, and even including training 
<br/>from well-developed countries around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the century of services, many millions of Fijian citizens have been born, 
<br/>cared for, had consultation, treated, reviewed and discharged from the hospital.  As the referral hospital 
<br/>for the Central and Eastern Health Divisions, the hospital has ably provided health services to people 
<br/>referred for admission at the hospital, as well as conduct outreach visits to many islands in the Eastern 
<br/>Division as well as to the communities in Rewa, Tailevu and the interior of Naitasiri.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Medical Specialities from CWM Hospital continue to carry out outreach visits to the 
<br/>Western and Northern Health Divisions of the country, taking specialist medical services close to the 
<br/>population in these divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2021,  the  hospital  also  faced  a  very  similar  challenge  in  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, to the Spanish flu-pandemic that the original hospital faced in 1918.  The CWM Hospital 
<br/>responded effectively and contributed immensely to the Ministry’s overall successful response to the 
<br/>pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On infrastructure improvement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing the aging infrastructure at CWM 
<br/>Hospital has been a real challenge that previous governments have attempted to address.  The Hospital 
<br/>currently has a total of 14 buildings of varying ages. Those buildings that are 20 years and older require 
<br/>significant infrastructural improvement works. A number of infrastructure assessments have been done 
<br/>over the last decade and some repair and renovation works undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to undertaking the necessary works to address the 
<br/>infrastructure needs for the hospital and is utilizing our allocated resources as well as liaising with our 
<br/>health partners for technical assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the World Bank’s assistance a Structural Assessment Project was approved 
<br/>in June 2023 and is in progress for the Hospital.  A structural retrofitting assessment is to determine which 
<br/>buildings  are  suitable  for  refurbishment  or  extension,  and  to  delineate  the  necessary  structural 
<br/>interventions required to improve health services, safety, climate resilience, and compliance with national 
<br/>building codes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  initial  scoping  mission  was  completed  in  October  this  year  and  it  has 
<br/></span><span>identified eight out of 14 buildings as eligible for structural integrity and retrofitting assessments and 
<br/>further prioritization of the building is underway by the Ministry.  A full detailed assessment under the 
<br/>project is anticipated to commence in January 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  assessment  report  will  assist  the  Ministry  to  prioritise  the  most  urgent 
<br/>retrofits of CWM Hospital for consideration in our next annual budget proposal, while feeding into the 
<br/>long-term master planning for health services delivery in Fiji.  In addition, the ongoing “Health Sector 
<br/>Review”  that  the  World  Bank  is  assisting  the  government  is  expected  to  provide  additional 
<br/></span><span>information that would inform the master planning process that is required for the hospital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Centennial celebration CWM Hospital board of visitors have been 
<br/>working  hard  and  supporting  the  Medical  Superintendent  -  Dr  Luke  Nasedra,  the  proud  son  of 
<br/>Wainibuka and the Hospital Management in the celebration programme.  The Board Members are 
<br/>led by the Chairperson, Dr. Esther Williams are volunteers and are putting in a great effort to support 
<br/>the Centennial celebrations for the Hospital. The Centennial celebration was formally launched on

<div><span>I look forward to the support and participation from all honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at the various activities of the Centennial celebration, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, CWM Hospital launches into the Centennial celebration, we 
<br/>also acknowledge and pay our deepest respect to those dedicated Hospital workers who worked hard 
<br/>and gave their best in delivering health services from the Hospital in these 100 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  pay  tribute  to  the  former  Medical  Superintendents,  Matrons,  Consultants,  Doctors, 
<br/>Nurses,  Dental  Officers,  Allied  Health  Practitioners,  Ward  Assistants,  Drivers  and  other  Support 
<br/>Service workers, for the yesteryears, many of whom have since passed on while some are still with 
<br/>us today.  We also know that some of their descendants have come back to serve at CWM Hospital 
<br/>and some are still here today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  remains  committed  to  supporting  the  role  of  the  Colonial  War  Memorial 
<br/>Hospital to carry on the legacy of services and caring irrespective of age, gender, economic status or 
<br/>belief in the next 100 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to deliver my Ministerial Statement. </span><span>Vina’a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Good  morning.  Mr.  Speaker.    Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services Ministerial Statement. I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for the Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I understand that the Ministry of Health and Medical  Services intend to 
<br/>celebrate the Century of the old Colonial War Memorial Hospital. No doubt the old wing of the CWM 
<br/>Hospital has played a pivotal role in serving the people of Fiji throughout its 100 years of existence. 
<br/>It is essential to acknowledge the challenges posed through the progression of time and changes in 
<br/>Occupational Health and Safety Regulations among other international hospital standards to address 
<br/>them effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The West Wing of the CWM Hospital houses various clinical facilities as alluded to by the 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Minister  including  some  private  wards,  the  ANZ  Ward,  the  Rewa  Ward  and  the  Lau 
<br/></span><span>Ward. It also house some of the Matrons office, the main switchboard for the Hospital, Physiotherapy 
<br/>Department, the JB Savou Dental Teaching Clinic for the School of Medicine, the Urology Clinic 
<br/>and also the CWM Dental Clinic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering the significance of this historical building it is imperative to 
<br/>conduct a thorough evaluation to address the multiple issues concerning the infrastructure.   If the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coalition Government wants to keep this 100 years old building, then it is imperative, as alluded to 
<br/>by the honourable Minister, to do a thorough assessment of the building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I asked our honourable Whip whether the CWM Hospital is part of the National Heritage Site 
<br/>because I was thinking we could do something like MHCC, to keep the face, but he said, “No, not at 
<br/>the moment”.  So, in the status, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the infrastructure is no longer compliant to the Fiji 
<br/>Medical and Dental Council accreditation standard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  challenges  of  infection  control  is  an  ongoing  issue  in  the  building,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  
<br/>Currently, the Physiotherapy Department operates from the end of the East Wing, which is along the 
<br/>Extension Street, down to the other New Wing of the Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to improving the West Wing it is crucial to provide suitable office for the Nursing 
<br/>Unit Manager and staff, given that the inpatient wards and Dental, Physiotherapy and Urology Units 
<br/>also require a facelift, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  over  the  past  century,  the  dental  profession  and  the  services 
<br/>provided in the Dental Department of CWM Hospital has evolved immensely. The service demand 
<br/>by patients and the different modalities of diseases that are presented to the clinic has also changed 
<br/>from its initial size, and the services that were provided in the Dental Unit from the starting has now 
<br/>changed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  in  the  past  100  years,  dentistry  has  evolved  in  a  phenomenal  phase  globally,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. With the support of the Bainimarama and the FijiFirst Government, it assisted the Fiji 
<br/>National University to develop a speciality training - Post-Graduate Training for Dentists, who are 
<br/>now qualified but still serving as normal Dental Officers in the Hospital because of the need to review 
<br/>staff  establishment  due  to  the  increasing  population  and  the  demands  of  service,  and  also  to 
<br/>remunerate the Post-Graduate qualification and the speciality of care that they are now providing to 
<br/>Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  moment,  I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  to  look  into  the  staff 
<br/>establishment for CWM Hospital.  Also, at the moment, our Prosthetic Unit is operating from Nakasi 
<br/>Health Centre.  They were relocated there because of the OHS issue with the old Children’s Hospital 
<br/>- the wooden building across the road from the Mortuary. We need to bring the prosthetic service 
<br/>back to CWM Hospital to attach to the clinical services so that patients do not have to travel that far 
<br/>to and from for the completion of their dental care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, space is an issue in CWM Hospital and we hope that the honourable Minister, 
<br/>in their scoping and also in their plan, would consider the plight of the CWM Hospital Dental Unit. 
<br/>It is important because CWM Hospital Dental facility is the main referral centre for all dental cases 
<br/>that cannot be treated outside of Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have graduates who have done their Post-Graduate training that have also earned their 
<br/>licence for speciality service for dentistry but are not remunerated as such, and I had indicated this 
<br/>to the honourable Minister and I hope that he would look into it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement and I 
<br/>hope that the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
<br/>Finance will give the necessary funding support for the honourable Minister for Health and Medical 
<br/>Services to be able to uplift the healthcare services, especially at CWM Hospital, so that we can look 
<br/>forward to a new face of CWM Hospital.  By prioritising this improvement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>Ministry of Health can retain and enhance the historical significance of CWM Hospital for future

<br/>workers  of  the  Emperor  Gold  Mine  of  Vatukoula.    There  was  an  agreement  by  the  previous 
<br/>Government for them to be assisted under the Vatukoula Social Assistance Programme, which we 
<br/>have now fully funded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On another note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have received an additional 10 packages of housing 
<br/>materials,  transferred  from  the  Ministry  of  Housing  that  handled  the  Rural  Housing  Scheme 
<br/>previously. These housing materials were funded in the 2021-2022 Budget but procurement were 
<br/>deferred due to COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Housing has started the procurement of outstanding materials which are now 
<br/>delivered to our Ministry for facilitation of cartage to recipients.  We have already arranged to start 
<br/>the delivery of these materials from this weekend whereby three sets of materials will be delivered 
<br/>to  the  Northern  Division  and  seven  sets  will  be  delivered  to  the  Eastern  Division.    We  hope  to 
<br/>complete these deliveries by the end of next week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also in the process of recruiting a Head for Rural Housing 
<br/>Unit and a Senior Technical Officer, who should be appointed before the end of December 2023.  
<br/>The positions were advertised after the Ministry completed a Job Evaluation Exercise and upon the 
<br/>endorsement  of  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service.    The  Ministry  has  received  three  Leading  Hands 
<br/>transferred from the old Rural Housing Unit previously based in the Ministry of Housing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the Rural and Outer Island Development Programme, the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  is  also  working  on  completing  submission  for  the  $2.5  million  budget  release.    In  the 
<br/></span><span>meantime, the tender process for assets and services required under the programme have already been 
<br/>advertised (hire of machineries, procurement of portable sawmill and procurement of value adding 
<br/>equipment) and remaining ones targeted for advertisement this weekend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is in the process of recruiting a Head of the Rural

<div><span>and Outer Island Programme and a Senior Technical Officer, who should be appointed before the 
<br/>end  of  December  2023.    The  positions  were  only  advertised  after  the  Ministry  completed  a  Job 
<br/>Evaluation Exercise and upon the endorsement of the Ministry of Civil Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the three new programmes, the Ministry had to use its existing officers 
<br/>to  work  on  planning  for  implementation  and  drafting  of  Operational  Guidelines  and  Standard 
<br/>Operating Procedures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has already received approval from the Ministry of Finance to utilise 70 percent 
<br/>of the funds allocated for Self-Help Programmes and CARFF, an equivalent amount of $0.7 million 
<br/>and $1.4 million respectively.  The Ministry is now progressing on implementing a total of 29 Self-
<br/>Help Programmes and 39 CAFF projects to utilise the $2.1 million that has been approved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry recently received approval for the 
<br/>release of $0.8 million for the implementation of 43 Hire Risk Water and Sanitation Projects across 
<br/>the four Divisions - 13 Ecological Purification System Water Projects and 30 Sanitation Projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UNDP Gov4Res Project has been a valuable development partner for 
<br/>the Ministry since the signing of Letter of Agreement (LOA) in August 2020. The Risk Informed 
<br/>Development Programme is a game changer, and we are excited to be the pioneer of this Programme 
<br/>in Fiji and in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The UNDP  has provided almost  $2 million  to  the Ministry for the implementation  of this 
<br/>initiative to support 89 projects that are now being used as a demonstration not only in Fiji but have 
<br/>also been shared across the Pacific region and at the global platform at the DRR Meeting that was 
<br/>held in Bali, Indonesia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that honourable Members are aware of the Planned Relocation 
<br/>Guideline approved in 2018 and the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Planned Relocation in 
<br/>the Republic of Fiji document endorsed this year.  The Ministry has been identified as the lead agency 
<br/>for the implementation of the SOP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Relocation Projection Unit is expected to be established and this will be managed through 
<br/>the normal budget and planning process.  The Unit which is to be secretariat to the Fijian Taskforce 
<br/>for  Relocation  and  Displacement  will  largely  have  an  administrative  function.  At  present  this  is 
<br/>currently  being  managed  by  the  Climate  Change  Division  and  (GIZ),  the  German  Agency  for 
<br/></span><span>International Development Corporation (GIDC).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has an arrangement with the Ministry of the Interior and Safety 
<br/>of the Republic of Korea for the implementation of the Saemaul Undong.  This is a concept that has 
<br/>been implemented in Fiji since the signing of our Memorandum of Understanding in 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three communities namely; Silana and Naimasimasi in the Tailevu Province and Mau in the 
<br/>Namosi Province, had been selected for piloting the concept, and various development projects have 
<br/>been implemented in these Villages for the past three years.  The Ministry is working on applications 
<br/></span><span>for funding for new projects for the next budget cycle of the SMU Korea (2025-2029 budget years).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition  to  Saemaul Undong, there is  another programme called the Saemaul Geugmo, 
<br/>which  is  a  community  based  financial  model  and  focuses  on  communities’  sustainable  financial 
<br/>development through savings and self-help development through cooperative principles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Interior and Safety of the Republic of Korea has supported active ODA

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>projects such as the on-site study, individual training, consultation on an establishment and operation 
<br/>of pilot Saemaul Geugmo programme in developing countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Saemaul Geugmo  projects  have been implemented in  developing countries, including 
<br/>Myanmar, Uganda and Laos by the Korean Federation of Community Credit Co-operatives (KFCC).  
<br/>The  KFCC  is  now  intending  to  conduct  such  programmes  in  Fiji.    This  augurs  well  with  the 
<br/>Government’s  vision  of  encouraging  MSMEs  and  their  sustainability  to  support  our  local 
<br/>communities and improve living standards and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another regional organisation that the Ministry is working with is through its membership in 
<br/>the Centre for Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP), which provides 
<br/>technical support and promotes innovative best practices on sustainable integrated rural development 
<br/>amongst member countries in Asia-Pacific in order to improve the lives of the rural people.  The 
<br/>CIRDAP also provides training for member countries in different thematic areas, including integrated 
<br/>rural development, governance, sustainable development, economic empowerment and socio audits, 
<br/>to name a few.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has developed a template or guideline to assist communities in formulating their 
<br/>development plan.  This is to ensure that communities are better able to plan and coordinate their 
<br/>development  priorities  so  that  there  is  a  more  cohesive  approach  towards  development  and 
<br/>resourcing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  but  not  the  least,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  whilst  I  appreciate  the  support  provided  by  the 
<br/>Government towards the rural and maritime communities of our nation, I believe that it is time that 
<br/>we, as a Government, must work together on changing the mindsets of our people.  Over the past 16 
<br/>years, a culture of dependency syndrome has been developed.  This, obviously, drains out resources 
<br/>that can be better allocated towards efforts of poverty reduction and investing in education for our 
<br/>future generation, for instance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has to be a concerted effort between the Government, development partners and the 
<br/>private  sector,  towards  building  the  best  capacity  of  our  rural  and  maritime  citizens  to  have 
<br/>confidence in themselves, make productive use of the resources that they own, and reinvest in their 
<br/>respective  communities,  thereby,  contribute  the  economic  growth.    There  must  be  a  change  in 
<br/>mindset, a total paradigm shift, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In planning for development at community level, this is an area that I intent to focus on in the 
<br/></span><span>next 12 months.  Our people must be encouraged to instil a culture of wealth creation and innovation 
<br/></span><span>from an early age.  We should not underestimate the capabilities that already exist in our communities 
<br/>- women and youth empowerment, and even recognising the talents of our children.  Planning at the 
<br/>community level should embrace this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the establishment of the Department of Strategic Planning in the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance, and I believe that this will assist in better coordination in planning for development at all 
<br/>levels - national, divisional, district and community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  Rural  and  Outer  Island  Development  Programme  and 
<br/></span><span>decentralisation of services, and to curb rural to urban drift and transforming the landscape of our 
<br/>communities, the Ministry plans to strengthen guidelines and frameworks for rural development in 
<br/>the  next  12  months.    This  will  be  done  through  a  consultative  approach,  not  only  within  the 
<br/>Government, but with all key stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to enlighten Parliament on the progress made

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  the  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition or his designate, I would like to adjourn Parliament for tea.  But before doing so, I would 
<br/>like to acknowledge, once more, those sitting in the gallery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  been  informed  by  honourable  Ditoka  that  there  are  few  friends  of  Fiji  here.    I 
<br/>understand some are from the Australian Embassy.  Could you stand up if you are from the Australian 
<br/>Embassy?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noticed our former staff at the Consul General’s Office in Sydney, Orisi, with his fancy 
<br/>haircut sitting at the gallery as well.  Welcome, Orisi.  No wonder, we have missed you during our 
<br/>recent trip to Sydney.

<div><span>From New Zealand, we have Nina Nawalowalo.  </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka, Bulou. </span><span> The last time we

<div><span>Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for tea and, please, dear friends, you may join

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to respond to the 
<br/>Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/>Management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last evening when we concluded, he made a very passionate speech on the 
<br/>Fiji  Sports  Council  2017-2018  Annual  Report  and  I  reminded  him  that  his  National  Disaster 
<br/>Awareness Week has brought disaster to Albert Park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ground condition  is quickly  deteriorating, and  I urge the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Local Government to please take particular care about Albert Park.  Suva is our capital, 
<br/>Suva is our pride and there has been a lot of investment. I walk around the park almost everyday 
<br/>during dinner time and I am really worried about the condition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- $10 million for Albert Park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes, Sir, justified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statement by the honourable Minister this  morning, again, very well 
<br/>aligns and confirms what I did mention a few years back, the shift in our development paradigm.  We 
<br/>had </span><span>TC Tomas</span><span> in 2010 - a Category 4 Cyclone; </span><span>TC Evans</span><span>, again, in 2012 - a Category 4 Cyclone, let 
<br/>alone all the other calamities that occurred in between and then in 2016 with </span><span>TC Winston,</span><span> the change 
<br/>in our development paradigm that we took with us into Bangkok and Tokyo.  The way we live is 
<br/>changing, the way we do development must change and, therefore, the way we do partnership must 
<br/>also change and this is exactly what the honourable Minister had stated in his Ministerial Statement 
<br/>this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  good  to  see  that  he  is  continuing  but  I  differ  with  his  concluding 
<br/>remarks.  In the Ministry we inculcated a dependency syndrome in the last six years.  I beg to differ 
<br/>on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir because rural development is essential.  We have huge potentials in rural 
<br/>Fiji  and  therefore  it  is  important  that  we  create  the  environment  for  rural  Fijians.    There  are 
<br/>constraints,  there  are  challenges,  what  we  as  leaders,  we  as  planners  must  do  is  convert  those 
<br/>constraints and challenges into opportunities because there are huge potentials and opportunities that 
<br/></span><span>can only be realised when government creates the environment for our rural people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  the  way  we  live  is  changing,  I  have  talked  about  resilience  in 
<br/>development, I have talked about sustainability in development and that is why the governance for 
<br/>resilience  programme  was  in  place  together  with  the  United  Nations.    It  is  about  risk  informed 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Minister  for  Works,  I  drove  up  to  Vunidawa  on  the  day  after  </span><span>TC  Mal</span><span>  and  a 
<br/>suggestion to you, honourable Minister, and the honourable Minister for Rural Development in terms 
<br/></span><span>of governance for resilience, we are now still doing the Viria Water Project.  I saw the construction 
<br/></span><span>of the pipes at the Naqali Crossing and, of course, on the two bridges and into Waila. We need to 
<br/>protect the very end of those pipes as it comes up onto the platform that was constructed to raise the 
<br/>pipes so that it is protected from the elements of the environment.  If flooding can take away the 
<br/>Moto Bridge, it can take away those pipes.  This is about the resilience in development and I hope 
<br/>when it comes to risk informed development that we can look into that.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, infrastructure development; what do we need to do?  Again, infrastructure 
<br/>development is critical. We have to look at the airfields in the rural areas, the jetties in the rural areas, 
<br/>the roading in the rural areas, communication in the rural areas because these are all essential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essential Services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Social Services particularly health, education, 
<br/>water,  I  will  not  go  into  the  finer  details.    Financial  support  is  very  critical.  Yes,  there  were 
<br/>considerations in  the last few years to  have the same programme  as the  NDP first  in  the  Eastern 
<br/>Division so that the concerns and the potentials in the Eastern Division can be realised.  Of course, 
<br/>we learnt a lot when we went to the islands of Lau. I totally agree with what the honourable Minister 
<br/>is considering about the need for detailed planning.  We need to now have specific development plans 
<br/>for every geographic region in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Vatoa is different from Ovalau; Ono-i-Lau is different from Wakaya. So, we 
<br/>need to look at specifically the area, potentials, challenges and what can we do as leaders and as 
<br/>planners to bring those potentials and opportunities into reality.  That is why these programmes are 
<br/>so important. Again, I emphasise resilience in development, particularly on housing, we need to get 
<br/>our people out of the poverty cycle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of internal  movements,  probably  I will not call it displacement, but a lot of internal 
<br/>movements came after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> particularly for those who had their homes damaged.  Again, this 
<br/>is an investment. We invest in housing. We will get our people out of the poverty cycle and they can 
<br/>use their savings and reinvest into other potentials they have in the rural areas. Saemaul Undong and 
<br/>Saemaul Geugmo (MG), we know what is happening in in those programmes, again just continue 
<br/>with it, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly  on  Rural  and  Outer  Island  (ROI),  this  is  important  but  the  linkage  between  ROI, 
<br/>Ministry  for  Women,  Ministry  for  Youth  and  Sports,  Ministry  for  Agriculture  and  Ministry  for 
<br/>Fisheries and Forestry is very critical.  If we are to graduate the subsistence farmers, fishermen and 
<br/>women from where they are with the current level to the semi-commercial level, it is the whole of 
<br/>Government  approach  and  it  is  the  interagency  connectivity  that  is  very  important  for  the  ROI 
<br/>Programme and it needs to be supported. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do agree with the concluding remarks of the honourable Minister, and I would like to say 
<br/>that continuity and further improvement is necessary in order to fully realise the potentials and the 
<br/>opportunities in rural Fiji that I have talked about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Australian Ministerial Visit to PALM Scheme Workers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, guests in the gallery and those watching on their television or online; I rise 
<br/>to  update  this  august  Parliament  on  the  recent  Ministerial  visit  to  Fijian  workers  in  Australia, 
<br/>approved employers and the Fijian diaspora from the 21</span><span>st</span><span> October to the 4</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I commence with my Ministerial Statement, I just wish to provide a 
<br/></span><span>response to the supplementary question that was asked by the other side of Parliament yesterday on 
<br/></span><span>the Volunteer Service Abroad (VSA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our records show that there are two Volunteer Schemes that the Ministry is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engaged in: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Graduates Pre-Service or Pre-Employment who are registered as volunteers for training under

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>NEC and that is where we have 105 of them this year; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Regional Volunteer Scheme whereby our retirees and unemployed are engaged in the Pacific 
<br/>Islands abroad.  This scheme has not been operating since 2021 due to budgetary constraints 
<br/>and other government priorities, including COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The New Zealand VSA Scheme, the volunteer scheme in New Zealand, this is the first time we are 
<br/>signing the agreement with them.  It has not been in existence before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this visit to Australia was to meet with the Fijian workers, 
<br/>approved  employers  and  the  Fijian  diaspora  in  the  five  states  across  Australia,  that  is  Australian 
<br/>Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria which were not 
<br/>covered in our first visit in March this year.  This was to enable my Ministry to hear their concerns 
<br/>and views regarding the schemes and to take appropriate action to resolve that.  The areas visited are 
<br/>also those from where most complaints were received by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our honourable Prime Minister on 18</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023 signed the renewed 
<br/>and elevated Vuvale Partnership Agreement with his Australian counterpart in Canberra.  Under the 
<br/>partnership engagement, Pillar 2 is related to deepening economic relationships and this is where our 
<br/>Labour Mobility Programmes are captured in the document.  Through this partnership agreement, 
<br/>we will work closely with the Australian Government to enhance the protection of Fijian workers 
<br/>and  strengthen  their  rights  while  working  in  Australia.    This  includes  implementing  measures  to 
<br/>address issues of concerns pertaining to worker’s welfare and their well-being. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, kindly allow me to take this opportunity to reassure our honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  this  august  Parliament  of  my  Ministry’s  commitment  to  working  closely  with  the 
<br/>Australian counterparts to ensure that the PALM Scheme continues to benefit Fijian workers and 
<br/>their families while upholding their rights as well.  Together, we will strive to create a fair and just 
<br/>working environment  for all Fijian workers and strengthen the Vuvale Partnership for the mutual 
<br/>benefit of both countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of issues received by the Ministry on labour mobility under the 
<br/>PALM Scheme resulted from the pathetic attitude of the previous administration for not taking time 
<br/>to visit our workers during their last four years in Government.  Remember, I am talking about the 
<br/>last four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to set the record right, honourable Koroilavesau and honourable 
<br/></span><span>Usamate visited the workers during their terms like  I  am  doing,  but  I cannot  say the same about 
<br/></span><span>honourable Bala.  He once visited the RSC workers in New Zealand who go there for only  eight 
<br/>months from 7</span><span>th</span><span> to 11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2019.  No PALM worker was visited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Look after the workers of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- That is exactly what we are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I do not think so.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  achieving  this  the  Fijian  Government  through 
<br/>representation by my Ministry and the Fiji High Commissioner to Australia held meetings with the

<br/>of labour mobility and shared economic development, also identifying gaps and finding appropriate 
<br/>solutions to strengthen the programme.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during this meeting, both my Australian counterparts and I discussed a range 
<br/>of key issues on the terms and conditions of employment, compliance with minimum standards, skills 
<br/>training  and  assessment  and  expanding  opportunities  for  workforce  collaboration,  funding  of  the 
<br/>Country Liaison Officers (CLOs) and local training institutions for industry skills development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both countries reaffirmed their dedication to the PALM Scheme and expressed their intention 
<br/>to  further  strengthen  ties  with  mutual  interest  in  addition  to  the  Ministry  putting  together  a 
<br/>governance structure for the CLOs and proposed case officers and Community Connections.  This 
<br/>organisation is working with the Australian Government to assist our workers in Australia to further 
<br/>reach out to workers with issues and provide support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have conducted a meeting with some approved employers who have 
<br/>engaged Fijian workers under the PALM Scheme. The meeting aimed at addressing any key concerns 
<br/>that  may  have  arisen  during  the  workers  employment  in  Australia.  This  meeting  was  crucial  in 
<br/>fostering  a  positive  working  relationship  and  ensuring  that  work  rights  and  wellbeing  of  Fijian 
<br/>workers are protected. The Ministry is committed to working closely with the approved employers 
<br/>to uphold the principles of fairness, transparency and respect for workers under the scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had a series of meetings with  the Fijian diaspora to  discuss the 
<br/>important role they play in assisting our Fijian workers under the Scheme through the provision of 
<br/>proper advice and community connect programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank our various Fijian communities in Australia for providing valuable support 
<br/>and  contribution  to  our  Fijian  workers  when  the  need  arises  and  were  faced  with  challenging 
<br/>situations  in  any alien environment  as well as the culture shock that they were faced  with.  I  also 
<br/>extend my sincere gratitude to the respective religious organisations and their pastors for the crucial 
<br/>role they play in providing pastoral care to our workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The insights and contributions from the Fijian diaspora are incredibly valuable to ensuring 
<br/></span><span>the wellbeing and success of Fijian workers under the Scheme and we are committed to working 
<br/>closely with the diaspora for the betterment of our workers. Also, I called upon the Fijian diaspora 
<br/>while we were there, Sir, to work collectively to ensure Fijian workers are all treated with dignity 
<br/>and integrity and free from harmful effects of misinformation to support initiatives that promote their 
<br/>wellbeing, rights and fair treatment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, meeting our Fijian workers after a lapse of three years was an eye-opener. 
<br/>At the same time, I felt a sense of shame and guilt over this matter about the laxity of the previous 
<br/></span><span>administration.

<div><span>HON. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, they have to accept it, they ditched them.

<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of those.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know how you looked after the workers of this country as well.  Let the Bill come this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- We are looking after all of them, unlike what you did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of these meetings was to engage directly 
<br/>with the workers, understand their experiences, address any concerns they have and ensure that they 
<br/>are receiving the treatment and support while in Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  meetings  were  crucial  to  ensuring  the  workers’  wellbeing  and  success  under  the 
<br/>scheme. The country liaison officer, the first one that we have appointed, accompanied us and noted 
<br/>the concerns that need to be addressed through dialogue with the respective employers and to draw 
<br/>the attention of relevant state agencies to ensure compliance, especially in the areas of work rights 
<br/>and fair work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  Fijian  workers  visited  expressed  their  sincere  appreciation  to  the 
<br/>Coalition Government for taking time to visit and listen to their grievances. There were occasions 
<br/>where emotions got high, there were tears (tears of joy) as well shed by those workers, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, and I quote what most of them said:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We have not received any Ministerial visitation for the past three years since our 
<br/>deployment in 2021, and seeing the Government delegation present here today, gives us 
<br/>hope that the Government of the day cares for us.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Another jurisdiction all together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I know it hurts, sorry about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is a government elected by the people for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- When we fully understand our responsibility to our people, wherever 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Hence, the need to meet with them and solve their problems. Who else 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can they look upon for this assistance, Mr. Speaker?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Not you!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  They  were  ditched,  as  I  have  said  earlier,  by  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- They felt, what they felt. Talk to them when you see them, they will tell 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- People are watching you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes, they are all watching. They are watching from abroad as well and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- They are getting more than $5 an hour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- That will come as well, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visitation has enabled the Ministerial Team to hear 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and see things from a bird’s eye perspective. It has also revealed …
