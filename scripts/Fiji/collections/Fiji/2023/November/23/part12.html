<div><span>Review Report - Energy Fiji Limited 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the Review Report on the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) faced unprecedented challenges in 2021 due to 
<br/>COVID-19,  in  particular,  the  second  wave  of  the  pandemic  which  significantly  impacted  EFL’s 
<br/>electricity  demand.  The  Committee  noted  an  increase  in  the  number  of  domestic  customers 
<br/>benefitting from subsidies provided by EFL, especially after 2020, and acknowledges EFL for this 
<br/>initiative given that a number of customers were affected by the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of Government’s commitment to climate change, the Committee 
<br/></span><span>noted  the  importance  of  EFL  embarking  on  Renewable  Energy  Sites  Projects,  and  strongly 
<br/>recommends for the inclusion of key stakeholders, such as landowners in the land acquisition process. 
<br/>It  is  also  recommended  that  all  efforts  be  made  to  ensure  that  the  pending  Power  Purchase 
<br/>Agreements are expedited to achieve the current target of 100 percent Renewable Energy by 2036. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the need for Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) 
<br/>to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical aspects of EFL’s regulatory functions, such as the 
<br/>registration  of  licensed  electricians  and  ensuring  standard  compliance  are  met.  In  this  regard,  the 
<br/></span><span>Committee  recommended  for  FCCC  to  recruit  the  necessary  expertise  required  to  regulate  the 
<br/></span><span>services of EFL. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  deliberating,  the  Committee  noted  a  slow  increase  in  the  use  of  solar  rooftop 
<br/>installations  and  encourages  the  use  of  solar  powered  products  by  domestic  and  commercial 
<br/>customers as an alternative to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel.

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the entities that appeared 
<br/>before the Committee and for being prompt in responding to the various queries and questions raised 
<br/>by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I hereby commend the Committee’s Report to Parliament and I request all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members to take note of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.

<div><span>Review Report - Energy Fiji Limited 2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the  Review Report on the Energy Fiji Limited 2022 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While deliberating on the 2022 Report, the Committee noted that EFL managed to make a 
<br/>healthy profit despite the various challenges and unforeseen expenses they had to endure during the 
<br/>financial year and commends the team at EFL for maintaining its financial soundness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  EFL’s  existing  Risk  Mitigation  strategies  provided  substantial 
<br/>support to the company during the adverse impact of COVID-19. This included strategies to address 
<br/>the disruption in EFL’s supply chain and the minimising of the effects of rising fuel costs through its 
<br/>Hedging Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted with concern the damages to EFL’s infrastructure which occurred due to various 
<br/>reasons such as motor vehicle accidents that damaged power poles, overgrown vegetation clashing 
<br/></span><span>with power lines, third-party damage to EFL underground cables and vandalism of EFL assets. The 
<br/></span><span>Committee would like to urge members of the public to be mindful of EFL’s infrastructure to ensure 
<br/>that they continue receiving undisrupted electricity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, EFL lost 54 technical employees for greener pastures overseas. Given that 
<br/>EFL is an essential service provider, it is imperative to further develop strategies to entice technical 
<br/>employees from moving overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware that multiple Renewable Energy Projects are in the pipeline 
<br/></span><span>at  present.  However,  the  Committee  is  concerned  that  our  National  Targets  to  meet  100  percent 
<br/></span><span>Renewable Electricity by 2036 might not be achievable.  While hearing submissions, the Committee 
<br/>was made aware that various applicants who intended to invest in Renewable Energy Programmes 
<br/>had their applications rejected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the entities that appeared 
<br/>before the Committee for being prompt in responding to the various queries and questions raised by

<br/>request all honourable Members to take note of the Report.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion  without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is  initiated at  a future 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Corrections Service 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee  on 
<br/>Justice, Law and Human Rights is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report 
<br/>on the Fiji Corrections Service 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Corrections Service is obligated under the Corrections Service Act 
<br/>to  serve  the  public  by  keeping  in  custody  those  convicted  by  the  courts,  in  providing  effective 
<br/>corrective  and  rehabilitation  services,  whilst  applying  all  relevant  human  rights  obligations  and 
<br/>standards.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report captures the review findings and recommendations of the Committee in respect 
<br/>of the pertinent issues noted from the contents of the Fiji Corrections Service 2018-2019 and the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service 2019-2020 Annual Reports.   For the review, the Committee conducted extensive 
<br/>deliberation on the Annual Reports, whereby issues were identified and correspondences regarding 
<br/>these issues were made with the FCS and its representatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Some of the main areas of discussion addressed in this Report are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Corrections  Service  is  committed  to  reducing  the  high  number  of  contraband 
<br/></span><span>entering correctional facilities. 
<br/></span><span>The  Fiji  Corrections  Service  continues  to  work  towards  its  responsible  target  by  safely 
<br/>detaining and rehabilitating persons sentenced to imprisonment or placed on remand at its 
<br/>correctional centres pending trial by the courts. 
<br/>The Fiji Corrections Service has no control over the number of persons incarcerated by the 
<br/>courts,  therefore,  does  not  have  means  to  minimise  overcrowding  issues  within  the 
<br/>correction facility.  
<br/>The Fiji Corrections Service has taken humanitarian steps to monitor and provide day care 
<br/>towards  inmates  of  old  age.    This  has  subsequently  exposed  the  lack  of  facilitation  for 
<br/></span><span>inmates that are at risk with respect to mental and health problems. 
<br/></span><span>The Fiji National Budget 2022-2023 provided funding for a Job Evaluation Exercise to be 
<br/>conducted  for  the  FCS  staff  with  the  view  to  reviewing  salaries.    The  FCS  engaged  a 
<br/>consultant company - Maxumise Pte. Limited to conduct the JEE, which was to conclude 
<br/>in  early October 2023.   The Ministry  of Justice and Ministry of  Finance  now  have the 
<br/>responsibility to evaluate and determine its outcome.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  during  its  tour  of  Correction  facilities  was  informed  of  the  land  tenure 
<br/>issues  at  its  Levuka  Corrections  Centre.    The  Committee  notes  that  the  Fiji  Correction 
<br/>Service has taken steps to protect tenure on the </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> land by signing a 99-year lease 
<br/>agreement with Land Owning Unit Yavusa Totogo beginning in 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>At the conclusion of this review, the Committee believes that the majority of the issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>identified in the review, have been adequately addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Members of the Justice, Law 
<br/>and  Human  Rights  Committee  -  honourable  Iliesa  Vanawalu  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable 
<br/>Mosese  Bulitavu,  honourable  Lenora  Qereqeretabua  and  honourable  Faiyaz  Koya,  for  their 
<br/>deliberations  and  input.    I  also  acknowledge  the  representatives  of  Fiji  Corrections  Service,  who 
<br/>made themselves available to make submissions which assisted the Committee in its work.
