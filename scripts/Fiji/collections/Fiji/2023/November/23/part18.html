<div><span>EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 
<br/></span><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That the Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 27/2023), 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be debated, voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Employment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled on Tuesday 21</span><span>st</span><span> of November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Employment Relations Act 2007, as I had mentioned on Tuesday, had 
<br/>been the subject of much expressed concern in relation to the compliance of International Labour 
<br/>Standards and this Bill is just the beginning of the work that this Government seeks to carry out in 
<br/>order to upgrade Fiji’s compliance level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not about following whatever the international world tells us to do as
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Usamate would like us to believe but about doing what should have been done a long 
<br/>time ago, that is precisely why this is so urgent. According to the International Labour Organisation, 
<br/>the employment relationship is the legal link between employers and employees. This relationship 
<br/>exists when a person performs work or services for his or her employer under certain conditions in 
<br/>return for remuneration or payment of the work or service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this legal framework the rights and obligations are created as well 
<br/>as the application of labour law provisions. The main purpose of amending the definition of essential 
<br/>services and industries in Section 185 of the Act is to revert the list of essential services back to the 
<br/>original definition of essential services as contained in Schedule Seven, and to bring Fiji’s list of 
<br/>essential services in compliance with ILO Convention No. 87 being “the Freedom of Association and 
<br/>the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948”. Fiji ratified this Convention on 17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 
<br/>2002 (that is more than 20 years ago).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 201l the Essential National Industries Employment Decree 2011 and the Essential National 
<br/>Industries  and  Designated  Corporations  Regulations  2011  made  amendments  with  significantly 
<br/>impacted  works  freedom  of  association  and  the  ability  to  bargain  collectively.  Example  of  such 
<br/>provisions in the 2011 legislative amendments were that all pre-existing collective agreements were 
<br/>terminated within 60 days after the commencement day of the decree.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The re-registration was required of every union, pending employment related disputes and 
<br/>grievances and litigations were terminated and employment disputes were referred to compulsory 
<br/>arbitration by the Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations with no right of 
<br/>appeal. Rather than unions have recourse to the Employment Relations Tribunal and the Employment 
<br/>Relations Courts. The ENI Regulations widen the scope of essential industries in Schedule Seven of 
<br/>the  Act  to  include  financial  industry,  telecommunication  industry,  civil  aviation  industry  and  the 
<br/>public utilities industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there was widespread criticism of the ENI decree and ENI regulations by Fiji 
<br/>Unions  including;  the  Fiji  Trade  Union  Congress,  the  Fiji  Island  Council  of  Trade  Unions  and 
<br/>internationally  by  the  International  Trade  Unions  Confederation,  the  Australian  Council  of  Trade 
<br/>Unions, the Commonwealth Trade Union Group, the ILO Committee of Experts on the application 
<br/>of Conventions in its observations of the Convention 87 of 2012 urge the Fiji Government to take 
<br/>the necessary measure to amend the ENI decree without delay in full consultations with the social 
<br/>partners so is to bring in conformity with Convention No. 87.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2013, two sets of regulations under the ENI decree were passed to extend the coverage of 
<br/></span><span>ENI decree which increased the number of industries and entities that were designated as essential 
<br/>services, to include the FNPF, Airports Fiji Limited, Pine and Mahogany Industries (that is including 
<br/>Tropik  Wood  and  Fiji  Hardwood),  Fire  Prevention  Services  Industry  including  the  National  Fire 
<br/>Authority and Local Governments including all towns and city councils in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, the ENI Decree was appealed the new Part 19 was inserted in the Act. This new Part 
<br/>19  read,  and  I  quote,  “it  introduced  a  new  interpretation  provisions  in  Section  185  which  define 
<br/>‘essential  service  and  industry’  to  include  government,  statutory  authority,  local  authority,  a 
<br/></span><span>government commercial company as prescribed under the Public Enterprise Act of 1996.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the definition in Section 185 included those essential, national industries declared and 
<br/>designated cooperations or designated companies, designated under the ENI Decree and an extended 
<br/>application of the Act to such industries and workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  preserve  the  extended  list  of  industries  designated  as  essential  services.  It  also 
<br/>introduced a new system for collective bargaining and employer union dispute resolution in those 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>corporations  and  services  and  establish  a  new  Arbitration  Court  to  decide  on  trade  disputes  in 
<br/>essential national industries and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The effect  of  amending  the definition of essential  service industry, will be, to  remove the 
<br/>extended  list  of  categories  of  essential  service  industries  which  were  designated  under  the  ENI 
<br/>Decree. Following the Amendment, the current list of essential services contain in Schedule 7, only 
<br/>will be Fiji’s list of essential services and any such other services, part of those listed, provided if, 
<br/>and only if, designated by the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of consultation, the Ministry had consulted with ERAB Sub-Committee in relation 
<br/>to the ERA Matrix in February and September as articulated by the Ministry of Employment this 
<br/>morning. The Ministry has also held consultations with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry 
<br/>of  Finance,  Strategic  Planning  and  National  Development  and  Statistics,  the  Ministry  of  Civil 
<br/>Service, Office of the Solicitor-General and the Ministry of Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I just touch on a few clauses on the Bill. Clause 1 of the Employment 
<br/>Relations Amendment Bill 2023 makes provision for the short title and commencement. If passed by 
<br/>Parliament,  the  amending  legislation  will  come  into  force  on  a  date  or  date(s)  appointed  by  the 
<br/>Minister by notice in the Gazette. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  2  of  the  Bill,  amends  Section  185  of  the  Act  by  introducing  a  new  definition  for 
<br/>essential services and industry or essential services and industries, in order to revert to the original 
<br/>list  of  essential  services  in  Schedule  7,  by  deleting  reference  to  essential  national  industries 
<br/>designated under the ENI Decree. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A new definition provides that additional essential services industries maybe designated after 
<br/>the date of commencement of the amended legislation and may include a service which is part of a 
<br/>listed entities, service providers, including services provided by the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill (Amends) Section 188 of the Act, to increase the time limit of workers in 
<br/>essential service to lodge or file employment grievances from 21 days to six months, the date on 
<br/>which a grievance first arose. A new time limit for filing of employment grievance does not have 
<br/>retrospective effect and only applies to actions filed after the date of commencement of the amending 
<br/>legislation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I have a list 
<br/>of four speakers, provided by the Whips. A batting will be led off by honourable Maharaj, then to be 
<br/>followed  by  the  honourable  Minister  Agni  Deo  Singh  and  if  we  have  time  we  will  follow  on  by 
<br/>honourable Jone Usamate before it is rounded off by honourable Minister Vosarogo.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have here before us a Bill that 
<br/>has two clauses, or particularly three, I would say. Members have been harping all along about the 
<br/>suppression of employees’ rights. Ever since 2007 ERA got into place. A lot of talks were there that, 
<br/></span><span>employees’ rights are supressed, this, that, blah, blah, blah. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We went with so many changes, 2015 an amendment was brought 
<br/>in, it was brought under 51, no doubt in that, but it was given to the Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights.  They went for a public consultation, they had some amendments to be done, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2251 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>made those amendments, it was brought back to Parliament in July 2015 where it was debated and 
<br/>passed.  Even after that ILO did not have any issues with the particular ERA that is, that was available 
<br/>in the form of what it is today, yes, honourable Professor Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When people  go to elections with this kind of agenda this is what actually happens.  We need 
<br/>to change to show people something, what are we changing in this, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  What kind of 
<br/>suppression  was  there  that  we  have  to  change  and  bring  these  three  clauses  that  now  all  these 
<br/>people.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The 21 days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- All the employers of Fiji basically only 30 percent out of more than 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3,090 employees are unionised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Only 30 percent by now the number would have decreased, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Gosh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  But  just  because  someone  has  gone  out  there  and  promised  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- With most genuine reason. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  ...voters  that  we  will  actually  remove  it,  they  need  to  bring  in 
<br/>something and there is no such thing to this particular Bill.  There was no restriction that industries 
<br/>that are part of essential industries as per the Act they cannot go on strike, they can, all that was 
<br/>required was to give a 28 days’ notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA- You give the permit?  No permit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Did anyone apply?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Did anyone apply? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We applied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- To go on strike? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- If you want to go on strike ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Shameema Ali is crying.

<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a developing nation.  Even if ILO agreed 
<br/>that the essential industries may defer from countries to countries.   In Fiji we are a tourism-based 
<br/>GDP over here, Mr. Speaker. Our economy is depended on tourism, so in Fiji’s context the tourism 
<br/>sector, airport, Fiji Airways, Aviation industry they are very essential set out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Simple ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- People willing to come to Fiji we cannot actually expect pilots to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be going on strike without notice.  The employers ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are requesting the union... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ- Oh come on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, as I say we are a developing nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We are a developing nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we need to  have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tailor-made essential industries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Listen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Stands for Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, there seems to be a lot of running commentary going on. Just listen, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with ILO there were only two issues with our 
<br/>ERA before amendments in 2015 and that was collecting bargaining and if the essential industries, 
<br/>employees, could actually associate with other unions and 2015 Amendments of the Act allow that.  
<br/>That is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was stating when we actually go and do false promises to the voters 
<br/></span><span>we will come back and do such kind of changes to the Act... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Which  will  affect  the  nation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  no 
<br/>suppression of what they are actually changing, will not reflect that the suppression will be removed, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these contributions I do not support the Amendment that is before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  quite  not  only  surprised,  but  shocked  at 
<br/>honourable Maharaj’s statement.  He was the former Assistant Minister and he would have read the 
<br/>reports from ILO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ILO  has  been  the  Committee  on  application  of  standards  has  been 
<br/>beseeching Fiji year after year, after 2015 (2018 and 2019) to correct the essential industries list, to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>restore the rights of all those workers who are not in essential services.  I would invite him to go back 
<br/>and read those reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should also be aware that 2019 Direct Contact Mission is still pending 
<br/>and is due here on the invitation of our Government now, either in December or in January, to see 
<br/>the progress of where we are with the amendment of the Employment Relations Act.  There are so 
<br/>many  comments  that  are  there  regarding  workers’  rights  that  have  been  breached  through  these 
<br/>amendments that were carried out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  2007  all  was  fine  until  2011  everything  was  fine,  no  one  complained 
<br/>because the law was catering for everyone’s rights.  It was only when they started tinkering with this 
<br/>in 2011 as an interim regime, where no one had any right to protest or oppose, and if they did, you 
<br/>know what happened.  That is when it started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that this side of Parliament, who genuinely believe 
<br/>in  true  democracy,  empowerment  of  our  people  and  restoring  the  rights  of  all  workers  whole-
<br/>heartedly support the Bill before us.  The struggle of the workers and their leaders to ensure justice, 
<br/>fair play and equality is now finally becoming a reality after the harrowing experience of 16 years of 
<br/>suppression by a dictatorship that did not give a dam about the rights and freedom of the workers.  
<br/>This  is  despite  the  fact  that  Fiji  had  ratified  the  fundamental  Conventions  as  alluded  to  by  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General.  I do not want to repeat all that, I have said it quite a number of times 
<br/>in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, simply, the assault on the rights and freedom of workers began just after 
<br/>December, a little after 2007, executed by a regime and later a government, although democratically 
<br/>elected, unable to shirk its dictatorial traits.  This is despite the fact that Fiji had well before that 
<br/>ratified the fundamental Conventions that I had just pointed out.  We all know that Essential National 
<br/>Industries  Decree  2011  later  largely  incorporated  into  the  Employment  Relations  Act  2015,  with 
<br/>some cosmetic changes in 2016 to try and avoid the ILO Direct Contact Mission or Commission of 
<br/>Inquiry, which was…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I will ask you to sit down since the bell has been 
<br/>sounded so I can provide another speakers to stand up and make their contribution.  When the bell is 
<br/>sounded too, it will go to the next speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you very much, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it would be better to listen to me after listening to all that hot air.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill basically talks about two things.  Let me school everyone, the Bill talks about two 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Reverting the definition of Essential National Industries. 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Those are subject to the processes in the Essential National Industries that …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is not! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hang on!  It is my time now, you can have your time later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amount of time that they have for grievances to register grievances was changed from 21 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>2254 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>days to six months.  That is the issue.  Now, Essential National Industries, this is how it is defined in 
<br/>the  very  Bill  that  the  honourable  Attorney-General  has  provided.    Let  me  revert  to  these  notes, 
<br/>probably better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hold on! Hold your horse!  Anything that may endanger life, personal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>safety, health of the whole or part of the population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now in any country in the world, the way we define this will also depend on our context. We 
<br/>do not just take willy-nilly the definitions provided by someone else where you have the interest of 
<br/>your country at heart, you take the Convention, we sign on the Convention but your most important 
<br/>interest is the interest of your country.  So, we define that in the context of our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that particular point in time it was decided to define that in the interest of making sure that 
<br/>the economy of this country kept on improving, while we still look after the interest of all workers in 
<br/>this country and that is what happened, honourable Attorney-General. We do not kowtow to all these 
<br/>people that have power around the world.  We do not do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You know that there are countries in the world that condemn Fiji in 
<br/>Geneva but they themselves have not ratified Convention 87. They have not ratified this and they 
<br/>shout all these accusations at us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the right as a sovereign country of our own. We ratified the Conventions and 87 in 
<br/>its definition allows us some leeway to define it according to our context and that is what we did and 
<br/>what resulted from that? We still look after all of our workers and at the same time our economy 
<br/>expanded.    And  as  our  economy  expanded,  we  are  able  to  invest  in  roads,  welfare,  education, 
<br/>assistance  for  electricity  and  all  of  those  things  benefited  those  very  same  workers  and  provided 
<br/>immediate direct benefits.  Their children were able to go to school without having to pay fares. That 
<br/>is happening because we are expanding the economy. So, it was done in the context of what we have 
<br/>here in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We did not, we allowed, people could still strike, they could go through the processes. The 
<br/>process was slightly changed but they feel their freedom of association was preserved, their freedom 
<br/></span><span>of association to join unions and to take action was still preserved. So, that is very important. We do 
<br/></span><span>not kowtow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was some time ago when the former Prime Minister used to sit here, used to fight for 
<br/>climate change. He would go to these countries and call them the “coalition of the selfish and if they 
<br/>did something about fossil fuel, even though they were very good friends, he would have the guts to 
<br/>tell them, “You are the coalition of the selfish” because he stood by the interest of this country first 
<br/>rather  than  kowtowing  to  anyone  all  over  the  world  in  the  international  arena.  That  is  the  very 
<br/>important thing that we have to remember. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hang on, hang on! Hold your horse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The other part, the best interest of Fiji, I would appeal to the Minister, these things that you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are talking about only affects 30 percent of the workforce of this country.

<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  70  percent  are  not  catered  for.  They  are  not 
<br/>represented. These trade unionists that are running around, who are talking about these things, they 
<br/>do not look after people in the security companies. Most the complaints in these ministries are about 
<br/>workers security companies suffering today.  As we sit here, they suffer. People in the informal sector 
<br/>are exploited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What did you do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was there doing it. That is the interest of today. That is what you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to focus on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you resume your seat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you very much, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker  for  the  opportunity  to  address 
<br/>Parliament in relation to this Bill.  Mr. Speaker, the amendment that we are seeking or the Bill seeks 
<br/>to introduce to the House is a modest adjustment but it comes with a lot of goodwill. It involves a lot 
<br/>of benefits also by what it would attract to our shores simply by the fact that we are going to comply 
<br/>with our ILO obligations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  the  honourable  Leader  of  Opposition  has  been  talking  about  relevance  in  the  world 
<br/>stage.  Honourable  Usamate  had  been  harping  on  this  week  about  punching  above  our  weights  at 
<br/>global  forums.    This  is  an  opportunity,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  Fiji  to  comply  and  become  a  </span><span>bona  fide</span><span>
<br/>compliant  member  of  ILO.  That  is  where  we  punch  above  our  lines.  That  is  where  we  become 
<br/>relevant at the international forums.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  amendment,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  been  discussed  with  stakeholders.  The  honourable 
<br/>Maharaj had spoken about the amendment that they brought in 2015. What he did not inform this 
<br/>Chamber  is  prior  to  that  one  amendment,  there  were  nine  other  amendments  that  were  done,  all 
<br/>without prior consultation.  Go and read the law. Some were done by promulgation, some were done 
<br/>by Decrees and some were done by Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is important about this one, Mr. Speaker, is if you ask the unions, employers association, 
<br/></span><span>workers, Ministry, how many of those amendments, the 10 amendments that have happened to this 
<br/></span><span>law in the past 10 years have they been consulted with?  Zero. The only one that they have said is the 
<br/>one  in  2015.  For  this  one,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  consulted  the  unions,  workers’  representatives, 
<br/>employers and the workers in a forum, Mr. Speaker, that the FijiFirst Government had laid to rest 
<br/>many years ago; the tripartite. That is how we were able to obtain the views of everyone who was 
<br/>concerned about this amendment, their views had been obtained in leading up to the introduction of 
<br/>this  Bill.    In  the  tripartite,  the  very  forum  that  you  buried  together  with  your  attempt  to  supress 
<br/>workers’ rights. Together with that, you lost their good will, you lost their </span><span>bona fide,</span><span> you lost their 
<br/>trust and you lost their votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Coalition Government is doing exactly what it promised it will do. It will 
<br/>revive people’s participation in their government  and through the revival of the tripartite, both in 
<br/>intent  and with  good deeds, we are delivering that  to  the workers of this  nation.  To be fair, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, to workers of the essential services, those who are in the Essential Services Decree, who 
<br/>only have 21 days to register their grievances and also be able to access justice. To be able to be fair 
<br/>with them, this Bill attempts to refine the time period which you can have access to the tribunal and

<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase it to the same period that every other worker of this country has, which is six months. This 
<br/>amendment seeks to do exactly that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Members on the other side, every ones in a while they would 
<br/>have played around with this book, the Constitution of 2013.   Well, Section 20 of the Constitution 
<br/>also has a provision where employers rights are preserved. That, Mr. Speaker, I think they must also 
<br/>think about when they are making Opposition today. This book preserves the rights, the law that they 
<br/>are now opposing is what we are trying to promote that actuates the rights, that gives the nuts and 
<br/>bolts to the rights that people and workers of this country require from us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to address this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please, resume your seat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the Right of Reply to the honourable Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, if you will allow me just to read the ILO submission to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Standing Committee in 2015, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“ILO noted in  its submission  to  the Fiji  Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights in its Report on their Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2015, the 
<br/>office further observes that the ILO supervisory bodies have considered that restrictions or 
<br/>prohibition on the right to strike maybe permitted with respect to public servants exercising 
<br/>authority  in  the  name  of  the  State.  This  would  include  civil  servants  in  Government 
<br/>Ministries but would not be understood to cover a broad range of civil servants such as 
<br/>teachers or those working in public enterprises.  The definition of “essential service” or 
<br/>“industry”  in  Part  19  includes  the  government  and  statutory  authority  which  may  go 
<br/>beyond the above restricted notion of exercising authority in the name of the State.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was made in 2015.  We came on board, they did not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do anything for eight years.  Why now?  Because we have to set up the mechanism first through 
<br/>consultation and come to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today is a very significant day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have given the workers of this country 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the power they lost.  Today, we have given back the power, giving them six months instead of 21 
<br/></span><span>days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- May I highlight a very important thing, this is actually what happens 
<br/>in a workplace.  You are sacked, you are not given your termination letter, when you ask for it, you 
<br/>are not given.  So, come 21 days, expire and the workers have to actually write.  They have to face a 
<br/>lot of difficulties in trying to access these documents from their employers but then the time to appeal 
<br/>has gone out.
