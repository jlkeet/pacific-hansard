<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - 
<br/>FIJI POLICE FORCE 2017-2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that we are all awake, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debate the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Police Force 2017-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2020 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  those  that  may  have  noticed,  there  is  a  year 
<br/>missing in between these two consolidated Reports.  That Report has already been debated here in 
<br/>Parliament, because it came to the Committee in this order.  There are nine recommendations in our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="103">Page 103</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report and I urge the Fiji Police Force to look at those recommendations and read the Report.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are worth looking at and it will certainly help in the conduct of their operations.  When 
<br/>we talk about the Police, I think we should also remember that this is the Force that works on the not 
<br/>so good side of the humanity, but the dark side of humanity.  That is them and that is where they 
<br/>expose themselves to, so that we can live on the better side of humanity.  They need to be resourced 
<br/>well and structured well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just talk a little bit on the first recommendation to look at the merits 
<br/>of setting up one emergency communications and dispatch Unit, like the 911 units that they have 
<br/>overseas. Right now, we have 911, 917, 919 and 913 for EFL.  During one of our meetings with the 
<br/>police present,  I called these numbers.  We called 911, and after the 12</span><span>th</span><span> ring I had to  turn it  off 
<br/>because no one answered.  I called 917, which is the Fiji Police, again, no one answered and after the 
<br/>12</span><span>th</span><span>  ring  we  had  to  turn  it  off.    I  think  it  is  worth  looking  at  setting  up  just  one  emergency 
<br/>communication and dispatch unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon inquiry, if you call 917, which is in Nakasi and someone robbing your home in Nakasi 
<br/>and you are calling 917, the Nakasi Police Station off the road, if  no one answers, that call is diverted 
<br/>to  the  West.    If  someone  answers  it  is  from  the West,  and  then  connected  back  to  Nakasi  Police 
<br/>Station.    I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  may  be  worthwhile  project  to  look  at  is  setting  up  the 
<br/>emergency communication and dispatch unit.  I will leave it at there and may be the other speakers 
<br/>can speak on the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have speakers listed here: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Tuinaceva; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Naivalurua; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  this  debate  on  the 
<br/>Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Police Force.  At the outset, I just want to congratulate the 
<br/>Committee on a great  report.  It  is  well researched, well-articulated, thorough and well presented. 
<br/>Again, I want to thank the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
<br/>and Defence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to make some remarks on Item 6 on Recommendations 3.1.7 Road 
<br/>Fatalities.  Before  I delve further,  I want to take this time to  acknowledge the  Fiji  Police Traffic 
<br/>Division for their hard work, dedication and commitment in trying to control carnage on our roads, 
<br/>despite being under resourced and lack of power to make their road enforcement work more effective. 
<br/>The Report summarises certain areas and the challenges faced by the Police Traffic Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year (2023) so far has not been a good year in terms of road accidents 
<br/>and fatalities, from road safety’s standpoint. We have a road death epidemic on our hands.  When we 
<br/></span><span>record eight deaths in two weeks and a total of 161 accidents in 16 days as reported by the Police, it 
<br/></span><span>tells us we are at  a point of crisis. The Report mentioned that from the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 23</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>August, 2023, there have been 60 road fatalities compared to 23 in the same period last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  latest  report  released  by  Police  last  week  says  our  road  fatalities  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  January  to 
<br/>second week of November 2023, there have been 72 fatalities compared to 38 in the same period last 
<br/>year.  That is an increase of almost 90 percent. On the 72 deaths, 31 were pedestrians, 21 passengers, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="104">Page 104</a></div>
<div><span>2290 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20 were drivers, and that is on fatalities.  For accident cases only from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to October 2023, 
<br/>there have been 3,062 accident cases on our roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for the whole of 2022, there were only 44 road deaths. We can see that our roads 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have turned into a killing field. That is why I said we are at a point of crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir about 80 percent accidents on our roads are caused by overspeeding  and 
<br/>about 70 percent of deaths are caused by overspeeding. To my view, the Fiji Police Traffic Division 
<br/>is trying their utmost best to make our road safe and reduce fatalities.  Now, to effectively police, the 
<br/>stretch of public roads of about 7,000 kilometres that is used by around 140,000 vehicles is a massive 
<br/>task.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 2023 – August 2023 the Police made a total of 30,000 bookings on speed 
<br/>violations as they tried to cut  down on road carnages and  I salute those efforts.  I noted  from the 
<br/>Report that Police has revamped its traffic operations through a joint operations with LTA to conduct 
<br/>stop-checks, radar operations, breathalyser, operations and media awareness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Streamlining operations to achieve optimal result is a great idea but that is not enough. The 
<br/>challenge is for the Police to intensify where road safety were and take it to another level. They will 
<br/>need to well structured, well-resourced and well trained to cope with road safety demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They will need a good relevant and practical Road Safety Action Plan to guide them. Perhaps 
<br/>certain powers currently with LTA to be passed over to Police. It will help them to be more capable 
<br/>and more effectual. Their advantage is they can operate around the clock seven days a week. That is 
<br/>what we need right now on our roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Traffic Police will need to be equipped better. Their devices to be up to 
<br/>date. It is not only about traffic offences it is also about road crimes road crimes.  We have all sorts 
<br/>of  illegal  activities  out  there  on  the  roads.    Let  us  give  Police  more  hand  laser  speed  detected 
<br/>machines. It is time to equip them with more mobiles speed cameras, let us give them some traffic 
<br/>violation cameras, they need to be equipped with average speed camera system and more red light 
<br/>cameras.  I call on the Honourable Minister of Finance to assist our policeman and women, give them 
<br/>money so they can do the job and make our road safe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude road accident is costing our economy big dollars.  For the figure 
<br/>I have got which is not the latest is around $50 million a year.  What is that compared to the loss of 
<br/></span><span>life?  Pain and grieves to the families and victims that will be with them through the rest of their 
<br/></span><span>lives.  Let us spin that million dollars, give it to police and LTA for preventative road safety measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You should have said a long time ago. I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief.  First of all, let me thank 
<br/>the Committee for this very elaborate report and for the recommendations that the Chairman of the 
<br/></span><span>Committee has alluded to earlier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very briefly, I will try to just go through the recommendations and what we are doing to date 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to address these areas of concern that the Committee has highlighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the matter of the emergency number, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure you that the matter 
<br/>has been brought to the National Security Council about a month ago and there is a paper that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="105">Page 105</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2291 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pending before Cabinet.  Essentially, what it is to align all of the emergency numbers into one, it is 
<br/>just one number of us all to remember so I will leave it with that and then we can come out, we will 
<br/>all know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation; Fiji Police be assisted in terms of appropriate adequate facilities 
<br/>for storage and administration of exhibits.  This definitely needs extra resourcing and I know we have 
<br/>been working with Ministry of Finance in the past to try and work at this because without proper 
<br/>protection for exhibits it is very hard to prosecute people successfully.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have toured almost all of our stations in Fiji and this is a big problem.  I want to thank the 
<br/>previous government for the new police stations that we have and they actually do have the kind of 
<br/>space that we need and the kind of protection and security to secure exhibits.  But the current state 
<br/>of the exhibit rooms everywhere for a very long time has been under a lot of neglect and needs money 
<br/>and upgrade.  That is what we pursue to do or we aim to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of body-worn and vehicle mounted cameras.  I have spoken about this earlier 
<br/>during one of my earlier speeches; something that we endeavour and this is also because of two parts.  
<br/>Not only for the safety of the public who are being arrested but also for the sanctity of the work of 
<br/>the police to protect them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, this is part of the things that we would really like to do and in the long term, work 
<br/>of  the  police  this  is  something  that  we  would  like  to  achieve.    Obviously,  we  talked  about  the 
<br/>integration  of  that  into,  for  instance,  the  security  systems  that  are  down  at  Central  Police  Station 
<br/>(CPS).  Ideally, we would like to leave these cameras live onto those things but this is something 
<br/>hopefully we can get in time through proper resourcing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Counselling capacity, I am happy to announce the police do have a Psychology Unit and that 
<br/>was established in 2021 after this Report was done.  Police work is hard, it takes its toll on the family.  
<br/>So, they really need to be helped, carry out their jobs sincerely, mutually and of course professionally.  
<br/>That  unit  is  available  within  the  Fiji  Police  Force  headquarters  right  now  for  the  benefit  of  our 
<br/>policemen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specialist allowance: there are many areas; hard work, uniform, detective  - I wish we had 
<br/>enough money we could give it to them today, unfortunately this is something we need to work at 
<br/>progressively, but I hear the call of the Committee and it is something that we must do and we fully 
<br/>support that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Developing effective studies to reduce the numbers of road fatalities, I thanked Mr. Naisa 
<br/>Tuinaceva, ultimately, I think many people forget in Fiji the responsibility of our roads is not with 
<br/>the Police, it is with the Land Transport Authority.  The Police exercise only the Land Transport 
<br/>Authority Act. The Police whilst they carry out needs resourcing, I recognise especially equipment 
<br/>and even roles to help them but obviously this is something we need to factor into Police resourcing 
<br/>into the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, animal cruelty something we take for granted absolutely true, we see a lot of 
<br/></span><span>stray dogs.  People just go and kick them but this is not so much about the Police, this is just about 
<br/></span><span>society. These are creations of God we should look after them.  There are proper places where you 
<br/>need to take them to if they need to be disposed of definitely, I agree with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dealing with hate crimes, this is something that we can all do together.  The police do not 
<br/>have so much capacity to be able to do this. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that, but it is something we 
<br/>need to work at as a community; do not hate, no good for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2292 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community policing at the centre of our work and this is something that under the “Restore 
<br/>Blue” is something that we will bring to the centre, better to prevent than to cure.  Sorry, I took up 
<br/>too much time, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister’s responses to 
<br/>the recommendations.  There is really not much to say and I am very positive and very supportive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But as a general comment when we examine these reports and if you fast track it forward for 
<br/>the next ten years, you will find that the Police Force will continue to face challenges at a strategic 
<br/>level, at the operational level and also at the technical level. This was confirmed in the recent visit 
<br/>by the Committee, that some of the issues can be resolved internally without much cost there. For 
<br/>example, Complaints Against the Police (CAP) and Complaints Against the Services (CAS) do not 
<br/>really need any technology, all it needs is good management, leadership and consistency at the sharp 
<br/>end of things. When people come and report and there is no feedback or responses, this is where the 
<br/>complainants come in.  That can easily be resolved internally without any cost at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Small things like the Water Police, honourable Minister Mr. Speaker, Sir, things like the foul 
<br/>weather kit that we visited. These are things that are essential equipment for those that work out there 
<br/>and it is very important that that can be resolved internally, does not need a big budget, all it needs 
<br/>is it needs to be resolved by the Operation Commanders on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fast forwarding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Police is an organisation that cannot really be involved 
<br/>in the catch-up game. There is a change in security situation and similarly evolving criminal situations 
<br/>and they need to be on top of these. In my personal assessment really the situation is up here and the 
<br/>Police Force is really down here. The simple strategy is to take them up here and beyond the real 
<br/>time situation at this point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just simply finish by responding to a leadership comment by the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister this evening. On that note, leadership is also a very important part in any organisation 
<br/>to the Police Force I see there is investment into that because as we all know everything rises and 
<br/>falls on leadership. A response to  the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister.   Yes, you said  that  the 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition pleaded for the honourable Prime Minister to change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In leadership, the leader makes a decision based on the advisors of his inner core or those that 
<br/>have  sit  around  and  provide  those  advice  and  he  makes  those  calls.  Yesterday  history  was  made 
<br/>where our leader the honourable Prime Minister turn to an alternative advice and that advice was 
<br/></span><span>from this end of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He provided that and he made his decision based on the alternative advice. The decision was 
<br/>made by the honourable Prime Minister on the national interest and in his primary core mission is to 
<br/>serve the best interests of the nation. So my call this afternoon there is always an alternative advice 
<br/>available at this end of the House to you honourable Prime Minister onto the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  J.R.VOCEA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wish  to  make  a  small  contribution.    As  you 
<br/>know,  I  am  also  part  of  the  Committee  that  was  scrutinising  this  Report,  and  we  had  some  very 
<br/></span><span>extensive consultations with all the necessary stakeholders. It was a bipartisan approach, we did away 
<br/></span><span>with  politics,  and  we  committed  ourselves  to  the  call  of  this  Parliament  to  try  and  improve  the 
<br/>condition of our people in the Fiji Police Force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why we made a lot of consultations, we went around the country, we reached Taveuni, 
<br/>and judging by the Report and what they are facing on the ground, it is not only for us sitting here 
<br/>and looking at the Report. We made sure we went around and spoke to responsible officers, officers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="107">Page 107</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2293 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the field to get a feeling of what they were facing in terms of the duties that are being assigned to 
<br/>them to undertake for our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, it was a bipartisan approach, no politics in that. We had a lot of issues that we 
<br/>raised  with  the  stakeholders,  we  did  some  consultations,  some  face  to  face,  and  from  the  nine 
<br/>recommendations we made sure that it is not only for Parliament to note, we had made a commitment 
<br/>that  we  will  try  and  revisit  these  recommendations  and  try  to  talk  to  respective  Ministries  and 
<br/>stakeholders and ask them to include in their submission for next year’s financial budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We even visited the Border Security in Nadi, and we found that they were congested in one 
<br/>of the small rooms. They are the first image that tourists see when coming to Fiji, and I hope that, 
<br/>perhaps, the Minister and those responsible will try and improve the working conditions of those in 
<br/>Border Security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, it is not only for Parliament to note the Report, we have made a commitment 
<br/>through our Chair, that we will try and re-visit all the recommendations and make sure we talk to the 
<br/>relevant Ministries and stakeholders, so that we will be able to improve the working conditions that 
<br/>are faced by our people out there, especially the Fiji Police Force.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my small recommendation, we had nine recommendations, but I think that most of 
<br/>the speakers who have spoken before me have talked on all the nine recommendations. I am just 
<br/>talking generally on the outcome of our visitation and looking at the Report and what we intend to 
<br/>do after submitting this Report to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is all that I wish to contribute, and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are beginning to sound like your neighbour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just thank the Fiji Police Force for the work 
<br/>that  they  do  and  their  family  that  support  them  and  I  wish  them  well.    I  commend  the  Report  to 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, Sir, for noting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think by listening to all that we have heard from the various speakers, it 
<br/></span><span>seems that what we have been slowly discussing as well as from the Report that was provided to us 
<br/></span><span>by  the  Australian  Federal  Members  of  Parliament  on  the  role  of  Parliament  and  make  it  more 
<br/>interesting.  I think we are really far behind in how we do our work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been just concentrating like we have been doing for the whole of this week, working 
<br/>on  Annual  Reports,  Reports  that  have  been  late,  so  late  and  can  we  go  beyond  what  has  been 
<br/>identified from the Annual Reports.  By going into policy issues then we will have to discuss that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="108">Page 108</a></div>
<div><span>2294 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with  the  Government  of  the  day  because  that  is  what  the  Committees  are  doing  in  Australia  and 
<br/>elsewhere, even in the UK.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Make it more interesting as offered by honourable Naivalurua and now honourable Vocea. 
<br/>They want to go beyond just submitting the Reports.  No, they want to continue to see that more is 
<br/>done out of what they have come up with in the Reports that they have worked so hard to produce 
<br/>back  into  Parliament.  So,  we  can  take  another  few  10  steps  further  from  just  reviewing  Annual 
<br/>Reports but that depends on the Government of the day and depends on you honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How we can further discuss it and come to an agreement as to how best we can make the role 
<br/>of Members of Parliament more lively especially for us in helping the Government of the day carry 
<br/>out its work as well.  That is something that we are working on but I am just happy to throw this 
<br/>across again because I have noticed that we are already doing it, we are doing it in parts now. It is 
<br/>slowly coming out but it just a matter of organising things and putting it  together and having the 
<br/>Government to agree to it.
