<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON THE MONITORING OF 
<br/></span><span>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUGARCANE DEVELOPMENT AND  
<br/></span><span>FARMERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Performance Audit on the Monitoring of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance  Programme which 
<br/>was tabled on 14</span><span>th</span><span>  September, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Public  Accounts,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  speak  on  the  motion  to  debate  the  Review  of  the 
<br/>Performance  Audit  on  the  Monitoring  of  the  Implementation  of  the  Sugarcane  Development  and 
<br/>Farmers Assistance which was tabled in Parliament on 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know the background and the objective of the grant which is, that the 
<br/>Government  through  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  should  provide  annual  budgets  to  various  grant 
<br/>programmes to support its objective of a sustainable sugar industry.  Additionally, the Government 
<br/></span><span>has  supported  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  and  farmers  in  an  effort  to  raise  cane  productions  to  three 
<br/></span><span>million tonnes each year, supposedly from 2023 as per planned back in 2011.  We commend the audit 
<br/>work  carried  out  by  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  in  examining  whether  the  sugarcane 
<br/>development and farm assistance grant that was distributed to farmers for the financial years 2016 
<br/>and  2019  was  effectively  and  efficiently  administered,  and  if  the  objectives  of  the  grant  were 
<br/>achieved.  It was a timely audit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted and agreed with the findings during the implementation of the grant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the year 2016 to 2019 on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Grant  policy  and  management  framework.    What  we  found  was,  there  was  no  formal 
<br/>written framework during the audit and the Ministry was in the drafting process when the 
<br/>audit was carried out, and under completion when we carried out a deliberation with the 
<br/>Ministry.  I will borrow my friends, honourable Usamate’s favourite word, “flabbergasted”.  
<br/>The Committee was flabbergasted with this.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- As the Ministry of Sugar, with the honourable Minister and the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary and the debtors  were in place for a number of years from 2011.  What happened 
<br/>to all those grants that were paid from 2011 to 2015?  How were they paid without a framework?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The administration of the grant. Again, flabbergasted. Accountability and transparency in 
<br/>grant management was generally weak; grant allotment lacked transparent system; grant 
<br/>agreements, payment vouchers were found missing in some cases; conflict of interest not 
<br/>being declared by FSC for the use of grants for farms; help in joint ventures; farmers did 
<br/>not always receive the grants on time and there were some elements of fraud, which were 
<br/>referred to FICAC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The monitoring of grants, again, flabbergasted.  Not performed to the requirements in the 
<br/>annual log plan at farm level, absence of proper system; and checks were not performed by 
<br/>the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Reporting and evaluation, the programmes were yet to be evaluated and reported against 
<br/></span><span>the objective and the audit was carried out.  So, all in all, it was a failure by the Ministry of 
<br/>Sugar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  You  are  resuming  your  seat  very  reluctantly  because  you  went  down 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>slowly, very slowly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now offer the floor to the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Hem Chand; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Maharaj; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Professor Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on 
<br/>this very important Report.  At the outset, I would like to thank the colleague Members of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Public Accounts for the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir I have read the recommendations of the 
<br/></span><span>Committee and I hope the relevant stakeholders will take steps to implement it accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noted in the Report that sugarcane farmers need support from the Government, from FSC, 
<br/>Sugar Research Institute and other stakeholders to maximise harvest. The Farmers are faced with a lot of 
<br/>issues and challenges, and I am going to highlight three: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Crop Protection - Crop Protection plays a vital role towards growth of sugarcane plants. It is 
<br/>important to protect the cane plants  from the very  beginning to be  able to  maximise the 
<br/>harvest. These will benefit both the farmers and the Sugar Industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cane farmers in Saweni, Dreketi, Verebatia, Lawaki and other nearby 
<br/>areas in Lautoka are currently facing huge problems, where cattle are damaging cane, and 
<br/>this has become a big issue to farmers. The matter was brought to the attention of FSC by 
<br/>concerned farmers this year in August and to date the matter remains unresolved.  The Senior 
<br/>staff of FSC are also aware of the issue but nothing has been done and I feel very sorry for 
<br/>the cane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="110">Page 110</a></div>
<div><span>2296 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The second issue is High Cost of Living: The increase in VAT, corporate tax, increase in fuel 
<br/>prices is taking its toll on cane farmers. On top of this the farmers have to pay more for 
<br/>manual harvesting this year, compared to last year. Transportation  cost, Tractor chargers, 
<br/>transportation of cane cutters, food cost of cane cutters have skyrocketed. The high cost of 
<br/>living to the increase in VAT, corporate tax and increase in fuel price is leaving the poor 
<br/>farmers with absolutely nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cane farmers are struggling to make ends meet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, keeping in mind the 
<br/>high cost of harvesting, cane cutting, high cost of living, the Government should consider a 
<br/>guaranteed price that can assist farmers to mitigate all this cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been just reliably informed from some cane farmers in Ba, that cane is 
<br/>still left to be harvested and Rarawai Mill has already closed and Lautoka Mill is due to close soon. This 
<br/>will leave a lot of cane unharvested, it will be lost for farmers and also for the sugar industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Reopen the Mill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I have highlighted some critical issues faced by farmers and I am sure the 
<br/>relevant Ministry will look into this urgently. Mr. Speaker Sir, I commend the Committee’s report, and I 
<br/>support the motion before the house. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, in fact the sugar has become more sweeter ever since I become 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- And it became more sweeter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  And  it  became  more  sweeter  when  the  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>announced $5 price up for the sugarcane. So when you go to towns and cities now, you can see the smiles 
<br/>on the farmers faces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is it part of the Report?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Sorry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Where’s the report, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I will, I am coming there. This is the preamble, anyways, Mr. Speaker, what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has happened is ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="111">Page 111</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- </span><span>Dabe ga era.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What has happened Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Kamikamica would agree, that look what I am saying, sometimes I wonder why are we are going and 
<br/>referring to reports which three years old, four years old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- So what. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. C.J. SINGH.- Come on, Just listen!   What I am saying is, I have issues here, the Report 
<br/>of 2016 to 2019, we are three years behind. I actually wanted to see a Report that would be of 2021 
<br/>because then I can correct what the industry has gone through. And I urge …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You want to see our performance review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- ... I urge that in future all the pending reports should be consolidated so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we can move forward on the present.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- In any business and Government is a business, if we are looking at a five 
<br/>year old report, we do not know what has happened. Here any private company for that matter we 
<br/>will monitor their accounts every quarterly so they can see where they are going. I am saying is one 
<br/>of the things that gives me a bit of confusion why these previous reports are being withheld.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Sugar  Industry  as  I  said,  is  here  to  stay  and  one  of  the 
<br/>businessmen lately met me during the Bred bank function (he was a Labasa businessman) and he 
<br/>said let us close the sugar industry and that person only because of sugar industry has thrived. Now 
<br/>we cannot close the sugar industry, the sugar industry is here to stay. That is why this Government 
<br/>has given 13 different programmes under the budget. There is $50 million worth of incentives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, what we are trying, Mr. Speaker, to see how we can diversify the sugar industry and 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, look man you have not done that, let me do it, let me do it. You guys have 
<br/>failed, you guys have failed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- So 16 years, we are here for the last 10 months only. You are from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labasa, what have you done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laugher) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- When we are trying to do something help us out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when he talks about bulldozer … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- When he talks about bulldozer he does not know what I meant. Here the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmers are putting wrong varieties of cane on the farm. So what?  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH- You do not know about farming. You know about it? I am are farmer, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am are farmer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here look we have to, we have to 
<br/>look after the farms, we have to look after the farmers, we have to look out for the owners farmers 
<br/>right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- You are still not a real farmer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Who said what?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Oh sorry. Mr. Speaker, I know that I made a lot of laughter in Parliament, 
<br/>but this is my last meeting with you and I hope to see you next year and we will talk more. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister for Sugarcane  and Multi-
<br/>Ethnic Affairs:  my first question would be and this is what we actually noticed during the meetings 
<br/>by the Committee actually  met with  the Ministry and when they came to  do the submission,  this 
<br/>particular Ministry has a Budget of $51 million out of which $2 million is for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, 
<br/>$1 million under R, $1 million for Operations, left is around $49 million out of which $47.5 million 
<br/>goes to FSC as grant left with $1.5 million one of the smallest Ministry but yet this particular Ministry 
<br/>has two Permanent Secretaries …   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Oh! My God. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Did  PS  make  any  analysis  and  surprising,  Mr.  Speaker,  that 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for special project.  All the money has gone to FSC. What the PS is doing in 
<br/>the Ministry? Wastage of money, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. C.J. Singh interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- This honourable Minister cannot even talk on the Report. I am not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sure what he is going to do to the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At first, Mr. Speaker, I thought he is from Labasa, he might be the saviour for the sugarcane 
<br/>industry but I tell you, Sir, what he had, the type of response from a Minister on a particular report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, he also spoke about price increase. Let me tell you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some financial mismanagement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First payment $40.15, second payment $13.38; then this Government came into the picture. 
<br/>The honourable Minister wanted to be all Hi5 gave $24.62.  Balance was left for only $7.11. The 
<br/>total came to $85.26. We surpassed before the wash down payment come through. Then he went 
<br/>begging to the honourable Minister of Finance, “Please, we have extra paid $26 for Diwali, what will 
<br/>the people say?  We need to give them something.” 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You are misleading. I never beg the Prime Minister, understand? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  after  realising  there  is  nothing  left  in  the  Balance 
<br/>Sheet they had to get the money from where from the taxpayers $8.5 million of the taxpayers’ money 
<br/>gone wasted. Had they actually done a better financial management throughout the year this would 
<br/>not have happened, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Just because they wanted to be in the good books they gave $24 
<br/>which  was  much  more  higher  than  the  forecasted  value  back  in  March.    If  these  kinds  of  things 
<br/>continue how much money we are going to lose through this Minister, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Minister  was  supposed  to  be  the  saviour  from  Labasa.  You  will  spoil  our  name, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, we know that the sugarcane industry is suffering. We 
<br/>need to come up with the alternate crop. We have actually informed people on the other side. We 
<br/>need alternate crops. We have been doing some research. There was $1 million allocated to do the 
<br/>research for industrial hem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister has jumped the gun from industrial hem he has actually 
<br/>gone on to the medicinal hem, please come back to the industrial hem, we will have a lot of overseas 
<br/>repatriation if you go to medicinal hem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us come back to industrial hem. Let us provide alternate crops. More than 60 percent of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the farmers who are actually cultivating less than 150 tonnes. Sit down yar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- A Point of Order. You sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  He  is  behaving  like  this  with  the  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament. Imagine what his attitude would be towards the farmers, Honourable Speaker.  Thank 
<br/>you, Honourable Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Reserve Bank of Fiji just revised the growth forecast from 
<br/>8.2 percent and that is good news. It shows that the economy is forging ahead.  What it does show 
<br/>however is that the resource sectors are going to be a drag on the economy if these sectors do not 
<br/>perform and they include sugar, mineral, water, gold, forestry and to some extent, fisheries sectors 
<br/>as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tourism numbers is  going  to  be  about  4 percent  higher than  even 2019 let alone pre-
<br/>COVID-19 and perhaps surpass 2018 as well depending on what happens between now and the end 
<br/>of  December.    What  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  and  Chairman  of  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee  pointed  out  very  clearly  and  the  figures  showed  in  a  very  contrasting  way.    The 
<br/>performance of the Sugar Industry in the last 15 years, if you look at these two graphs just from the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="114">Page 114</a></div>
<div><span>2300 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the  
<br/>Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report itself, area versus cane production, you will find that cane production has declined in a much 
<br/>more rapid rate than the area under cane production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, if you look at the registered versus active growers where the decline also has been 
<br/>rapid. The audit report shows and it is the honourable Assistant Minister and the chairman of the 
<br/>Public Account Committee highlighted it very well and all the issues (nine or ten) basically points 
<br/>out that all these money that was being put into the Sugar Industry over the years at least from 2016 
<br/>to 2019, if what the audit assessment says, then really Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a sad indictment of the 
<br/>leadership at all levels within the industry in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think what we need to do obviously, at the end of the day the Sugar Industry without the 
<br/>farmers is not going to get anywhere.  I think our focus and the honourable Minister Singh in the last 
<br/>eight  to  nine  months  has  been  focusing  on  that.    I  was  actually  quite  disappointed  with  the 
<br/>contributions from the other side; both honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  are  complaining  about  the  number  of  resources  that  the  Government  has  put  in  and 
<br/>particularly, the top up cane price. Honourable Hem Chand was talking about the escalating costs, 
<br/>but  he  refused  to  even  acknowledge  the  fact  in  an  honest  way  that  the  Government  has  tried  to 
<br/>mitigate that by topping up the price.  We have provided a number of programmes within the budget 
<br/>to support the farmers.  I think we have to be honest if the economy is to remain at a sustainable path 
<br/>of growth.  In 2024 – 2025, we will have to focus in the resource sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad that as a government, we have realised that in the long term, if you look at countries 
<br/>at Costa Rica you look at countries where tourism is also about 40 percent to 50 percent of GDP, one 
<br/>of the key components there apart from some of the other industries such as BPOs or services sectors, 
<br/>the agriculture sector in this country has a huge potential and our Government is going to focus on 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In  fact,  the  National  Economic  Summit  identified  a  number  of  areas  and  as  part  of  the 
<br/>planning within the Ministry of Finance, we want to push that and make sure that the appropriate 
<br/>policies, interventions, monitoring and evaluation are carried in a timely manner so that there is no 
<br/>wastage, yet there is an increase in production and we can increase the contribution of the resource 
<br/>sectors to GDP.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accounts to speak in Reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we left the best to the last.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have heard all the comments from honourable Members who have contributed to this 
<br/>motion and the responsible Minister from  the Ministry of Sugar and we plead with  them and the 
<br/>relevant stakeholder in the Sugar Industry, should take note of all the recommendations and work 
<br/>together in addressing all the challenges and gaps identified and revitalise the Sugar Industry so that 
<br/>resources poured into this industry are not mismanaged or wasted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As stated by the Minister and as recommended we need another updated report or audit.  At 
<br/>this  point,  I  can  say  that  things  have  improved,  and  we  should  support  continuously  the  Sugar 
<br/>Industry.  With those final comments, Sir, I thank you.
