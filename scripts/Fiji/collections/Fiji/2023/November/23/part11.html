<h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3>
<div><span>POINT OF ORDER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unparliamentary Language – Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I rise again on a Point of Order?  I refer to 
<br/>Standing Order 74(1) and Standing Order 45(4)(b)(c) because you were going to make your ruling 
<br/>on the Point of Order that I had raised yesterday.  I kindly request your high office to also make a 
<br/>ruling on the Point of Order that I raised on the sitting on 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you would recall, there was an End of Week Statement by the honourable Rinesh Sharma 
<br/>on the increase of National Minimum Wage and I objected to the statement made by the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and 
<br/>Statistics in his response to the End of Week Statement. This is what the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister stated, Sir, and I quote from Page 1927 of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> of Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 
<br/>2023: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Mr. Speaker,  they looted the workers by  forcing them to  use their FNPF funds 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during the pandemic.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in yesterday's deliberation, the honourable Member, again, used these words 
<br/>against this side of Parliament. What is the reason behind it? I really do not know whether we can 
<br/>look at Standing Order 45(4)(b)(c) but, again, I did raise my concern if it could be registered and I 
<br/>requested a ruling from you, Sir.  I hope that this will be provided tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have given him the opportunity to respond.  Again, let me say that in 
<br/>his reply, he stated, and I quote: “They looted the workers by forcing them to use their FNPF funds 
<br/>during the pandemic”, but his response was totally different when you gave him the opportunity and 
<br/>this is what he said, and I quote from Page 1935 of the Daily Hansard of Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 
<br/>2023:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“All I said, Mr. Speaker, was in reference to the FNPF Pension Act, that is a fact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was a Government that made the decision - the Bainimarama Government.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He then continued: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Yes, I used the word “looted”.  It was the Bainimarama Government that passed 
<br/></span><span>the Decree and terminated the FNPF workers’ contracts and they lost pension and they 
<br/></span><span>had no recourse to go back to the court because there was another decree which did not 
<br/>even allow that.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of the word, “looted”, again, is very offensive and I hope and plead 
<br/>with  you  that  the  honourable  Member  needs  to  be  reminded,  he  needs  to  be  warned,  that  it  is 
<br/>unparliamentary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  my  Point  of  Order  and  I  hope  that  your  ruling  on  it  can  also  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>included in tomorrow’s ruling.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think it is a bit late at this stage that this Point of 
<br/>Order issue is being raised.  We are now on Agenda Item 4.  During the Confirmation of Minutes, 
<br/>issues such as this or any other you feel ought to be addressed so as not be included or excluded from 
<br/>the Confirmation of the Minutes, that is the time when you raise it. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2191 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was in Opposition, we usually look at it before the Confirmation of Minutes, that is 
<br/>when  we  rise  on  a  Point  of  Order  and  say,  “look  before  the  Minutes  is  confirmed,  this  is  what 
<br/>transpired and we would like to flag for you, Sir, a Point of Order.”  We have been doing it for quite 
<br/>a long time from the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  this  particular  case,  I  cannot  make  it  as  an  exception  because  it  has  gone  past  the 
<br/>Confirmation of Minutes stage and we are right into Agenda Item 4, but we will take note of what 
<br/>you have highlighted, honourable Leader of the Opposition in the hope for the issue of fairness, that 
<br/>we are able to drum up some search.  The Secretariat will require time to look at this. I cannot be 
<br/>including this in tomorrow’s outcome of what I stated yesterday because of the outstanding Point of 
<br/>Orders that were both raised by honourable Sachida Nand and honourable Professor Biman Prasad 
<br/>and  yesterday,  again,  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  as  against  the  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister Professor Biman Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  for  this  particular  one,  we  will  take  note  of  it,  but  maybe  we  need  to  be  given  time, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition so that we can check all that is required to be checked so we 
<br/>can come up with a position to advise whether this is what you have asked and this is the outcome of 
<br/>the  search  that  we  have  undertaken  and  this  is  the  ruling  from  the  Speaker’s  Chair.    I  hope  you 
<br/>understand our situation as well, honourable Leader of the Opposition. We will take note and we will 
<br/>move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, there will be three Committee Reports for tabling this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
