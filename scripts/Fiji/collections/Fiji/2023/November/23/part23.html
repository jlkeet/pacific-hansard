<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Ba Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  in  1905  the  Ba  Rural  Local  Authority  was 
<br/>established under the Public Health Ordinance to administer the District of Ba on various matters.  
<br/>The urbanised area of Varoka was proclaimed a township under the Township Ordinance in 1939.  
<br/>The Local Government Act was enacted in 1972, Ba was then alleviated to town status in June 1972.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Committee  acknowledged  the  commitment  of  Ba  Town  Council  in  the 
<br/>upkeep of urban sanitary and the continuity of rezoning in the district. This contributed positively in 
<br/>the District of Ba for the year 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee also commends the work carried out by the Council and would 
<br/>like to recommend that it continues to promote community engagement in order to achieve a healthy 
<br/>and a clean environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I have a list 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of speakers in front of me: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament and Minister for Public Works, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meteorological Services and Transport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be my shortest contribution. As you all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know, Ba is basically a soccer crazy town, and last month we won the IDC 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got two issues, one is the flooding, in Ba and I urge my good 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>friend, Minister for Waterways, can you look up, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- He is your friend? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do for 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- PM, change him! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We did many other things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Minister for Waterways to look 
<br/>into it.  In past years, Ba River was dredged and the people of Ba were safe from the floods. So, that 
<br/>is what we did, honourable Kamikamica.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that I want to inform Parliament, that, a few weeks ago, there was a statement 
<br/>made that the grounds at Govind Park and the boundary fence was included (because that is in the 
<br/>Report) in the original contract, but I want to clarify that,  that was in Phase 2 and it was not included 
<br/>in the original contract. So, with that clarification, I support the motion that is before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before this 
<br/>august  Parliament  this  evening.  First,  I  would  like  to  thank  honourable  Bala  for  supporting  the 
<br/>motion.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I share some insights into the recommendations put forward by the 
<br/>Committee, first  I would like to  thank the Special  Administrator, CEO and the staff of Ba Town 
<br/>Council for diligently serving the people of Ba Town. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Ba Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2287 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were four recommendations put forward by the Committee and these 
<br/>are  very  vital  and  also  important  for  the  development  of  Ba  Town.  One  which  is  common  in  all 
<br/>Councils  is  the  untimely  preparation  of  annual  accounts  and  some  from  the  Ministry  have  been 
<br/>working with other municipal councils to address issues, and we also attach this with KPIs so that 
<br/>they will be able to produce annual accounts on time. That is something that the Ministry is working 
<br/>on right now with all municipal councils in Fiji including, Ba Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next one is the issue of flooding in Ba. I know in one of my recent visit to Ba, I think I have 
<br/>done two visits already, something that has been raised, not only by the Council’s CEO, as well as 
<br/>employees, and even by the residents of Ba. Something that we are working on right now is to work 
<br/>on the Elevuka Creek which, according to the people of Ba, is something that contributes significantly 
<br/>to the flooding of Ba Town, as well as the dredging of the Ba River.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is something that we are working closely with the Ministry of Waterways, to ensure that 
<br/>this is done and also to assist the people of Ba Town. Another very important issue raised by the 
<br/>Committee is on the completion of Govind Park. It is something that needs to be completed  right 
<br/>now because the people of Ba, even though they won the IDC, they are not enjoying watching their 
<br/>own team play on their home ground.  That is something they are trying to do this year, so hopefully 
<br/>with the appointment of a lead consultants working on Phase 2 of the project, we should be able to 
<br/>complete and to ensure that the people of Ba enjoy watching their own players playing in Govind 
<br/>Park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some issues too with Govind Park, something, that we are also looking into right 
<br/>now. Hopefully, the Ministry will address to ensure that if you have a project, you must make the 
<br/>project is done in a timely manner, as well as done to standard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two very important issues on the satellite towns.  The two satellite towns were not really 
<br/>because one is on a road reserve and the other is on open space.  What the Council is doing now is 
<br/>to liaise with the relevant agencies to formalise the rezoning of the two lots where the satellite towns, 
<br/>according to Committee has to complete or put up a satellite town in Ba.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry have given its assurance that it is going to assist Ba Town Council in completing 
<br/>some of the projects  and one is  Govind Park. Honourable Bala  will also  be happy, hopefully the 
<br/>people of Ba will be able to watch their players playing at the Govind Park in Ba.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I thank you for the opportunity and I fully support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  on  the 
<br/></span><span>Report on the Ba Town Council.  Their key findings include as mentioned on the flooding and that 
<br/>has been mentioned by few honourable Members and the need for us to look into mitigation measures 
<br/>not only for the Ministry of Waterways but of course, Ministry of Public Works too moving forward, 
<br/>we do recognise that not only for Ba but also for Nadi.  There were issues raised regarding the delays 
<br/>in obtaining development approvals.  Noted the satellite markets in Varadoli and Namosau Wards 
<br/>which intends to ease traffic which is an ongoing issue not only for the Council but also with FRA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note the improvement in rate arrears collection of $1.94 million to $3.074 million in 2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  we  do  acknowledge  the  Council’s  enhanced  payment  plans.    These  key  findings  present  the    
<br/></span><span>Coalition  Government  with  the  need  to  build  up  on  the  recommendations  moving  forward  as 
<br/>mentioned by the honourable Minister and, of course, I was very surprised that honourable Bala has 
<br/>taken the issue about Govind Park very lightly when there have been issues with the construction of 
<br/>the first phase, especially noting some of the defects which the Coalition Government has now taken 
<br/>on board to address and moving forward.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note that he commissioned that in  2018 and after that there was a long  delay before the 
<br/>commencement of phase two. That  sort deprived the young people of Ba in  terms  of their sports 
<br/>facilities. So, when the young people were deprived, I was wondering where honourable Ketan Lal 
<br/>was?  He did not say anything regarding that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Neither honourable Ritesh Sharma, even though the Ba Rugby 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Union is now being promoted to Skipper Cup we are still depriving them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Go, go, go! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So under the Coalition Government we will ensure that that 
<br/>ground comes into operation very soon. I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and  Minister  of  Finance  for  fast-forwarding  that  and  also  personally  visiting  them.  It  is  very 
<br/>surprising that a Member of Parliament from Labasa comes to solve the problem in Ba … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- … while the honourable Member of Parliament from Ba is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  We  will  be  working  on  that  and  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>Council.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  honourable  Bala  too  for  his  contribution  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>development of that and moving forward. I support the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would again like to thank all honourable 
<br/>Members that commented and contributed to the motion before Parliament, and your comments are 
<br/>highly noted by the Committee.  I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed.
