<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - TAVUA TOWN COUNCIL 2015 ANNUAL REPORT   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That  Parliament  debates  the  review  of  Tavua  Town  Council  2015  Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report for the year ending 2015 which was tabled on the 12</span><span>th</span><span> of September 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Tavua  was  formally  incorporated  as  a 
<br/>Town in 1992.  Tavua Town covers a land area of 102 square kilometres.  Apart from the agricultural 
<br/>sector contributing to the economy of Tavua Town, the Gold Mine and the mineral water factories 
<br/>continue to develop to sustainably provide for the Town and its people through employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, Tavua Town Council assisted stakeholders in achieving its ultimate objectives by 
<br/>recognising  its  contribution  to  socio-economic  development,  which  uplifts  the  standard  of  Tavua 
<br/>Town.  For instance, the Council assisted the Ministry of Agriculture in organising the Agriculture 
<br/>Show in Tavua.  This was the first of its kind and it was an advantage for the people of Tavua to 
<br/>witness activities and programmes piloted by the Ministry of Agriculture; and the establishment of 
<br/>the Ex-Offenders Association and the engagement of offenders in the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua Town was awarded the Clean Small Town Designation in 2015 and this can be seen 
<br/>as a boost and recognition to Tavua as a Town; Interagency meeting on Child Abuse, Neglect and 
<br/>Abandonment with Government officials; and Tavua Town Council also organised its first ever New 
<br/>Year Street Party in 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends the work carried out by the Council and would 
<br/>like  to  recommend  that  it  continues  to  promote  community  engagement  to  achieve  a  healthy 
<br/>environment and efficient infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee compiled through its deliberation on the review of Tavua Town Council 2015 
<br/>Annual  Report  and  found  that  a  loss  of  $5,142  was  incurred  in  2015,  and  from  2010  to  2015,  it 
<br/>resulted in the accumulative loss of $1.1 million; funding constraints faced by the Council to carry 
<br/>out  programmes  and  initiatives  to  improve  infrastructure  in  Tavua  and  there  was  a  shortage  of 
<br/>technical expertise in the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also noted that Tavua Town Council has asked the well-established municipal councils that 
<br/></span><span>were  well  resourced,  that  they  should  share  their  qualified  personnel  to  assist  in  their  operations 
<br/>which in turn will enhance the service delivery of the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have the list of speakers: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Viam Pillay; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister Nalumisa; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Premila Kumar; and  
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister- Esrom Immanuel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I stand before Parliament today to give a few remarks 
<br/>on the review conducted by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Tavua Town Council 
<br/>2015 Annual Report.  This Report serves not only as an account of the Council’s activities, but as a 
<br/>valuable guide posed for the future development  and progress  of Tavua Town Council.  The key 
<br/>findings outlined in the Report should be viewed not merely as challenges, but as opportunities for

<div><span>Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2283 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategic intervention and improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee’s recommendations are constructive and forward looking, 
<br/>emphasising  the  timely  submission  of  annual  reports,  collaboration  with  various  stakeholders  for 
<br/>economic development, prioritising the development of the dumping site and encouraging the sharing 
<br/>of qualified personnel amongst municipals, are steps in the right direction.  The call for collaboration 
<br/>with well-established municipal councils highlights the spirit of solidarity and mentorship that should 
<br/>underpin the relationship between municipalities fostering a collective effort for the greater good.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr, Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  before  this  august  Parliament  to  address 
<br/>pressing matters raised by Standing Committee on Social Affairs concerning the Review of Tavua Town 
<br/>Council Annual Report 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairperson  and  honourable  Members  for 
<br/>reviewing these reports.  I also would like to thank the Special Administrators, the CEO and the staff of 
<br/>the Tavua Town Council for meticulously serving the people of Tavua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation by the Committee are very critical and for me justifies the 
<br/>need to have a Local Government Election, once Local Government Election be able to get in, responsible 
<br/>Councillors would be able to assist the Council as well as the Ministry in addressing some of the very 
<br/>pertinent issues that are being raised  here such things like submission of Annual Reports as well as the 
<br/>need to have more collaboration with NGOs, Civil Society because the size of Tavua Town, it does not 
<br/>have  the  financial  means  to  sustain  itself.    It  is  particularly  important  that  we  involve  some  of  the 
<br/>stakeholders and even some of the societies and donor partners to assist the Council in carrying some of 
<br/>its very important services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a good example raised by the Committee is the need for the Council to look for 
<br/>a dump site. The Council has already identified one, but issue here is that they do not have the financial 
<br/>means to develop the dump site. That is why there is a need to get in good people, to be the Council, be 
<br/>able to get in good ideas, new ideas as well as the business acumen as well as build relationships with 
<br/>other donor partners as well as other organizations in assisting the people of Tavua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think these are very important issues to the Ministry 
<br/>and is working with the CEOs as well as the staff of Tavua Town Council to ensure especially a financial 
<br/></span><span>accounts, just to add on the importance of getting Annual Accounts rate but this year, the Office of the 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General has diligently audited 2017-2019 Financial Statements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council has submitted 2020 Financial Statements for auditing with ongoing efforts to finalise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 2021-2022 Financial Statements. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua is a very small town with only 287 ratepayers 
<br/>while the Tavua District population stands at 23,000. Often on the back of a small number of ratepayers 
<br/>the Town Council is expected to provide services to all citizens residing in the Tavua District. So, it 
<br/></span><span>becomes difficult for any Council to support a large number of people living in the District when they are 
<br/></span><span>able to only collect limited amount of resources from their ratepayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak on each recommendation made by the Committee, I agree with 
<br/>Recommendation No. 1 which talks about submission of Annual Reports in a timely manner. For Tavua 
<br/>there was no qualified Finance Officer to address these issues across the Councils, CEOs were appointed 
<br/>who had knowledge skills and qualifications in finance.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the currency of Tavua Town Council, Mr. Sailosi Sawana, who was previously 
<br/>employed at the Ministry of Economy, is a qualified public Accountant with over 25 years of Accounting, 
<br/>Corporate and audit experience. Now Tavua and Rakiraki Town Councils have a very capable CEO to 
<br/>lead  and  deliver  timely  Annual  Reports,  so  this  matter  should  be  resolved.  The  Committee  also 
<br/>recommended  that  the  Council  works  with  the  Government,  Non-Government  Organisations,  donor 
<br/>agencies and landowners to develop Tavua Town as it has economic potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua Town is extremely difficult where the market is, market and bus stand. 
<br/>There is no State land where one can go in and quicky develop that area and build a market or bus stand. 
<br/>For a very long time, we were negotiating with the landowners but amongst the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, there was 
<br/>a land dispute and the matter is before the court. The only option Tavua Town Council have is to 
<br/>completely move the market and bus stand far away from where it is if they are in search of State 
<br/>land but then it is not practical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are so many shops around it so that is a catch-22 situation which Tavua Town Council 
<br/>is currently facing and hopefully when the dispute is settled in court then the government can start 
<br/>negotiating with the rightful owner of that land and move forward from there onwards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to mention, and I think the Minister also mentioned, that Tavua 
<br/>is the home for Vatukoula Gold Mine and Fiji’s largest water bottling plant, Fiji Water. As part of 
<br/>the social responsibility, the least Fiji Water can do to assist the Council is to develop …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do ? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- … the town for the ratepayers and visitors because they use Tavua 
<br/>Town.   They do not pay any rates, but they use the facilities of Tavua Town and now that Fiji Water 
<br/>will not be paying 25 percent corporate tax for the next seven years, they do have surplus money and 
<br/>they should be able to invest it into a town where they are based. Simple as that. So Tavua has been 
<br/>approaching Fiji Water for a while, through their Special Administrators and CEO, but they have not 
<br/>come back with a concrete suggestion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Because you did not treat them with respect, that is why.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is not about the respect, they need a favour from you so you have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>given them a favour through the national budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You need to treat them with respect to get respect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So favours were made and, therefor,e they need to invest in Tavua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Town.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Recommendation  4,  the  Council  had  identified  freehold  land  in  the 
<br/>interior which is a mountainous area to be the dump site. So, when they started negotiating with the 
<br/>landowner, yes, the cost was very high, the valuation was high and Ministry of Finance could not 
<br/>provide that funding because the valuation was low but the landowners was asking for more money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tavua Town Council, through the Ministry 
<br/>of Local Government, has received are total of $1.3 million since 2015 which is a favourable support 
<br/>from the Government. I just wish to talk on a few recommendations which I support. We visited 
<br/>Tavua  Town  and  we  support  that  Tavua  Town  has  economic  potential,  thus  the  Council  will 
<br/>collaborate with Government, Non-Government Organisations, donor organisations and landowners 
<br/>to develop the town.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023                 Consolidated Review Report-Ba Town Council 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2285 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 where the Town Council needs to continue with its work in prioritizing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of its dumping site.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 - a well-established municipal council that is well resourced should share 
<br/>their  qualified  personnel  to  assist  municipalities  in  their  operations  which  will  enhance  service 
<br/>delivery.  We saw that there is probably a drawback for both Tavua and Rakiraki for being small and 
<br/>they do not have a well organised or well co-ordinated effort to manage those two Councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, lastly, I wish to talk on the financial account or the financial record of the 
<br/>Council, something that we rarely talk on. While we are looking at the 2015 Annual Account, the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee is also looking at the 2016 account.  We have noted that the auditors 
<br/>mentioned  that  all  or  most  of  the  Council’s  accounts  have  been  extensively  delayed  due  to  non-
<br/>submission of financial accounts on time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have not met the Local Government Act 1972 section 57 
<br/>(1) and (3) for several years and for Tavua Town Council it is more than six years. Are we accepting 
<br/>this?  Probably  for  the  past  government  but  not  the  current  one.    For  Tavua,  the  2017  and  2020 
<br/>accounts were provided and under audit in March 2023. The 2021 and 2022 are yet to be provided. 
<br/>So, the Council is quite late. Internal controls were bad or ineffective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart  from  the  timing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  opinions  given  for  2015  were  modified  or 
<br/>qualified when misstatements eventually or in aggregate material but not pervasive to the financial 
<br/>statements or in simple terms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is material misstatements or non-compliance 
<br/>and or lack of sufficient appropriate audit evidence to the financial statements.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>has been going on for ages, not only for Tavua but for the other Town Councils as well. There a lot 
<br/>anomalies but Tavua is a bit better than Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were issues prevalent in most or all Councils and I hope 
<br/>the  Minister  do  take  note  and  encourages  his  PS  and  Directors  to  resolve  all  of  them  before  the 
<br/>proposed election.  One unreconciled of substantiated balances, poor record keeping with extensive 
<br/>manual  records,  different  system  used  by  different  Councils,  quality  staff  shortages  and  lack  of 
<br/>quality supervision from the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the honourable Members who 
<br/></span><span>have contributed to the motion before Parliament and I concur that the Council have a lot of pending 
<br/></span><span>reports  to  submit.    The  Committee  has  encouraged  the  Tavua  Town  Council  and  the  rest  of  the 
<br/>Councils that we will be debating this evening and remind them of the need to submit their Annual 
<br/>Reports on time.  Thank, Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
