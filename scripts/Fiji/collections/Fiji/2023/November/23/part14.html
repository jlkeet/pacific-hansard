<h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  $2,300.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  $2,300. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- …both the positives and the negatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. K.K. Lal interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Speak when it is your turn.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What about the Caregivers in America? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you destroyed the Trade Unions in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- You decimated them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  a  positive  note,  Fijians  will  remain  focused, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committed and dedicated, thrive and achieve their set goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Some of these workers have assisted their families, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>back  home  through  construction  of  their  home,  farming,  land  cultivation,  income-generating 
<br/>incentives, better education for their children and siblings, as well as community development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share a few success stories of our Fijian workers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- </span><span>Vinaka! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a young man from Matawalu in Lautoka has bought 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a truck for his father… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thanks to FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- … to help him cart his sugarcane from the farm to the mill. Another 
<br/>gentleman  from  the  Province  of  Namosi  has  recently  commenced  with  construction  of  a  three-
<br/>bedroom house for his children and spouse back home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Tell them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, an Aged Care Worker from Tau Village in Nadroga, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>went there and she took the initiative to upgrade her qualifications, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- She was assisted by the employer and after upgrading her qualifications 
<br/>and working for three years, in the fourth year, her employer applied for the variation of her VISA, 
<br/>and now, she is going for Permanent Residency and her children and spouse are going to join her.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- This lady also took the initiative to build a house, worth $45,000 in her 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>village.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT.- </span><span>Vinaka!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- She also makes voluntary contributions to her FNPF from there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- We have encouraged other workers to do the same, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Absorb it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a woman from Navua, who has just been six months 
<br/>of her engagement in the scheme, bought a four-wheel drive and secured a five-acre piece of land for 
<br/>her spouse to start their family farm. Another gentleman, Sir, from Bua secured a $50,000 home in 
<br/>Caubati, and he still has two years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scheme is a game changer for some of our goal-oriented workers and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they have achieved more compared to what they would have done ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- You tell them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- ... in years back home here. Mr. Speaker, Sir … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- </span><span>Na cava?</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2211 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scheme, however, also has negative impacts on 
<br/>our  workers  and  they  faced  several  challenges  during  their  employment  in  Australia.    Negative 
<br/>impact  or  social  issues  due  to  family  separation.    Challenges  which  include  cultural  adjustment, 
<br/>language barrier, differences in workplace, practices.  Furthermore, some workers encounter issues 
<br/>related to unfair treatment, overcrowded living conditions and lack of support services and breach of 
<br/>work rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to address these challenges and ensure that Fijian workers are 
<br/>provided with the necessary support, guidance and resources to thrive in their roles and contribute 
<br/>positively to the Australian workforce and our own economy as well as their families back home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the health and lives of our workers is of paramount importance to us.  Some 
<br/>Fijian workers, under the scheme, are facing psychological injuries resulting from discrimination, 
<br/>exploitation or mistreatment at their workplaces which can have a negative effect on their mental 
<br/>wellbeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  some  workers  are  experiencing  overcrowding  living  conditions,  inadequate  pay 
<br/>due to unauthorised deductions, long working hours with no overtime payment which contribute to 
<br/>stress  and  psychological  effect.  It  is  important  for  both  the  sending  and  receiving  countries  to 
<br/>recognise these potential risks and implement measures to support the mental wellbeing of labour 
<br/>mobility workers. This can include providing cultural orientation, language training, social support 
<br/>networks and above all ensuring fair treatment and protection of workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  challenges  that  our  workers  encounter  require  a  comprehensive 
<br/>approach  to  address  the  issue.    The  issues  need  to  be  addressed  urgently  with  our  Australian 
<br/>counterparts to ensure the principle of fairness, equality, respect and dignity is upheld.  We will be 
<br/>submitting a comprehensive report on our findings to my counterpart in Australia to be addressed by 
<br/>his department.  We have advised him of this and very soon the report will reach his table.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to earlier, there are some excellent approved employers and there 
<br/>are  those  that  are  not  that  compliant.    Non-compliance  by  approved  employers  contributes  to 
<br/>exploitation  of  workers  through  breaches  of  employment  laws  including  employment  contract 
<br/>breaches.  To address these challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is reviewing recruitment and 
<br/>also the performance of some labour hired employment agencies as approved employers which is not 
<br/></span><span>working well for the Fijian workers.  We are also encouraging and promoting the host employers to 
<br/></span><span>recruit directly under the programme and minimise third party involvement in the process. This is to 
<br/>minimise malpractices in recruitment and reduce exploitation as well as occasional disengagement 
<br/>of our workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the team has noted that certain visa arrangements are very restrictive, there 
<br/>are  conditions  which  say,  “No  pregnancy,  no  family  visitation  and  no  worker  portability”.    Sir, 
<br/>worker portability means joining another employer to work with which is a violation of worker’s 
<br/>rights and both human rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had this discussion with our Australian counterpart and now it has 
<br/>been agreed that workers can be moved from one workplace to another in the same industry.  Our 
<br/>workers also have been advised to ensure that with the assistance of the Country Liaison Officers put 
<br/>in writing all their grievances to the employers so that it can be escalated to higher authorities in the 
<br/>proper manner.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the role of the Country Liaison Officer is the key to the Fijian 
<br/>Government as it serves as a vital link between the Fijian workers, Australian approved employers 
<br/>and  the  Fijian  Government  ensuring  effective  communication,  coordination  and  support  for  the 
<br/>success of the scheme for both Governments. The Country Liaison Officers will be responsible for 
<br/>ensuring the seamless transition of the Fijian workers providing an ongoing support and addressing 
<br/>concerns while promoting Fiji abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week the Ministry has finalised the appointment of the second Liaison 
<br/>Officer to be based in Brisbane to look after the workers in Queensland and Northern Territory.  The 
<br/>appointee will start work in two weeks’ time.  In the coming weeks the Ministry will advertise the 
<br/>position of the third Country Liaison Officer in Sydney to look after workers in New South Wales.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Minister check from the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- There are no Liaison Officers, you never appointed one.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I have said this earlier, the Australian Government had approved the allocation of funds for a 
<br/>Liaison Officer in 2021.  They never appointed.  We have appointed the first one now and we have 
<br/>appointed the second one and now we are appointing the third one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- In the new year, we will appoint the fourth one and that is when we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be relieved to having to go and visit them every time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- They were sleeping on the job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Minister of Finance for 
<br/>approving the two Liaison Officer allocations and with that we are appointing and the third one.  For 
<br/>the fourth one we have now asked the Australian Government to assist with and hopefully in the new 
<br/>year, we will appoint that one to be based in Western Australia.  Once we have four Liaison Officers, 
<br/>we will be breathing a sigh of relief.  The Liaison Officers will be the direct link between the workers, 
<br/>employer and us, and they will provide us with monthly progress reports, and of course to the High 
<br/></span><span>Commission.  In that manner, they will resolve the problems on the spot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  ongoing  commitment  to  the  PALM 
<br/>Scheme, the transition of the Scheme from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of 
<br/>Employment and Workplace Relationships, is a strategic move and we are very happy that the whole 
<br/>Scheme  is  now  under  the  Ministry  of  Employment,  to  say  in  simple  terms.    The  Ministry  of 
<br/>Employment and Workplace Relationship is now having the Scheme under its wings, and that makes 
<br/></span><span>things easier for us because we will deal directly with the Minister and his team.  This way we will 
<br/></span><span>be more focused and there will be fewer layers of unnecessary … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  …  structures.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  strengthening  both  the  Fiji  and 
<br/>Australia collaborative efforts, they have agreed  to  work on data sharing  initiatives, and this will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2213 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>involve sharing of relevant information and resources to improve the effectiveness of the Scheme to 
<br/>ensure the successful implementation of all the goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Data sharing initiatives will help us to develop  a new national labour mobility framework 
<br/>strategy to  facilitate cooperation and coordination between the sending country and the  receiving 
<br/>country, as well as between the government agencies.  All in all, the Fijian Government is looking 
<br/>forward to finalising the Australia-Fiji bilateral  Labour Agreement under the PALM or the MOU 
<br/>following the merging of both the short term and the long-term programmes in April, 2022.  We hope 
<br/>to  finalise  the  MOU  once  the  draft  implementation  arrangements  are  made  available  by  our 
<br/>Australian counterparts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the revised MOU will improve governance of the Labour Migration Scheme 
<br/>in several ways.  It highlights the principle of cooperation and responsibility sharing between the 
<br/>sending country and the host country by improving inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination. 
<br/>This  is  because  development  negotiations,  implementation  and  monitoring  of  Bilateral  Labour 
<br/>Agreements require coordination amongst different ministries as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bilateral  Labour  Agreement  will  continue  to  create  transparency,  a 
<br/>major component of good governance and to be developed based on social dialogue and inclusive 
<br/>consultative  processes  for  both  countries.    The  Bilateral  Labour  Agreement  will  lead  to  positive 
<br/>changes in laws, policies and practices for better governance of the whole scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  confident  that  the  PALM  Scheme  will  continue  to  be  a  valuable 
<br/>opportunity for the Fijians workers, and I am committed to addressing the challenges they face while 
<br/>working in Australia.  The Vuvale Partnership Agreement provides a golden opportunity to Fiji to 
<br/>collaborate with the Australian Government and improve our labour mobility scheme for the benefit 
<br/>of all parties involved including support towards our economy which to-date stands at approximately 
<br/>$50 million in remittance annually. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji therefore has the opportunity to diversify our economy by strengthening 
<br/>and growing our Labour Mobility Programme towards economic resilience and at the same time has 
<br/>the obligation for the duty of care for our Fijians working abroad under these schemes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday the honourable Minister said that during my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>term I never visited the workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Today he comes to this Parliament and say that is what I did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- No, the PALM workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- PALM workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the manner in which the honourable Minister presented 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>himself today, as if he is the only one who did everything in regards to PALM. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Answer the question.

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And I will tell him, now I am going to tell him and you will listen to what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am going to say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I wish to thank the honourable Minister of Employment for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement justifying his travels that he made but let me tell him … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He help cleaned up your mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … that no amount of justification will reverse the decisions that he took 
<br/>to travel and I have always call his travels as “wine and dine travels”.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National 
<br/>Employment  Centre  was  established  under  the  National  Employment  Centre  Act  2009  under  the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is the fact! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Did you visit or not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No one can take away that fact, even you honourable Kamikamica. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Future Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vuvale Partnership was signed in 2019 between 
<br/>the two former Prime Ministers of Australia and Fiji and Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what they had to 
<br/>say at that time and I quote, “we commit to this not only as friends and partners but as families as 
<br/></span><span>vuvale</span><span>”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the initial stage this task was very difficult. There was a huge competition 
<br/>by our neighbouring countries.  The staff at the Ministry of Employment had to work day and night 
<br/>to build upon our name and brand and that is how this programme has become so successful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear! Hear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, May last year, Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Senator 
<br/>Wong, came to Fiji, and after our discussions, she announced that the Australian Government is working  
<br/>towards allowing the families of workers to live in Australia, and it is not a new subject. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, later last year, the Australian Prime Minister met with us and talks were held to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase the Caregivers from Fiji under the PALM Scheme. Here in Fiji, not there in Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all worked hard, as I have said earlier on, even during trying times, like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19, to make sure that Fiji does not fail in its obligation in terms of the agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  our  term,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  had  sent  around  7,000  Fijians  to  Australia  and  New 
<br/>Zealand for employment. I do not know what the figure is now, honourable Minister.  You should have 
<br/>said in this Chamber the number of people you have sent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, the FijiFirst Government, have laid a very solid foundation for this growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And we hope that the honourable Minister will build on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were criticised for these programmes by some of the honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side, so let us not forget that.  The slogan was that the villages will be empty under 
<br/>these programmes, but that was not the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today  this  programme  has  become  so  important  for  this  Government,  that  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister has to make regular visits to Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What he has talked about, the success stories, I used to come here and inform Parliament on the 
<br/>success stories, that is the whole objective of that programme.  The programme is designed in such a way 
<br/>that they would come, assist the villagers and the families, that is an ongoing thing.  It is nothing new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I briefly said on the works that we did, was all done here in Fiji, without 
<br/>making regular trips, like my colleague, the honourable Minister.  But during our term, Sir, we had trust, 
<br/>this is the word, “trust”, on our staff at the Embassy to carry out this work, and also the team leaders that 
<br/>we sent from here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the word “trust” is important.  What I can gather now is that this honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister has got no trust in the staff of the Embassy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I think he does not even trust his Prime Minister because the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister went to meet the seasonal workers.  Then after one week, I read in the papers that he also 
<br/>went. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What is all happening? And then you come here and my God – big song, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sing, dance and everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, there is even Liaison Officers.  So, I hope from now 
<br/>onwards, since we have Liaison Officers, Embassy staff, team leaders (there are a lot of team leaders), 
<br/>that these wine and dine trips will stop. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>Development and Way Forward for Sea Cucumber Fishery in Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>distinguished guests in the gallery and members of the public who are watching the livestream from 
<br/>the comfort of their homes;  a very good morning to you all.  I rise to deliver a Statement on the Sea 
<br/>Cucumber Fishery in Fiji and it is my hope that the information shared though this Statement will 
<br/>provide a holistic insight to us all.

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the trading of sea cucumber in the Pacific started in the early 1800s and is 
<br/>currently a multi-million dollar industry in the region, second only to tuna with some 21 sea cucumber 
<br/>species making up 90 percent of the trade.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sea cucumbers are an important source of income for local fishers, including women, and 
<br/>their export is considered as one of the oldest trades in Fiji. As you are aware, Fiji has traded sea 
<br/>cucumbers  since  1813  and  because  of  its  lucrative  status,  it  has  continued  trade  until  today  with 
<br/>imposition of fishing and trading bans by the Government of the day along the way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sea cucumbers which are largely traded in a smoked dry-form referred to as beche-de-mer or 
<br/>trepang, are high in protein and important amino acids, and consumed mainly by Chinese and other 
<br/>Southeast Asians for health and medicinal benefits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is the biological name - sea cucumber, beche-de-mer and what?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, I have forgotten the name.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- </span><span>holothuria scabra</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I could not get what you said, but you just continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- It is </span><span>holothuria scabra</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over 13 million people are involved in sea cucumber collection across 83 countries with over 
<br/>90 percent of the world tropical coastlines participating in the trade. The main consuming countries 
<br/>are mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  high  market  demand,  coupled  with  the  associated  risks  on  use  of 
<br/>sustainable  fishing  practices  and  inadequate  management  strategies  had  led  to  the  decline  in  sea 
<br/>cucumber  stocks  and  health  hazards  for  harvesters.  In  recognising  this,  the  Ministry  imposed  the 
<br/></span><span>fishing ban in 2017 to protect this fishery and allow natural repopulation. The band was of two parts: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Ban on the use of underwater breathing apparatus; and 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> ban on harvest or sale. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this ban was lifted in July 2022, with closure for harvesting in February 
<br/>2023 and exports in April of the same year. The intent of lifting of the ban was to support national 
<br/>economic recovery after the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic and more so, individuals and 
<br/>communities for basic survival needs as most were made redundant from their jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lifting of the ban to allow the harvest and export for this period had 
<br/>served  its  purpose  with  some  $18  million  to  $20  million  direct  benefits  paid  out  to  harvesting 
<br/>communities and individuals. It was overwhelming to see the various forms of investments our fisher 
<br/>folk had engaged during this opening. This included infrastructure, improvements at village level, 
<br/>housing,  procurement  of  machines  and  equipment  to  support  income  generating  activities, 
<br/>investments and many more.

<div><span>2217 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was equally important that the Ministry tracked exports of bech-de-mer. 
<br/>Our records show that a total volume of 140,000 metric tonnes of bech-de-mer were exported during 
<br/>the opening in 2022-2023. The value is estimated to be $11 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the sustainability in the stock, the following were in place in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 opening of the ban: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A defined criteria was in place for the selection of traders. A total of 11 companies were 
<br/>engaged by the BDM Licensing Committee and it was chaired by the Permanent Secretary 
<br/>for Industry and Trade and co-opted an additional three Permanent Secretaries as members. 
<br/>All these traders were issued with conditions to operate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 11 companies engaged agents to buy sea cucumber from harvesters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>A special licence specifically for sea cucumber harvest was issued to fisher folks through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the normal licensing process under section 13 of the Fisheries Act (Cap 158).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>A monitoring plan was also in placed by our Enforcement Team to ensure compliance to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the licensing and trading conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry undertook a bech-de-mer stock assessments in the Western 
<br/>Division with the SPC experts and surveyed some of the </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> with the most harvest pressure.  
<br/>The  areas  show  presence  of  species  which  indicates  that  they  have  not  been  fully  wiped  out  as 
<br/>speculated and will be repopulating.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on these assessments, the Coalition Government reopened the ban for 
<br/>six months in July 2023 and for closure on 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023. The intent of the opening was for 
<br/>three reasons - for national economic recovery, greater community empowerment and to open up 
<br/>spaces for iTaukei-owned businesses to trade in this lucrative commodity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the processes that were in the first lifting of the ban, the new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ones implemented by the Coalition Government through the Ministry are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The defined criteria was expanded to allow eligible iTaukei own companies to be part of 
<br/>this process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>An  internal  committee  chaired  by  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry 
<br/></span><span>evaluated  the  submissions.    This  streamlined  process  allowed  for  swift  decisions  to  be 
<br/></span><span>made. 
<br/>Twenty-one companies were engaged to buy and sell sea cucumber, of which 25 percent 
<br/>was iTaukei owned and they had secured their direct markets to Hong Kong. In the first 
<br/>opening in July 2022, there was a zero percent involvement of iTaukei-owned companies.   
<br/>It  was  mandatory  for  companies  to  liaise  directly  with  communities  and  harvesters, 
<br/>resulting in better pricing offers for harvesters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>As part of their corporate social responsibility, traders were tasked to engage in hatchery 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and culturing activities with selected communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for both lifting periods, the lucrative profits, gains and benefits has shown 
<br/>positive impacts in improving the livelihoods of communities and fisher folks and have contributed 
<br/>to economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the current opening period, the estimated volume of exports recorded by 
<br/>the Ministry is 42,000 metric tonnes with a value of FJ$4 million.  More shipments are expected to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  Ministry’s  attempt  to  ensure  sustainability  in  this  fishery,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following is currently being implemented: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together with its partners, the Ministry has undertaken various assessments to study the 
<br/>viability of the beche-de-mer</span><span> </span><span>fishery and understand the stock status.  This includes the 
<br/>National Science Expedition which has just concluded in the last two months.  This was a 
<br/>rapid assessment that was led by the Ministry in collaboration with Blue Prosperity Fiji and 
<br/>the WAITT Foundation.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The preliminary report has shown that there are beche-de-mer stocks on our reefs, while 
<br/>some areas have fared better than others.  There are measures and monitoring in place to 
<br/>ensure that communities continue to adhere to specified size limits and conditions imposed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following these studies, the Ministry plans for a more extensive national stock assessment.  
<br/>This is a very costly exercise, we will, therefore, seek funding to undertake this through the 
<br/>normal budgetary process and through our partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has already started scoping for communities with potential for sea cucumbers 
<br/>sea ranching projects.  The Ministry is also liaising with donors partners, through furthering 
<br/>the  scope  of  hatchery  at  Makogai  to  increase  large  scale  production  and  rearing  of  sea 
<br/>cucumbers and replenishing coastal reefs around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Galoa  Hatchery has  juvenile sandfish  ready for restocking some of  the  reefs where the 
<br/>broodstock was spawned from.  In addition, some of the sites have already been reseeded 
<br/>with juvenile sandfish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will finalise its Sea Cucumber Management Plan and regulations to ensure 
<br/>controlled harvesting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to inform this august Parliament and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>general public at large on work that the Ministry is undertaking to balance conservation and 
<br/>production of these fishery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his 
<br/></span><span>designate, honourable Minister, how many direct importers and exporters local do we have?  You 
<br/></span><span>have mentioned a few but I could not get the actual figures of locals in that category. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total number of exporters is 21 and we have 11 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei</span><span> exporters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Would it be simpler to Australia if you have to be an importer or a local 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resident in China to be an importer? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- No, Sir, it is a direct export to their clients in Hong Kong and China. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I said that I am interested because of my co-ownership of the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> and 
<br/>we have been dealing with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, honourable Minister.  So I suggest 
<br/>just to  polish  up on those figures that  I have been asking because it is  hard to  penetrate to  be an 
<br/>exporter or importer.  You are an exporter if you are Fijian but you have to be a resident somewhere 
<br/>in China or Hong Kong to be an importer.  Is that correct?

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Alright, that is enough.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  speak  in  response  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forest Ministerial Statement on Sea Cucumber Fishery in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be addressing sea cucumber as beche-de-mer which is much easier 
<br/>for me to refer to or BDM.  The ban on sea cucumber was introduced in 1987 as an affirmative action 
<br/>initiative.  It was to help </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities along the coast and around the islands in Fiji . It was 
<br/>to prompt them to enter into commercial activities and this had initiated the immediate response by 
<br/>local communities especially on maritime islands and coastal areas in Vanua Levu and Viti Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the 30 years of harvest there was no guideline to the harvesters of BDM especially 
<br/>the merchants and the middlemen. The benefit basically over those 30 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was 
<br/>the middlemen and merchants. Our local population did not get the total benefit that was initiated to 
<br/>benefit our local population.  Let me just give you an example, BDM would be bought at about FJ$70 
<br/>here in Fiji and it was sold in Hong Kong open market at US$200. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The merchants basically went out and distributed boats and engines as part payment for our 
<br/>local population to collect and sell the resource back to the merchants.  It was really totally unfair.  
<br/>The practice basically drove the BDM population to almost extinct.  In fact, two species have gone 
<br/>through the process of extinction in Fiji and luckily during those years when the ban was introduced, 
<br/>it had repopulated our reef.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  issue  with  beche-de-mer  when  it  had  gone  out  of  the  shallow 
<br/>waters  that  used  to  be  harvested  by  our  ancestors  and  it  can  only  be  found  in  deep  waters,  our 
<br/>population around the coast started using diving gears and this was a great concern. There was a huge 
<br/>number of fatalities amongst our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>population in Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Yasawa basically 
<br/>were the scapegoats of these buying and selling.  Fiji was on the verge of losing two main species, 
<br/>golden fish and black fish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Fisheries was able to repopulate our ocean during that period.  The initial ban 
<br/>was for five years.  We  had planned that within the five years, the population  would come back.  
<br/>Fortunately,  within  three  years,  we  had  report  on  our  stock  assessment  that  the  population  has 
<br/>rejuvenated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole of the Lau Group was reported to have the population that had never been seen 
<br/>before; the beaches were full of beche-de-mer.  In that context that we were waiting for the five years, 
<br/>the cyclones hit Fiji.  We started to put a programme to re-introduce for our local communities along 
<br/>the coast and the maritime islands to harvest this to benefit them.  It prompted us to make a quick 
<br/>restock and stock assessment.  That was bulldozed by the cyclones and then COVID-19.  In fact, we 
<br/>were lucky that we had reached the five years when COVID-19 hit.  So, the population of beche-de-
<br/>mer around the coastal areas was in huge quantity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, the honourable Minister has explained what had resulted out of the harvest and the 
<br/></span><span>sale.  I thank the honourable Minister for highlighting the strict guideline that was given.  I also thank 
<br/>the initiative to involve the local communities, especially</span><span> iTaukei </span><span> to be involved in the export.  This 
<br/>is an area, I had travelled to Hong Kong, and I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would know how difficult 
<br/>it  is  to  enter  the  Hong  Kong  market  of  beche-de-mer,  but  I  was  able  to  go  across,  through  our 
<br/>representative  in  Hong  Kong  and  force  him  to  allow  our  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  to  be  also  exporters  of  the 
<br/>commodity.  I hope in the context of all these, the Government will still look at sustainability as a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>major consideration for our future generations.  We must not allow the leisure of our generations to 
<br/>be denied from our future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this is a very interesting topic and I think if only the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications could look into and see how best we can  explore it.  In several of 
<br/>our visits to Hong Kong, in transit we were met by the Chamber of Commerce, as highlighted by 
<br/>honourable Koroilavesau.  I was interested to touch on how best we can penetrate that big market in 
<br/>China.  This is a very expensive food in China.  They take all the sea cucumbers, they can grab hold 
<br/>from all the seas all over the world, and they are very good businesspeople.  They will milk you dry 
<br/>before you realise you have run out of stock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was listening very closely to the statement by the honourable Minister, since he is a fisheries 
<br/>expert, maybe this is something that could be followed up, because I am wearing another hat here 
<br/>and  it  interests  me.    We  levy  $10,000  for  some  local  men  to  come  and  dive  for  this;  $10,000  is 
<br/>peanuts.  They will do this all over the seas in Fiji, and there is only one big exporter sitting out there 
<br/>in Labasa.  He gets all the juice out of all these without dipping his head in the water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have tried using machines and we have suffered a lot, then they banned the usage of this 
<br/>and honourable Koroilavesau knows that fully well because we were at the extreme mercy of the 
<br/>weather and we did not know how to observe all these things and we suffered these bans and we had 
<br/>to be rushed Suva by medivac to be able to put in those decompression chambers.  It is quite costly 
<br/>for us but it is lucrative business, and we have them in abundance.  If only we could be helped just 
<br/>to  see  how  best  we  can  also  enter  the  market  and  play  in  the  market.    That  would  certainly  be 
<br/>promising for the big </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners all over Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  will  adjourn  for  lunch  now  since  I  have  another  meeting,  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hopefully when we return, we will continue when the bell is sounded.
