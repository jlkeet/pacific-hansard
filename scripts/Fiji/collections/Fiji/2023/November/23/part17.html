<div><span>ITAUKEI AFFAIRS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on  
<br/>Tuesday, 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 26/2023), be debated, voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I deal with the Bill with your indulgence,   
<br/>with heavy heart, I wish to formally announce the unfortunate passing away of the Chief Justice 
<br/>Kamal Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Lordship  passed  away  at  the  care  of  doctors  at  the  Oceania  Hospital  in  Suva.    The 
<br/>Honourable  Chief  Justice  Kumar  was  born  on  13</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  1963,  passed  away  on  the  21</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>November,  2023.    He  had  six  brothers  and  three  sisters,  he  attended  Andhra  Primary  School  in 
<br/>Lautoka and his secondary education was at Pandit Vishnu Deo Memorial in Saweni in Lautoka. 
<br/>He was married to Sunita Devi and he has two sons.  His eldest son Kishnel resides in Brisbane and 
<br/>the youngest Shivneel resides with Kamal in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The late Justice  Kumar in January 1884 joined the law firm  of  Steward  Radian  Co. as a 
<br/>junior clerk until 1988 when the law firm of Steward Radian Co was wound up as a result of the 
<br/>Military  </span><span>Coup</span><span>  of  1987.  He  joined  the  ANZ  Bank  in  Sigatoka  in  1988  he  then  joined  Young  &amp; 
<br/>Associates as a Clerk in 1992.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  1994  he  decided  to  study  law,  enrolled  in  Queensland  University  of  Technology  in 
<br/>Brisbane. He completed his Bachelor of Law Degree in March 2000 and was admitted as a Barrister 
<br/>and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Australia and Fiji and returned for the employment with the 
<br/></span><span>Young &amp; Associates as a Solicitor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  May  2012,  he  was  appointed  as  a  Puisne  Judge  of  the  High  Court  of  Fiji.    He  was 
<br/>subsequently appointed as the Acting Chief Justice in 2019 and was confirmed the Chief Justice of 
<br/>Fiji.   Throughout  his  adult life, he was known to be a charitable,  and financially  assisted several 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>and  Indian  students  with  their  education.    He  had  a  quiet  demeanour,  and  never  sought 
<br/>acknowledgement for his social services to the community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of the day, the Coalition Government, the legal fraternity, and I am sure the 
<br/></span><span>previous Governments, appreciate his service to the people of Fiji.  The Coalition Government would 
<br/></span><span>like to pay tribute and sympathy to his family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 
<br/>2023, which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023.  As highlighted before the 
<br/>honourable Members of this august Parliament on Tuesday, the Bill essentially seeks to amend the 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs Act 1944 to reinstate the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC), otherwise, referred to as
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2240 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Bose Levu Vakaturaga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At its initial inception in 1875, the GCC comprised of Fijian Chiefs was established as an 
<br/>advisory body by the British Colonial Government, who had recognised the valuable insights that 
<br/>these  traditional  leaders  could  provide  on  indigenous  affairs,  and  that  their  participation  in  the 
<br/>administration would result in a more effective governance of their respective people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  GCC  considered  matters  relating  to  Native  Provincial  Regulation,  taxes,  laws  and 
<br/>punishments,  engaging  in  key  discussions  with  the  Colonial  Government  and  making  resolutions 
<br/>along the way.  The active participation of the Council culminated in the creation of laws, such as 
<br/>the Native Lands Ordinance in 1881, the Fijian Affairs Ordinance in 1944, the development of the 
<br/>traditional system of land tenure and the Mataqali Land Unit.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that also includes 
<br/>the establishment of schools such as, the Vulinitu, which is known as Queen Victoria School today 
<br/>and Adi Cakobau School.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Affairs Ordinance of 1944, now referred to as iTaukei Affairs Act 1944, is one of 
<br/>the core legislations pertaining to the indigenous people of Fiji, and section 3 of this Act provided 
<br/>for the GCC, which was to make recommendations and proposals for the benefit of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people 
<br/>and to consider questions relating to the good governance and wellbeing of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In early 2006, there were trainings conducted for village headman, </span><span>mataqali</span><span> leaders and clan 
<br/>leaders under a pilot project endorsed by the GCC, before the fateful day 6</span><span>th</span><span> December </span><span>coup d’e’ tat</span><span>
<br/>took place, the same year which ultimately saw the suspension of the Council in 2007.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The GCC was eventually removed altogether in 2012, some five years later, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>not by phasing out due to impracticality or lack of purpose, nor by collective desire of the population 
<br/>to  do  away  with  it  but  it  was  abrogated  under  an  authoritarian  rule  through  the  iTaukei  Affairs 
<br/>(Amendment) Decree 2012, which deleted section 3 from the provisions of the iTaukei Affairs Act 
<br/>1944 in the period prior to the return of democratic governance In our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji were not consulted by the regime at the time of the removal 
<br/>of the GCC. But regarding its re-instatement this time around under the Coalition Government, there 
<br/>was a Review Committee set up, wide consultations was held which have yield positive responses, 
<br/>as the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs had shared in his Ministerial Statement on Monday 
<br/>before honourable Members of this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The publication in  the  </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>  on 7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023 setting  the results from  the  </span><span>Tebbutt 
<br/></span><span>Times Poll</span><span>, also found 64 percent of Fijians surveyed were in favour of reinstating the Bose Levu 
<br/>Vakaturaga  and  76  percent  overall  when  only  the  support  and  do  not  support  responses  were 
<br/>considered without the undecided responses and responses defusing to answer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although we stand in Parliament today as the elected representatives of the 
<br/>people,  our  leadership  does  not  exist  in  a  vacuum  within  our  society.    May  I  say  that  again,  our 
<br/>leadership in Fiji does not exist in a vacuum within our society.  For over a century and to the present 
<br/>day, many men and women have stood up in their chiefly capacity to govern, represent and advocate 
<br/></span><span>for the traditional  </span><span>vanua,  </span><span>a role which was  reflected in  the former provisions  of the Act  that was 
<br/></span><span>removed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is only befitting with God on our side, you are seated as the Speaker to 
<br/>hear this very emotional momentous occasion of a critical part of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> the GCC, they are not 
<br/>only for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, it is for the entire people of Fiji who call Fiji, home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2241 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the 14</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, informed the 
<br/>111</span><span>th</span><span>  Session  of  the  International  Labour  Conference  in  Geneva  of  Cabinet’s  decision  for  Fiji  to 
<br/>adopt an official position or support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
<br/>Peoples or what is called UNDRIP.  The establishment of the GCC would provide crucial insight that 
<br/>is  currently  missing  towards  equitable  governance  and  inclusive  development  at  a  time  when 
<br/>statistics show a significant percentage of those living below the poverty line are </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  echo  the  statement  made  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management in the media whilst visiting Rotuma earlier in March this 
<br/>year that with respect to Rotuma, it is more a bottom-up approach that would be taken in progressing 
<br/>projects  on  the  Island.    It  is  not  a  two-men  rule,  it  is  not  from  the  top-bottom,  it  is  a  bottom-up 
<br/>approach.  It is one of consultation and reiterating the commitment of this Government in amplifying 
<br/>the mediums available for community dialogue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this year, work towards this end was progressed by the repeal of the Media Industry 
<br/>Development Act, which saw the return of a greater press freedom and in terms of the present Bill, 
<br/>it is the reinstatement of the GCC that would allow for a holistic approach towards solving the issues 
<br/>facing indigenous people today and related matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Opposition  Member,  honourable  Usamate,  in  his  statement  on  Monday 
<br/>when referring to the GCC being the body which looks after everything in relation to iTaukei that 
<br/>stated and, again, I quote: “All these things are enshrined in the Constitution”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while the Constitution recognises the iTaukei people, the ownership of iTaukei 
<br/>land and culture does not comprehensively deal with all these relating to the iTaukei and it is the 
<br/>facade and the mistake if the earlier government was hoodwinked by the former Attorney-General 
<br/>that everything is protected in the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is absolute hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- If they have a good understanding of the law and the Constitution, 
<br/>we do not expect the nut and bolts of the law to be in the Constitution. You will find it in the Fijian 
<br/>Affairs Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reinstatement of the GCC is not made unnecessarily by the provisions of the Constitution.  
<br/>May I say this again -. the reinstatement of the GCC is not made unnecessarily by the provisions of 
<br/></span><span>the  Constitution  but  rather  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  make  it  necessary  that  the  GCC  be 
<br/></span><span>reinstated to effect the full realisation of the rights and aspirations contained therein.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna is famously attributed in saying that, I quote: “The title of 
<br/>chief is not an ornament”. Much that he said about GCC is said from historical perspective. Therein 
<br/>lies the role of the present day torch bearers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As shared by honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs on Monday, the GCC will emerge as a 
<br/>revitalised structure based on the strategic recommendations of the GCC Review Committee that are 
<br/></span><span>in line with international standards which include that the GCC be neutral and apolitical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a potential for stewardship of a traditional </span><span>vanua </span><span>to facilitate 
<br/>reconciliation and nation building efforts, as demonstrated of the Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui 
<br/>Dreketi, Ro Teimumu Kepa, who made headlines in 2017 by declaring the descendants of G</span><span>irmitiyas</span><span>
<br/>as part of belonging to the </span><span>Vanua o Noco</span><span> in Rewa in a traditional ceremony that bestowed upon them 
<br/></span><span>cavuti na luvedra na Ratu</span><span>.

<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  existence  of  the  GCC  does  not  necessitate  the  exclusion  of  other  Fijians  -  a 
<br/>sentiment understood where the late Jai Ram Reddy who was a former Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>briefly as an Attorney-General, President of the Court of Appeal and was the first Indo-Fijian to be 
<br/>invited to a meeting of the Council on 6</span><span>th</span><span> June, 1997 at which he addressed the assembled Chiefs 
<br/>saying, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “The members of this Council are not just the chiefs of indigenous Fijians but all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fiji”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that said, Mr. Speaker, I now move on the pertinent features of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, the Bill will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come into force on a date or dates appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 amends section 2 of the Act by inserting the definition of “Council” to mean the 
<br/>Great  Council  of  Chiefs  and  the  definition  of  “Permanent  Secretary”  to  mean  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary responsible for iTaukei Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill inserts section 3 to the Act to provide for the constitution and primary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>function of the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 4(4) of the Act to require the iTaukei Affairs Board to 
<br/>refer to the GCC or the Bose Levu Vakaturaga any question relating to the iTaukei people that the 
<br/>Minister may submit to the Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amend section 5 of the Act to empower the Minister to make regulations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in relation to the Great Council of Chiefs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill amend section 11 of the Act to require the Minister to refer to the Board 
<br/>or  the  Council  any  proposed  Bill  that  is  intended  to  be  introduced  to  Parliament  and  which  may 
<br/>appear to the Minister to affect in any important matter the rights and interests of iTaukei people.  
<br/>The Board or the Council, as the case may be, is then required to submit the proposed Bill with a 
<br/>memorandum which is to be used in the Parliamentary debate process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  7  of  the  Bill  consequently  amends  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  Act  2004  to  </span><span>inter  alia 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>include reference to the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  spirit  of true  democratic  exercise,  we  have  set  out 
<br/>transparently the motivation and, in fact, the necessity for the reestablishment of the GCC within the 
<br/>codified ambit of law and anticipate healthy debate and contributions from the Opposition on the Bill 
<br/>that has been presented before this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill does not introduce a new entity but brings back a Council that existed and functioned 
<br/>practically before, and which had best suited to give recommendations and proposals for the benefit, 
<br/>wellbeing and good governance of indigenous iTaukei and Rotuman people in light of the cultural 
<br/></span><span>dynamics and structures which purvey this nation and save the reality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have before me a list of speakers and the order is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2243 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Naupoto; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Ratu J.B. Niudamu; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If time is still left, then we will take: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; and 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are just being given one hour to allocate to this 
<br/>debate.  We started at 4.36 p.m. and we shall stop at 5.36 p.m.  The Right of Reply will be given at 
<br/>5.16 irrespective of whether you have delivered your speech or not, but I apologise as this is how we 
<br/>are going to be managing our time - the one hour that we have been tasked to observe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the chiefly system must be preserved and protected 
<br/>for as long as we can.  More importantly, the sanctity of it must be preserved for without it, the system 
<br/>dies.  The sanctity is preserved when the aura and the </span><span>mana</span><span> that surrounds our chiefly system is not 
<br/>violated, and we do that by observing the protocols and keeping alive the traditional structure that 
<br/>surrounds the chiefly system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We maintain our different roles and the boundaries in that traditional structure around our 
<br/>chiefly system.  Words that are spoken around our chiefs, assist them with grace.  Chiefs’ decisions 
<br/>are final, they are not scrutinised or critic, before they accept it.  When all these are intact, we have 
<br/>deep  reverence  for  our  chiefly  system,  and  as  long  as  that  reverence  exists  like  now,  the  chiefly 
<br/>system will be protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the institutional history of the GCC, Sir, it was established in 1876 under the governorship 
<br/>of Sir Arthur Gordon.  The decision was taken following consultations with chiefs who advised Sir 
<br/>Arthur  Gordon  on  how  best  to  govern  the  colony’s  indigenous  population.    In  the  words  of 
<br/>Anthropologist Robert Norton, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It embodied the privileged relationship of trust and protection established between 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fijians and the British.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  me,  the  GCC  is  the  Westernisation  of  a  very  traditional  </span><span>itaukei</span><span>
<br/></span><span>governance system and because of it, the chiefly system is exposed to the ravages of the whims of 
<br/>change and it contributes immensely to the erosion of the sanctity of this chiefly system that is so 
<br/>dear to our hearts.   Because the decision of the GCC is not final, contrary to the traditional way 
<br/>where it is final, according to the Act, the decisions of the GCC is presented to His Excellency the 
<br/>President.  If a Bill is required, it is first presented to a Board, then to the Permanent Secretary, then 
<br/>to Cabinet and then to Parliament.   In that process, Sir, the Bill may not pass, again, their decision 
<br/>is not final. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A big criticism of the GCC in the past was the politicisation of it that is still relevant today. 
<br/></span><span>The GCC will always be politicised and it cannot shield itself from it.  The GCC will face its fair 
<br/>share of criticism even in their last meeting, their decision to remunerate  </span><span>Turaga Ni</span><span> Yavusa with 
<br/>$200 per month was heavily criticized on social media and even that decision was not final because 
<br/>it was  slashed to  $100 and approved here in  this Chamber through the passing of the 2023-2024 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the best way to protect and preserve our chiefly system is, in my view, not 
<br/>to expose it but to shield it from the influences of change brought about by the globalised world that 
<br/>we live in now.  Secondly, it has to be shielded in its purest form or as close to it as possible. It is in 
<br/>the traditional setting that this shielding is done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these years without the GCC, the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>continues to be served through 
<br/>the various arms of Government, through the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, there have been initiatives 
<br/>like  royalty  payments  that  was  new,  the  Fiji  Pine  landowners  have  been  paid  up  a  total  of 
<br/>approximately  $30  million  in  Lease  Security  Bonus  Payment  and  more  importantly,  our  chiefly 
<br/>system has been shielded in its traditional setting as I had alluded to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  now  that  Government  will  reinstate  the  Great  Council  of 
<br/>Chiefs, we must be reminded of the words of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna when he warned them in 1944 
<br/>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If we confine ourselves to pleasure seeking only, no useful purpose will be served 
<br/>in our maintaining our claims to chiefly status. If we are merely decorative, our position is 
<br/>finished forever, we will soon be tossed aside when some other races rise to the fore.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on this Bill.  I 
<br/>would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  also  the  honourable  Naupoto  for  their 
<br/>contributions this far.  I have a prepared address, but I just want to go back some correspondences 
<br/>over time.  On 8</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2006, I got this letter written, it was written in </span><span>vosa vaka-Viti</span><span>:

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>I am glad that I am part of this Bill that has been brought before this august Chamber and we 
<br/>are going to be looked upon as bringing back a bipartisan Bill.  But I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we 
<br/>will not vote on partisan lines today, that we will vote in the interest of the nation.

<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my brief contribution to the Bill 
<br/>that is before Parliament.  </span><span>Bula si’a.  </span><span>I have just received the Bill while the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General was introducing it.  After listening to the Ministerial Statement on Monday by the </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>nai Talai,</span><span> the Minister for iTaukei Affairs, he talked about the recommendations by the GCC Review 
<br/>Committee that was tabled to the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> GCC Meeting that was held in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his speech he had said that the future GCC would be something that needs to be apolitical” 
<br/>meaning the findings of the Committee probably had found out too that the GCC or the new GCC or 
<br/>the future GCC that he had put in his statement needs to be apolitical.  It should not be mixed with 
<br/>politics and that was admitted by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, the honourable Viliame Naupoto had said that while the GCC was not 
<br/>present, in the Act, the board was carrying the functions and roles of the GCC. If you see the current 
<br/>amendment that was being introduced by the honourable Attorney-General, it is just inserting the 
<br/>word “council” back into the Act and to play the role that the board was playing when the GCC was 
<br/>abolished in the decree that he is talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will not talk about the politics and the emotional arguments about the GCC, I will just go 
<br/>straight to the clauses, to the salient features of the Bill which I would like Parliament to see that is 
<br/>very important.  First of all, he is suggesting an amendment to clause 3 and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There  needs  to  be  a  Great  Council  of  Chiefs  which  must  consist  of  persons 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appointed by the President on the advice of the Minister.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  original  1944  Act,  those  words,  “on  the  advice  of  the  Minister”  is  not  there.    The 
<br/>wording is, “person(s) who were appointed by the Governor-General”.  In this particular clause, why 
<br/>it was very important to refer this Bill to the Committee would have been more consultations done 
<br/>and whether the powers now given to the Minister to advice the President in any appointment, how 
<br/>will it be vetted?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Minister, as we all know, is a politician, a political appointment and a political decision 
<br/>could influence the appointment of any GCC member given that they will be advising the President 
<br/>in any of the appointments.  If you look at the original Act, that is not there so that is a new insertion 
<br/>on the advice of the Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second thing that I would like to also share is on clause 4.  When a particular question or 
<br/></span><span>recommendation  is  brought  to  the  Council  through  the  Minister,  the  powers  that  are  there  in  the 
<br/></span><span>original Act that it must or should be referred to the Great Council of Chiefs.  In the current form, it 
<br/>has somewhat weakened the Council in the words in clause 4 where we will be inserting, if you read 
<br/>sub-section 4 of the Principal Act, it will be amended to insert, “it may refer such questions to the 
<br/>Council”.  So, that has somewhat given powers to the Minister and somehow the original Act talks 
<br/>about that the Minister needs to refer that to the Council.  In here, the Great Council of Chiefs is 
<br/>being undermined because the powers will be with the Ministers. These are some of the wordings 
<br/>that are there that is very, very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go to clause 5 of the Bill and you go to the Principal Act, there is a poor drafting done 
<br/></span><span>in terms of the words “wherever it appears” and the words that are being referred to in clause 5 are 
<br/>the words “of the”. If you look at that particular section in the principal Bill, there are three times the 
<br/>words “of the” appears in that section 5, but how it was drafted here, it only refers to two occasions, 
<br/>that is in sub-sections (a) and (b) that refers to this. So, there is poor drafting too done there that needs 
<br/>to be re-done.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2247 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that needs to be looked at in clause 6 where you have the introduction of a 
<br/>Permanent  Secretary  in  the  procedures  of  a  Bill  concerning  an  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  that  comes  through  the 
<br/>Council.  After the discussion by the Great Council of Chiefs, it is brought back to the board to make 
<br/>its papers before it goes to Cabinet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the original Act it talks about, after it comes from the GCC it goes to the Clerk Parliament.  
<br/>That has been removed in this particular amendment, an introduction of the Permanent Secretary that 
<br/>is in the form of the Bill that we have. The GCC had a standalone legislative procedure.  After they 
<br/>have discussed any legislation concerning iTaukei</span><span>,</span><span> it comes from the Minister, goes right to the Clerk 
<br/>of Parliament or the Secretary-General of Parliament; that is being removed in clause 6 of the Bill. I 
<br/>hope  the  honourable  Attorney-General  will  relook  into  this  because  these  are  very  important 
<br/>questions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we had taken the Bill to  Committees, we would have picked it up and also compared with 
<br/>the original Act, compared with the 2012 Decree and compared with the current form of the Bill that 
<br/>you have introduced and we will also look into the recommendations of the Review Committee of 
<br/>the Great Council of Chiefs so we can make a better form of the Bill that is long lasting and not come 
<br/>back running into Parliament for future amendments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last part is clause 7, the Bill states that these are just consequential amendments. There 
<br/>is another very important thing that this particular Bill has removed, that is, if you look at the iTaukei 
<br/>Trust Fund, the membership of the board, I will refer you to section 7(3):  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The board consists of eight members to be appointed by the Minister including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Five members nominated by the GCC.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That veto power, nominated by the GCC has been removed by this particular Bill which now 
<br/>says that five members must have a suitable qualification and work experience in any of the following 
<br/>areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment management; 
<br/>Engineering; 
<br/>Information and technology; 
<br/>Human capital;  
<br/>Tourism and hospitality 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a new insertion and that has taken away the veto of power of the GCC where five 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members are nominated by the GCC into the iTaukei Trust Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  the  Government  to  relook  at  the  Bill.  If  it  was  done  at  a  rush,  I  would  like  the 
<br/>Government and the honourable Attorney-General to withdraw it and refer it to Committees so we 
<br/>can fix and repair the Bill as it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We have only two minutes left for debate. So given that, I now offer the 
<br/></span><span>floor to the honourable Attorney-General for his Right of Reply because by 17.36 p.m. we should be 
<br/></span><span>finishing debate on this particular motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- My apology, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The contribution from honourable Naupoto was relevant but here we are hearing someone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who is not an expert in drafting. I do not know what his experience is for him to comment on the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>2248 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>semantics, it is just waste of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 82 of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, states that the President acts on the advice 
<br/>of Cabinet or a Minister or of some other body in  the exercise of their  executive  authority.   The 
<br/>referral  of questions  to  the  GCC because it must first  be assessed as  something substantive to  be 
<br/>referred to the GCC.  We have the Fijian Affairs Board refers to Cabinet then if it sees something 
<br/>that is relevant then it will go to the GCC.  This is only an interim measure explained by the Minister 
<br/>for Home Affairs.  The review, the future and shape of the GCC will be in a trust form and it will 
<br/>take two years, so we need the GCC to be sitting deliberating on the process to be discussed in the 
<br/>shape and form of the new GCC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed Bill processes is prior to submission to Cabinet.  It does not change the essence 
<br/>of the intention to ensure that the GCC comments are considered at the highest level of law making 
<br/>during  parliamentary  process.    The  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  of  2004  qualifications  submitted  by  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  since  five  members  were  repealed.    There  is  no  other  substantive 
<br/>comment to make.  I believe the essence of the Bill and why it is relevant has been considered, are 
<br/>there for endorsement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.
