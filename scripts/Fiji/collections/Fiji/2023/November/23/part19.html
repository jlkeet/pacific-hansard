<h3>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023 I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 28/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be debated, voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Mahogany 
<br/>Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled on Tuesday, 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Mahogany  Industry  Act  2010,  as  mentioned  when  the  Bill  was  first 
<br/></span><span>tabled, establishes the Mahogany Industry Council with the Prime Minister as Chairperson. Apart 
<br/>from this under the current legislative regime, the Prime Minister is also the Minister responsible for 
<br/>the administration of the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Act, the principal function of the Council is to supervise and direct the maintenance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and development of the Mahogany Industry in Fiji and in particular to supervise and direct Fiji 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hardwood Corporation Limited and Fiji Mahogany Trust in the performance of their functions under 
<br/>the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to transfer the overall responsibility of the 
<br/>Act and by extension the regulation of the Mahogany Industry from the Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/>to the Office of the Ministry of Forestry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Amendments  proposed  in  the  Bill  will  allow  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  to  provide  the 
<br/>much-needed  technical  expertise,  advice  and  guidance  to  the  Council,  to  achieve  its  mandated 
<br/>objectives, such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The need for the Mahogany Industry to be operated on the basis that is sustainable in the 
<br/>long-term and in particular the need for a comprehensive programme.  The desirability of 
<br/>the value being added within Fiji to mahogany timber and mahogany timber products. The 
<br/>aim of achieving a fair return to landowners for the mahogany timber on their land.  It also 
<br/>looks after the interest of the people of Fiji as a whole including opportunities for increase 
<br/>employment and skills training.  It also maintains high quality mahogany timber and timber 
<br/>produced in Fiji.   
<br/>To establish a scheme for the certification of the fell mahogany timber. 
<br/>The development of a recognised brand for Fiji Mahogany Timber and Timber products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the transferring of the custodianship of the Act and Chairmanship of the 
<br/>Council to the Ministry of Forestry and Minister for Forestry, respectively it is not a reform that has 
<br/>been  done  in  isolation.    But  one  that  complements  what  is  already  a  collaborative  relationship 
<br/>between the Ministry of Forestry and the Mahogany Industry.  For  instance, in September of this 
<br/>year, the Ministry of Forestry and the Fiji Mahogany Trust signed a grant agreement for $250,000 to 
<br/>better coordinate the needs of Mahogany landowners and to further enhance the contribution towards 
<br/>the Mahogany industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry has been working in the forest certification space 
<br/>for more than 15 years and with the support from the World Life Fund provided a technical support 
<br/>and also the Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Forest Certification Gap Analysis and Roadmap Report.  In 
<br/>March 2022, the Ministry of Forestry facilitated that the forest certification preparatory workshop as 
<br/>part of the endeavour for the forest stewardship certification to extend to Fiji’s Mahogany plantations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for reference the attainment of the FSC confirms that the forest has been 
<br/></span><span>managed in a way that protects biological diversity and benefits the lives of local people and works 
<br/></span><span>while ensuring sustain economic viability.  There is a need for our mahogany to be certified to enable 
<br/>us to compete in the international market arena.  Adding its value to the place and to place us above 
<br/>other similar mahogany sources from Asia and Africa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the representative of collaborative existing efforts but when we 
<br/>speak of technical expertise and knowledge that the Ministry of Forestry can impart to the mahogany 
<br/>industry, the examples mentioned are practical illustrations that we are referring to.  Under the Act, 
<br/>the Council has powers to fix the terms of a mahogany timber may be sold to FHCL to direct FHCL 
<br/></span><span>to enter into an agreement with specified persons for the sale of mahogany timber to determine how 
<br/></span><span>the proceeds of sale of mahogany timbers are to be distributed or used, and to give directive to FHCL 
<br/>and Fiji Mahogany Trust and to give directives to the iTaukei Land Trust Board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these very important powers, it only stands to reason that the Council 
<br/>must  have  meetings  to  allow  them  to  exercise  their  powers  in  a  manner  that  is  conducive  to  the 
<br/>exercise  of  their  powers.    However,  since  the  commencement  of  the  Act,  on  3</span><span>rd</span><span>  May,  2010,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2259 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Council last had its meeting sometimes in 2018.  That means, in eight years they did not have that.  
<br/>That is two terms of Parliament.  It must be noted, that under the Act, the Council meets at such times 
<br/>and places as the chairperson may appoint.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also one of the issues that the Bill seeks to rectify.  By allowing the 
<br/>Minister for Forestry to assume the chairmanship of the Council so that the Council may meet at 
<br/>regular intervals.  It is clear to all of us the busy schedule of the honourable Prime Minister, so if the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister is the chairperson of such Council, it will really hamper its performance, 
<br/>as was illustrated in the last eight years when it did not meet once.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  2018-2019  Report  on  Government  Commercial  Companies,  Commercial  Statutory 
<br/>Authorities and other entities, the Office of the Attorney-General in this audit of the FHCL noted that 
<br/>the mahogany harvested in 2017 and 2018, had not been replanted to maintain the sustainability of 
<br/>the mahogany plantation as required by the Licencing Agreement under the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just one of the examples which highlight the need for the Ministry of 
<br/>Forestry to oversee the administration of the Act, given the technical insight and resources they have 
<br/>which would allow them to monitor compliance with obligations under the Act.  Under the Forest 
<br/>Act  1982,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  bears  the  responsibility  of  being  the  administrator  of  matters 
<br/>related to Fiji forest and forest produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In its response to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, regarding questions posed 
<br/>on the Ministry of Forestry on the 2017-2018 Annual Report, the Ministry of Forestry had advised 
<br/>that mahogany plantations on private land or individually owned land were regulated by the Ministry.  
<br/>Therefore, the Bill also allows for the streamlining of processes as the regulating of forest products, 
<br/>inclusive of mahogany timber, will be regulated by one institution, that is the Ministry of Forestry.  I 
<br/>would  like  to  inform  Parliament  that  the  Coalition  Government  is  committed  to  reforming  the 
<br/>mahogany  industry.    Therefore,  the  Bill  is  one  of  the  reforms  and  the  Coalition  Government  is 
<br/>committed to implementing for the ultimate benefit of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has a significant mahogany industry which has the potential to make a 
<br/>substantial contribution to our economy.  Therefore, to encourage such an industry, it is only right 
<br/>that with the approval of Parliament, assign the role of the chairperson of the Council and the overall 
<br/>administration of the Act to the Minister for Forestry and the Ministry of Forestry respectively.    This 
<br/>will  allow  the  implementation  of  the  Act  to  be  conducted  more  effectively  and  efficiently.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate.  The list before me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>identifies three speakers, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forests; and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Small  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the sound of the first bell, I shall be humbly asking you, honourable Members, to resume 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your seat so as to enable us to get the next speaker to continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The floor is now open for debate and the floor is yours, honourable Leader of Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start with the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>2260 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>again, he has been harping about nothing being done in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir in almost 
<br/>all his speeches in this august Parliament but the problem is, he was not in the country most of the 
<br/>time in these  16 years, and he is not conversant with the developments that have taken place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad in the last Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, keeps 
<br/>reminding us that the voters are watching, the voters are watching. We are not concerned about the 
<br/>voters, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because politics without principles is dangerous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, I said workers not voters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, politics without principles is dangerous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I said, workers, not voters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KOROILAVESAU.- Stand up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Whether they are workers or voters, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the workers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are voters as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What this country needs are not politicians, but leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, because politicians are more concerned about 
<br/>the voters. Leadership is more concerned about the future and the future of the country and the people 
<br/>and the workers as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were some very good reasons that was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considered and had the Prime Minister as Chair of the Mahogany Trust. This is one of the entities 
<br/>that was salvaged from its status during the FijiFirst and the Bainimarama terms in Government, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same thing with the Fiji Pine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know it. No one can deny that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Undeniable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is one of the entities that was salvaged. How? Through strong 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership and solid leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Strong leadership, solid leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is needed and that is why, it remained in the Prime Minister’s Office because it was in the red. The 
<br/>same thing with Fiji Pine, it was in the red. It cannot run its own operations, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Millions of debts, if I recall, $23 million owed to the financiers. We owe money to FNPF, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>owe money to the machine operators, we owe money to other agencies, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Apart from the $23 million. Where is it today? Where is it today, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir? It took good leadership to salvage this company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is it today? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It took good leadership to salvage this company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We all know the history of Fiji Hardwood and we all know the 
<br/>history of Fiji Pine, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am concerned with all due respect to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>how solid is his leadership to take this institution given what it had gone through?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know for a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that even now in Fiji Pine, the Class A shares, which is 
<br/>mostly the landowners that we want to promote their interest, they are being bulldozed by Class B 
<br/>and Class C shares, which are representatives of Government in that board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask again, the honourable Minister, how solid 
<br/>is his leadership? I hope he is not easily influenced, because this is an industry that is important for 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We need, I have mentioned it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an over-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reliance on plantations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mahogany. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You know what has happened in most of the native forests in Fiji, 
<br/>it is almost gone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost gone. The issue of sustainability in the long-term and that 
<br/>is why it has to remain, and I urge the honourable Prime Minister, reconsider this decision because 
<br/>it is critical. We know how busy you are honourable Prime Minister Sir, but it is important for Fiji, 
<br/>and it is important for the landowners that we fight for, and it is important for the economy, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  It  is  not  an  easy  thing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  talked  about  the 
<br/>certification, we know the tightening in market conditions. Sir, on environmental issues, I know what 
<br/>is coming up when this goes to the Minister. There are overplanted plantations as well. Sir, the danger 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>2262 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in overplanted plantations there are small operators who are working with some of the landowners 
<br/>because landowners sell out of desperation. They do not go through proper consultations and that is 
<br/>why we need to protect this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have strong objections to that, and we hope that the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister reconsiders because it is important for the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry supports the motion and it will debate 
<br/>due to the following reason.  The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 gives an overarching 
<br/>power  to  the  Mahogany  Industry  Council  which  has  the  power  the  control  the  management  of 
<br/>mahogany plantation through FHCL. And the engagement of landowning forest base trust under the 
<br/>Fiji Mahogany Trust.  This basically brought other private enterprise to buy mahogany process and 
<br/>export timbers which negatively  affected  FHCL and resource owners.   The practice of restrictive 
<br/>mahogany licensing and cooperatively high log price since 2016 has not blend well with the industry 
<br/>performance to date.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the  Mahogany  Industry Development  Act 2010  the FHCL has not  been allowed to 
<br/>explore its full potential to expand its business into processing and export mahogany timber overseas. 
<br/>The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also repealed the Fiji Mahogany Act 2003 which 
<br/>gives Fiji Mahogany Trust more flexibility to make its own decision on its future direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also applies to the Forest Act 1992 in the 
<br/>mahogany plantation. This allow FHCL not to only operate but to regulate its own operation which 
<br/>should be regulated invertedly under the Forestry Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also limits the role of FHCL to grow in of 
<br/>the mahogany plantation and selling the mahogany lots.   This limits the profitability of FHCL and 
<br/>the owners who leased their land for mahogany plantations under the FHCL. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FHCL should be allowed to  process  and market  its own  trees as  well to  ensure more 
<br/>return as value added product rather than selling only primary product in forms of log.  Fiji Pine, on 
<br/>the  other  hand,  assists  the  company  -  Tropik  and  pine  product  which  allows  more  economical 
<br/>management and the plantations higher returns to landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Mahogany  Industry  Development  Act  2010  encourages  Fiji  enterprises  through  its 
<br/>mahogany industry, licensing and planning their 2011 to promote the mahogany brand through its 
<br/></span><span>licence  customers.  But  very  little  is  done  facilitating  landowners  to  actively  participate  in  forest 
<br/></span><span>business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Mahogany  Industry  Development  Act  2010  states  the  landowners  through  the  Forest 
<br/>Base Trust are given a fair share of return through lease rental and land management fees. However 
<br/>this  share  is  quite  small  compared  to  what  those  private  enterprise  are  receiving  from  export 
<br/>mahogany timber overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Mahogany  Industry  Development  Act  2010  also  have  a  very  little  support  for  the 
<br/></span><span>provision  of  initiative  availability  and  financial  facilities  that  could  enable  landowners  to  enable 
<br/></span><span>meaningful participation in SMEs and Forest Enterprise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry welcome the opportunity discussed in this motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and stands ready to execute the decision in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, therefore, support and commend the motion before Parliament.

<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the  amendment  to 
<br/>Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 putting the responsibility of the mahogany industry in 
<br/>the hands of the experts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  have  heard  me  talked  about  turbo-charging  the  economy  in  this 
<br/>Parliament or supercharging the economy, Sir. This industry if handle well will be a contributor to 
<br/>supercharging or turbo-charging the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Get the right people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They did not do the right thing on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am reminded of what they did in the </span><span>Bible,</span><span> the parable of the talents in the </span><span>Bible.  </span><span>They just 
<br/>sat  on  it,  they  did  not  do  anything  to  it.    One  meeting  of  that  Council  in  2010;  what  are  shame!  
<br/>Shameful, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  If you look at the trend of revenue, these industry should be a $100 
<br/>million industry right now in our country.  It is not even scraping $20 million at the moment and I 
<br/>think by placing it in the hands of the Ministry of Forestry, we will do the right thing and do justice 
<br/>to not only the industry but to the landowners, the resource owners of this industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just share some pertinent facts of what the other side did to the Mahogany Industry 
<br/>just to put it in perspective.  Some of it was during the chairmanship of the current honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition.    Firstly,  they  amended  the  Decree,  they  removed  the  10  percent  shares  of  the 
<br/>mahogany  landowners  vested  through  FMT.    Why?    They  were  saying  that  they  were  in  for 
<br/>landowners’ rights.  Why did you do that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  weaken  the  role  of  iTaukei  Trust  Board  on  mahogany  leases  by  enabling  the 
<br/>Council to have overriding powers on any matter relating to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land that are leased for mahogany 
<br/>purposes.  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> resource owner, right?  Why?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, weaken the participation of mahogany landowners to have meaningful participation 
<br/>in the harvesting and cartaging of operations.  The honourable Minister mentioned it just now, do 
<br/>you see any wealth created amongst the landowners, the resource owners in the Mahogany Industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- None. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Stop lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Fourthly,  weaken  the  participation  of  the  mahogany 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners to participate in the processing and export business.  I rest my case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Introduced  an  unworkable  licensing  system  that  led  to  poor  decisions  by  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government, to increase the mahogany log prices to unrealistic levels.  Oh, they have gone quiet! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And mahogany log production at export volumes have been on the decline and the list can go 
<br/>on.    I would like to just share two other things when I came back from my travels, I participated in 
<br/>the Mahogany Industry.

<div><span> Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in a company that actually started 
<br/>talking about certification of the forest, that was in 2018.  The honourable Attorney-General is still 
<br/>talking about no certification.  They sat on the certification and the implications were, we lost out on 
<br/>a major market in New Zealand without a certification.  They just sat on it, they had no money or no 
<br/>whatever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  They  had  no  political  will  to  do  the  right  thing  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners in the Mahogany Industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said numerous times that the previous government was full 
<br/>of talk, but a lot of hot air.  This example here, the mahogany industry is a classic example of hot air, 
<br/>lots of talk and no action.  I support the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir and the landowners of this country who 
<br/>own mahogany have a promising future ahead of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just a few other issues I would like to highlight.  
<br/>Contrary to normal standard best practise for forest sector management, the FijiFirst Party it basically 
<br/>takes out what is the legislative role of the Ministry of Forestry, so what we are doing here, we are 
<br/>reverting that back to where it rightly belongs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The essence of the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s submission is basically leadership, 
<br/>give it to the person who is the leader.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if am listening correctly, this is what he 
<br/>said.  It is only the Prime Minister who has the power, that is the problem with the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if I am listening correctly, this is what he said, it is the Prime Minister who has 
<br/>the  power,  that  is  the  problem  with  the  other  side.  All  the  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  we 
<br/>empower them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What about them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It is not a one man rule!   Gone are those days! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- There’s a new political order we are creating here! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The civil servants are the advisors.  As Ministers we go, we listen, 
<br/>we empower them, we give direction, we do not dictate what they used to do, so that is what we have 
<br/>created today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji will benefit, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> will benefit, the forest industry, the mahogany plantations, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>entire country will benefit from this Bill.  I endorse it, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
