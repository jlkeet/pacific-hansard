<div><span>Oral Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the    first  Oral  Question  from  honourable  Rinesh 
<br/>Sharma  has  been  made  redundant.  Since  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  has  given  his 
<br/>Ministerial Statement, we hope that takes care of the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 183/2023 was withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate Action Transparency Phase 2 Project 
<br/>(Question No. 184/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change,  Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs 
<br/>update Parliament on the Project Cooperation Agreement for the Initiative for Climate Action 
<br/>Transparency Phase II Project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the 
<br/>question on the Project Cooperation Agreement for the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency 
<br/>(ICAT).  This project is fully funded by the United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS).  
<br/>There are no financial implications to the Fiji Government and the project funding for phase 2 is 
<br/>US$139,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet at its meeting on 24th October, 2023 approved the signing of the 
<br/>Project Cooperation Agreement for phase 2 of the initiative for Climate Action Transparency which 
<br/>is an ongoing Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this second phase of the project is focused on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Management System; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Data institutionalisation from Nationally Determined Contribution; and  
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Tracking and policy making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Cabinet at its meeting held on the 24th October, 2023 approved the project cooperation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agreement between the government of Fiji and UNOPS as I said before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think some honourable Members are wondering why I am wearing this 
<br/>tie.  Today is Thanksgiving Day in the United States of America.  It was first celebrated in the first 
<br/>harvest after the first European settlers settled there. I am not promoting America or anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The background, the UNFCCC as we have heard this week was ratified in 1992 by the SVT 
<br/></span><span>and GVP Coalition Government which I had the honour to lead from 1992 to 1999.  It required State 
<br/>parties to regularly report on their climate change commitments and progress of National Climate 
<br/>Actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  developing  countries  like  Fiji,  reporting  is  done  through  our  national  communication 
<br/>reporting on climate change every four years and also biannual reports every two years.  These reports 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contains greenhouse gas inventory. The inventory is an account of greenhouse gas emissions such as 
<br/>carbon dioxide, methane, et cetera immediate to the atmosphere per sector on an annual basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are aware of the various sectors that can contribute to these greenhouse gases including 
<br/>agriculture and beef and dairy farming as well as rice.  Inventories are used to establish a baseline 
<br/>for  tracking  emission  plans,  develop  climate  change  mitigation  strategies  and  policies  and  assess 
<br/>national progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Paris  Agreement  signed  at  COP21  sets  out  an  enhanced  transparency  framework  for 
<br/>countries to promote effective implementation of the Agreement. To support countries in this regard, 
<br/>the Initiative of Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) was created as a multi-stakeholder partnership 
<br/>in 2015 bringing together multiple countries, various sectoral experts as well as public and private 
<br/>stakeholders at all levels of governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative for climate action transparency provides countries with tailored 
<br/>support and practical tools and methodologies to build robust transparency frameworks needed for 
<br/>effective climate action in sync with national development priorities.  Fiji ICAT was one project with 
<br/>the  Climate  Change  Division  (CCDE)  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  developed  a 
<br/>Greenhouse  Gas  Inventory  Report  for  rice  cultivation  and  livestock.    A  guidance  document  for 
<br/>determining greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector was also issued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase 1 enabled the identification and assessment of two agricultural policies for greenhouse 
<br/>gas  and  sustainable  development  impact.  The  project  also  resulted  in  the  development  of  an 
<br/>overarching  institutional  arrangement  and  recommendation  for  a  National  Reporting  System  and 
<br/>Design for the Fiji National Greenhouse Gas Inventory for Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji ICAT Phase 2 Project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is the subject to this question will enable 
<br/>alignment  of  sectoral  monitoring,  reporting  and  verification  systems  with  enhanced  transparency 
<br/>framework of the Paris Agreement.  I am sure you are all aware of the Paris Agreement, the attempt 
<br/>of the nations of the world to get global warming down to 1.5 or less than 1.5 degrees centigrade by 
<br/>2030.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  place  of  the  ICAT  Project  identified  at  the  national  monitoring,  reporting  and 
<br/>verification  system  blueprint  developed  for  the  agriculture  sector  could  be  replicated  for  other 
<br/>greenhouse gas sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This system blueprint will now be piloted to the fluorinated gases sub sector of the Industrial 
<br/></span><span>Process and Product Unit (IPPU) sector. The project timeline is expected to be 13 months and this 
<br/>phase  of  ICAT  Project  will  enhance  the  ability  of  extension  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  to 
<br/>contribute to the national reports required under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
<br/>Change (UNFCCC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will further strengthen their ability to measure the greenhouse gas 
<br/>mitigation  abatement  impact  of  introducing  biogas  digestors  in  community.  The  project  will 
<br/>strengthen the Department of Environment database on hydrofluorocarbons (HFC).  This will inform 
<br/></span><span>policy around the importation of air conditioning and refrigeration into the country.  Phase 2 will also 
<br/></span><span>address the Ministry of Local Government and Department of Environment challenges in collecting 
<br/>waste collection data from the various municipalities.  This ICAT project will aid in understanding 
<br/>solid waste disposal issues as well as the opportunities for methane recovery but also address other 
<br/>issues such as land and marine pollution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to update Parliament on this important  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have a supplementary question to the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>but I need to acknowledge this great step into the implementation particularly climate action steps 
<br/>that would help us in  fight against global warming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My simple question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is all about green gas and you are well aware of 
<br/>the fight on methane particularly on energy, agriculture and waste.   But, honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>Sir, apart from greenhouse gas data and recording and the actions that we do, also very critically is 
<br/>our implementation of our Nationally Determined Contributions.  We have a reporting process in 
<br/>that area as well, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question is, how is the Climate Change Office approaching this or if we have not made 
<br/>so much effort into it, then probably it is something that the Government has to consider seriously 
<br/>because this is how our mitigation contributions are also recorded under the UNFCCC process?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I think that is a very pertinent supplementary question.  It challenges 
<br/>the Government to update or upskill its workers.  You will have noticed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there 
<br/>was an article in the news two days ago about the appointment of a new Permanent Secretary for 
<br/>Climate Change and he had been involved in the international arena for some years and has come 
<br/>home to serve.  He has not been appointed, they have made the announcement but he will be part of 
<br/>the group going up to COP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Australian Government have been very kind as to second to us an expert from the Climate 
<br/>Change Division of the Civil Service in Australia to help out with our records and data keeping to 
<br/>justify our request.  The Small Island Developing Nations have been complaining about the tardiness 
<br/>of the assistance they get.   It  has been because of their submissions  for this funds have not  been 
<br/>properly staffed and we are going to have the officers properly staffed.  We are also looking at other 
<br/>things like the landfill in Naboro and whether we can harvest anything from the old dump we have 
<br/>in Lami et cetera.  Those are things that we are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had an old chap from Tailevu (senior to me at school) who manage the Manukau Dump 
<br/>for many years and then he came to start the one in Naboro during our time and it is time now that 
<br/>we look at harvesting gas from that landfill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  just  want  to  share  something  regarding  the  statement  made  by  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister in terms of the tardiness of these Small Island States.  It is quite something 
<br/></span><span>to work with them and see how they have been going on their own, it is sad.  Even though they are 
<br/>seriously affected, but their tardiness, kind of, stands out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of our island neighbours who are now suffering from these issues which have 
<br/>been raised by the honourable Prime Minister.  They are coming to meetings, sometimes you do not 
<br/>feel embarrassed but sometimes you laugh - this is the Pacific way.  How they are dressed, just a pair 
<br/>of shorts, flip flops and they come to international meetings to register themselves.  When they go 
<br/>back, we will be talking amongst ourselves.  </span><span>Isa</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>this is where we are and how we are doing it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  something  that  we  really  should  be  talking 
<br/>about.  There are nature-based solutions that the honourable Leader of the Opposition is very much 
<br/>aware of and there are also our own men thought-up solutions of reclamation and trying to mitigate 
<br/>the effects of rising sea levels.  We have a Fiji company that is working with the Government of 
<br/>Kiribati in the reclamation of some of their islands, also shipping, landfill all the way from Fiji to 
<br/>Kiribati to build up their islands.

<div><span>ECE Curriculum and Salary of Teachers 
<br/>(Question No. 185/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  inform  Parliament  on  the  steps  being 
<br/>undertaken by the Ministry to address the ECE sector, particularly the ECE Curriculum and 
<br/>salary of teachers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  again 
<br/>asking another question regarding the Ministry of Education. This time around, this one is a very 
<br/>crucial sector in terms of the education regarding Early Childhood Education and some of the long 
<br/>overdue issues regarding teachers’ salaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently </span><span>Na Noda Mataniciva </span><span>is the current curriculum that has been used 
<br/>by the Early Childhood Education. I see the honourable Member is nodding his head in agreement to 
<br/>what I am saying from this end.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2009, this curriculum needs to be reviewed to be on par with the changes and demands 
<br/>that have occurred during the period from 2009–2023. There was a forum of Fiji ECE subject analysis 
<br/>that  was  done  in  2022  where  there  was  discussion  to  review  the  Early  Childhood  Education 
<br/>curriculum in 2023 so this will be undertaken in 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding teachers first of all we need to review the resources that have been 
<br/>allocated to address the ECE. Currently, there is only one or two ECE officers that look after closed 
<br/>to 800 ECE schools around Fiji. So after the Fiji National Educational Summit there were plans to 
<br/>set up and put more emphasis on the Early Childhood Education with the positions to be filled up for 
<br/>the position of Director ECE, Principal Officer, Senior Curriculum Specialist.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the proposed positions that were discussed in the Fiji National Education 
<br/>Summit: a Senior Education Officer for ECE, Research Officer and nine district officers (advisors) 
<br/>that will be responsible to seeing the smooth operations of the ECEs schools in the various districts 
<br/>around  Fiji.  The  proactive  steps  that  need  to  be  taken  by  the  Ministry  will  contribute  to  the 
<br/>development of our nation’s young minds and ensuring that our dedicated teachers who play a very 
<br/>important role receive a recognition and the remunerations that they deserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw attention to the disparity that had been experienced by 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry of Education ECE teachers regarding the inconsistency of the remuneration that they 
<br/>have been paid over the years. They were given contracts and I think the honourable Member would 
<br/>be very much aware with the stated salary of $14,000 that they will be entitled to. Unfortunately, the 
<br/>ECE  teachers are paid  hourly rate of $5. They work five hours a day and sometimes their salary 
<br/>amounts to only $9,000. So, these are the discrepancies that we are trying to work on, for us to review 
<br/>the hours of work, if they work the full  eight hours so that they can be  entitled to  what  they are 
<br/>actually appointed on, on a salary of $14,000.   Thank you very much Mr, Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question. Before that, there might 
<br/></span><span>be new question but if the Minister can answer; if we are talking about ECE children, proceed from 
<br/>ECE.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will decide on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Sir.

<div><span>2225 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  If  students  going  from  ECE  to  primary  school,  ECE  being  the 
<br/>feeder of primary school and primary school being the feeder of the secondary schools, what we have 
<br/>seen recently is some management are coming up with their own rules whereby Year 8 students are 
<br/>not taken into the same school for Year 9 as a feeder.  I will give you an example. MGM Primary are 
<br/>rejecting students from Year 8 to be enrolled in Year 9 and they telling them to go and look for their 
<br/>schools  on  median  marks.  If  the  Ministry  can  look  into  this  because  parents  are  having  a  lot  of 
<br/>difficulties also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same applies for ECE. If the feeder is ECE for primary school, they are not enrolling 
<br/>these students and parents are roaming around from here and there to look for their schools and we 
<br/>have live examples of this, if the Minister can look into this, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- They roam around looking for schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a totally new question, but I would like 
<br/>to shed some light into the education situation that we have now. We have over 700 plus primary 
<br/>schools, and we only have 170 plus secondary schools. Definitely, there is imbalance there that we 
<br/>are  trying  to  address  by  even  building  new  schools,  trying  to  address  students  going  to  find  the 
<br/>schools that provide better quality education. At the same time, they are leaving the schools in the 
<br/>rural and maritime areas vacant or empty, because the people are coming into town, and we are going 
<br/>to address that. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Thank you, honourable Minister. There 
<br/>is  an  estimated  of  1,500  ECE  teachers,  and  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  majority  of  the  people  have  been 
<br/>affected by the VAT increase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Of course they have been affected, we agree. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister for Employment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is relevant because 80 percent of 
<br/>his  speech  is  about  international  things,  nothing  about  local  employment.    To  the  Honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Education, I have high hopes from you that if the salary of these ECE teachers could see 
<br/></span><span>an  increment  in  time  to  come,  and  if  there  was  any  impact  assessment  done  through  a  feedback 
<br/>question mechanism, or clarification on the impact of the Cost of Living that has increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the short answer to that is, we are trying to 
<br/>address  the  anomalies  in  the  pays  that  are  currently  being  paid  out  to  ECE  teachers.  This  was 
<br/>inherited. I think the honourable Member who asked the question would be fully aware, and that is 
<br/>what we are trying to address now, trying to give them what were actually offered in the first place 
<br/>with the proper working hours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MOU - Risk Communication Capacity 
<br/>(Question No. 186/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  Enhance  Risk  Communication  Capacity  for  the 
<br/>Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for the question. Sir, on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2023, Cabinet endorsed the Ministry of Health to engage with 
<br/>the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  for  opportunities  to  build  risk 
<br/>communication capacity in the Ministry.  Just as the honourable Prime Minister had mentioned in 
<br/>celebrating the Thanksgiving Day, we are also thankful to the US Government in terms of increasing 
<br/>their capacity at the USAID Department - the Ministry’s to seek their assistance with regards to risk 
<br/>communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, risk communication is important in the public health response tool, sure the 
<br/>previous  Government  know  this  too  well.    Its  main  purpose  is  to  enable  people  at  least  to  make 
<br/>informed decisions to take actions to mitigate the effects of health threat or hazard such as disease 
<br/>outbreak and proactive measures and preventative measures, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  Communication  team  has 
<br/>commenced consultation with our USAID counterparts and the details of their assistance with the 
<br/>Ministry.    The  visit  by  the  USAID  Team  is  planned  in  February  next  year  to  conduct  the  Needs 
<br/>Assessment Survey and also handover much-needed communication equipment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU between the  Ministry and the USAID has been drafted and  contains assistance 
<br/>sought  from  USAID  through  its  action  portfolio  which  is  their  funded  global  social  behavioural 
<br/>change project. The list of activities are the needs assessment which I have alluded to earlier in 2024, 
<br/>capacity  building  for  staff  of  the  Ministry  and  developing  communications,  plan,  campaigns  and 
<br/>communication  materials,  virtual  coaching  on  developing  communication  materials,  website 
<br/>enhancement training and provision of communication equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently draft MOU is now with the USAID Team for their consideration 
<br/>and  final  endorsement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Sir,  that  in  itself  is  a  brief  update  on  the  current  MOU 
<br/>between the Ministry of Health and USAID on the understanding on enhance risk communication 
<br/>capacity.  </span><span>Vinaka.

<div><span>Update on Review of Market Fees 
<br/>(Question No. 187/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that the market fees review for market vendors and farmers was announced in 
<br/>the  2023-2024  Budget,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Housing  and  Local  Government 
<br/>update Parliament on the status of the review? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question, first, I would 
<br/>like to respond to a remark that was made in the morning by the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>regarding the upkeep of Albert Park.  I wish to remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition as 
<br/></span><span>well as honourable Members of Parliament that there is no change to the maintenance programme 
<br/></span><span>that is followed by the Suva City Council, whatever has been done in the past they are continuing 
<br/>with that, that is going to continue, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I played touch rugby there last year and this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- A good example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are here for the last two 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2227 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>days, the ground was closed.  It seems that Suva City Council was trying to maintain the surface, as 
<br/>well as the upkeep of Albert Park.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Deep holes are there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now I will respond to the question before me 
<br/>this afternoon.  Firstly, I would like to remind the honourable Member that the 2022-2023 Budget 
<br/>does not mention the market reviews for market vendors and farmers, but rather reinstated the waiver 
<br/>of  the  market  stall  fees,  I  suppose  as  COVID-19  recovery  strategy.    The  reinstatement  is  the 
<br/>consideration of the successful navigation of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
<br/>the fact that we are now on the path to recovery.  This is also to ease the Coalition Government as 
<br/>we now work on the national priorities and commitments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Government provided a sum of approximate $10.5 million in 
<br/>the form of financial support to Municipal Councils for the waiver of the market stall fees for the last 
<br/>two financial years.  The waiver was provided in the financial years from 2021 to 2022, as well as 
<br/>2022 to 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there was a shortfall from the grant that was provided by Government.  In 2021 to 
<br/>2022, there was a shortfall of close to $55,000, which is a short fall of 11 precent and $1.2 million in 
<br/>the financial year 2022 to 2023, which is a shortfall of close to 19 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  although  the  market  stall  fee  subsidy  was  allocated  to  13  Municipal 
<br/>Councils initially, the amounts allocated was insufficient to pay all the dues on the market stalls.  Not 
<br/>all the Councils were provided with the actual amount of funds that they would have collected from 
<br/>the market vendors in all the municipal markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry requested for a reinstatement of market stall fees 
<br/>to  allow  Councils  to  collect  fees  to  focus  on  strengthening  their  revenue  stream.    All  Municipal 
<br/>Councils around the country have been challenged to manage their affairs from business perspective 
<br/>and not relying solely on Government on the provision of grant to assist them in their operation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, the budget for the financial year 2023-2024 does not make any provision for the 
<br/>subsidy on the market  stall  fees for this fiscal  year.  Municipal Councils have now reinstated the 
<br/>market stall fees from this financial year and are collecting the same.  There is no review, they are 
<br/>just collecting whatever the gazetted fees say for all the municipal markets around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  given  the  significance  of  the  market  stall  fees  revenue  and  sustaining 
<br/>operations  and  development  of  municipality,  the  Councils  have  been  prompted  to  take  actions  to 
<br/>ensure the collection of their revenue.  Since the announcement of the reinstatement of stall fees, 
<br/>Municipal Councils have been advised to ensure that market stall vendors resume payment of their 
<br/>respective fees as at 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023.  The existing fee structure, as outlined in the previous years, 
<br/>remain in effect to allow the Councils to make appropriate submissions if there is a need for review 
<br/>of the market fees for all the Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition,  Municipal  Councils  have  been  directed  to  establish  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mechanism to efficiently collect these fees and maintain accurate record of the transactions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $1.675 million has been collected by the 13 Councils in the last 
<br/>quarter  from  August  to  October  this  year.      This  is  the  much-needed  revenue  for  the  Local 
<br/>Government that will assist Municipal Councils to enhance their operations and service delivery for 
<br/>the benefit of the market vendors, ratepayers and the community at large.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government, through Municipal Councils, will ensure 
<br/>that ratepayers and various communities continue to receive the service that they deserve.  Needless 
<br/>to say, the Municipal Councils will be motivated to build the cities and towns with the aim to generate 
<br/>multiple activities and innovative development of infrastructure.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, UN Women has provided funding assistance to the Ministry for the review 
<br/>of  the  bylaws  and  the  development  of  the  new  Municipal  Market  regulations,  considering  the 
<br/>changing demands of the markets, market vendors, Municipal Councils and the public at large.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funding provided by UN Women is in the sum of FJ$89,600.  This will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cover the market consultancy and awareness during the review exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also worth noting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the assistance will focus on the consultative 
<br/>process of the revision of market bylaws of the Municipal Councils to ensure that regulations are 
<br/>established.  As such, the Ministry in partnership with UN Women, has appointed a consultant to 
<br/>carry out the review exercise and draft market regulations that will be a standard regulation to be 
<br/>used by the 30 Municipal Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  speak,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  go  around  Municipal  Councils  in  Fiji,  they  have 
<br/>different market bylaws  for different markets, and that is something that we are trying to address 
<br/>now.  There are cases where some of the produce that are not supposed to be sold in some of the local 
<br/>markets that we have are now being sold.  It is just like you are walking into a mini supermarket.  
<br/>There are also cases where some market vendors have been allocated more than two or more than 
<br/>four stalls, some even have 20 stalls, so that is something that we are trying to address right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The role of the consultant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to provide guidance to the Ministry of Local 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government in developing Municipal Market regulations which would replace the market bylaws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  following  the  review  and  consultation  with  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-
<br/>General, the Ministry will facilitate the formalisation of the regulations.  The consultancy fee for the 
<br/>review is in the sum of FJ$40,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of funding an agreement with Ministry and UN Women is also 
<br/>to develop materials and awareness programmes.  Awareness material will be a simplified market 
<br/>regulation that will be displayed in all 13 Municipal Markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government in collaboration with UN Women endeavours to complete 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the project before the end of the financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to the question before this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>august Parliament this afternoon. Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  honourable  Minister  has  informed 
<br/>Parliament, he has reinstated the fees for the market vendors and farmers.  Sir, what a Government!  
<br/>The people’s Government!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be welcomed by the Coalition Government to come into Parliament 
<br/>and brag about putting money into people’s pocket, but here they are bragging about their collections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the so-called people’s Government, honourable Minister, do you have any exemptions on 
<br/>any reduction for any smallholder vendors because remember, cyclones came, COVID-19 came and 
<br/>these were really affected?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these were really affected but the VAT increase has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2229 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>really impacted our people, especially these vendors.  So, are there any exemptions to be considered 
<br/>for these vendors?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member for the question.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, through you, if you have been following the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s announcement just lately, 
<br/>they have stated that Fiji is now back to pre-COVID-19 level and if you happen to walk around all 
<br/>the Municipal Markets, you will see that a lot of produce are now being sold in all the markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To answer his question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just said that the Ministry is on the verge of 
<br/>reviewing the market bylaws and that some of that, we want to do right now, so those are some of 
<br/>the things that we are going to consider.  There will be cases where some vendors that will be affected 
<br/>may be due to something that must have affected them.  VAT increase is not something new. What 
<br/>I have just is not back to pre-COVID-19. A lot of things are happening now. A lot of people are 
<br/>buying from the market.   A lot of market vendors are now receiving more income as they used to do 
<br/>before, so that is something that the Ministry is considering of doing as we review the Market Bylaws.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Scam Taskforce 
<br/>(Question No. 188/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the establishment 
<br/>of the Scam Taskforce on online fraudulent activities and its future plans? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thank the honourable Tunabuna for a very relevant and 
<br/>topical  question in  the country right now. Perhaps, before  I venture into my  question, there were 
<br/>some questions made over the last 24 hours that warrant some mention. I would like start with, to 
<br/>me, what was a very significant event yesterday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, yesterday, on this floor, the honourable Leader of the Opposition begged the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister to attend COP 28 and the honourable Prime Minister agreed, virtually immediately, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I hope Fiji watch that gesture yesterday, Sir, because it is showing a very important 
<br/>point, a point that all of us in this Parliament, including the whole country, will learn that one key 
<br/>element of leadership is the ability to listen, and when it is right, act on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 16 years… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>E sega, e warai</span><span>.  So, I hope that the people of Fiji will take 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>note that we have a Leader who actually listens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A couple of other points,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.   Honourable Bala mentioned  something about 
<br/>empty vessels yesterday. So, I thought just to match his quote, I would provide a quote from this side 
<br/></span><span>of Parliament just in the spirit of banter and politics. It is a quote from Abraham Lincoln, the former 
<br/></span><span>President of the United States, where he said, and I quote: “It is best to be quiet and be thought a  
<br/>fool or to speak out and remove all doubt.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, the final point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is about honourable Bala and maybe this is picking on his speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- If you continue to speak, you’ll remove all doubt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He, in responding, was asked, “Did you travel to see the 
<br/>workers offshore? I think he did not answer that question, which brings me to a very important point, 
<br/>Sir. What was the motivation of his Government in terms of the…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker.    Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister, please, answer the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You raised a Point of Order and you are telling him to answer the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will leave my point on honourable Bala for another day, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to answer the question.  The Scam Taskforce 
<br/>was actually  established this year by Government  in  response to  quite significant  and concerning 
<br/>online fraudulent activities that happened in this country.  It is very unfortunate that Fiji has had a 
<br/>history of scams over the years, such as the gifting pyramid schemes, now the e-Bay shop scheme, 
<br/>bitcoin and cryptocurrency, impersonation to obtain financial advantage through </span><span>Viber</span><span>, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The failed e-Bay shop scam has left many people struggling, with hundreds of people losing 
<br/>thousands  of  dollars  in  a  scheme  that  provided  zero  returns  once  it  collapsed.    E-Bay  shop  was 
<br/>essentially a pyramid scheme disguised as a recruitment agency.  They had over a hundred agents, 
<br/>recruiting people into the scheme across all Divisions in Fiji.  In response, the Fiji Police Force also 
<br/>established the taskforce in each Division to ascertain the severity of the matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Consumer Council of Fiji, Fijian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (FCCC), the 
<br/>Consumer  Commission  and  other  agencies  pleaded  to  the  public  to  come  forward  and  report  the 
<br/>matter to enable comprehensive investigation to proceed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thus far, the Taskforce has received over 1,859 complaints as of 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2023.  It is 
<br/>understood that the people have been taken in for questioning and we hope for an outcome soon, 
<br/>given that the e-Bay online recruitment scam is of national interest, noting the millions of dollars that 
<br/>have been lost by the public actively participating in this online scheme.  The total value of reported 
<br/></span><span>losses todate is $3.1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is, no doubt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the rise in technology and the use of e-commerce 
<br/>platforms are being misused.  It is still new and not fully utilised in Fiji and the Pacific countries, 
<br/>hence it is not fully regulated.  Such examples, such as mobile wallets - M-PAiSA and MyCash, are 
<br/>becoming increasingly popular tools for cashless payments and money transfer.  There is a need, Sir, 
<br/>to review existing regulations and identify gaps to safeguard consumer protection.  That is one of the 
<br/>current new priorities of the Ministry and the People’s Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, the Taskforce has their hands full to also assess, review, monitor 
<br/></span><span>online fraudulent activities both, locally and abroad, ensuring there is no money leakages offshore.  
<br/>It is important to note that continuous advocating against fraudulent activities through various media 
<br/>platforms are being made by members of the taskforce.  The Taskforce may or will declare an online 
<br/>activity as a scam after an assessment of the Taskforce, assigning members to take necessary action 
<br/>where applicable.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2231 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Taskforce at the moment, comprises of the following agencies, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Trade; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Fiji Police Force; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Consumer Council of Fiji; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Online Safety Commission; 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reserve Bank of Fiji; and  
<br/>Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Chairperson  of  the  taskforce  is  generally  the  Minister  for  Trade  (myself)  or  the 
<br/>Permanent  Secretary.    The  Taskforce  has  the  ability  to  co-opt  members,  such  as  the  Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit, commercial banks and telecom service providers, such as Vodafone or Digicel, as 
<br/>required.    Thus  far,  we  have  had  three  meetings  on  the  online  scams  –  e-Bay  Shop  and  </span><span>Viber 
<br/></span><span>impersonations are key issues at the moment.  Impersonators would defraud family, friends, business 
<br/>executives using MPAiSA or MyCash platforms to deceive innocent people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the future plans, Mr. Speaker, Sir? In our Taskforce meetings, we have invited the 
<br/>two major operators, Vodafone and Digicel to seek their support to nurture and create awareness on 
<br/>the ongoing scams that are involving the use of e-wallets.  Most importantly to hear the activities in 
<br/>providing more secure platforms, programmes and initiatives to create more awareness of devious 
<br/>transactions and scams.  It is unfortunate that whilst Fiji aims to develop our digital economy, it is 
<br/>being misused and it does build mistrust amongst us all; this is unacceptable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly, during our taskforce meetings, it was revealed that a new way of scamming through 
<br/></span><span>Viber</span><span> accounts as I had mentioned is currently underway where accounts are being hacked, whereby 
<br/>the hacker will try and obtain money from one’s own contacts. This type of new impersonation is 
<br/>happening right now, and our taskforce has  received a lot of reports  and complaints.  Alarms are 
<br/>being sounded and we urge people to take this very seriously.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the FCCC, the Consumer Council, RBF are collaborating with a digital solutions 
<br/>provider to provide a proactive approach to  awareness  and educating the public on online scams.  
<br/>They will be publicising their awareness material very soon.  We have made it a top priority, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to bring justice to those involved in the scam to be taken to task.  Furthermore, we will 
<br/>be undertaking more awareness programmes to educate the public so that they do not fall into such 
<br/>scams in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the medium to long term, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the taskforce is also looking at the existing 
<br/>laws to give consumer protection agencies more teeth.  Can I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the government 
<br/>over the last 16 years had seen these scams before and did absolutely nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- This is a government that is full of talk, a lot of hot air, again 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just like you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Through this august Parliament, I call on the beloved Fijians 
<br/>to take great awareness in the use of various social media sites as there have been high reports of 
<br/>fraudulent  activities    originating  from  social  media  sites  promising  get  rich  quick  schemes.    I 
<br/>therefore  urge  the  public  to  practice  financial  awareness  when  coming  across  such  schemes  and 
<br/>prevent themselves from falling victim to these kind of ventures.

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In very simple terms, Sir, if someone comes to you and says, “your money is going to grow 
<br/>50 percent or 100 percent” my advice to the public, run for the hills.  With those few words, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to answer the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>for his detailed explanation but not his meanderings. My question to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs has had discussions on this matter.  I just 
<br/>wanted to ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister if there has been communications with the two 
<br/>mobile service providers because it seems to us as a Committee that they are also taking advantage 
<br/>because it is business for them on the money transfer that has been created as they collect fees out of 
<br/>it.  I just wanted clarification on that, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question. Let us not forget Digicel and 
<br/>Vodafone are actually regulated by the RBF so there is no way they would jeopardise their licences.  
<br/>They have responded when there has been invitations for them to come and attend the taskforce, they 
<br/>have been quite transparent in terms of their explanations, and they are actively assisting the Police 
<br/>to actually try and find out the perpetrators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question.  I had alluded to 
<br/>this in one of my statements the other day. It has to do with the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.  
<br/>When  we  ratify  that  Convention,  we  partner  with  these  countries  that  are  leading  the  fight  on 
<br/>cybercrime.  Do you know if we are going to ratify, given that Treaty has gone through the whole 
<br/>process?  It came to the Standing Committee on the Foreign Affairs and Defence, and we brought it 
<br/>back to Parliament.  Do you know if we are going to ratify and sign it?  Those people who are doing 
<br/>the online scams, if you catch them, there is the Cybercrime Act in Fiji that you are going to perhaps 
<br/>use to convict them and that was put in place by the previous government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously if they are found to be guilty, 
<br/>they will be prosecuted.  At the moment the police is still doing their investigations.  On the Budapest 
<br/>Convention,  we  are  working  hard  to  actually  get  something  before  Cabinet  to  actually  ratify  the 
<br/>Convention.  There is only another piece of consultation that needs to happen with the stakeholders, 
<br/>and as soon as that happens we will be tabling it with Cabinet .  I am hoping to do that in the first 
<br/>quarter of next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification.  If the two mobile companies are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regulated by RBF, then what is Telecommunication Authority of Fiji doing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, she has been the Minister of Trade but 
<br/>probably is not familiar with the machinations.  Telecom does not operate mobile wallets, so they are 
<br/>not regulated by the RBF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They are not regulated by the RBF? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, so they are not accountable, they do not have a 
<br/>discussion point to make in the conversation about e-Bay and whatever, because that involves the 
<br/></span><span>mobile network.  It does not involve Telecom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Can  you  confirm  whether  RBF  is  regulating  these  two  mobile 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>companies?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Of course.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  It  is  very  important  to  understand,  because  I  know  there  are  many 
<br/>financial institutions which are not regulated by the RBF till now, for example, Pacific Finance is not 
<br/>regulated by RBF.  That is coming as a … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act stipulates 
<br/>very clearly who gets regulated under the financial system.  The mobile operators have to be regulated 
<br/>because they are taking deposits from the people of Fiji so they have the laws that actually regulate 
<br/>them.  Then you have the banks that have certain regulations.  In order to get the mobile wallet, they 
<br/>need to get RBF approval.  They cannot do it without RBF.  I am not sure what you learnt when you 
<br/>were there for 16 years.

<div><span>Update on Waste Management and Disposal Practices 
<br/>(Question No. 189/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on 
<br/>the current state of waste management and disposal practices in our communities that used to 
<br/>be covered by Rural Local Authorities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question raised.  Waste management in Fiji, indeed, is a critical issue. The reason why this is very 
<br/>important is because this is brought about by exacerbated rate of urban drift, population growth, the 
<br/>changes in lifestyle that have led to surge in waste generation.    The burden is particularly heavier 
<br/>on municipal councils grappling the challenges of proper solid waste management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as outlined in the Local Government Act 1972 the municipalities bear the 
<br/>responsibility for solid waste management.  However, they face a barrage of issues including illegal 
<br/>dumping, damaged communal containers and resistance to service charges.  In the rural areas, the 
<br/>disposal of solid waste is often buried or through burning.  The municipal councils were given the 
<br/>responsibility for solid waste management, Mr.  Speaker, Sir, in  extended areas a duty  previously 
<br/>overseen  by  Rural  Local  Authority  since  2018.    Despite  the  challenges,  the  Councils  are  now 
<br/>servicing 234 settlements and villages in these extended boundaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the current fiscal year 2023-2024, an allocation of $2.2 million has been designated to 
<br/>address solid waste management in the extended areas. The Ministry of Local Government has been 
<br/></span><span>providing  consistent  support  offering  government  grants  and  technical  assistance  from  JICA  to 
<br/></span><span>manage solid waste effectively.  Over the past three years, the council had collected 120.8 tonnes of 
<br/>waste in these areas with the government contributing $10.6 million towards waste disposal efforts.  
<br/>Additional  support include government  subsidies, the purchase of garbage trucks in  collaboration 
<br/>with JICA for technical assistance and the formulation of a solid waste masterplan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  pursuit  of  sustainable  practices,  councils  are  engaging  in  waste 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>segregation at source, composting green waste and assisting villages in communal heat excavation 
<br/>within the delegated areas.  This approach plays a pivotal role in extending the lifespan of landfills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To further enhance solid waste management, the Ministry in collaboration with  municipal 
<br/>councils has initiated a partnership with the Pacific Recycling Foundation to establish mini-waste 
<br/>recycling centres.  The centres situated in various locations aim to address waste issues in informal 
<br/>settlements and promote recycling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to acknowledge that councils provide waste collection services  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  informal  settlements  without  monetary  compensation  or  it  is  free  of  charge  to  the  informal 
<br/>settlements. The waste collection subsidy helps offset the cost and the councils are actively working 
<br/>to  reduce  ongoing  expenses  by  procuring  fleet  and  equipment  and  adopting  inhouse  services  to 
<br/>replace costly outsourcing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  imperative  to  highlight  that  the  Ministry  is  actively 
<br/>collaborating with esteemed developed partners like KOICA and UNDP to undertake the crucial task 
<br/>of rehabilitating specific dumpsites across Viti Levu, particularly those encroaching on the coastal 
<br/>areas.  This  is  a challenge for the Ministry right now; to  rehabilitate and even move some of the 
<br/>existing landfills and dumping sites that we currently have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry is orchestrating a collaborative effort involving key agencies such 
<br/>as the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change Unit, Ministry of Finance, UNDP and KOICA to 
<br/>spearhead the legislative reforms. These reforms are geared toward instituting  mandatory ways of 
<br/>sorting at the source and ensuring effective management at dumpsite and landfill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the formidable challenges faced, municipal councils are unwavering 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in their commitment to delivering efficient services to their delegated areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, a very simple question. In accordance or to be aligned 
<br/>with the SDGs of responsible consumption, production and sustainable citizen communities, does 
<br/>the Ministry have any future plans to  generate renewable energy and fertilisers from  the disposal 
<br/>practices of this waste for cleaner cities in Fiji, healthier soil and greener farms? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question. If you have been 
<br/>to or if you have a chance to visit Lautoka Dump Site, they now have a compost site where all the 
<br/>green waste are dumped in a particular area.  As we speak, they do collect the compost, it can be 
<br/>termed as very good manure and fertilisers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In one of my last visits to Vunato Rubbish Dump, they have even been selling the green waste 
<br/>or the compost to the public. That is something that we are also exploring right now. As part of the 
<br/>reforms that we are undertaking right now, because if you go to countries like Singapore, they are 
<br/>converting waste to energy.  So, these are some of the ways that we are reviewing right now and 
<br/>trying to ensure that when we try and resolve waste management system, we also look at the more 
<br/>effective and more climate friendly ways of disposing waste in our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  This  question  to  be  redirected  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Restoration of Levuka Heritage Site 
<br/>(Question No. 190/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts inform 
<br/></span><span>Parliament on the steps being undertaken in partnership with World Heritage Fund to restore 
<br/></span><span>the heritage sites damaged during </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016 at Levuka? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- I thank the honourable Member for the questions. I understand the town of 
<br/>Levuka has been wondering where  will they get  the assistance when they get  listed, who will be 
<br/>helping them, whether it is the Government, World Heritage or National Trust? But when I brief you 
<br/>this afternoon, you will see that World Heritage does not have that much to offer when towns are 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2235 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>listed as World Heritage Listing and also the Government does not allocate much from 2013 to-date. 
<br/>So, that must be why they were wondering as to who is there to help them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand in our last sitting we were discussing about the Heritage Bill and to help the 
<br/>people of Levuka, we need to pass the Heritage Bill.  In regards to the policy for the heritage site in 
<br/>Levuka, they can process it.  The trust be formed so that funds can be allocated to that trust and they 
<br/>can help with the restoration of those old properties in Levuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1990 Fiji became a signatory to the 1992 World Heritage Convention 
<br/>and it is eligible to apply for the World Heritage Fund.  The Fund is used for world heritage sites 
<br/>international  assistance  and  also  fund  advisory  bodies.    The  status  allows  Fiji  to  pay  the  World 
<br/>Heritage  Fund  an  annual  contribution  of  US$134.    The  Fund  is  used  for  world  heritage  sites 
<br/>international assistance and to fund advisory bodies.  The World Heritage is paid out under these 
<br/>categories: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>preparatory work up to US$30,000; 
<br/>emergency assistance up to US$75,000; and 
<br/>conservation and management assistance up to US$10,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, they can also assist with: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>technical corporations the sum of US$10,000; 
<br/>training and research, the sum of US$10,000; and  
<br/>promotion and education assistance the sum of US$30,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to report that the World Heritage Fund assisted Fiji with about US$44,500 from 
<br/>2003 to 2008 to fund the Heritage Port Town of Levuka before it was listed in 2013 as the World 
<br/>Heritage Site.  The breakdown of this Fund is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2003 - a comparative analysis study for Levuka was approved with 
<br/>given US$10,000; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>March  2004  -  the  World  Heritage  Stakeholders  Consultations  we  were  given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>US$19,500; and 
<br/>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2008 - the development of Legislative Protections for the Conservation 
<br/>of Heritage in Levuka of a management plan we were given US$15,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2016  (three  years  after  the  listing  of  Levuka  Town  as  the  World  Heritage  Site)  the 
<br/></span><span>devastating </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>hit Fiji and did not spare Levuka Town.  Mr. Speaker, UNESCO assisted 
<br/>Fiji by sending two built heritage technical experts to organise a rapid assessment report on the effects 
<br/>of </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>on Levuka.  Their response was included in the 2016 </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>post-disaster needs 
<br/>assessment report and this was completed in May 2016.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  World  Heritage  Rapid  Assessment  Report  was  presented  to  the  post-disaster  need 
<br/>assessment working group for the Culture Sector which was set up by Government.  It was the first 
<br/>time that Government had recognised the urgency to include its PDNA (a survey of cultural heritage 
<br/></span><span>resource) that was damaged during </span><span>TC Winston.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According  to  the</span><span>  TC  Winston  </span><span>PDNA  Report,  the  summary  of  the  combined  value  for  the 
<br/>damage and losses for the cultural sector in Fiji was Culture and Heritage Sector was $5.9 million, 
<br/>World Heritage Site in Levuka was $4.38 million.  A total recovery and reconstruction need for the 
<br/>cultural sector during </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>was $9.1 million.

<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the World Heritage Funding only cater for the technical corporation training 
<br/>and research assistance. However, it does not include financial assistance to restore damage to the 
<br/>Levuka Heritage structure. The timeline for the heritage funding for any purpose is from January to 
<br/>March  each  year.  As  the  deadline  for  the  submissions  was  March  2016  the  PDNA  report  was 
<br/>endorsed in May which was too late. Two months after the approval window which mean we missed 
<br/>out on that opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2017  while  there  was  an  opportunity  to  make  the  submission  to  the  World  Heritage 
<br/>however the Fiji Government decided to have a structural assessment done first for Levuka World 
<br/>Heritage structure. This was conducted between 2017 and 2018. The structural assessment was fully 
<br/>funded by the Government with the budget of $0.6 million. Based on the </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>PDNA Report 
<br/>the Government had provisions of assisting some  homeowners in the historic port of the town of 
<br/>Levuka with the urgent restoration work after </span><span>TC Winston.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to answer the honourable Member’s question the World Heritage contribution 
<br/>for </span><span>TC Winton </span><span>came in the form of two experts who conducted the rapid assessment. The previous 
<br/>Government had allocated $1.5 million for its restoration of the Levuka Community Centres Project 
<br/>from the 2023-2024 budgetary allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I understand we have overlooked the Town of Levuka for too long. We will try 
<br/>our outmost best to try and help and carry out the process to work with World Heritage and make 
<br/>sure we work with the Town of Levuka, our National Trust and the iTaukei Affairs so that we can 
<br/>move the project forward. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Yes,  honourable  Members.  We  are  probably  just  waiting  for  another
