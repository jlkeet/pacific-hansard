<h3>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of  Parliament on Tuesday, 
<br/>21st November 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  of  the  Local 
<br/>Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill of 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 21</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>November 2023. The Local Government (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Local Government 
<br/>Act of 1972, to ensure that the Local Government election procedures and processes are consistent 
<br/>with the policies and legislations relevant to elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin with the quote by Abraham Lincoln: “Democracy is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the government of the people, by the people and for the people.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Live with that now, live it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- For there to be a true democracy in our country, we must give our 
<br/>people  the  opportunity  to  be  involved  in  what  is  happening  in  their  towns  and  cities.    Citizen 
<br/>participation is a building block of democracy. As I had mentioned on Tuesday, people at the very 
<br/>level  of  society  -  nation,  provincial,  district,  city,  town  and  village  must  be  empowered  for 
<br/></span><span>governance to be fully responsive and represented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, holding the municipal elections will enhance the role of the civil society 
<br/>and improve the quality of life at grassroot level. It will nurture our future leaders, empower citizens 
<br/>to speak on the issues that are unique to different towns and cities, and it will bring to light key issues 
<br/>which need to be addressed by the Government. We do not always need to have surveys and studies 
<br/>done to find out what our people need, we can give them an opportunity to tell us directly.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a  priority  of  the  Coalition  Government  to  address  the  wastage  of 
<br/></span><span>resources and taxpayer’s money that has taken place in the previous years. If we provide a platform 
<br/></span><span>which  people  can  use  to  advocate  for  issues  that  affect  them,  we  will  be  able  to  better  allocate 
<br/>resources and taxpayers’ money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, by encouraging democratic local governance, there will be positive effects on 
<br/>our societies. It will encourage public discussions and involvement, participation in decision making, 
<br/>there will be greater focus on vulnerable groups and the environment. The development of our society

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deserves the same amount of attention that is given to economic development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we strongly believe in listening to our people, and bringing back municipal 
<br/>elections  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction.  As  mentioned  on  Tuesday,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  public 
<br/>consultation was held on the Bill and based on the outcome of this consultation, the Bill is now being 
<br/>introduced in Parliament. There were consultations with key stakeholders, the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister, Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, Ministry of 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts, and of course, the Office of the Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>provides the manner in which a candidate can stand for election to the Council, and the qualifications

<br/>disqualification of a candidate after he or she has been nominated for election.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2267 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 16 revokes the Local Government (Election) Regulations of 1972. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable members, the floor is now open for debate, and I have before 
<br/>me a list of four names, two from each side provided by the Whips and the batting will be led off by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  world  is  moving  with  time,  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is stuck in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What I call a colonial hangover.  They need to overcome that, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, words ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- …were created during the Colonial days for rubbish collection. The 
<br/>Bill  before  us  is  taking  us  backwards.    Why  can  we  not  use  the  municipality  boundary  for  each 
<br/>council or town as one single electoral boundary rather than dividing into wards and little pieces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is merit in moving away from wards to a single electoral boundary, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>A single electoral boundary can encourage elected officials or councillors to consider the interest of 
<br/>the entire community residing in that municipality rather than advocating the interest of their specific 
<br/>wards  at  the  expense  of  the  broader  community.    A  single  boundary  can  contribute  to  better 
<br/>distribution and policy development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, including comprehensive, urban planning and 
<br/>sustainable development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unified approach will allow the growth of the municipality and it will 
<br/>reduce the complexity of managing a municipality.  A unified approach is very much in line with our 
<br/>National Electoral System. Single electoral boundary was already practiced by the three Municipal 
<br/>Councils in the past. These Municipalities operated with no ward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2007, we saw how Municipal Councils operated where the number of councillors did not 
<br/>match the number of wards. For example, Suva City Council had five wards with 20 Councillors 
<br/>while Lami had 12 Counsellors with two wards. How far is Lami from Suva City Council?  Should 
<br/></span><span>Lami be amalgamated with Suva? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nausori Town Council had 12 Councillors overseeing over 46,000 people.  
<br/>Labasa had 12 Councillors for its only 27,000 people and Tavua which is basically penniless, had 
<br/>nine Councillors to represent 2,500 citizens.   The total number of elected councillors in 30 Municipal 
<br/>Councils were 159 - bigger than the Parliament of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>
<div><span>2268 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministries, statutory bodies provide majority of the services whether it is education, health or 
<br/>a transport system, et cetera.  What services do Municipal Councils provide?  Garbage collection and 
<br/>drain cleaning.  Even roads are taken away.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want, and I urge the other side to 
<br/>think properly of how the Municipalities are evolving over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister whether the boundary extension 
<br/>exercise by the Municipal Councils is complete, which was being undertaken under the guidance of 
<br/>the Local Government Committee?  Areas outside municipal boundaries have become satellite towns, 
<br/>but it is not part of the municipality.  A good example is Cuvu, which is not part of Sigatoka.  Have 
<br/>you look at all that?  How will the boundary and city councils treat Rural Local Authority?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, have we incorporated Rural Local Authority boundaries and are they going 
<br/>to be part of the voting system or the election that the Government is talking about?  We are not too 
<br/>far away from New Zealand, the least they can do (they often travel to New Zealand) is learn from 
<br/>New  Zealand  on  how  they  have  progressed  with  the  election  system,  as  well  as  developing  its 
<br/>municipality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  extremely  important  to  note  that  Auckland  Council,  in  2010,  was  established  by 
<br/>dissolving four City Councils and three District Councils.  Why was that done?  It was done to reduce 
<br/>the administrative  cost  and to  focus on the development  of  a unified city for better planning and 
<br/>development, and above all, pooling resources to provide those services in a more structured manner.  
<br/>So, look at Auckland Council at this stage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the population of Fiji, it is just less than one million and we have 13 municipal 
<br/>councils.   They are councils which are very small  like Tavua and Rakiraki.   That  is why we had 
<br/>appointed a single CEO to look after both the municipalities, because the intention was to amalgamate 
<br/>them.  It was not making sense.  If you have these counsellors, there is an overhead cost in running 
<br/>the municipality, and what we wanted was more resources to go into developing the place rather than 
<br/>simply money being wasted in the overhead cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You had been in a dictatorship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  It  is  not  dictatorship,  thank  you,  it  is  about  modernising  the 
<br/>municipality.  That is why we are saying, they live in the past.  That is what they know, that is what 
<br/>has been left by our colonial governance.  That is what they left, and that is what they are continuing 
<br/>with.  They are not moving with time, and that is the sad part of this Coalition Government.  What 
<br/></span><span>they know is where they left, the clock stopped there.  When they came back, now they want to go 
<br/></span><span>back to that time piece.  That is what they are doing, they are not moving with time.  We are simply 
<br/>urging for the interest of the ratepayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, democracy is not, that we never said there will be no election, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thank you.  It was all about making sure that we are able to come up with better reforms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the reforms, let me just remind them to go back and read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> (if you really 
<br/></span><span>want to know), where I delivered the Ministerial Statement, and the work had already progressed in 
<br/>that direction.  We had completed the review of the Town Planning Act, we had completed the review 
<br/>of the Subdivision Act and the honourable Minister, if he is honest enough, should admit that even 
<br/>the terms of reference was developed for us to go in this direction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Bill to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2269 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amend the Local Government Act.  The Bill before Parliament is about restoring basic democracy to 
<br/>all the 13 municipal councils.  As the Minister for Housing and Local Government, this Bill holds 
<br/>more than initiative certificates.  It represents a profound commitment to our nation and our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed amendment aims to pave the way for a fair and inclusive Local Government 
<br/>Election, a cornerstone of our democratic values.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for long 18 years, the ratepayers 
<br/>and  residents  of  13  municipalities  had  been  deprived  of  the  basic  democratic  right  to  elect  their 
<br/>representatives in the administration of their councils.  It is far, far too long.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  underscore  the  dedication  of  our  Coalition  Government  to  the 
<br/>principles of democracy and the empowerment of our citizens.  We firmly believe that the power to 
<br/>elect representatives should rest in the hands of the very individuals residing in the municipalities 
<br/>and communities.  Furthermore, our Coalition Government has fulfilled its promises to the people in 
<br/>reinstating the Local Government Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill present before the august Parliament, stands as a compelling pathway to a fair and 
<br/>just  Local  Government  Election.    The  coming  Local  Government  Election  symbolises  this 
<br/>commitment  and  we  are  resilient  in  ensuring  a  transparent  and  fair  electoral  process.    The  Bill 
<br/>presented before this august Parliament today, sets the wheels in motion for an election that echoes 
<br/>the democratic aspirations of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Local Government Election stands, not just as a democratic exercise but as a beacon of 
<br/>hope for our communities, potential catalysts for significant positive change. the decisions made at 
<br/>the local level resonates directly in the daily lives of our citizens impacting their livelihood enforcing 
<br/>grassroot economic development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the proposed amendments to the Local Government Act aims at 
<br/>modernising and improving the legislative framework aligning it with international best practices. 
<br/>These  changes  born  out  of  extensive  consultations  with  residents,  stakeholders,  political  parties, 
<br/>media and civil society organisation and reflect our dedication embracing the democratic levels ideals 
<br/>of participation and inclusiveness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  prolonged  absence  of  elected  councillors  over  the  past  15  years  has  impacted  the 
<br/>functions of the councils. Create independencies on national budget for project and operations. With 
<br/>this amendment we aim to break three from this side, Mr. Speaker, returning decision making power 
<br/>to the rightfully representatives chosen by the people.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Councils become 
<br/></span><span>complacent to collect rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today we have a huge arrears problem. The last Council Elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was 
<br/>held in 2005. The Councillors term expiring in 2008. From 2009 all Councils have been managed 
<br/>under the supervision of Special Administrators by virtue of section 9 of the Local Government Act 
<br/>which we are revoking through this amendment.  The last 18 years have created spiral events that 
<br/>have completely eroded the essence of democratic decision-making in Councils which will change 
<br/>for the better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  the  privilege  of  participating  in  extensive  consultations  where 
<br/></span><span>residents  actively  contributed  to  the  manual  process.  Their  passion  and  enthusiasm  reaffirm  the 
<br/>importance of giving them a voice in local governance decisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, these amendments are not just legal adjustments, they are a 
<br/>commitment  to  restoring  democratic  decision-making  at  the  Council  level.  The  Coalition 
<br/>Government firmly believes that this Election will charter the course towards a bright future and that

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one has to be able to put with all the heat that comes to

<div><span>you. So, I hope honourable Kamikamica will take note of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last speaker said that we have waited for 16 years and now we will have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the …

<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Get your facts right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- …Municipal Elections I want to ask the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why you have sidelined the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> from Municipal Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I want to ask the honourable Attorney-General. Why you have sidelined 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> from the operations of Municipal Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You need to answer this. You people are coming here shouting, dancing, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everything for the iTaukei and here in this amendment, you people have taken their rights away.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do not laugh.  It is not a laughing matter.  I am asking you.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I wish to contribute to the motion that is before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment will take away my rights as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hogwash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … to contest the municipal election if this amendment is passed.  You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know nothing and that is why you are saying all sorts of things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two sides of the coin, looks like they have only seen one side of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the coin and that is to deprive our rights as the ratepayer of respective municipalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- </span><span>Ahre! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What  do you mean  </span><span>ahre</span><span>, Members of Parliament are not  allowed?   I 
<br/>think you have not read, that could be one reason.  The other reason could be, you have not discussed 
<br/>in the Cabinet that is why you are not aware.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2271 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendment to section 9(2) seems not necessary as the Local 
<br/>Government Election Regulation section 2 that the election commission shall consult the Minister 
<br/>for such purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Local Government Act (Amendment) Bill propose that section 9(3) of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Act be amended by inserting  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- The obvious correction in 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I think he want something from me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That the councillors shall hold office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please keep that to yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- But privately, I will share with you Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Local Government Act (Amendment) Bill proposes that section 9(3) of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Act be  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It is my humble plea that after the session call me in your office and talk 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to you, please.  That is my plea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Plagiarism Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The Local Government (Amendment) Bill proposes that section 9(3) of 
<br/>the Act be amended by inserting: “That the councillors shall hold office for a period of three years 
<br/>so such terms  and condition as the Minister may deem fit.”  All these years, they come here and 
<br/>harping on that the Ministers are controlling all the municipalities.

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I do not want to talk to you, you are useless.  This defeats the whole .… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Check the </span><span>Hansard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  You are useless.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this defeats the whole purpose of 
<br/>holding elections as elected councillors shall  be working on the terms of the Minister.  The Local 
<br/>Government  Act  (these  people  must  know)  is  the  framework  of  operation  and  now  under  this 
<br/></span><span>amendment, the Minister will have legal powers to dictate to the Council, where is the autonomy that 
<br/></span><span>you all have been harping about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment to section 9(a) is not necessary as it has nothing to do with 
<br/>calling  municipal  elections.  Furthermore,  the  replacement  of  section  10  through  deleting  and 
<br/>inserting needs further attention.  Section 10(1) states that a candidate shall be nominated by a party 
<br/>to stand as an independent seems not necessary.  In prior elections, through the regulations,

<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>candidates have used political party symbols or independent symbols and, in this amendment, the 
<br/>ratepayers’ association or the landowner and citizen association are being denied of their rights.  They 
<br/>cannot  form  landowners’  association  or  ratepayers’  association.    These  are  all  his  doing  –  being 
<br/>denied of their right Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In previous elections Mr. Speaker, Sir, the landowners used to have their own candidates in 
<br/>their  respective  municipalities.    Let  me  repeat,  reminded  by  my  colleague  here  that  in  previous 
<br/>elections, the landowners used to have their own candidates in their respective municipalities.  This 
<br/>message is very clear to the </span><span>mataqalis</span><span> that this Government has removed their rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  some  districts,  the  ratepayers  do  not  want  politics  and  they  have  the 
<br/>freedom to appoint or sponsor their candidates, and Councils like Tavua, Savusavu, these people, 
<br/>they  never  had  this  politics.  They  had  the  association,  you  should  have  consulted  me,  that  is  the 
<br/>problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You did not win the Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The qualifications of candidates standing requires review. The removal 
<br/>of the Members of Parliament is not in the interest of democracy. The Drafting team should have 
<br/>referred to the High Court Judgement of 17(2005), and 10.10 of 1997. Section 10(3) states “that the 
<br/>total of the number of candidates nominated by a Political Party, to number equally, to the ward. The 
<br/>number also requires a review, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Political Parties shall be allowed to fill candidates to the number that they feel fit and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proper, and then there should be a provision for dummy candidates. Those were all past practice.   
<br/>They removed all those things, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  …and provision to withdraw… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The bell has rung. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was hoping to give a speech, or give my response 
<br/>to inspire, but I have to respond to some of the mud that has been thrown from the other side. Let me 
<br/>just remind, honourable Bala.  Honourable Kumar said, “go back and read the </span><span>Daily Hansard”</span><span>, we 
<br/>did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bala, in 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, what about the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- …he promised…

<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-... talk about… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- …in 2014, he promised Local Government Elections. He promised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Government Elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- In Parliament and to the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Lasu, lasu</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Myself, </span><span>qo sa oti</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He is the former Miniser for no elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is his legacy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- And let me remind him, he is standing and defending his position 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because he was ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Khalas</span><span>!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA- ...appointed as an Administrator in the Lautoka City Council. He is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>defending his position, he was not elected, chosen by the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Myself not ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He was elected, he was appointed by an illegal regime, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are appointed by a legal regime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Let  me  remind  him  and  honourable  Sharma,  the  People’s 
<br/>Government is keeping its promise and coming for Local Government Elections. That is the People’s 
<br/>Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kumar promised a review of legislation and bring it to 
<br/>the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Where?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> Nov., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Honourable Kumar is the former Minister, but did it happen? No! So 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>neither former Ministers ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  ...delivered  on  their  promises.  But  here  we  are  bringing  a  Bill, 
<br/>reviewing the Law, and we are about to pass it, that is keeping our promises. That is keeping our 
<br/>promises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They just cannot deal with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Under the Special 
<br/>Administrators, let us just go back in time, since honourable Kumar is accusing us of going back in 
<br/>time, let us go back in time. Under Special Administrators, Shirley Park was giving to P Meghji. JC’s 
<br/>Park was given to North Pole Hotel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Part of Churchill Park was given to Tappoos.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  A  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  The  honourable  Minister  is 
<br/>misleading this Parliament. She said, “that Lautoka City Council gave away Shirley Park to P Meghji. 
<br/>There was a process. Not aye! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There was a process and they were the successful bidder, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, they did not consult the voters or the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ratepayers of Lautoka Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  You  did  not  consult  the  ratepayers.  That  is  the  difference.  The 
<br/>difference between that side and this side. We will now have the ratepayers vote for their leaders and 
<br/>make decisions in the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is why you are being put there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Part  of  Churchill  Park  was  given  to  Tappoos.  Again,  transferred 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without consultation of the ratepayers, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Talking too much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- And what happened to the swimming pool in Lautoka?

<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2275 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Took too long, and cost too much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That, we have to pick up. Govind Park, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rest my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the point we are making here, it is the need 
<br/>for  ratepayers  to  determine.    In  all  modern  democracies,  they  have  Local  Government  Elections.  
<br/>Talking about modernisation or coming into the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century, they are electing their leaders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will get now to what I really wanted to share, and that is the importance 
<br/>of women participating in Local Government Elections.  It is not just a matter of gender equality, it 
<br/>is about enriching the equality of our democracy.  I am very honoured to be part of Commonwealth 
<br/>Women Parliamentarians, which comprises of… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Please, remove you from there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…  women  Members  of  Parliament  in  this  Chamber  who  are  dedicated  and  committed  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increasing the participation of women in the Local Government Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite all political parties, please, ensure that you remove the barriers for 
<br/>women candidates to participate in the Local Government Elections.  You have your voluntary quota 
<br/>system, constitutions, some 20 percent, some 30 percent,  and some do not  have it, but please, do 
<br/>encourage your women to step up.  I call on all our fellow Fijians, please embrace the importance of 
<br/>women’s leadership, and the need for us to stand up in support of gender equality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Fiji Country Gender Assessment, it presents a compelling reality.  Sir, 
<br/>81  percent  of  Fijians  agree  that  women  are  underrepresented  in  our  nation.    Furthermore,  a 
<br/>remarkable 72 percent of Fijians believe it would be better for our country if there were more women 
<br/></span><span>in  leadership  roles  and  actively  contributing  to  decision  making  processes  across  politics  and 
<br/></span><span>governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Ministry  is  collaborating  with  the  Ministry  for  Local  Government,  and  I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  the  work  we  are  doing  together  and  that  we  are  engaging  our  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders, civil  society organisations and we  are hoping  to  foster an  enabling environment  for 
<br/>women’s active political participation in the Local Government Elections.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister for Women, honourable Sashi Kiran who is already working in communities with 
<br/>the  Republican  Institute  (RI)  funded  by  USAID,  already  engaging  our  women  on  local  level  to 
<br/></span><span>participate in Local Government Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  really  excited  about  having  our  women  participate  in  Local 
<br/>Government  Elections.    It  is  my  plea  to  all  Fijian  women,  please,  step  up  and  engage  in  Local 
<br/>Government Elections.  We are usually the ones that when we go around to the communities, they 
<br/>appeal in these meetings about road humps on roads that where speeding is happening too often, the 
<br/>need for streetlights and footpaths and the need for improved crossings, and also to keep their children

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and family safe and the need for more bus shelters.  These are issues that women usually raise in the 
<br/>communities, and we have got to listen to them and help them to step up and become leaders in their 
<br/>municipalities.  I am really disappointed with the noise coming from the other side, that they are not 
<br/>showing respect for the appeal to women.  Come on, show your respect for the appeal for women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it behoves me that the honourable Minister of no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>election had the audacity… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- ...to come and ask things that are already in the Act.  That is why it 
<br/>is so dangerous, when you try to read the law when you are not a lawyer.    Let me go to section 125 
<br/>of  the  Local  Government  Act,  which  includes  villages.    The  villages  that  are  located  in  the 
<br/>municipalities can participate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It is the village.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- You can hold the book but you may not know what is inside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If may, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the village under the iTaukei Affairs Board that can participate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what this Government has done, interestingly they have raised the issue of iTaukei</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA.- Now they are worried about the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Where was the issue of</span><span> iTaukei</span><span> in the last 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You have taken the right away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That is what we have done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  And more importantly is bringing the freedom.  We have listened, 
<br/>there is a massive consultation. Listen, incorporate and they have to go by standards as set by the 
<br/>FEO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Kumar was referring to going back. They must go, according to the statistics.  
<br/>The problem is, because previously during honourable Bala’s time, they formed into groups only to 
<br/>prepare for the Local Government. After the Local Government’s done, there is nothing there.    Now 
<br/>there are standards, they have to comply. They must come through by way of political parties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am indeed honoured, as part of the Coalition Government bringing these
