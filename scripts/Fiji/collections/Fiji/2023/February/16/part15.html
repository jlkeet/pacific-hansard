<div><span>Monday 27</span><span>th</span><span> – Friday 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this sitting calendar will allow all the six Standing Committees to continue with 
<br/>their work on the Annual Reports that are currently pending with the Committees and Bills that may 
<br/>be moved in this Parliament for consideration.  It is for this reason also that all honourable Members 
<br/>must support this proposed sitting calendar.  With the proposed straight two weeks sitting, unlike the 
<br/>previous two terms in Parliament, it is envisaged that there will be more time for debate on matters 
<br/>before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also pertinent to note that the Committees are our essential mechanisms 
<br/>through  which  Parliament  is  able  to  reach  out  to  members  of  the  public.    They  are  essential 
<br/>mechanisms  in  terms  of  accountability  and  scrutiny,  therefore,  it  is  viable  to  allow  them  time  to 
<br/>undertake their work, which this proposed sitting calendar allows. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the new Government and positive changes have been proposed to 
<br/>ensure  that  services  to  the  people  are  improved.    With  this  proposed  sitting  calendar,  both  the 
<br/>Government  and  the  Opposition  will  be  able  to  execute  and  implement  its  plans,  policies  and 
<br/></span><span>programmes, and the Standing Committees undertake and discharge their functions mandated in the 
<br/></span><span>Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is in this  respect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the proposed sitting calendar before Parliament be 
<br/>supported by all honourable Members, as it is one that will greatly ensure that the Fijian Parliament 
<br/></span><span>will continue to undertake its legislative, representative and oversight functions.

<div><span>2023 Calendar of Parliament Sittings  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this motion to Parliament, and I hereby seek support from all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members to approve the proposed sitting calendar for the year 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Opposition has no issues with the 2023 
<br/>sitting calendar, I would like to bring to the attention of this august Parliament on what transpired in 
<br/>the Business Committee, especially with regards to the date, 28</span><span>th</span><span> March.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, you were the Chairman, it was discussed, and I believe the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>was also there, that 28</span><span>th</span><span> March is going to be a sitting day.  Cabinet was supposed to be held after the 
<br/>Parliament sitting.  But as we see in the calendar and as confirmed by the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Government in Parliament, that 28</span><span>th</span><span> is going to be a Cabinet sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We would like to emphasise to this Parliament that Members are sitting in Cabinet because 
<br/>they are in Parliament, so Parliament should take precedence over Cabinet meetings.  That was what 
<br/>we emphasised, there was a healthy discussion and the Business Committee agreed that it was going 
<br/>to be a full week sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the decision was changed, we were not aware of it.  We were not informed that on 28</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>March, we are not going to have a sitting.  Government is talking about bipartisan, Government is 
<br/>approaching Opposition to work together but this unilateral approach and changing the decision of 
<br/>the Business Committee is not on.  While I say that we do agree with the calendar, however I request 
<br/>Government to adhere what was discussed and approved in the Business Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Member.    My  reply  to  that  since  I  Chaired  the 
<br/>meeting, after some lengthy discussions, honourable Members, the Government agreed that the full 
<br/>week will be taken up, but since Cabinet sits on the Tuesday, the Committees will continue in their 
<br/>respective committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief.    I  think  you  are 
<br/>absolutely  right;  my  recollection  is  the  same.    We  had  agreed  that  Tuesday,  if  there  is  a  Cabinet 
<br/>meeting, we will have a Cabinet meeting and that day will be devoted to parliamentary Committees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One other point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, in case honourable Members on the other side, 
<br/>especially  honourable  Maharaj  forgets,  for  eight  years,  we  have  never  had  two  weeks’  sitting.  
<br/>Essentially, we had one week per month, so if you look at the calendar, you are actually having more 
<br/>parliamentary sitting days than when you were in Government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, what we are offering, Mr. Speaker, is more parliamentary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You’re overloading the Standing Committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is not overloading - unlike the previous Government, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would bring Bills in the morning and debate it in the afternoon and pass the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is not the point we are discussing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The point I am making - you are not listening, this is your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Calendar of Parliament Sittings  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trouble. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The point we are making is, there is more sitting days at a time 
<br/>in a month. So, even if we do not have a sitting on a Tuesday, we still have more days in a month, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, that is precisely the point we are making.  There will be more sitting days than what it 
<br/>was there.  So, I support the decision that we took at the Business Committee, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a brief contribution to the discussion. I am glad 
<br/>that  finally  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  National  Federation  Party  has  deemed  it  proper  that  he 
<br/>should attend the Business Committee, so congratulation, Sir, for finally making it to the Business 
<br/>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We come here in  this  Parliament to  serve the people, we serve in  the Committees for the 
<br/>benefit of the people of this country. When we are called, we go to those Committees, we do our duty 
<br/>to this Parliament and to the people that elected us to be here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, my understanding of the number of weeks that we have had in the past years of 
<br/>Parliament and this one is exactly the same, only in this case we are doubling up on some months 
<br/>and leaving the others without a week, so the total number of weeks would still be the same. So, I 
<br/>thought I would just add that clarification. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, has supported the calendar but the only question he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had was on the Tuesday, so that has been sorted out, honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there is no other honourable Member who intends to speak on the motion, then I shall call 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I just want to add the comments in the Right of Reply…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He did not catch my notice when he was trying to raise his hand. So, please, 
<br/>honourable Members, try and catch my attention.  If I am not looking your way, could you, kind-of, 
<br/>give us a gesture that you need to speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I need more white hair, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, just a clarification, it is not contentious, we just needed to 
<br/>get some clarity on the issue of whether Parliament takes precedent or  Cabinet takes precedent, that 
<br/>is all. It is just a clarification from you, which takes precedence? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The clarification from me, honourable Koya and honourable Members is 
<br/></span><span>that, we had agreed that on the Tuesday, Committees will continue and Cabinet sits on that Tuesday.  
<br/>The following days, it goes back to Parliamentary sitting. That is how the calendar has been marked 
<br/>out.  So, I hope that clarifies the issues raised.  I do not have any other comment to make on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  may,  that  is  understood.    Everyone  just  really 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wanted to know whether this is a one-off or is it always going to be a case of Cabinet taking 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FDB  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>precedence over on a Tuesday because we had been informed rightfully that there are two Cabinet 
<br/>sittings per month, if I am correct.  Therefore, we just wanted some clarity; is this just a singular 
<br/>precedent,  or  this  is  going  to  be  followed  always  -  that  Cabinet  will  be  taking  precedence  over 
<br/>Parliament on Tuesdays?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- For the time being, honourable Koya, that is how it stands, so we will just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>take it from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulitavu, I think I have just allowed honourable Koya to say his bit when I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already asked the Leader of the Government in Parliament to make her reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification on that because…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- How many more clarifications do you need? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are we are speaking in what?  Let us continue, let us move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
