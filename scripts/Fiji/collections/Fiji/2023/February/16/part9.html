<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Minutes of the sitting of Parliament held on Wednesday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023, as previously circulated, be taken as read and be confirmed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- There being opposition, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- A   Point  of  Order,  Sir,  arising    from  the  Minutes  of 
<br/>yesterday, that is, the agenda of the Order Paper today.  I think it would be most early for 
<br/>me  to  raise  it  now  on  a  statement  that  was  uttered  on  the  floor.    Before  the  Minutes  is 
<br/>approved and before Parliament is given another seven days for the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>to be 
<br/>edited as per Standing Orders on a statement that was made by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Government in Parliament yesterday in response to honourable Premila Kumar in terms 
<br/>of referring to her statement that was trying to show some seeds of division in the past, 
<br/>referring to the ideologies from the other side always referring to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister on the 1987 </span><span>coup </span><span>in terms of the rape that was done to Indo-Fijian women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that there is a blatant lie because even the head of the Women Crisis Centre is 
<br/>on record that there were complaints received in terms of those events that happened in the 
<br/>past.  She cannot re-track and withdraw those statements because the Standing Orders does 
<br/>not allow that, only grammatical errors can be altered in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.  Just to put it 
<br/>on record, Sir, that it is incorrect.  The </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>is to be marked red because of her 
<br/>statement that is unbecoming of the Leader of the Government in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have given leeway to honourable Bulitavu 
<br/>to make his objection and read it out to us as well.  But, again, that is just a process on the 
<br/>Confirmation of Minutes.  He is also asking that it be expunged and as such, the seven days 
<br/>is still very much in the process here of the Minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that the seven days is still up when the corrected version are corrected, but as 
<br/>you have just mentioned also, honourable Bulitavu, that you just want this to be noted, we 
<br/>will take note, and we will move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
