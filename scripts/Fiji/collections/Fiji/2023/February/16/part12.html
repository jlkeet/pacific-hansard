<div><span> HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Parliament adopts the Sitting Calendar for the year 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- As all honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are aware, Standing Order 22(1) stipulates that, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Business Committee must recommend to Parliament a programme of sitting 
<br/>periods  for  each  session  of  Parliament  or  each  12-month  sitting  period  of  Parliament, 
<br/>whichever is the shorter.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It further provides in Standing Order 22(2), and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The recommended programme must be presented to Parliament no later than the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>third sitting day of the session…”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, Mr. Speaker, the Business Committee convened and undertook discussions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on a proposed sitting calendar for the year 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  can  confirm  that  the  Business  Committee  agreed  and  approved  the  sitting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>calendar for the year 2023 which was circulated to all honourable Members this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are also mindful of unforeseen circumstances and, therefore, should there be 
<br/>any  imminent  need  to  readjust  some  of  the  sittings,  that  this  would  be  subsequently  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament.   Sir, this is to primarily allow some flexibility and as most honourable Members may be 
<br/>aware, this has been the accepted practice in the last two terms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this  juncture, Mr. Speaker,  I wish to  put  on record that  there were healthy discussions 
<br/></span><span>during the Business Committee meeting on this matter, but I can confirm that the matter was resolved.  
<br/>I, therefore, plead with all honourable Members to support and approve the proposed sitting calendar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the benefit of all honourable Members, as well as the general public at large, the endorsed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting calendar outlines the following sitting periods:
