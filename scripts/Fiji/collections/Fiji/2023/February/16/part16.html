<h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE - FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK</h3>
<div><span>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE - FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the purposes of Section 145(1) of the 
<br/>Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Parliament approves - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the Government guarantee for the Fiji Development Bank borrowings for the 12-month 
<br/>period from 1</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 to 28</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2024, through the issuance of short and long-
<br/>term Bonds, promissory notes, any Reserve Bank of Fiji financing facility and other short-
<br/>term borrowings; 
<br/>that the Government guarantee for a sum of FJ$150 million for the guarantee period; and  
<br/>that the Bank pay a guarantee fee of 0.075 percent on the cumulative utilised guarantee 
<br/>credit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to  make an introductory remark, we 
<br/>informed the Business Committee very clearly that there will be a motion on Government guarantee, 
<br/>unlike in the past where we were just told that there will be a motion, and we did not know until we 
<br/></span><span>came into Parliament.  This motion was well publicised, so I am hoping that honourable Members 
<br/></span><span>on both sides of Parliament would have had enough time to understand what is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  by  way  of  background,  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB)  was 
<br/>established under the Fiji Development Bank Act 1966 and opened for business on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, 1967.  
<br/>Pursuant to section 5 of the Fiji Development Bank Act 1966, the function of the Bank is to facilitate 
<br/>and stimulate the promotion and development of natural resources, transportation and other</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>251 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>industries and enterprises in Fiji, and in the discharge of its functions, the Bank shall give special 
<br/>consideration and priority to the economic development of the rural and agricultural sectors of the 
<br/>economy.  That is a very, very important statement out of the Act, Mr. Speaker.  The Bank, later on, 
<br/>came under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) and that was since 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 
<br/>2019, and as agreed, it provides a six-monthly report to the Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the discharge of its functions, the Bank, in accordance with section 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16(1) of the Fiji Development Bank Act 1966, provides, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “The Bank may from time to time, with the consent of the Minister responsible for 
<br/>finance, borrow such sums as are required by it to meet any of its obligations, discharge 
<br/>any of its  functions provide necessary working  capital,  and the Bank may with  the like 
<br/>consent - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a) 
<br/>(b)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue and sell bonds and debentures; and  
<br/>issue promissory notes, certificates of deposits and other instruments, acknowledging 
<br/>or evidencing a borrowing or the terms of borrowing.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Section 16(3) of the Fiji Development Bank Act 1966states that the repayment 
<br/>of any sums borrowed under the provisions of this section and the payment of interest thereon may 
<br/>be guaranteed by the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members who had been here before would understand this but 
<br/>for  the  benefit  of  those  who  are  new,  I  need  to  state  that  as  required  under  section  62(1)  of  the 
<br/>Financial Management Act 2004, it states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “Subject to any other Act, the Government may guarantee the financial liability of 
<br/>an entity in respect of a loan or otherwise, but only if the giving of the guarantee is approved 
<br/>by Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, the 2023 Guarantee request from the Bank will: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enable continued facilitation of Government’s policy by lending to essential sectors of the 
<br/>economy and as have I pointed out, mainly resource-based sectors, including agriculture, 
<br/>mining and quarrying, manufacturing, transport, communications, et cetera.  
<br/>ensure that the Bank lends to the resource-based sector that will assist in the development 
<br/>of the agricultural sector and assist in the development of the Fijian economy in the long 
<br/>run. 
<br/>ensure that the Bank’s borrowings are guaranteed by the Government, therefore, reducing 
<br/>perceived risks associated with such borrowings. This will make the Bank’s instruments 
<br/>more attractive to investors and should reduce the cost of borrowing for the Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Bank’s lending portfolio, the Bank’s audited financial statement as 
<br/>at 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2022 recorded a cumulative total loan portfolio of $629.04 million, which represents 
<br/>about 7,340 accounts of $340.60 million in the focussed sector and 1,186 accounts of $288.44 million 
<br/></span><span>in the non-focussed sector, compared to $618.8 million in 2021 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  difference  between  the  focussed  and  the  non-focussed  sector  is 
<br/>important.  Perhaps, when some of us were sitting on the other side and when we had bank guarantees, 
<br/>we had concerns about the balance between the focussed sector and the non-focussed sector.  So, 
<br/>while  we  are  looking  at  the  actual  account  numbers  in  the  focussed  sector  which  shows  that  the 
<br/>number is quite big but the actual value of the loan is $340.60 million and $288.44 million in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div>
<div><span>252 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FDB  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>non-focussed sector, in terms of the number of accounts, that number of loans for the non-focussed 
<br/>sector is 14 percent to 16 percent, so the actual amount that is loaned is almost about 45 percent.  So, 
<br/>that is an important consideration for discussion by the Bank and perhaps, the new Board when it is 
<br/>looking at the balance between the focussed sector and the non-focussed sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Bank’s financial position, Mr. Speaker, at the end of the 2022 financial year, the Bank 
<br/>recorded a consolidated profit of $1.79 million.  It showed an increase by 78 percent when compared 
<br/>to the same period last year which was $1million, attributed to the decline in the interest on expenses 
<br/>and allowances for interest and fees.  The total asset base stood at $626 million in 2022 -  an increase 
<br/>by  3.1  percent  when  compared  to  $607.5  million  in  2021,  while  total  liabilities  also  increased  to 
<br/>$449.9 million an increase by 3.9 percent when compared to $433 million in 2021.  So, with the 
<br/>increase in total assets, Mr. Speaker, total shareholders’ equity also increased by 1 percent to $176.4 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Bank’s borrowing forecast is also important to provide that information. The 
<br/>Bank’s  total  forecasted  outlay  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  March,  2023  to  28</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2024,  which  includes  the 
<br/>proposed 2023 guarantee period, amounts to $211.3 million as opposed to $252.3 million from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>March, 2022 to 28</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.  Again, that is the 2022 guarantee period.  So, given that the 
<br/>Bank’s  forecasted  inflow  is  only  $61.3  million  during  the  proposed  guarantee  period,  the  Bank 
<br/>requires an additional $150 million to finance its total outlay of $211.3 million.  That is the reason 
<br/>why the additional $115 million is proposed to be raised through the issuance of bonds, promissory 
<br/>notes, short-term borrowings and any RBF financing facility and term deposits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  that  is  the  basis  for  the  guarantee  that  we  are  requesting.  We  also  have  to 
<br/>provide, while moving guarantee motions, situation with respect to the total Government guarantee 
<br/>debt and contingent liability.  So, as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2022, the total Government guarantee debt 
<br/>stood at $1.1 billion or 9.5 percent of GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accessing  the  $150  million  guarantee  by  the  Bank  will  increase  the  total  Government 
<br/>guarantee exposure to $1.3 billion or 10.7 percent of GDP.   What that means, Mr. Speaker, is in the 
<br/>event of the default by the Bank, the Government will be liable for the utilised guarantee borrowing 
<br/>of the Bank.  In the past years, we all know and honourable Members on the other side will also 
<br/>know, that the Bank has never called on the Government to honour its guarantee.  However, the Bank 
<br/>continues to pay the guarantee promptly upon the utilisation of the guarantees.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One important point, Mr. Speaker, is that we are always asking, and I think a more strategic 
<br/>focus of the new Board and the new Government will be to work with FDB to strengthen its reach in 
<br/>the Agriculture Sector because we still feel that the original intention of setting up the Bank can be 
<br/>enhanced more.  That is an important consideration for the new Board and I think as Government, 
<br/>we would like the Bank to focus more on the focussed sector.  I think the CEO and the new Board of 
<br/>the Bank understand that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) which are loans in which 
<br/>the borrower is at default and has not made any scheduled payments of either interest or principal, 
<br/>for some time, they categorise NPLs by banks.  Normally, international standard varies from country 
<br/></span><span>to country.  The rate for NPLs is between 5 percent to 7 percent, but with respect to the FDB, the 
<br/></span><span>NPL for the Bank stood at $152.31 million as at the end of 2022.  In 2021, it was $162.98 million 
<br/>which is equivalent to 24.2 percent and 36.34 percent in 2021.  There was an improvement from 26 
<br/>percent to 24 percent in 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We could explain the high NPL in 2020 to 2022 but even in 2017 to 2019, the NPLs were 
<br/>still high.  For example, in 2017, it was 21.6 percent; in 2018, it was 17 percent; and 2019 it was 16.5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FDB  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  can  see  improvements  being  made  and  as  I  have  said,  the  Bank 
<br/>understands these things very well and I do not see any problem in going forward.  I know that the 
<br/>Bank has put in strategies to ensure that these NPLs will see a reduction over the next few years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I commend the motion to Parliament. Let me also say 
<br/>that when we were sitting on the other side, we raised a number of questions every time there was an 
<br/>FDB government guarantee motion but from my recollection, we never opposed the FDB guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- See the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D TABUYA.- But we supported it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I commend the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have two Members from the Opposition and two Members as well from Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to speak on the 
<br/>motion before Parliament.  Let me say that we support the motion because it is important for the 
<br/>country and for the good of all those who benefit from the services provided by the Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank (FDB).  I am glad that the honourable Minister is learning and perhaps, he needs to realise the 
<br/>fact that he is now in Government and he is in control.  Stop referring to the practices of the past 
<br/>because, Mr. Speaker, the very words that he uttered here in the past is haunting him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, let me just remind Government (as I have stated they are 
<br/>now in control) that we know some of the issues are concerning the conduct of some of the executives 
<br/>and on that as well, perhaps some of the elites and those who are aligned to politicians and political 
<br/>parties we cannot deny that.  We all know the history that the FDB went through and, therefore, we, 
<br/>on this side of Parliament, would like to urge Government to be vigilant on that.  Let us make sure 
<br/>that the highest level of standards and professionalism is given.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, words do haunt us.  I remembered the last time when we 
<br/>had  the  debate  here  about  this  guarantee,  there  was  a  lot  of  noise  coming  from  this  side  of  the 
<br/>Chamber on the appointment of the CEO.  Sir, in organisations as such, we need the best people - the 
<br/>right people to do the job so that services can be delivered and, of course, we must see the benefits, 
<br/>particularly in institutions as such. That is why it is important because our partners are watching, the 
<br/>clients that do benefit from the services are watching, so we as responsible Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament, when it comes to national issues and important issues as such, we need to be very careful 
<br/>with the words that we use so that it brings confidence to the stakeholders and particularly, to our 
<br/></span><span>development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I wish to state the fact that as Government, you now have the responsibility.  Let us 
<br/>make sure that we, through the Board, the CEO and the Senior Management, make sure that they 
<br/>conduct their business to the best, the highest level and standards so that we do not go through some 
<br/>of the problems that we faced in the past, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FDB  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On NPLs, let us leave it to the experts.  However, we know what we went through particularly 
<br/>from  2019  and  even  when  we  are  still  in  the  recovery  process,  but  I  look  forward  to  what  the 
<br/>honourable Minister had stated about more investments in the agriculture sector. We know the risks 
<br/>involving the agriculture sector, particularly with the new resource-based sector. That is why I am 
<br/>sure it is not only the FDB but other lending institutions because of the risks involved - they always 
<br/>take the necessary.  But I think as a Government, it is about creating the right environment so that it 
<br/>brings confidence to all the stakeholders, particularly for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that in the past, I have had a lot of discussions with the Reserve Bank of Fiji about 
<br/>creating the environment so that more lending can go to the critical sectors so that we can grow and 
<br/>diversify our economy, and we support that honourable Minister.  We look forward to hear more on 
<br/>the plans and we will be happy to work with you on that, so be assured of our support, honourable 
<br/>Minister.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution and support 
<br/>the motion by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics -  the honourable Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FDB has played a pivotal role in Fiji in providing access to finance, 
<br/>especially to Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises and Co-operatives.  As mentioned by the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister, Professor Prasad, it was established by statute and the key objectives were 
<br/>to improve the socio-economic status of people by making the right development investments and 
<br/>financing and staying financially and economically sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all agree, one of the most influential sectors potentially in our country 
<br/>will be agriculture, so the assistance of the guarantee that is being provided today, we are certain that 
<br/>the bulk of it will certainly be targeted at agriculture to ensure that the space continues to grow.  Just 
<br/>looking at the current portfolio, 37 percent of the clientele is in agriculture and the bulk of it is actually 
<br/>MSMEs.    We  hope  that  as  a  proportion  of  the  total  debt  that  is  provided  from  this  $150  million 
<br/>guarantee, that the bulk of it is targeted at commercial agriculture, particularly, to the MSME sector 
<br/>and to the women and youths of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some interesting facts and supporting the FBD motion, they have 
<br/>interestingly been providing special facilities in this space, the SME sustainability package and FDB 
<br/>loans for women entrepreneurs was a good initiative.   They have also introduced online applications 
<br/>on their portal and in fact, I have been told that they have received about 16,000 applications for 
<br/>various loans on their portal.  For the Government, which is focusing on the ease of doing business, 
<br/>this is an initiative that we applaud and actually encourage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another thing that happened recently is that we have met with the management of the FDB 
<br/>and they are partnering with visa to introduce financial literacy online and it is free of charge to all 
<br/>their  clientele.      As  we  know  financial  literacy  is  an  important  element  of  any  business  to  be 
<br/>successful and using digital means, means that the Bank can reach out to a wide array of customers 
<br/>and people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we all agree that FDB is and will continue to be a 
<br/></span><span>natural  partner  of  Government,  particularly,  because  of  its  risk  appetite  and  when  it  comes  to 
<br/>supporting MSMEs, Co-operatives and rural communities.  Within the Ministry, they are currently 
<br/>collaborating on the Northern Development Programme, the integrated human resource development 
<br/>programme, which forms public private partnership.  Through NDP the Ministry is providing equity 
<br/>funding to successful MSMEs so they can access loans from commercial banks which includes FDB.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee - FDB  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>255 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on that, I would like to commend and support the motion which will ensure that we 
<br/>continue to strengthen the agricultural sector.  I look forward to more support in terms of MSMEs 
<br/>and Cooperatives to ensure that we expand that sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief on a lighter note.  Just a reminder 
<br/>to some other Members in Government who were sitting on this side, please remember ‘n’ means 
<br/>‘no’ and ‘y’ means ‘yes’, so when you press do not press ‘n’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we support the motion before the Parliament and just 
<br/>quickly  a  couple  of  things  to  add  on  to  what  honourable  Seruiratu  mentioned  and  also  what  the 
<br/>honourable Kamikamica said.  Unlike before where we used to get objection on these motions that 
<br/>we brought this Parliament, I think it was not too long ago that there was one particular guarantee 
<br/>motion that was being objected to by the Opposition, but we were actually agreeing to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A quick question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, with regards to the NPL if he 
<br/>could  respond maybe figure out  a portion of that, would that be attributable to  COVID-19?  The 
<br/>considerable portion attributable to COVID-19 is going to be some other way of dealing with that 
<br/>because I most definitely know that a large part of the SMEs that we encouraged to Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank would be there.  Are they part of that particular basket?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  I  know  there  is  an  encouragement  on  the  part  of  the  Ministry  responsible  for  Co-
<br/>operatives and Trade, et cetera to get into some more diversification which we had introduced when 
<br/>we were there in government, and it is an important issue for us to do with respect to diversification.  
<br/>We cannot rely on tourism as we did for many, many years.  Diversification is actually needed, SME 
<br/>sector needs to get back on track, it needs to grow.  We also need to ensure that our co-operatives 
<br/>and I understand that there is a lot of work going on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was actually labelled previously when we were looking after the SMEs as I think the word 
<br/>used was “</span><span>dinau</span><span>” and also “vote buying” is another but it is a different case when you are sitting on 
<br/>the other side.  So, it is  important and I am hearing that, that is actually  being looked at and Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank is our institution and we must not let it go back to what it used to be before.  We 
<br/>have got it on a firm footing at the moment.  This Guarantee is actually important and the sectors that 
<br/>are being looked at are actually very important and as I said one of the other things that we must 
<br/>realise is that the FDB is also a large contributor to our sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had made sure that FDB also opened branches out in Nabouwalu, Taveuni -  places where 
<br/>it has never been.  So, it is actually a very important tool in our economy and supporting this particular 
<br/>guarantee is very, very important.  So, we wholeheartedly support the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/>Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you.  Before  you  proceed  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>Gavoka, honourable Deputy Prime Minister Finance, in your response, would you be able to address 
<br/>the issues raised by… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When I respond in my Right of Reply. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you honourable Speaker, Sir, yes they made a lot of noise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the other side at that time.  It is true but it was healthy for the institution at that time. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Oh no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We were in the Committee on Economic Affairs, honourable Vijay 
<br/>Nath  was  our    Chair  and  we  used  to  scrutinise  the  books  every  year.  This  is  one  of  the  best 
<br/>organisations in terms of the production of the Annual Reports and a lot of those recommendations 
<br/>were implemented by the organisation. So, it is very healthy to make those noises Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>It resulted in some changes for the organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- You want us to oppose it first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  We  always  supported  it  but  we  made  observations  and  those 
<br/>observations became very useful in the running of the organisation.  When I look across the room 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only see two there who were in Committee, the honourable Maharaj so to the 
<br/>new Members you will enjoy the Committees.  You can make a lot of noise there, you can make a 
<br/>lot of recommendations.  You looked a little despondent over the last couple of days - freshen up.  
<br/>You will be seeing a lot of good things when you scrutinise the Annual Reports like this and come 
<br/>and contribute as we debate.  Shout as much as you can but it is good for the organisation.  Thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I want to say that we will not be the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spanner in the works, as we used to see the other side of Parliament when they were sitting this side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whenever  we  had  a  FDB  Guarantee  discussion  it  used  to  take  almost  two  hours,  initially 
<br/>objection, objection but this is the new Opposition.  We will not come in the way of any policies or 
<br/>laws that you are going to bring to this Parliament that will benefit the people.  Of course, we will 
<br/>ask for clarity as we are doing now. We will ask for accountability and transparency. Those three 
<br/>things will be there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why I support FDB is because it is the only development 
<br/>bank  in  Fiji  that  supports  the  farmers,  fishing  sector,  agriculture  sector  and  above  all  women 
<br/>entrepreneurs.  Recently FDB had forked out around $1.5 million to support Small Micro Businesses.  
<br/>So,  we  can  see  the  benefits  and  a  Government  guarantee  is  very  important  from  the  borrowers 
<br/>perspective because that gives them the assurance that risk that they normally think about a FDB is 
<br/>no longer there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also come across situations where credit institutions like all other big banks, do not 
<br/>give loans for agricultural activities unless and until you have 99 years lease, or you have a freehold 
<br/>land.  So, FDB is the only option that the grass roots have.  If they want to go into small agriculture 
<br/>activity or fishing small businesses so for that reason, we support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I fully support the motion before the House. I do have one slightly 
<br/>irritating  concern  that  I  have.    Having  listened  to  the  words  from  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister No.2 or 3 I am not sure about the improvements that have been made to FDB - that has been 
<br/>gratifying to see.  I think the reasons for FDB’s importance in this country are apparent, so we need 
<br/>not talk too much about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have one niggling concern. In any organisation especially when you are guaranteeing it is 
<br/></span><span>the importance of good governance. I think this is something we all understand. Good governance, 
<br/>fit for purpose directors; fit for purpose management. My slight concern has been, and I am not sure 
<br/>whether this affects FDB but I am urging Government to constantly make sure that this is the most 
<br/>important criteria that you put to the governance of these bodies - fit for purpose directors.

<div><span> Government Guarantee - FDB  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>257 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My slight concern is because I am not too sure what is happening in some other Boards, but 
<br/>I have heard some things and I have seen some things and I am not too sure that you are focussing in 
<br/>putting in place fit for purpose people on some of these boards.  I hear some people have just been 
<br/>put into boards, some people have been saying it is the failed candidates and so forth.  I hope that 
<br/>sort of things does not happen. One thing that I urge fit for a purpose directors and fit for purpose 
<br/>managers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I thank  all the honourable Members for their support. Just 
<br/>some quick points. Honourable Seruiratu and honourable Usamate talked about Boards and I think 
<br/>your point is well taken - we need fit for purpose and in fact, if I can just inform Parliament the boards 
<br/>that have seen changes, at least those which come directly under my responsibility - like the Reserve 
<br/>Bank.  They have a process where they do a fit for purpose check and I do not think there is a set rule 
<br/>honourable Usamate that if you are a failed candidate, you do not necessarily fit the purpose.  There 
<br/>would be people who would fit the purpose (of course there are always political considerations there) 
<br/>and we have seen failed candidates appointed in the past in a number of positions, but I take your 
<br/>point about fit for purpose.  The honourable Koya, I think that is a very good question, in fact the top 
<br/>10  Non-Performing  Debt  (NPDs)  (  I  have  got  the  list  of  all  NPDs)and  that  comes  to  about  $100 
<br/>million and they are all pre-COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  look  at  the  NPLs  prior  to  2020,  the  ratio  was  pretty  high.    The  CEO  and  the 
<br/>management  of  the  bank  understand  that,  in  fact,  I  have  seen  some  new  innovations,  there  is 
<br/>digitalisation of platforms where customers can easily get access to information, they can apply for 
<br/>loans online and many other initiatives that I think the bank is trying to undertake will mean better 
<br/>focus, more improvement in terms of the service delivery.  But I do take the point that honourable 
<br/>Seruiratu and honourable Kamikamica made with respect to the focus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is one of the things that we always talked about, whenever we had the FDB Guarantee.  
<br/>We were saying let us go back to the original focus of the bank, why the bank was created, what was 
<br/>the objective, where is the priority?  I think with the new Board and the CEO understands it in my 
<br/>discussion with him and the management, there is an appreciation of re-looking at the focus of the 
<br/>bank especially for the resource-based sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those issues will be taken into account.  Just one last point to respond to honourable Kumar, 
<br/>if you look at the record of the previous Opposition, you will see in the eight years (Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>you would remember some of them) I understand the role of the Opposition and we always said… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am trying to be very diplomatic here because I was part of that group at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … that is fine, that the Opposition have guaranteed figure.  I 
<br/>have always said this from the other side and I want to say it from this side; the Opposition is as 
<br/>important as the government.  We understand this better than perhaps they did when they were in 
<br/>government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Now you know, not before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We know Mr. Speaker, Sir, and let me just make one point 
<br/>before I finish.  There are questions about fit for purpose for the board.  We can go to town on this, 
<br/>we can talk about cronies, we can talk about cabals that existed and they still exist and through the 
<br/>credit of this Government, we have not just come willy-nilly, we have not gone there to just change 
<br/>for someone said earlier today, if something is working we have said this very clearly.  I have said it 
<br/>many times that we are not going to make changes just for the sake of making changes.  We, as a

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, we are going to look at and if there are people that need to go or be removed from 
<br/>boards, we will do that, but we will not just go and do that for the sake of changing people.  I want 
<br/>to let the Opposition know that we are not going to behave like what they probably did in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank the previous Government as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  want  to  take  this  opportunity,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  thank  the 
<br/>Board of the FDB, the CEO and the Management.  So far since we have come into Government, we 
<br/>have  had  total  corporation  from  the  Management  and  we  understand  the  priorities  that  the  new 
<br/>Government has.  I think the Bank understands that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank all honourable Members for their contribution and I commend the motion to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. Thank you.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today.  Thank 
<br/>you for bearing with the long hours of sitting which you just started.  We look forward to another 
<br/>new day tomorrow and I wish to adjourn Parliament until tomorrow at 9.30 am. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 9.12 p.m.
