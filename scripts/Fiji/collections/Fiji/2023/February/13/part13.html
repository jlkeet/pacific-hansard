<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am just enjoying the music.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  This  is  what  we  feared,  and  that  is  exactly  what  is  happening.  
<br/>Based  on  favouritism  and  nepotism,  Board  members  are  being  changed.    People  who  were 
<br/>performing are being removed. Permanent Secretaries are being pressured to either resign or else get

<div><span>removed.  Once people are selected on senior positions through nepotism and ethnic agenda, they 
<br/>will  ensure  that  from  Deputy  Secretary  position  down  to  Government  Wage  Earners,  people  are 
<br/>appointed on nepotism and ethnic lines and not on merit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>None of the civil servant positions will be secured.  Every civil servant was promised by the 
<br/>Parties in the Coalition Government permanent establishment so why some civil servants are asked 
<br/>or rather forced to resign?  Why were so many teachers who were given contracts, especially Head 
<br/>of Schools, had their appointments withheld or terminated?  Where are the Unions now?  Why is no 
<br/>one saying anything?  Where is the Fiji Trades Union Congress?  Where is the Fiji Teachers Union?  
<br/>Where is the Fijian Teachers Association?  Why are they not fighting for justice?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Masters and teachers have it in black and white that they had been 
<br/>promoted to Head of School and now they are told that the Ministry has recalled their appointment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst  was  blamed  that  we  have  suppressed  the  trade  unions  and  media,  but  what  is 
<br/>happening now?  Why are the Unions not speaking on behalf of their members?  Why are they not 
<br/>giving the notice of strike?  Are they afraid of the current administration, or they are warming up 
<br/>their chairs and waiting for their benefit package for their silence?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are blamed that we have suppressed the media freedom in Fiji, but we 
<br/>know the reality.  No one from the media industry was ever prosecuted under our Government.  Some 
<br/>of the media outlets continuously ran biased and one-sided story, but no one was taken to task.  Why 
<br/>were the staff of one media outlet forced to go and ask for forgiveness from the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister?  What on earth was that?   This is what we call the media suppression, where the Board 
<br/>forces its media personnel to go and ask for forgiveness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FBC  Board  needs  to  come  out  and  tell  the  people  what  the  reasons  were  to  ask  for 
<br/>forgiveness.  Will the staff of FBC have the freedom to report freely?  No, I do not think so.  Total 
<br/>abuse of office and powers.  Government is not holding the law and the 2013 Constitution of Fiji.  
<br/>They must not forget they have been able to form the Government under the 2013 Constitution, which 
<br/>they continue to breach.  Members of the Government held the </span><span>Bible</span><span> and </span><span>Ramayan</span><span> in their hands 
<br/>and took an oath to uphold the Constitution, yet the Government continues to undermine it on a daily 
<br/></span><span>basis.  This is the hypocrisy and distortion of our religious teachings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Talk about breach of the Constitution, my friend. Have some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We have gone back in the era where it was all about whom you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is no longer about one’s capabilities or merit, if you know anyone 
<br/>in the top rank, you will get the job done. And for any ordinary Fijian who does not have any link 
<br/>than only God can help you.  Amen!  With such practices, it is the elites who are going to benefit 
<br/>from all these, and marginalised and ordinary Fijians are going to suffer.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  poor  and  rural  iTaukei  will  be  left  in  the  dark  with  no 
<br/>development going their way, iTtaukei</span><span> </span><span>kids with qualification will be forced to go back to the village 
<br/>and do farming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Indo-Fijians will be left wondering and hunting for jobs, trust me 
<br/>life  will  get  very  difficult  with  OMRS  fading  away.    How  come  a  person  not  in  the  system  be 
<br/>appointed  on  Acting  Permanent  Secretary  position?  What  was  PSC  thinking  or  doing  when  such 
<br/>appointments were done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Just recently announced, new Acting CEO of FBC is no different 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>case as well.  No advertisement, no assessment just direct appointment.  What do we call this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Acting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- He is still appointed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Why is that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- At least, he is qualified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- With the position advertised on one side and before closing date, 
<br/>people  getting  recruited  is  known  as  “favouritism  and  nepotism”.  Ministers  appointing  advisors 
<br/>without creating a position through the Ministry of Civil Service, how can that be justified?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Failed candidates are promised positions in  High Commission, Boards and Ministries is  a 
<br/>clear-cut case of bias and corruption.  These are the changes the Coalition Government promised to 
<br/>the people of Fiji.  Fiji has seen unprecedented development in the history of Fiji under the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government,  and these  current  changes  are stopping  the infrastructure development.  Workers are 
<br/>sent home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- CWM workers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No wages and salaries to feed their families. What a change! People 
<br/>working  for  contractors  who  used  to  build  roads  have  laid  off  hundreds  of  workers.  During  the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government, people lost their jobs because of the pandemic, which was not in our hands but 
<br/>now Fijians are losing jobs because of the changes made by the Government which is in your hand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On one side they are talking about employing people who were made redundant in limited 
<br/></span><span>liability companies such as ATS, independent organisation such as FRCS, and on one side more than 
<br/></span><span>500 workers are made redundant. Wow!  What  a change. These two institutions are independent, 
<br/>Ministers  should  not  interfere  with  the  day-to-day  operations,  leave  it  to  the  Board.    See  what  is 
<br/>happening - no respect for the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reform and restructure are done by experts and consultants, what knowledge do Ministers 
<br/>have to overturn the reform of an organisation?  New graduates are waiting to get jobs because civil

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>servants turning 55 returned to continue work for the next five years. Positions that would have been 
<br/>vacated by retirees at the age of 55 could have been used to absorb new graduates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Retirement age does not create new jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It does. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It does not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  It  creates  vacancy  in  the  Ministry,  people  retire,  it  is  a  simple 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we have changed the retirement age to 60, why is the current administration biased against 
<br/>those civil servants who retired in the past four years?  They have not reached 60 yet, they should be 
<br/>given natural justice and should be allowed to return to the Civil Service and complete their term.  
<br/>Why double standards? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You retire. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- To all young Fijians who study under the loan scheme, at least with 
<br/>FijiFirst, though the loan was there, you had jobs through which you could have repaid the loan. But 
<br/>now with the loan on your head and no job, how are you going to start your career?  They told you 
<br/>that they will remove the loan, they will write off close to $700 million. I ask, why are they not doing 
<br/>so?  It will not happen because they have changed their manifesto.  As I  have said before, forget 
<br/>about getting a job in the Civil Service because now recruitment will take place based on nepotism 
<br/>and discrimination.  Where is the increase in pension?  People of Fiji were promised $200 in pension. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the lie you have been saying for eight years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Where is it? With retirement age going up to 60 from 55, why is 
<br/>the Government not bringing the pension age down to 60 from 65? Why are people paying VAT on 
<br/>medication?  The NFP wanted VAT on medication to be removed, so when will this happen? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It will happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Government has created new Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, you have the full right to do so.  It is your Government and 
<br/>you decide how to share the portfolio but where is the budget allocation for the new Ministries.  The 
<br/>FMA does not allow virement of funds for a totally new ministry.  That needs to be done through a 
<br/>mini-budget.  The whole parliamentary process has been bypassed.  How can Government just bypass 
<br/>the system, the whole Parliament process?  Where is transparency and accountability that you talked 
<br/>about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, this is the change you were talking about.  You asked to slash the cost of flying 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with Fiji Link by 50 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Who?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Why is it not happening?  Why has the Government not reduced 
<br/>the cost of an air ticket to Labasa?  Your Member asked for it.  Change it!  Bring it down.  Change, 
<br/>change and change - only time will tell what change people have voted for.  It is not going to be easy 
<br/>for the next four years.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Assistant Minister of Finance.  Honourable Member, I 
<br/>must apologise.   The spelling of your name is in English - Esrom.  I have just noticed that recently 
<br/>because you hail from the highlands.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Yes, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It takes a while to get the message through. Anyway, you have the floor, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Opposition  Members  and  guests,  it  is  with  deep  humility,  honour  and 
<br/>appreciation to be elected as a Member of Parliament for Fiji and a representative, a leader for all 
<br/>Fijians and especially so for all Fijians in the Naitasiri Province who made it possible for me to be in 
<br/>this august Chamber and making this maiden speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I wish to do two things.  Firstly, to pay tribute to those who were being instrumental 
<br/>in my life and journey, up to where I am today and secondly, to share the value and vision that I am 
<br/>going to bring to Parliament and to the Government in   reply to His Excellency the President’s most 
<br/>gracious Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I begin with acknowledging Yeshua, my Lord God, our Creator who created me, gave me 
<br/>life, sustenance, wisdom, provides the banner and leads me to where I am today and still here for my 
<br/>tomorrows. I would not be here if there is no God and I believe that leaders are from or of God as He 
<br/>puts in place leaders and takes them away as well if they go astray.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then tribute goes to my parents, Savenaca and Anareta Lewenikuruyasi Lotuicama of Delai, 
<br/>Navolau, Naitasiri and Rara Natavea Nabaitavo, Naitasiri respectively, and my grandparents, both 
<br/>paternal and maternal who were the backbone of my upbringing that is, from birth, primary school, 
<br/>secondary school and then to university.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have passed on and 
<br/></span><span>could not be here to celebrate this occasion with me and my family, relatives and all the Fijians in 
<br/></span><span>Fiji and overseas.  They would be the proudest as they had a vision and dream over 50 years ago and 
<br/>coupled with hard work to make a leader out of me.  They brought me up and supported me in a 
<br/>village where the only means of transportation then to sell farm produce, the main source of income, 
<br/>week in and week out was either by </span><span>bilibili</span><span> or if lucky outboard motors as there was no road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they inculcated in me the savings and budgeting culture from 
<br/>such  a  young  age  to  enable  me  to  move  around  Suva  during  those  school  days  without  a  lot  of 
<br/>difficulties. That culture is still with me today with the addition of finance and investments and I am 
<br/></span><span>grateful that I had adapted to that upbringing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my school days from Class One to Class Six was at Dravuni District School in our village.  
<br/>It  was one of the pioneer schools in  Fiji  in  those days and  I  am  indebted to  our elders then who 
<br/>thought fit to establish the school in the early 19</span><span>th</span><span> Century.  My secondary school days from Form 1 
<br/>to  Form 6 was  spent  at  Ratu  Sukuna Memorial  School  and  I stayed  with  three faithful guardians 
<br/>during those years.  It is only proper that I name and pay tribute to them and their families for sharing 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their homes with me to stay and sleep, provided and shared their food with me and guided me to be 
<br/>a disciplined person during those years of studying away from my parents.  Unfortunately all of them 
<br/>had passed away. First is Nei Siteri from Dakuinuku, Sawakasa, Tailevu who single-handedly looked 
<br/>after me with her own three children.  Second is Unaia Raimua from Navolau, Naitasiri and his wife 
<br/>from  Rewa  and  </span><span>tavale</span><span>  Laisani  from  Nakorovatu  in  Naitasiri  and  her  husband  from  Malakati  in 
<br/>Yasawa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to say that Ratu Sukuna Memorial School moulded me in my school 
<br/>days and from the first day I set foot in the school in 1976 until when I came out, I was constantly 
<br/>reminded of Ratu Sukuna’s legacy – his vision, leadership, wisdom and how God used him mightily 
<br/>to be a saviour for Fiji during his lifetime against our Colonial powers. I am glad that the holiday to 
<br/>commemorate him will be brought back this year to Fiji and also hope this Government and future 
<br/>ones will continue to assist and develop Ratu Sukuna School in line with Ratu Sukuna’s legacy and 
<br/>vision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am forever grateful and wish to acknowledge the work of the Christian faith leaders of my 
<br/>life - the Methodist Church, Apostle Gospel, Every Home, Christian Mission Fellowship, All Nation, 
<br/>Kingdom and Assemblies of God Churches. They were all involved in the upbringing of my life and 
<br/>my family’s life in faith. Their unwavering faith and the gospel teachings and prayers continues to 
<br/>strengthen, direct the path for me and I believe for the nation of Fiji, and I will urge them to continue 
<br/>their good work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then there is the support faith nurturing provided, an experienced gained during my work 
<br/>days  from  management,  supervisors  at  Fiji  Development  Bank,  the  then  Colonial  Mutual  Life 
<br/>Assurance, Colonial National Bank (now Bank South Pacific), Commonwealth Bank of Australia, 
<br/>Auckland Savings Bank and Yasana Holdings Limited.  Names such as the late Laisenia Qarase, 
<br/>former  Prime  Minister,  former  Minister  Tomasi  Vuetilovoni,  Malakai  Naiyaga,  Dave  Robertson, 
<br/>Simon Swanson, Mike Welsh and others that I have not named here. They were part of my grooming 
<br/>and  I  am  indebted  to  them  for  the  faith  and  trust  they  placed  on  me  whilst  working  under  their 
<br/>leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  sincere  appreciation  goes  out  to  my  immediate  family  as  well.  My  wife  Penuel,  son 
<br/>Shaiya and daughter Grace for the sacrifice they placed in me and allowed me to strive for leadership 
<br/>in Fiji. It was not easy. I had to leave most of my responsibilities as a father to my wife, thanks to 
<br/>her, day in and day out most of the time and especially during preparation time and the campaign 
<br/>period.  My daughter and son had to study without my supervision and without a father figure, most 
<br/></span><span>of the time they endured and were able to move a step further in their studies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tribute also goes to all my Fijian supporters in all the 16 </span><span>tikina</span><span> and 91 villages in Naitasiri – 
<br/>the Naitasiri Provincial Council and the Soqosoqo Vakamarama.  I will remember all the chiefs, men, 
<br/>women and youth, who gave their trust to me to be a leader in their midst.  We, Naitasirians, have a 
<br/>strong sense of belonging or togetherness.  We are deeply proud of our heritage, we are a community 
<br/>knit together by family, hard work and generosity and I am proud to be one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  only  proper,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  announce  that  there  are  three  other  Members  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament  from  Naitasiri,  honourable  Aseri  is  the  Minister  for  Education  and  two  others  on  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition side.  My hope that we will do more for our province during our terms in Parliament.  In 
<br/>addition, special tribute goes to all my agents and all the people during the campaign period from the 
<br/>north  of  Naitasiri,  centre,  Waidina  areas  and  south  of  Naitasiri.    Your  hard  work,  dedication  and 
<br/>support will not be forgotten.  I am indebted to you, and we will visit you in the not distanced future 
<br/>if you cannot come to our village on 25</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  not  forget  to  mention  my  core  campaign  team  of  Sakaraia  from 
<br/>Wainawaqa, Uraia (Tamai Jo) from Naivucini, Roko Senitiki, Samuela, Goleva and Lemeki (Tamai 
<br/>Vilisi) from Navolau, </span><span>Turaga ni ovisa vakacegu </span><span>from Sawani, Drika from Nakorosule, Tamai Milio 
<br/>from Nauluvatu, Waidina, Vunaia from Waidra and cousin, Keni Dakuidreketi.  They were the crust 
<br/>or the centre of my campaign operation and were with me from the start to the finishing line.  They 
<br/>were the go-to guys with different skills and knowledge that assisted me to go wherever I want.  They 
<br/>sacrificed their time to follow me almost every day and placed their utmost faith on me and pushing 
<br/>me, saying that I should be a leader not only for Fijians in Naitasiri but to all the Fijians in Fiji.  With 
<br/>that, I wish to acknowledge and thank their wives and their families for the support given to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, special thank goes to the People’s Alliance team from its then leader, my 
<br/></span><span>tau</span><span> Sitiveni Rabuka, who is now the honourable Prime Minister, plus all the candidates who put their 
<br/>hands up to contest the 2022 General Elections, and all the volunteers who sacrificed their time and 
<br/>resources to show up and work for us.  All the office bearers who made sure there is compliance and 
<br/>governance all around and a big thank you to all the party supporters around Fiji and the whole world.  
<br/>The  2022  Election  was  the  most  challenging  one  but  prevailed  at  the  end  with  the  hands  of  our 
<br/>Almighty God.  Thank you so much and I pray that we all be blessed in the days and years ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special thanks and mention goes out to our coalition partners; the National Federation Party 
<br/>(NFP) and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) for coming together and subsequently 
<br/>creating the enabling environment to allow us to govern for the next four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this enabling environment is what we can see and feel today, on the happy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and free faces of our people wherever we go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- On businesses, workers, churches, medias and I think on land, sea 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and atmosphere alike.  They are all happy Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said earlier, there is a sense of freedom, happiness, talking, sharing all around as if 
<br/>the circles have been broken.  It is just 33 working days or 51 days, and the coalition machinery is 
<br/>progressing well ahead and I can see the great wisdom, knowledge and skills that were brought in to 
<br/>gel appropriately as a team to govern our beloved Fiji.  And all Fijians to bring out the ‘feel free and 
<br/>happy’ feeling.  There may be differences but we choose to forgive and forget them and mainly focus 
<br/>on the similarities that we have - that is the genuineness of being a Fijian like us.  We work on our 
<br/></span><span>similarities and bring about the love shine attitude.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second part of my speech is to briefly share the value and vision that I 
<br/>am going to bring to this honourable Parliament, and to reply to His Excellency the President’s most 
<br/>gracious speech. However, I wish to advise that most of what will be spoken about finance and the 
<br/>economy will be done by my line Minister of Finance, the honourable Professor Biman Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with His Excellency the President, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that our ultimate objective of 
<br/>governing is to improve the lives of all the people in Fiji.  However, we are faced with the following 
<br/></span><span>main challenges apart from others.  There is an era of uncertainty and rapid changes in the world 
<br/></span><span>right now affecting world trade and prices. There is a need to build unity through social cohesion 
<br/>among our people, we need sustainable growth plus the need to further improve and strengthen our 
<br/>economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  should  have  a  clear  focus  on  the  rule  of  law  and  the  broadening  of  the  democratic 
<br/>processes including transparency, human rights and genuine consultation.  We will hear the views of

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all members of our communities to be heard, we will adhere to the doctrine of separation of power 
<br/>continuously and we will work for greater efficiency and productivity from our civil servant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to say that Fiji is a strong nation even though we are small, 
<br/>and I believe we can rise above challenges. We have a mixed sense of history of 200 years, most 
<br/>significantly we should acknowledge that some of our forefathers, fathers, brothers and now some 
<br/>sisters,  sacrificed  their  lives  to  participate  and  defend  world  nations  in  need  during  the  First  and 
<br/>Second World Wars, and also on peacekeeping duties in the Middle East.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We should also acknowledge the arrival of the indentured labourers and church evangelists 
<br/>who came in to assist the development of our nation.  The labourers’ generation and the churches are 
<br/>here today, building our nations and we should be proud of that history.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can also 
<br/>say that we are a prosperous nation, with an abundance of resources such as land, sea, air space and 
<br/>peaceful people. Though we may be lacking in funds, those resources are the backbone in our quest 
<br/>for development, but we must develop them sustainably.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have gone through a number of Governments since independence, and 
<br/>this new Coalition Government faces a daunting task of realigning the economy after 16 years of  the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my view is that we should not sit and judge for 
<br/>too  long,  but  encourage  apologies  for  the  past  and  foster  reconciliations,  where  true  forgiveness 
<br/>achieves whilst justice takes its course.  In that way we can all work together towards the common 
<br/>goal of improving the lives of all the people in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to our need to reform or realign our economy, focussing on consolidation knowing the 
<br/>challenges  I  mentioned  before.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reform  is  needed.    However,  we  must  proceed 
<br/>carefully, and I am pleased with my role in the Ministry of Finance and as a Member of the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee.  Three major issues  come  to  mind apart from  others, we all know that  our 
<br/>economy needs help to  grow sustainably.  We need the private sector to be encouraged to be the 
<br/>engine of growth and we have already started on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Partnerships  will  be  strengthened  with  Trade  Unions,  civil  society  and  traditional 
<br/>organisations.  That has already started as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will work towards reducing 
<br/>our heavy and continuous reliance on consumption, as it will drive imports and subsequently price 
<br/>as currently faced.  In reverse psychology we should increase the savings and investment rate for our 
<br/>people.  Inflation was high but tracking low now at around 3 percent to 4 percent, hence manageable 
<br/>by one standard and we need to keep it low.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, is our national debt, which will be around $10 billion in July this year or 85 percent 
<br/>of the GDP, plus guarantees it will be around $11.8 billion or around 100 percent of the GDP.  We 
<br/>need to slow down the borrowing rate as it limits our borrowing gap for capital expenditure, but this 
<br/>is a challenge for us.  We have to rein in unimportant expenditures and stop wastage and that is what 
<br/>we  have  started,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  is  where  we  need  to  work  quickly  to  see  that  funds  are 
<br/>efficiently and effectively used – from budgeted funds, grants, subsidies, projects, et cetera, including 
<br/>funds paid or supported given to Government statutory and corporate bodies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have started on this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with two of our corporate bodies, and there are 
<br/></span><span>others  to  come,  and  a  few  are  already  on  social  media.    The  social  media  nowadays  are  whistle 
<br/>blowers.  We will have to diversify revenue source by identifying, encouraging and facilitating the 
<br/>widening of economic base, including exports.  We already worked on boosting new industry source 
<br/>such as Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO), and value adding to our traditional source. We will 
<br/>look  at  improving  the  operations  of  the  statutory  bodies  and  companies  to  increase  Government 
<br/>returns on investments.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>75 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third important issue is to reduce poverty level, especially rural poverty.  From the 2020 
<br/>level of around 24.1 percent or 208,021 individuals and reduce unemployment rate.  Currently the 
<br/>rates are much worse because of the effect of COVID-19 and the slow economic growth.  From above 
<br/>we can see the need for more diversified economy and the Government is embarking on strategy to 
<br/>achieve this, including consultations and discussions on socio-economic issues, improve the ease of 
<br/>doing business, new products and new markets recognised, and widen the role of MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the next four years, with the help of the 29 Member of Parliament in 
<br/>Government, I have faith that a lot will be achieved.  However, more will be achieved if the other 
<br/>side of Parliament will work with us, and much more will be achieved if the stakeholders such as the 
<br/>private sectors, Trade Unions, development partners and traditional institutions do buy in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  have  a  dream  as  well  as  the  dream  of  my  fellow 
<br/>Government  parliamentarians,  and  vision  that  with  leadership  of  our  God  and  Lord  on  this  new 
<br/>Government brighter days are ahead of us.  May God bless and guide us all on behalf of those who 
<br/>sent us here and God bless our beloved Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and fellow 
<br/>Parliamentarians, those at the gallery and also those listening on the television; I rise to deliver my 
<br/>response to His Excellency’s most gracious Address. Before I do that, Sir, allow me to give my views 
<br/>on the recent election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last election, it was clear that there was no outright winner and we went to a period of 
<br/>negotiation with SODELPA who became a hot darling becoming a kingmaker. Sir, PAP, a breakaway 
<br/>from SODELPA suddenly needed SODELPA’s help.  Indeed, the stone that the builders rejected had 
<br/>become the cornerstone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PAP supporters reminded SODELPA not to forget the time the late Prime 
<br/>Minister Qarase wanted to form government and the CAMV Party as kingmaker had to turn down 
<br/>the Fiji Labour Party’s offer. No one ever mentioned that the Military Council in 2000 gave the late 
<br/>PM Qarase a banker at that time the opportunity to lead the nation as an Interim Prime Minister. Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Qarase was given a plan by the Military Council to reset Fiji’s path, but it was overshadowed by the 
<br/></span><span>CAMV political interest that resulted in the 2006 military takeover.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir technically the people were no longer deciding the next government, as it 
<br/>was to be decided by SODELPA alone. The 30 member SODELPA Management Board was split 
<br/>with  16  in  favour  of  PAP/NFP  and  14  in  favour  of  FijiFirst.  The  next  day  it  was  back  to  the 
<br/>SODELPA Management Board as there were anomalies regarding the rightful management board 
<br/>members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA Management Board members who campaigned for PAP tried to 
<br/></span><span>attend the meeting.  At the end, the 26 SODELPA Management Board was split with 13 in favour of 
<br/>PAP/NFP and 12 in favour of FijiFirst with one invalid vote.  Mr. Joji Senitabua Leweniqila who had 
<br/>campaigned for PAP in Macuata sat in the Management Board as the Labasa/Savusavu member and 
<br/>voted.  I remind the honourable Prime Minister, being a Methodist Christian like me in the Vanua 
<br/>Levu dialect, “</span><span>Kai saga mo va’adodonu ta’ina</span><span>.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I thought those types of political tactics were no longer part of PAP that had 
<br/>resulted in the High Court overturning the SODELPA AGM election results in Savusavu in 2019 
<br/>because of rigging.  The Coalition is in power by default.  And I repeat the Coalition is in power by 
<br/>default.  Mr. Speaker Sir, we cannot congratulate any party in this august Parliament for winning the 
<br/>2022 Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Nevertheless, I will congratulate the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for becoming the Prime Minister by a single vote in this august Parliament.  Mr. Speaker Sir, no 
<br/>doubt FijiFirst is still the biggest party in the august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The honourable Leader of the Opposition still carries the biggest 
<br/>mandate amongst the 55 MPs in this Parliament and as the only candidate in the 2022 election that 
<br/>has collected over 130,000 votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- How many did you get? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir if I were to be the Prime Minister, I would have 
<br/>opted for a government  of national unity given the total percentage of the Coalition votes is only 
<br/>49.85 percent which is less than 50.01 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- It would be incorrect to call the People’s Coalition Government if 
<br/>50.15 percent of the people are not part of them. I will re-echo the sentiments of the late </span><span>Turaga na 
<br/>Tui Nayau</span><span> and Statesman Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara who said, and I quote, “Dialogue should become 
<br/>a part of the way of life in every country and that solutions should be reached by dialogue.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  the  FijiFirst  Party  and  the  Commander  RFMF  have  raised  concerns  on 
<br/></span><span>sweeping  changes  by  the  Coalition  that  has  threatened  our  young  democracy.    His  Excellency’s 
<br/></span><span>Address by convention lays out the Government of the day’s plans in this session of Parliament. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker Sir, His  Excellency, however revealed a worrying statement and I quote, “… for critical 
<br/>capital  expenditure  on  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  ports,  hospitals,  water,  sewerage.  …  direct 
<br/>spending into key areas such as education, health and social welfare payments.”  That clearly shows 
<br/>that  the  Coalition  Government  will  not  deliver  the  pace  of  service  delivery  that  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  made  a  priority  under  the  2013  Constitution  and  the  United  Nations  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals  that  is  aligned  to  the  5-Year  and  20-Year  National  Development  Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency in revealing the statement, the 
<br/>Government’s shortcomings in a much anticipated statement of hope, it was like a </span><span>tukutuku ni leqa 
<br/>kei na rarawa.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is this the kind of change that people voted for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- </span><span>Wawa</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  people  are  now  saying  that  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government  is  just  continuing  and  opening  the  developments  that  the  FijiFirst  Government  had 
<br/>started or done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will set up a Fiscal 
<br/>Review Policy and will be followed by an Economic Summit in April.  Let us not reinvent the wheel.  
<br/>The People’s Charter and the Strategic Framework for Change and the Roadmap for Democracy and 
<br/>Sustainable Economic Development and the Three-Year Strategic Plan that led to the formation of 
<br/>the 2013 Constitution and the 2013 Constitution became the basis of the 5-Year 20-Year National 
<br/>Development Plan.  We have that in place already.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 5-Year Development  Plan aligned to  the UN SDGs as you will be familiar with,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  as  being  a former Member of the Public Accounts Committee which usually does SDG 
<br/>audits  and  now  as  the  Speaker  of  Parliament,  you  will  be  subject  to  the  SDGs  implementation 
<br/>reporting mechanism under the  Inter-Parliamentary Unit  (IPU) which requires States  to  report on 
<br/>how governments’ national budget impacts the fulfilment of UN SDGs.  The format also is standard 
<br/>by  parliamentary  Committees  in  reviewing  Annual  Reports  and  Bills  under  the  SDG  lenses.    I 
<br/>understand it will be in Manama, Bahrain next month for the IPU meeting, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the media reports that the Coalition hints in amending the Constitution even 
<br/>through the Courts.  A referendum to decide our current nationality as Fijian and the secular State.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having studied in Israel, it was always interesting to learn the evolution of the State 
<br/>of Israel from Abraham to Jacob and the journey to the Promised Land.  They were taken to Egypt 
<br/>through a famine through Joseph after his brothers sold him.  After 600 years, Moses led them out of 
<br/>Egypt for another 40 years in the wilderness.  Joshua took over and then the Judges led Israel before 
<br/>Prophet Samuel took over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All along, God wanted Israel to be a priesthood nation.  The real Israelites wanted a physical 
<br/>king and God told Prophet Samuel to anoint Saul.  After King Saul’s demise, David was chosen king 
<br/></span><span>and Prophet Samuel had anointed him way back when he was still a shepherd boy.  King David’s 
<br/></span><span>era, his reigning descendants disobeyed God and that resulted in the Babylon captivity for another 
<br/>70 years.  The Prophet Isaiah before the Jews exiled to Babylon had prophesised a child that will be 
<br/>born and the government will be upon his shoulders.  When the Persians conquered Babylon, Cyrus 
<br/>the  Great  gave  Jews  the  permission  to  return  to  Palestine.    Persia  was  eventually  conquered  by 
<br/>Alexander  the  Great  and  the  land  of  Israel  was  again  under  the  Greeks.    The  Greeks  were  then 
<br/>conquered by the Romans.  The Romans ruled over Israel for another 400 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>all those events that I have talked about had reshaped Israel and it took away its monarchical system 
<br/>so that He alone be exalted king.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Qarase Government in 2001 in its attempt to unite the nation after the 
<br/>2000  </span><span>coup</span><span>  decided  to  form  an  Assembly  of  Christian  Churches  Fiji  called  the  ACCF  which  was 
<br/>mandated to facilitate reconciliation and unity for a prosperous Fiji.  There were a few evangelists 
<br/>who  were  brought  into  Fiji  to  pray  over  our  nation  under  the  ACCF  mission,  one  of  them  was 
<br/>Australian  evangelist,  Steve  Penny,  who  prayed  over  the  late  Prime  Minister  Qarase  at  a  prayer 
<br/>breakfast and prophesised, and I quote:

<div><span>“Some of those rocks and monuments to man’s best efforts and the Spirit of God has 
<br/>begun to run, it has gone around.  But you watch! In the next couple of years as the tide of 
<br/>the spirit gains momentum, it will literally sweep all before.  Some of those things that have 
<br/>been strong monuments will literally won’t be there because God will have decided to bring 
<br/>his agenda.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency outlines the Government’s plan to review laws concerning 
<br/>the  iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>community.   His  Excellency’s  Address  mentioned  ILO  169  and  UNDRIP.    You  will 
<br/>know, Sir, we under the Vitivou Forum in 2012 had done a lot of research in tracing back to the Deed 
<br/>of Cession 1874 and how to bring back a system that was similar to the </span><span>Treaty of Waitangi</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Convention 169 and  UNDRIP  was created to  protect  indigenous people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are minorities in their own State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- It calls for those States to develop measures in accordance with 
<br/>the universal framework of minimum standards both individual and collective rights, cultural rights 
<br/>and identity, rights to education, health, employment, language and others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  contrary  to  our  case,  Sir  Author  Gordon  had  established  the  Separate 
<br/>Administration System shortly after the Cession in 1874 to form a Colonial tool for direct rule to 
<br/>preserve natives under traditional leaders.  It was a semi-autonomous body within the government 
<br/>and  in  1945  the  Fijian  Administration  System  was  re-designed  to  protect  indigenous  Fijians 
<br/>politically and economically.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC was tasked to consider questions relating 
<br/>to the good government and wellbeing of the iTaukei people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of political ideologies that appeal to the indigenous sense of culture 
<br/>and identity through the use of mainstream institutions such as the GCC and the church gives rise to 
<br/>indigenous Fijian paramountcy and Christian nationalism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while negotiations took place in the year 2000, the GCC delegation that 
<br/>visited  Parliament  offered  George  Speight  and  the  group  immunity,  abrogation  of  the  1997 
<br/>Constitution and no Indo-Fijian to be ever Prime Minister again and the blessings to its Speight’s 
<br/>administration.  George  Speight’s  group  wanted  another  demand  and  that  was  the  removal  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Turaga na Tui Nayau</span><span> as President. The GCC later endorsed Vice President Ratu Iloilo to be President 
<br/></span><span>in 2001. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while the  GCC  under  the  1997  Constitution  and so  with  the  entrenched 
<br/>provisions  of  iTaukei  laws  and  the  compact  guaranteed  the  paramountcy  of  iTaukei  over  other 
<br/>communities then why did George Speight stage the 2000  </span><span>coup</span><span> under the pretence of indigenous 
<br/>rights? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many iTaukei supporting George Speight’s </span><span>coup</span><span> had no confidence in the 
<br/></span><span>GCC because they saw it as a group advancing their own confederacy interests. The 2000 </span><span>coup</span><span> crisis 
<br/></span><span>exposed the rot within the GCC in terms of the shift to rivalry iTaukei communities of a political 
<br/>power. It was a shift to tribalism as the common indigenous people challenged the chiefs who wanted 
<br/>to keep the GCC as a tool to remain in power and control the iTaukei people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei people saw them as corrupt chiefs who had political interests to gain wealth from 
<br/>the generosity of those who served them.  Reading the current Bose Levu Vakaturaga discussions on

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>79 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fiji Native Tribal Congress online page where the honourable Minister Ditoka is a moderator, I 
<br/>observe that there is a strong view on many iTaukei in the forum against Colonial-made chiefs.  Many 
<br/>want  a  review  of  the  composition  of  the  GCC  membership  and  have  called  for  the  correction  of 
<br/>historical  injustices  done  by  some  chiefs.    They  have  a  valid  point  and  G.V.  Maxwell,  the  first 
<br/>Commissioner of the Native Land Commission in the Legislative Council Paper No. 27 of 1915 to 
<br/>the Colonial Secretary stated that, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“… the conspiracies and perjury (lying  under oath/false swearing) that stand and revealed 
<br/>from time to time is simply appalling…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Evangelist Steve Penny’s prophesy in 2001 had mentioned that there is a 
<br/>spirit that causes the </span><span>coup</span><span> to happen and also is reflected in many that even sit in the church.  The 
<br/>danger of advancing iTaukei supremacy and Christian nationalism resulted in the 2000 </span><span>coup</span><span> despite 
<br/>the multiracial promises of the 1997 Constitution, the Indo-Fijian community were again victims of 
<br/>that </span><span>coup</span><span> despite the promises of that Constitution that anyone can become Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency reminded us with the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy’s address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the GCC in 1997 and I quote: “Fiji is our home. Fiji is our only home. We have no other.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the plea by the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy in 1997, the GCC in the 
<br/>year 2000 with the honourable Prime Minister as the Chairman at that time proposed to resolve the 
<br/>crisis through the release of hostages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- GCC approved that Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Yes, release of hostages that no Indo-Fijian should be ever again 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be Prime Minister. Had they forgotten what the late Jai Ram Reddy had said in 1997 and plea?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Constitution has a more balanced approach to indigenous issues 
<br/>in view of stability and removing discriminatory policies.  Fijians are recognising the preamble, their 
<br/>land is protected and cannot be permanently alienated, not like the Momi and Denarau cases.  Section 
<br/>30 of the 2013 Constitution now enables 80 percent of fair share of royalties on minerals to be paid 
<br/>to landowners, something that was never done in the SDL and SVT governments despite that being 
<br/>part of the 1997 Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investment capacity of iTLTB in making landowners move from passive land providers 
<br/></span><span>to ntrepreneurship is prioritised through the iTaukei Land Development Programme that has allowed 
<br/></span><span>many landowners and landowning units to sub-divide land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- More land development for accessible housing though the First 
<br/>Home Buyers scheme allowed resource owners to get economic returns. Landowners have moved 
<br/>into the quarry business partnership with Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) contractors - they earn as far 
<br/>as  $13  per  cubic  metre  where  $3.39  goes  to  TLTB  for  royalties  and  $9.61  goes  into  a  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>
<br/></span><span>account  to  improve  their  economic  position.  Now  with  introduction  of  the  PWD  and  seizure  of 
<br/></span><span>contactor’s they lose out and many who voted People’s Alliance Party (PAP) working under FRA 
<br/>contractors are now without jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board  had  paid  a  total  of  $243.3  million  to  the 
<br/>landowners in three years as of November 2021.  These landowners have leased out their land for 
<br/>economic development on various sectors of the economy.  TLTB has invested a total of $29 million

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as of 30</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2021 to 27,000 minors at various investment institutions in the country. These 
<br/>lease monies will be released to the entitled iTaukei children when they turn 18 years. This was never 
<br/>done by the SVT or SDL government in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the 2013 Constitution, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board continued to invest in educational 
<br/>programmes,  to  help  uplift  the  lives  of  iTaukei  around  the  country  in  promoting  and  preserving 
<br/>language  and  culture.  It  has carried out  leadership training for traditional leaders for its centre at 
<br/>Nadave and also has moved on to post graduate studies in partnership between ITaukei Trust Fund 
<br/>with USP, for those that want to do their post graduate studies in indigenous language - and that was 
<br/>done through the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the 2013 Constitution the Climate Change Act was passed last year 
<br/>and that now allows many landowners to participate in the carbon trading market.  For example, in 
<br/>Vunivia  Catchment  in  Dogotuki  are  now  in  discussion  with  the  Maori  Land  Commission  and 
<br/>Cooperation  on  partnership  to  carbon  credits.    Section  26(8)(g)  of  the  2013  Constitution  protects 
<br/>iTaukei, Rotuman and Banaban lands and access to marine resources (qoliqoli), or the bestowing of 
<br/>iTaukei, Rotuman and Banaban chiefly title rights and rank.  No native land has been alienated, no 
<br/>qoliqoli  lost  and  no  chiefly  title  or  rank  was  lost  under  the  FijiFirst  Government  in  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution. Despite this, many still spread lies during the campaign that now we are all Fijians and 
<br/>all other communities can be registered, maybe in the future registered in the VKB to own land &amp; 
<br/></span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>and finally the iTaukei people will be swimming in the sea without any ownership to their 
<br/>resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the new order in the 2013 Constitution established by the Military was based 
<br/>on  two  important  goals  firstly,  “uplifting  the  disadvantaged  in  all  communities”  and  secondly, 
<br/>“mainstreaming the indigenous Fijian in a modern, progressive Fiji.”   Interestingly, that prophecy in 
<br/>2001 by Steve Penny talked about a government structure that  will bring favor to  the nation.    In 
<br/>explaining the basis of the structure he cited Ezekiel 17:22-24. The passage talks about a shoot that 
<br/>was taken from a top most of a cedar tree and planted into a top mountain in Israel and birds of every 
<br/>feathers will shelter there and find peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I believe the splendid cedar tree in the prophecy is the 2013 Constitution 
<br/>that has the ability to produce branches and bear fruit. Birds of every kind will nest in it; they will 
<br/>find shelter in the shade of its branches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the birds of every kind mentioned in the passage refers to all communities 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji who are now all Fijians living in peace.   We need to grow into the future together as a nation 
<br/></span><span>of Fijians in harmony. We need to move away from the view that Fiji is for the iTaukei. The 2013 
<br/>Constitution unites us as one people towards a shared destiny.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we need to uphold and promote the values of our sovereign democratic State 
<br/>in the 2013 Constitution especially common and equal citizenry and national unity, equality of all 
<br/>race, care for the less fortunate based on values inherent in the Bill of Rights.  We all took an oath as 
<br/>Members of Parliament in this august with our holy books in our hand to uphold the Constitution just 
<br/>like  the  Israeli  soldiers  taking  their  own  oaths  to  swear  that  Masada  will    never  fall.    The  2013 
<br/></span><span>Constitution is a fortress that needs to be defended. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  1986  his  Holiness  the  Pope  John  Paul 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>famously declared "Fiji - the way the world should be”, a year later we had the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>81 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- How do we retain that status we did not fall not from 16 years 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ago… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The 2006 </span><span>coup. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- .. but from 36 years ago?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to deliver our nation out of that evil spirit that caused the </span><span>coup</span><span> to first birthed in our 
<br/>nation. I urge the honourable Prime Minister not to waste his time on restoring the systems and the 
<br/>monuments that the evangelist has spoken about - that we only encourage instability.  Let us not use 
<br/>the freedom as a pretence that will drive us to the past.  People are now joking about the new rushed 
<br/>FBC logo and now we hear that they wanted to change it again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  The  former  Supervisor  of  Elections  was  stopped  at  the  Nadi 
<br/>International Airport without any knowledge of an investigation being done by FICAC on him. The 
<br/>honourable Leader of the House last week had her bail condition varied by the Court and she can 
<br/>now travel overseas because she was charged by FICAC.  Mr. Saneem without even being caution 
<br/>interviewed  was  put  on  the  watch  list.  The  former  Police  Commissioner  of  Police  is  being 
<br/>investigated by CID and is already suspended by the COC and pending a tribunal hearing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They followed the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Process, process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  I  was  picked  up  by  the  CID  Taskforce  team  last  week  at  5.00 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a.m… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Unlike some.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  …on  an  allegation  based  on  the  Online  Safety  Act  without  an 
<br/>opportunity to respond to the complaint lodged to the Online Commission as required by the Act 
<br/>itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I call on the honourable Prime Minister to stop this drama.  I also thank the PAP General 
<br/>Secretary for condemning the uncalled behaviour of the PAP President that was circulated online. 
<br/>Many with the wrong motives have taken this opportunity of change of Government to try cause 
<br/>unnecessary fear in the community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  take  my  seat  on  1st  August,  2022,  Pope  Francis  received  His 
<br/>Excellency the President at the Vatican's Apostolic Palace. Prior to that on 29 July, His Excellency 
<br/>the President met with His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales at his Royal residence in Norfolk, 
<br/></span><span>England.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- </span><span>Io, sa rauta</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- He had sent me a photo of him and King Charles and I replied 
<br/>back “</span><span>Sota e rua na a’i Bolatagane</span><span>” and His Excellency replied to me saying “</span><span>Sota e rua na ai’vale</span><span>” 
<br/>meaning, “Two from the same household have met”.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  addressed  the  Government  of  the  day  as  the  People’s 
<br/>Coalition government and not “My government.” His Excellency true in his character as a leader 
<br/>could not say it because he respected him being elected as President of Fiji in 2021 by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.    His  Excellency,  left  it  to  us  to  find  a  solution  by  saying,  “The  change  in  our 
<br/>Government gives rise to the opportunity to bring our nation together and start afresh.”</span><span> </span><span>To understand 
<br/>the meaning of what His Excellency meant in one sentence, I would urge you to listen to what His 
<br/>Excellency is not saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, fate does funny things sometimes as the famous poet said “They came for 
<br/>the socialist, I did not speak.  They came for the trade unionist, I did not speak.  They came for the 
<br/>for the Jewish, I did not speak because I was not a Jew then they came for me and there was no one 
<br/>left to speak for me.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat it will be amiss not to congratulate you for ascending 
<br/>to the Chair of this Parliament.  I recall the day the honourable Prime Minister as the Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition  in  2020  tendered  his  resignation  in  Parliament.  We  had  to  elect  a  new  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition the next day. The Party had issued a written directive that honourable Gavoka to be the 
<br/>nominee. However, we managed to sail through those rough seas that morning and finally you were 
<br/>unanimously elected to be the Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- We have in the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is confidential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- … maneuvered safely through difficult passages.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I know you will not regret… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Stop pointing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- … customarily being dragged unwillingly to the Speaker's bench. 
<br/>I  have  confidence  that  you  will  maintain  order  and  decorum  of  Parliament  by  acting  impartially 
<br/>without fear or favour as having gained experience, having being on attachment to the British House 
<br/>of Commons in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for indulgence, may God bless Fiji forevermore. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Bulitavu, that was a world tour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now intend to adjourn Parliament so we can take a break for tea before we come back for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the final lap.  The Parliament is adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and 
<br/>the people of Fiji who may be tuning in this afternoon; </span><span>bula vinaka, namaste</span><span>, </span><span>noaia e mauri</span><span> and a 
<br/>very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May  I  congratulate  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  your  appointment  as  Speaker  to  this  august 
<br/>Parliament  and  with  your  experience  and  knowledge,  we  believe  that  it  was  an  appropriate 
<br/>appointment  -  we wish  you well in  these four years.  Likewise,  I would like to  also  congratulate 
<br/>honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua for her appointment as Deputy Speaker and we wish her well as 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin, I thought coming into this Parliament that I might be able to elevate the quality 
<br/>of debate in this august Parliament, but clearly, it is going to be a big task.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu for taking us around the world on a biblical and geographical journey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/>and also present my Maiden Speech.  In opening my contribution, please allow me to make a few

<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I speak in full support of His Excellency the President of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji and the </span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata</span><span>, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere’s Address delivered 
<br/>on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023.  May I begin with the following quote in this august Parliament and I am 
<br/>taking you back to 1998, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The coming into force of the Constitution Amendment Act 1997 on Monday 27th 
<br/>July, 1997 will establish a new threshold for multiracial and multi-party cooperation in Fiji.  
<br/>But we must not be complacent. The job has just begun. The provisions of the Constitution 
<br/>have to be fully explained to the people, especially the indigenous Fijians. The rationale of 
<br/>the new amended Constitution and how their rights and interests have been safeguarded in an 
<br/>environment  where  they  have  to  help  themselves  by  working  with  people  of  other

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities must be understood. In fact, the people of Fiji have been working together for 
<br/>more than a hundred years and together we have built a country where we have been blessed 
<br/>by the Almighty with abundant resources and opportunities. This is our reality. We shall not 
<br/>grow in stature and wealth by depriving others of their freedoms and opportunities. We must 
<br/>stand firm against the forces of racism, and ethnic violence, fundamentalist sectarianism and 
<br/>greed which is at large in the world today. We must educate and train the people of Fiji to 
<br/>seek to  live with  the truth, to  respect  the law, to  be worthy  of trust,  to  be industrious  and 
<br/>competent, to respect the religious beliefs of others, to love and help children, honour and 
<br/>help our parents to set a good example, being temperate and not living in the promiscuity and 
<br/>as  the  Bible  says,  “Try  not  to  do  things  that  you  would  not  like  others  to  do  to  you  and 
<br/>safeguard and improve the environment.”.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we want to make Fiji a happy home for those who live in it, we must encourage and 
<br/>support  all  the  people  of  goodwill,  religious  bodies  and  non-government  organisations  to 
<br/>promote those principles which must form the foundation of a New Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is a few months away from making a historic decision at the next elections  - we 
<br/>will be electing the first  government  of national  unity  - in  which all major parties will be 
<br/>represented. All communities will be working side by side to make Fiji a better place to live 
<br/>and to give our children a better future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But it will not be easy.  It will need men and women who put Fiji first and its people 
<br/>but I believe, the goal of political stability and economic prosperity will be worth the sacrifice.  
<br/>That is the promise of the New Fiji – a prosperous and happy nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Josevata Nakausabaria Kamikamica - dated 24th July 1998.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I decided to use this quote of my late father, who was also a Member of this august Parliament 
<br/>in tribute to his life and, of course, my mum, Mrs. Esiteri Kamikamica. His speech which he titled 
<br/>the “Dream for a New Fiji” in 1997 has absolute relevance today.  At that time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>there was an aura of hope in Fiji.  That same aura of hope and renewal exists today.  It calls for unity, 
<br/>tolerance and respect for each other and for leaders who are wanting to serve.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President speaks and demands unity and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Your Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion and further 
<br/></span><span>improve  and  strengthen  our  economy  through  sustainable  growth  with  the  ultimate 
<br/></span><span>objective of improving the lives of all the people of Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and wax lyrical with anecdotes or analogies about clapping 
<br/>with one hand or the strength in numbers but I will not.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will challenge this august 
<br/>Parliament  and  the  people  of  Fiji  –  are  we  serious  about  unity?    Like  1998  and  as  stated  by  His 
<br/>Excellency, unity is critical.  If like myself, we agree that we are serious about unity then we cannot 
<br/>be complacent, and we must lean in and work together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unity starts from this august Parliament.  Sure, we will have debates, we 
<br/></span><span>will lob insults at each other, but we must not forget the task at hand.  It is large, it may be daunting, 
<br/>but with God’s help, together unified in Parliament and across the nation we can truly build a happy 
<br/>and prosperous nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, together we can!  It is vital that as a nation we accept a fundamental truth, 
<br/>that we are one nation under God.  Racial and religious intolerance has no place in the new Fiji.  Let 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>85 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me repeat that – racial and religious intolerance has no place in the new Fiji.  If we accept this as a 
<br/>country, if we do this in this august Parliament, the road to unity as a people is off to a great start.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two other significant keys to unity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  One, we need to find women 
<br/>and men who put the country first.  Second, the key to a unified Fiji is a Government that listens, not 
<br/>only in words and platitudes but in actions and deeds, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  His Excellency urges us all, 
<br/>the People’s Coalition Government, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…to  ensure  all  initiatives  and  draft  legislation  must  go  through  a  thorough 
<br/>consultation  process  for  better  outcomes  to  ensure  inclusiveness  and  foster  greater 
<br/>ownership.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we assure this nation and the people of Fiji that we will listen.  There are 
<br/>major challenges that lay in front of us, and His Excellency touched on this as well.  His Excellency 
<br/>spoke about the need  to get our economic house in order.  I am confident that we will get this done.  
<br/>Why?  It is because we are in this together.  Together, Sir, we can.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, of equal importance is the need to grow the pie or the cake or the economic cake.  
<br/>Fiji is open for business, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yes, there are a few impediments to doing business in 
<br/>Fiji and this shall be fixed.  If we are to prosper as a country, we need to target to grow our economy 
<br/>aggressively and I am suggesting 50 percent over the next 10 years.   It is an ambitious target, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but I have news for the people of Fiji, together as a unified nation, we can.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the next 12 months, we need to execute the following to name are few:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review the civil service;  
<br/>Perform a fiscal review of our Government - the last review was in 2004;  
<br/>Hold an economic summit which shall form the basis of the national strategy for Fiji; 
<br/>Conduct the National Tripartite Forum – this is exciting as it means the unions will have a 
<br/>true voice in our country; and  
<br/>Review the education system so it is fit for purpose and relevant to the employment needs 
<br/>in Fiji for the 21st century. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those bodies of work may seem daunting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but together we can.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry which I head covers Trade, Small Micro Enterprises(SMEs), Co-operatives and 
<br/></span><span>Communications  will  work  closely  with  all  the  ministries  -  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Tourism and Civil Aviation, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Forests and other key 
<br/>ministries to increase the economic pie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be honest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some significant opportunities out there - energy, 
<br/>tourism, aviation, commercial agriculture with value added, pharmaceuticals, fisheries, forestry and 
<br/>the ICT sector just to name are few. There is a renewed interest for investment in our country. There 
<br/>is also a real opportunity to make Fiji a genuine regional hub in the Pacific working together with 
<br/>our Pacific partners, brothers and sisters to bring about prosperity for all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, transparency and investor confidence is fundamental. We shall operate on 
<br/>a  no  surprises  basis.  We  will  contribute  to  work  on  modern  and  innovative  trade  co-operation 
<br/>agreements that make sense for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  (IPEF)  is  an  example  of  a  modern  and  forward-
<br/></span><span>looking trade agreement which will evolve as a powerful economic bloc. Mr. Speaker, Sir, IPEF will 
<br/></span><span>address  non-tariff  barriers  and  modern  trade  logistical  issues  which  exacerbate  the  cost  of  doing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business.  The IPEF is a US-led initiative that addresses the issues and challenges of the 21st century.  
<br/>Fiji is currently negotiating IPEF with 13 other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, 
<br/>Thailand, United States of America to name are few which represents about 40 percent of the world’s 
<br/>Gross Domestic Product.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will also leverage Public Private Partnership (PPP) and business-to-business initiatives and 
<br/>it has an opportunity to deliver foreign direct investments and technological transfer. Fiji is already 
<br/>seeing the benefits of IPEF even without signing an agreement and we look forward to more tangible 
<br/>benefits in the coming days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another novel agreement that will drive our transformation to a low emission climate resilient 
<br/>economy is the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS). The ACCTS is 
<br/>being  negotiated  with  Costa  Rica,  Iceland,  New  Zealand,  Norway  and  Switzerland  draws  nexus 
<br/>between trade, climate and environmental goals with sustainability at its core.  In the regional context, 
<br/>we will focus on renewing cooperation and trade relations with the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  aim  to  increase  Fiji’s  trading  volume  by  diversifying  our  exports  across  a  large 
<br/>number of products and trading partners. To do this, it is vital that we build competitive advantages 
<br/>by redirecting incentives and initiatives to build capacities in MSMEs and including co-operatives to 
<br/>engage in cross-border trade. We will particularly target the youth and women in the rural setting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  private  sector  engagement  is  more  than  ever  important  as  it  shapes  the 
<br/>economic and social landscape. What I want is to see a private sector led growth. They are the key 
<br/>drivers of growth and innovation and most importantly address the biggest challenges facing society 
<br/>today, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will create a supportive environment in which 
<br/>businesses can thrive and contribute to economic growth. By making things easier businesses can 
<br/>focus on what they do best, providing goods and services to their customers. These hurdles can be 
<br/>fixed, and they will be.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having the right infrastructure and fair and transparent legislation and policies, that is, when 
<br/>we can boost investments into the country, meaning more jobs and more innovative opportunities for 
<br/>the people. Essentially, we will further and promote economic diversification.  When I mean fair and 
<br/>transparent  legislation, I mean, a  collaborative  approach with  the private sector forming the right 
<br/>foundation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proposed Bills that may come through like the MSME Bill; a review of the Co-operative Act 
<br/>will be on the cards and I  assure this august Parliament  that those  Bills and amendments  will go 
<br/>through thorough consultation and review process to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We intend to encourage the development of new industries such as BPO Green Manufacturing 
<br/>Renewable Energy, to name a few. The Blue Economy is also an exciting prospect, and they have 
<br/>significant potential to grow in the coming years. Professional bodies will provide sound advice to 
<br/>our Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digitalisation  is  critical  and  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    In  communication,  we  have  an 
<br/>opportunity to transform our country as a technological driver.  We are steadfast in our dedication to 
<br/>grant connectivity to the remaining 5 percent of the unconnected Fijians which will further enhance 
<br/>financial inclusion and access to digital services.  With the Universal Services Fund, we will connect 
<br/>the unconnected.  There are areas in Fiji where signals and access are weak, we plan to address this 
<br/>as  well.    Also  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  prioritizing  the  second  cable  landing  station  which  will

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transform technology in Fiji and of course, with increasing cyber-attacks, this is something that our 
<br/>Ministry will focus on and commit its resources to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to the Media Industry as mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister, the Media 
<br/>Industry Development Act (MIDA) will either be amended or repealed.  I have heard countless first-
<br/>hand accounts of the trauma experienced by journalists and the way this law has been used to paralyse 
<br/>the  media.    Like  any  democratic  society,  the  media  must  be  able  to  carry  out  its  critical  role  in 
<br/>informing our people. This will be coming to the floor of this august Parliament on the amendments 
<br/>that we will be proposing. Be assured, full consultation will take place before it is presented.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker Sir, we are also mindful of significant investments that have been made in </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.  There 
<br/>will be a paper to Cabinet on the need for a detailed review of  </span><span>Walesi's </span><span>operations and the future 
<br/>roadmap. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, may I be allowed to conclude with my Maiden Speech to the Parliament.   In 
<br/>1984, a very young man, at his school prize giving ceremony, uttered the famous words of President 
<br/>John Fritzergerald Kennedy (JFK) about service before self.  Today, that same not so young man, 
<br/>would like to quote those same words – </span><span>“Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you 
<br/>can do for your country.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I challenge all of us in this august Parliament to do the same and I will explain why.  Before 
<br/>I do, I would like to thank the God Almighty and his son Jesus Christ for his love, grace and blessings 
<br/>which has allowed me to come and serve my country. If there has been one thing I have learnt on this 
<br/>journey, without God, this would not have been possible.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now to explain why I chose the words of JFK in my maiden speech. Mr. Speaker Sir, it is 
<br/>very simple, the moment demands it.  Fiji has some challenging times ahead which requires sacrifices 
<br/>and the desire to  work together for our people.  We cannot  be complacent  and bicker about  petty 
<br/>issues.  As mentioned by my late father, Fiji needs women and men who will put our country first.  I 
<br/>ask my colleagues in this august Parliament, are we such women and men?  The people of Fiji, our 
<br/>people deserve no less.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, for those who do not know me, I am a descendant of two warrior clans, from 
<br/></span><span>Navitomi</span><span>, from the </span><span>Turaga na Tudrau</span><span>, in Dravo Bau Tailevu, and from </span><span>Tacilevu,</span><span> from the village of 
<br/>Navunievu in Bua. My dad’s village is also one of the warrior clans to the </span><span>Vunivalu</span><span> of Bau.  A warrior 
<br/>is  by nature, selfless  and their first  instinct is  to protect  those around him  and a desire to  serve  - 
<br/>service before self. This is what I bring to this august Parliament -  a desire to serve my country and 
<br/></span><span>people well with integrity, truth and justice and that is my pledge to this Parliament and the people 
<br/></span><span>of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker  Sir,  this  is  why  I  used  the  quote  from  JFK.  If  any  of  us  have  come  to  this 
<br/>Parliament merely to earn a salary or to winge about election results, then this Parliament is not for 
<br/>them.  I come to this place with significant hopefulness -- as a practical person, a doer and a tireless 
<br/>worker.  Before  joining  politics,  I  had  a  33-year  career  in  finance,  aviation,  banking  and 
<br/>manufacturing.  I am here to make the lives of our people better by implementing actionable level-
<br/>headed policies and legislation using the knowledge and skill I have gained from the real world.  Like 
<br/></span><span>many of my colleagues in this august Parliament, I believe we have a duty to our people and the 
<br/></span><span>responsibility to create opportunities for our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  it  would  be  remiss  of  me  not  to  acknowledge,  Mr  Speaker  Sir,  my  deepest 
<br/>appreciation  and  thanks  to  those  who  have  supported  me  in  my  arriving  here  today.    To  my  late 
<br/>father, Josevata Nakausabaria Kamikamica, my mother Mrs Esiteri Nuenue Kamikamica, my wife

<br/>my Air Pacific, Fiji Airways and the Waqavuka Family, Mr Joveci Balenaivalu, Titilia Vuataki, Ana 
<br/>Gale, Lanoma and Pradeep Singh and the supporters in the West and the People’s Alliance Western 
<br/>Regional Team - thank you for your efforts and support – they are deeply appreciated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the 24 patriots that did not make it to Parliament, we will not forget you.  
<br/>To those of you who I have not mentioned and anyone that voted 454, I thank you and say ‘v</span><span>inaka 
<br/>vakalevu’.  </span><span>I promise that I will not let you down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, when God approached the young King Solomon and asked him what 
<br/>he wanted, he asked for wisdom. The rest we know is history. I pray that all of us in this august 
<br/>Parliament will seek God and his wisdom, the wisdom he gave King Solomon.  The challenges that 
<br/>we face in our nation are many, Mr. Speaker, Sir but with God’s wisdom and together unified, we 
<br/>can.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless His Excellency the President of Fiji, may God bless our Prime Minister and 
<br/>his Cabinet and may God bless the Members of this august Parliament and may God bless the people 
<br/>of Fiji.

<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/>and our dear people of Fiji - </span><span>ni sa bula, namaste, asalaam waalekum</span><span> and a very good afternoon to 
<br/>you all. Please, allow me to acknowledge and greet all our people and our friends joining us this 
<br/>afternoon via television, livestreaming or on Parliament website and </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before you today as  a proud Fijian and Member of Parliament from 
<br/></span><span>Lautoka  to  represent  all  Fijians.    It  is  indeed  an  absolute  honour  and  privilege  to  be  here  in  this 
<br/>capacity.  Let me start by thanking God because of whom we are here today.  I am greatly humbled 
<br/>this afternoon to deliver my Maiden Speech during this parliamentary session.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>congratulate you on your appointment as Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am originally from Viseisei Lautoka.  I attained my primary education at 
<br/>Viseisei  Primary  School;  secondary  education  at  Sangam  (SKM)  College,  Nadi;  my  teaching 
<br/>certificate  from  Lautoka  Teachers  College,  Bachelor  of  Arts  Degree  from  USP  and  Master  of 
<br/></span><span>Education from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia.  I taught in Primary school for 12 years 
<br/></span><span>and was a Senior Lecturer in Education at Lautoka Teachers College and FNU until 2014.  From 
<br/>2015 to 2022, I was at the Ministry of Education as Principal Education Officer, Director Primary 
<br/>Education, Director Early Childhood Education, Director Special Inclusive Education and Head of 
<br/>Human Resources.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any constitutional democracy to thrive, the Government must deliver on 
<br/>its election promises.  It must subject itself to scrutiny and it must get subjected to be questioned.  
<br/>When we as the Opposition will do so, it will not be for the sake of doing so, but it is the right of 
<br/>every citizen to know, it will not be for the sake of it, it will be done as and when necessary.  I wish 
<br/>to echo the sentiments of our honourable Leader and the honourable Member of Parliament who by 
<br/>far alone has the largest number of votes, almost double that of the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my presence in this Parliament today has been made possible by our FijiFirst 
<br/>Leader and by the people of Fiji.  I also wish to thank my campaign team, my wife Sharmila, my 
<br/>daughter Priyashna, brothers, sisters, cousins, family members and village elders for their extremely 
<br/>hard  work  and  support  during  the  election  campaign.    I  am  very  honoured  to  be  one  of  the  26</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>FijiFirst MPs in Parliament.  FijiFirst has the biggest number of MPs in this august Parliament after 
<br/>having 26 out of the 55 seats in the 2022 General Election.  FijiFirst received 200,246 votes, that is 
<br/>42.55 percent of the total votes cast. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, mainstream politics was something that I had never wanted to be in until 
<br/>four  months  prior  to  the  elections.    I  am  now  here,  and  I  fully  understand  the  enormous 
<br/>responsibilities bestowed upon me and I am ready to deliver.  Unlike, many on the other side of the 
<br/>Chamber  who  had  chosen  a  defined  area  as  their  constituency,  I  campaigned  throughout  Fiji.  
<br/>Whenever I will rise to speak in this Chamber, I will always have a clear picture of the people out 
<br/>there for whom the policy is being made, be they from Lautoka, Nadi, Bua, Rakiraki, Labasa, Taveuni 
<br/>or be they from rural, urban, remote, very remote or maritime.  I have met them, I have sat with them 
<br/>and  shared  their  concerns  and  appreciations  over  a  cup  of  tea  or  a  bowl  of  grog.    Majority  have 
<br/>expressed  their  great  appreciation  to  the  FijiFirst  Government  for  the  assistance  provided  and 
<br/>development  done  by  the  FijiFirst  Government.    I  have  a  much  better  understanding  of  the 
<br/>development  that  has  taken  place  in  urban,  rural,  semi-urban,  remote  and  outer  islands  under  the 
<br/>leadership of our leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be noted with great appreciation that it was the careful planning, 
<br/>wise budgeting and tireless effort of the FijiFirst Government that steered us out of the woods during  
<br/>COVID-19. When the pandemic swept the globe, no country was spared.  The impact of COVID-19 
<br/>was  worse  than  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>,  </span><span>TC  Harold</span><span>  and  every  storm  since  2016  combined.    The  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government took steps to secure our borders and made sure our hospitals and doctors had medical 
<br/>supplies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government made sure our families had accurate and timely information about 
<br/></span><span>what public actions were required and when vaccines became available.  The FijiFirst Government 
<br/></span><span>made sure that we were first in the line. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  also  highlight  that  the  FijiFirst  Government 
<br/>during the pandemic,  they provided direct cash assistance and rations to Fijians.  Those assistance 
<br/>have helped support more than 300,000 Fijians.  While in many countries people had to pay for the 
<br/>corona vaccines, the FijiFirst Government provided free vaccines to the citizens.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Sir, COVID-19 was not the only issue that gripped our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Who negotiated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Since 2016, we had 14  cyclones, out of which five were either category 
<br/>5 or category 4.  Fiji faced the brunt of some of the worst natural disasters in its history.  One cyclone 
<br/>to mention is </span><span>TC Winston.  TC Winston</span><span> caused havoc and widespread damage to our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many Fijians were left homeless, without food, medical supplies and other necessities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Wait till a category 5 hits again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- But what matters when facing a once-in-a-lifetime crisis is a government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  The  FijiFirst  Government  acted  quickly  to  protect  our  nation,  our 
<br/>families  and  Fiji  with  a  stimulus  programme  now  responsible  for  putting  us  back  on  the  road  to 
<br/>recovery, faster than anyone thought possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to dwell on a subject that is very close to 
<br/>my heart and that is education.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I started teaching in the 1990s, some teachers 
<br/>used to work at the District Education Officer’s farms and homes in the weekends for free because 
<br/>in  return  the  District  Education  Officers  used  to  favour  them  by  recommending  their  names  for 
<br/></span><span>leadership positions.  We should avoid going back 30 years and all appointments should be based on 
<br/></span><span>merit and not on recommendations by District Education Officers, Divisional Education Officers or 
<br/>the Teacher's Unions.  I am very surprised to hear from teachers that now appointments are based on 
<br/>recommendations and not on merit.  This is nepotism, discrimination and favouritism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Open Merit Based Recruitment and Selection is the system of appointing 
<br/>employees based on their ability to do the job, assessed against objective selection criteria which do 
<br/>not discriminate against or give preference to any group of individual. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Open  Merit  Based  Recruitment  and  Selection  Guideline  ensures 
<br/>consistency in the recruitment and selection of staff across the Fijian Civil Service.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>when I was the head of Human Resources, all the recruitments were in accordance with the OMRS

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  been  reliably  informed  that  some  acting 
<br/>leadership appointments have been revoked and now appointments are done on recommendations. 
<br/>This is nepotism, discrimination and favouritism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past eight years, the FijiFirst Government has 
<br/>increased  investment  in  education  at  all  levels  through  the  Free  Education  Initiative,  Bus  Fare 
<br/>Assistance,  Free  Textbooks  for  Primary  and  Secondary  Education  and  Tertiary  Education 
<br/>Scholarship and Loan Schemes.  It invested in teachers, salary increase at all levels, providing more 
<br/>scholarships, post graduate qualification appointments and a better work environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Short term contracts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  It  also  removed  the  grog  drinking  culture  which  is  now  back  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vengeance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Quality  education  for  all  is  essential  to  create  a  more  skilled  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>adaptable workforce and create a knowledge-based society.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Constitution guarantees the right of every child to early childhood, 
<br/></span><span>primary, secondary and further education.  A number of bold initiatives have been introduced by the 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst Government to improve the provision of quality education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  universal  access  to  primary  education  has  been  achieved  and  today,  net 
<br/>secondary school enrolment is over 80 percent.  With the free education initiative, free bus fares and 
<br/>free textbooks, enrolment numbers have increased.  It is no secret that our education system requires 
<br/>further changes to match-up with the first world countries.  We can only build on the foundation laid 
<br/>by the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FijiFirst  Government’s  initiative  that  fulfilled  the 
<br/>dreams of many secondary school graduates is the National Toppers and Tertiary Education Loan 
<br/>Scheme (TELS).  Toppers offered a pathway for high achievers to pursue studies of their choice.  
<br/>Similarly tertiary education loan TELS gave the opportunity to secondary school graduates options

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  study courses and  chart their career paths.    Now, the students  are in  limbo with  no clarity,  no 
<br/>certainty and no direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, free education grant for primary and secondary students was introduced in 
<br/>2013 and since then more than 200,000 students were assisted annually.  Free education grant for 
<br/>early childhood education was introduced in 2015 and since then more than 15,000 students were 
<br/>assisted annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another scheme that literally reached far and wide is transport assistance.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>transport assistance provided to students is another very good initiative of the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>to reduce the financial burden on parents who are unable to afford transportation cost involved in 
<br/>sending children to school.  Transport assistance ensures equal access to  quality education for all 
<br/>Fijian  students  in  primary  and  secondary.    More  than  90,000  students  are  provided  transport 
<br/>assistance  every  year  regardless  of  the  location.    Since  the  introduction  of  free  education  grant, 
<br/>transport assistance and free textbooks, the school dropout rate has decreased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  to  earlier,  the  education  sector  continues  to  evolve.  Much 
<br/>groundwork  has  been  done  in  early  childhood  education,  special  inclusive  education,  primary 
<br/>education, secondary education and at tertiary level.  In theory, the Ministry of Education has a sound 
<br/>grounding to forge further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the three universities, there are 47 higher education institutions registered with 
<br/>the  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission.    To  name  a  few  includes  Fulton  College,  Corpus  Christi 
<br/>College,  Montfort  Boys  Town  Technical  College,  Centre  for  Appropriate  Technology  and 
<br/>Development, Vivekananda Technical College, Pacific Polytech Technical College, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  institutions  are  small  ones  mainly  involved  in  offering  quality 
<br/>Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programme.  The demand for skilled labour 
<br/>is highly a shortage in the country and there is an influx in the migration of skilled labourers out of 
<br/>Fiji.  As such it is imperative that these smaller institutions  are considered in the development of 
<br/>national education policy and the policy is not only influenced by the three universities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  took  oath  on  24</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  2022  for  taking  office  as  a  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament and in doing so, I solemnly and sincerely promised that I will defend the rule of law and 
<br/>the  rights  of  the  people  and  will  act  with  integrity  and  diligently  carry  out  my  responsibilities  in 
<br/>accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will, at all times, obey, observe, uphold and maintain the 2013 Constitution 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji which is the supreme law of our country, and all Fijians should uphold and 
<br/>respect  the  2013  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji.    I  believe  the  role  and  purpose  of  the 
<br/>Government  is  to  work  for  the  people  and  listen  to  the  people.    The  Government  should  remain 
<br/>focused on improving the lives of our families by making them safer, by ensuring they have quality 
<br/>education and health care and by protecting their environment and natural resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I look forward to working with all Members of this Chamber during this 
<br/></span><span>term of Parliament and will do all it takes to ensure that I do not fail in my responsibilities.  I wish 
<br/></span><span>all the honourable Members well.  May God bless our beautiful country Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>93 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.-  Honourable Speaker, Sir,  the  honourable Prime Minister, colleagues,  I 
<br/>wish to pay my respects to my elders and to our people and say, </span><span>ni bula vinaka</span><span> to all including those 
<br/>who are watching on television or livestream.  I pay tribute to the </span><span>vanua</span><span> and my </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> ancestors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  congratulate  all  Members  of  Parliament.  I  am  honoured  to  stand  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament as the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation in the Coalition 
<br/>Government and I am somewhat bewildered at the same time having a very short political career. I 
<br/>would like to thank National Federation Party, my family, friends and voters whose faith in me has 
<br/>brought me here.  I also wish to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his faith in me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to pay a special tribute to late Allen Lockington.  Allen was a citizen activist 
<br/>and humanitarian of rare dedication. He supported me among many other brothers in my campaign 
<br/>at a time when the political environment was very challenging for a late comer like me.  I wish to 
<br/>acknowledge the family of Mr. Sharda Reddy, sibling of late Shri Jai Ram Reddy who cocooned me 
<br/>during the campaign period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have come from the NGO sector.  Many people know about Foundation 
<br/>for Rural Integrated Enterprises and Development (FRIEND), the organisation I had founded with 
<br/>other committed people. I have more than two decades of experience working with rural communities 
<br/>and  vulnerable  families  to  provide  them  with  social  economic  and  health  empowerment 
<br/>opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Food security through organic agriculture and traditional food system has been a core part of 
<br/>the  work  I  have  been  involved  in.  My  work  with  FRIEND  has  taken  me  to  rural  and  peri-urban 
<br/>communities in the West, North, as well as the maritime areas.  This has given me many insights into 
<br/>challenges faced by communities. My experience also includes disaster response and rehabilitation 
<br/>as  well  as  trauma  healing  and  peace  building.  I  have  served  on  many  regional  and  international 
<br/>development boards over the last two decades that has also provided me with global perspectives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that experience, I hope to work with every sector and agency who can work with our 
<br/>Ministry to achieve our goals and targets.  Specifically these are income support to families to address 
<br/>poverty, policy interventions and improve services for older persons, people living with disabilities, 
<br/>beggars and people living with mental health challenges and various other wards of the state. I have 
<br/>always felt very invested in this country’s development. I strongly believe that through partnerships 
<br/>and using our existing skills and resources we can achieve sustainable development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I felt I was already in a space where I could plan and deliver definitive outcomes. All the 
<br/></span><span>people  asked  me  about  politics,  I  did  not  think  I  could  survive  in  a  Government  machinery  and 
<br/>bureaucracy and achieve the wins I wanted, but here I am and I guess time will tell. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My hope was on a FRIEND board member, the prominent lawyer and human rights activist, 
<br/>Mr. Richard Naidu to be in Parliament.  I was hoping that our many issues needing national attention 
<br/>could be raised through him.  However, political persecution of leaders like him, people who have 
<br/>committed their life to this nation forced me to change course.  Many issues that impacted our most 
<br/>vulnerable people had to be brought to national level.  The civil society sector was under attack from 
<br/></span><span>the  previous  Government,  even  though  we  were  trying  our  best  to  provide  relief  and  care  to 
<br/></span><span>communities in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, within days after the date of Election was announced, I walked out of the 
<br/>organisation I had created, and my political journey began.  Everything happened rather quickly but 
<br/>here I am.  I have a lot to learn about how the government machinery works - I find it rather slow I 
<br/>must say.  I accept that the Government must consult widely, and I know it must be accountable and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparent with its money.  I know that sometimes these things take time, but I would also like to 
<br/>find ways which we can be more nimble and responsive to the needs of our most vulnerable people.  
<br/>That is not easy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the pandemic, I worked extensively with the Commissioner Western’s Office to get 
<br/>resources to those affected by the pandemic as well as the natural disasters.  We worked across our 
<br/>networks with civil society organisations and faith-based organisations.  In those difficult days, we 
<br/>tried to support the Ministry of Health even while the Government attacked and belittled us, so I had 
<br/>some idea of the problems in the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  coming  into  office,  I  was  still  shocked  at  the  neglect  of  our  various 
<br/>government  facilities,  housing  to  some  of  our  most  vulnerable  people.    I  have  met  teams  at  our 
<br/>ministry  headquarters  and  in  the  field.    They  are  overworked  and  burnt  out.    Most  buildings  we 
<br/>occupy need urgent repairs, the air conditioning does not work, landlords getting regular rent seemed 
<br/>to be in no rush to fix the problems.  The IT systems do not work, many of the staff use their own 
<br/>recharge cards to call our clients.  They have to deal with child protection, domestic violence and 
<br/>social protection programs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each of these needs research and attention to individual humans, so there is a backlog because 
<br/>teams are overstretched.  We need better resourced teams, we are talking to various development 
<br/>partners looking for better ways to work together to improve our service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Ask the Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Clear up the mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- We have 94,600 recipients on social protection programs Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Our financial support is rarely enough to allow people to live a dignified life where they can 
<br/>meet if they had full potential.  For many, welfare support should be temporary to support them while 
<br/>they face challenges of unemployment or illness, but there is no program to help welfare recipients 
<br/>to move out of welfare and to new opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  hope  that  we  can  work  with  the  Ministry  of  Trade  with  the  support  towards  Micro 
<br/>Enterprises.  I would like us  to  do more with  the Ministry of Agricultures’ women in  agriculture 
<br/></span><span>program among others.  We need to find ways to empower the poor and create viable livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise and hear the feedback from our clients including our welfare 
<br/>partners that the Social Welfare schemes need review and reform.  We have global commitments to 
<br/>report  on  under  various  international  conventions  we  have  ratified.    But  these  have  to  match  the 
<br/>reality on the ground.  We have shocking rates of violence against women and children.  We have 
<br/>more street dwellers many with mental health challenges.  Easily accessible hard drugs are damaging 
<br/>our young population.  We do not have drug rehabilitation programs or facilities.  We are not focused 
<br/>on  our  growing  mental  health  crisis.    We  are  grateful  to  partners  like  St.  Vincent  de  Paul  and 
<br/></span><span>Veilomani Home that have stepped up to provide support to street dwellers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that NCD driven amputations are adding  weekly  numbers to  people living  with 
<br/>disabilities  which  means  we  must  work  with  the  Health  Ministry  to  develop  sustainable  care 
<br/>programmes.    
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>95 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Late  last  year,  the  previous  Government  announced  the  closure  of  Golden  Age  Home  in 
<br/>Lautoka with residents to be moved to Suva or Labasa.  We have reversed this decision, we have 
<br/>now secured the former Ba Mission Hospital as a new care facility.  However, we will be challenged 
<br/>to fund the necessary renovations, and this is my next priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to look at how we care for our children in our orphanages.  Girls 
<br/>must leave them at the age of 18 and they are often ill prepared for independent life.  The 12 year old 
<br/>boys are placed in alternative care.  I am really thankful that St Christopher’s Home is now building 
<br/>a facility to accommodate the boys. We have started working with Fiji Women Crisis Centre to cater 
<br/>for  girls  leaving  those  homes  to  upgrade  their  live  skills  and  finding  boarding  schools  for  their 
<br/>education.  Scholarship for tertiary education and foster homes will solve some of the challenges of 
<br/>these very vulnerable children, pathways to foster care would also be greatly beneficial.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful that our Prime Minister has announced Local Government 
<br/>elections this year.  This means we can begin to address many of the complaints I heard about during 
<br/>the election campaign. These include poor rubbish disposal and dump sites, poor drainage and stray 
<br/>dogs.  I ask our youth and women in particular, to rise to the occasion and become elected leaders in 
<br/>this local government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost all houses in Lautoka have been impacted in some way by the Asian 
<br/>subterranean termites infestation.  This infestation has spread to Nadi, Ba, Tavua and the Northern 
<br/>Division.  Many poor and vulnerable people are losing their homes to these infestations.  I wish to 
<br/>acknowledge this Government for recognising the challenge and committing to deal with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now want to talk about race relations and national unity.  We also, during 
<br/>and after the election, felt the politics of race being played.  Our people have paid dearly in the past 
<br/>decades for this.  I have closely witnessed the events of 2000 and I have worked with many impacted 
<br/>communities.  I started studying trauma healing and participated in some very difficult conversations.  
<br/>I grew up in a Indo-Fijian settlement, I had no education on cross cultural learning, so to try and 
<br/>understand the culture, fears and pain of the indigenous communities was a steep learning curve, I 
<br/>am still learning.   Even now both indigenous and Indo-Fijian communities feel that they are victims 
<br/>of the other.  They fear that the other will take away their resources or their sense of belonging.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I started on this journey, I was shocked and a little ashamed that how little I knew about 
<br/>indigenous culture.  I learnt that to build better understanding and improve race relations we need to 
<br/>review our history.  I have discovered that if we tried, we build stronger relationships and I wish to 
<br/></span><span>acknowledge the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Rewa and the </span><span>Gone Marama Bale Na</span><span> Roko Tui Dreketi – Ro Teimumu 
<br/></span><span>Kepa for enabling a healing journey to unfold in 2016.  This culminated in the ceremony by which  
<br/>the Indo-Fijian people of Fiji became the </span><span>luvedra</span><span> </span><span>Na</span><span> Ratu. I wish to pay tribute, to the </span><span>Turaga Na</span><span>
<br/>Tui Noco – the late Ratu Isoa Damudamu who gave us the descendants of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> his identity.  
<br/>His </span><span>I cavuti</span><span>, so we could truly belong to the </span><span>Vanua </span><span>of Viti.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the late </span><span>Momo Na</span><span> Tui Vitogo – Ratu Viliame Sovasova and 
<br/></span><span>Momo Na</span><span> Tui Tavua – the late Ratu Nacanieli Uqeuqe for leading the Vanua of Ba to a ceremony in 
<br/>2017,  where  they  gave  the  </span><span>kamunaga</span><span>  for  protection  to  the  descendants  of  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>,    I  pay  my 
<br/></span><span>tribute to and offer my condolences to the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Sukanacagi on the sad loss of the </span><span>Momo Na</span><span> Tui 
<br/></span><span>Vitogo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for generations to come are physical features will link us back to our proud 
<br/></span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> ancestors.  In the 1990s when I joined  the Board of International NGO CIVICUS one of 
<br/>its prominent leaders said he had only seen the rugby boys from Fiji. He said, “you do not look like 
<br/>them”.  I had to explain our </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> history to him.  Personally, I am quite comfortable with my

<div><span>identity as an Indo-Fijian.  A person of Indian origins who belongs to Fiji.  It is not a common name 
<br/>that gives me a sense belonging I ached for.  It is dialogue, learning and being accepted by the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.  
<br/>I  know  our  Coalition  Government  is  committed  to  nation  building,  healing  and  ensuring  that  all 
<br/>people in Fiji belong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I pray that day come soon when we are able to see beyond our ethnicity, to 
<br/>treat each other with humanity, love each other unconditionally and to build harmony.  We all owe 
<br/>it to our country to help build Fiji.  We all owe it to our values of humanity that no one sleeps hungry 
<br/>in our communities regardless of ethnicity.
