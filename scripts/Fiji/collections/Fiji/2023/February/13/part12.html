<h3>DEBATE ON HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS</h3>
<div><span>DEBATE ON HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the honour to move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That  this  Parliament  thanks  His  Excellency  the  President  for  his  most  gracious 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Address, 31 years after I moved this motion for the first time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise  as  the mover of this  motion, to  thank His 
<br/>Excellency the President for his most eloquent Address where he gave a very clear message that we 
<br/>must be united for the sake of our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  him  for  outlining  the  Executive’s  Mission,  Vision  and  key 
<br/>programmes and initiatives of the Government and its legislative agenda while opening Parliament 
<br/>on Friday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February this year. I congratulate honourable Members on both sides of Parliament for 
<br/>winning their seats at the December 14</span><span>th</span><span> General Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also send greetings to the chiefs, the leaders and the people of Fiji and 
<br/>thank all those candidates of the Government Coalition whose votes have allowed us to be elected 
<br/>with  a number of seats  that  the three  parties have won and formed Government  according to  our 
<br/>the  D’Hondt  Multi-Member  Open  List  of  Proportional 
<br/>constitutional  provision 
<br/>Representation in a Single Natural Electoral Roll of all registered voters according to Section 53 of 
<br/>our 2013 Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>therein, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the People’s Coalition Government and the Opposition have many 
<br/>differences, we have a shared common interest, a common duty and that is the welfare of our people 
<br/>and policies and measures that will benefit the people and the nation as a whole.  There are many 
<br/>opportunities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Government and Opposition to adopt a united approach on 
<br/>certain issues and jointly develop legislation and pursue other initiatives for the common good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  had  hoped  we  could  work  together  on  policies  to  better  protect  our  children,  eliminate 
<br/>violence  against  women,  improve  services  in  our  municipalities,  provide  better  opportunities  and 
<br/>inspire  our  sports  people,  alleviate  the  level  of  poverty  et  cetera,  the  resolution  of  many  of  our 
<br/>national  challenges  could  draw  on  the  combined  wisdom  and  efforts  of  all  Members  of  this 
<br/>honourable Parliament.  I give an assurance that we in Government will continue to ensure that our 
<br/></span><span>democracy functions properly and fulfil our democratic obligations to all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the proper and efficient functioning of the Government in serving the 
<br/>people and the country, our Civil Service is very, very important.  In recognition of that pivotal role 
<br/>of  our  civil  servants,  a  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  and  the  Public  Service  Commission  are  the 
<br/>responsibilities of the Prime Minister.  The core values of the service will be strengthened through 
<br/>the PSC and the Ministry.  Our intention is also to improve planning, accountability, efficiency to 
<br/>ultimately lift the standards of service to all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  its  first  month  in  office,  your  Government  has  amended  the  Civil  Service  (General) 
<br/></span><span>Regulations to deliver on two critical policy changes. The first was to increase the retirement  age 
<br/>from 55 to 60.  This will give Fiji a greater return from institutional knowledge, experience and skills. 
<br/>It also caters to the aspirations and the needs of our hardworking civil servants.  Due to shortages of 
<br/>teachers, nurses and doctors, the increase in retirement age for them is effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 
<br/>2022.  For the other occupational categories, the amendment is effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our second major initiative is the removal of contractual appointments.  This provides civil 
<br/>servants with a long-term security of employment which they very much need.  Consultations are 
<br/>ongoing for the full implementation of this policy - the policy which represents virtual permanent 
<br/>employment across the Public Service governed by the usual terms and conditions.  We look forward 
<br/>to improving morale and productivity in the Public Service once this policy is fully implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PSC, with the assistance of the Ministry, will develop guidelines and policies to provide 
<br/>better cohesion and coordination throughout the service, consistent with our determination to enhance 
<br/>performance to benefit Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PSC will be given greater autonomy, greater responsibility within its 
<br/>constitutional  mandate.    This  is  to  ensure  impartiality  and  integrity  in  recruitment,  remuneration, 
<br/>professional development and in addressing grievances and disputes.  The Ministry will engage with 
<br/>all  government  agencies  and  development  partners  in  providing  training  and  career  growth 
<br/>opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the re-establishment of the Higher Salaries Commission will lead to greater 
<br/>consistency in setting and administering remuneration of senior civil servants and CEOs of State-
<br/>Owned Enterprises.  Compliance with international best practices will ensure that senior civil service 
<br/>executives are remunerated fairly and equitably.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recent  revelations  about  certain  public  and  state-owned  enterprises  have  generated  many 
<br/>interest and debate in the media and in the community.  Some disclosures have raised red flags and 
<br/>highlighted  the  need  for  greater  scrutiny  and  accountability  by  executives  and  directors  in  these 
<br/>enterprises.  These entities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are involved in food processing, agriculture, livestock, 
<br/>timber, farming and fisheries; postal, trustee and financial services; broadcasting,  airport operations 
<br/>and biosecurity.  State-owned enterprises relate to aviation, sugar, banking, housing, forestry, energy, 
<br/>digital television, and airport services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Coalition Government invited Expressions of Interest for Board 
<br/>Appointments,  over  1,200  applications  were  received.    It  is  imperative  that  the  right  people  are 
<br/>appointed to Boards on merit.  Board membership must also reflect the dynamics of our population 
<br/>diversity.  Some appointments have already been made.  With the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation, 
<br/>it  was  imperative  that  a  new  Board  be  appointed,  given  the  resignation  of  the  previous  Board 
<br/>members.  The same applied to the Fiji  Development Bank, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where resignations 
<br/>prevented the meeting of the Board due to a lack of quorum.  The meeting was urgently required to 
<br/></span><span>seek a guarantee extension which will be tabled in this honourable Parliament later this week as the 
<br/></span><span>current guarantee expires soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, directors and employees of statutory bodies and  state-owned enterprises 
<br/>will be required to observe appropriate standards of conduct, performance, ethics and act within the 
<br/>law.  The aim is to lift profitability and sustainability and ensure diligent control.  In this regard, it is 
<br/>critical that timely annual reports are produced.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for announcing those 
<br/>Standing Committees and Select Committees; they will be very busy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  light  of  publicity  about  excessive  remunerations,  the  re-establishment  of  the  Higher 
<br/></span><span>Salaries  Commission  will  set  guidelines  for  salaries  and  benefits  for  CEOs  and  other  high-level 
<br/>executives.  The Commission will also be the responsible agency to ensure the consistency of salaries 
<br/>and benefits for CEOs, for State-Owned enterprises and statutory bodies, rather than the prior Prime 
<br/>Minister and the Attorney-General as had been the case between 2011 and 2022.  We want to ensure 
<br/>that these are realistic and appropriate for the demand in the labour market.  At the same time, there 
<br/>must be consistency and transparency.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to our foreign relations, I prioritised rebuilding regional unity 
<br/>as Chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum, a position I inherit from the former Prime Minister.  The 
<br/>State visit to Kiribati and the meeting with His Excellency the President, Taneti Maamau, three weeks 
<br/>ago was very successful.  The aim was to find a path for Kiribati to re-join the Forum family after 
<br/>their withdrawal last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A united Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is better placed to protect the interests of our region.  
<br/>This is especially significant at a time of international manoeuvring for big power influence in the 
<br/>Pacific and the common challenges we face, in particular, climate change problems.  His Excellency, 
<br/>President Maamau and I also agreed on various measures to improve and strengthen the Fiji-Kiribati 
<br/>bilateral relationship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government has also prioritised mending our relationship with the University 
<br/>of the South Pacific, the most successful example of co-operation in our region.  We will make an 
<br/>initial payment to begin reducing our significant debt left with the USP, and we will do that later this 
<br/>week.  I am glad the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pal Ahluwalia has returned to Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and I look forward to meeting him later this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  I  intend  to  review  the  closure  of  some  key  diplomatic 
<br/>missions in key strategic locations.  The decision, I believe, worked against our interests, particularly 
<br/>at this time where Fiji needs to engage more effectively with our strategic partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  support  given  by  our 
<br/>development  partners  in  helping  to  make  the  Black  Rock  Facility  in  Votualevu,  Nadi,  fully 
<br/>operational.  I thank the former Government for their effort in the establishment of that.  This will 
<br/>surely enhance and strengthen our regional disaster response capabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia and New Zealand remain key strategic partners.  We will continue to strengthen our 
<br/>relationship  with  the  United  States  of  America  while  continuing  co-operation  with  the  People’s 
<br/>Republic of China, respecting our mutual understanding of the ‘One China Policy’ and respecting 
<br/>our national sovereign rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our long-standing relationship with India continues to grow from strength to strength.  We 
<br/>are  keen  to  further  develop  bilateral  and  multilateral  relations  with  Asia  and  the  Middle  East, 
<br/>particularly  with  Israel,  while  we  consolidate  partnership  with  the  European  Union,  the  United 
<br/></span><span>Kingdom and other countries that share our common interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change and the environment is now under the portfolio of the Prime 
<br/>Minister.  The hallmarks of climate change are global warming (as we all know), rising sea levels (as 
<br/>we all see), pollution and more frequent and the increasing intensity of adverse weather conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issues that confront us here at home continue to be: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>polluted shorelines and coastal areas, such as the Laucala Bay and Draunibota Bay in Lami; 
<br/></span><span>clogged drains and waterways, leading to regular flooding; 
<br/></span><span>Suva Harbour is the graveyard for rusting wrecks and abandoned ships; 
<br/>contaminated marine life and related threats to human life; 
<br/>rural and urban landscapes polluted by thousands of tonnes of dumped rubbish and waste, 
<br/>including mountains of plastic; 
<br/></span><span>toxic emissions from buses and other vehicles; 
<br/></span><span>widespread destruction of mangroves; and  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>seawater  intrusion  into  coastal  villages  which  require  relocation  to  higher  ground,  an 
<br/>expensive and culturally very sensitive exercise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  not  yet  have  a  specific  masterplan  to  holistically  address  these 
<br/>environmental problems, but we are starting to look at opportunities and the possibilities of donor 
<br/>support to help us in that big exercise.  I will be recommending a study to be carried out in recycling 
<br/>which will minimise pollution.  It will also reduce solid waste and protect the environment.  I note 
<br/>with interest, Sir, that Tourism Fiji is now expressing an interest in waste management and recycling, 
<br/>and I commend them for that.There is a need for expensive public consultation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 
<br/>the  problems  of  pollution  and  environmental  damage.    This  will  also  be  on  the  agenda  for  the 
<br/>upcoming  National  Economic  Summit  or  the  People’s  Forum  sometime  in  April.    Individual 
<br/>government agencies are also initiating clean-up programmes around the country, and I encourage 
<br/>all of us in this august Parliament to participate where and when we can. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  portfolio  also  includes  Information,  meaning  the  media  and  its 
<br/>operations.  As Prime  Minister, I have made it clear that the Government  is  totally committed to 
<br/>allowing the nation the freedom of the press.  That will include the review of the Media Industry 
<br/>Development Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe we cannot have proper democracy without a free press which has 
<br/>been described as the oxygen of democracy.  We depend on newspapers, television, radio and other 
<br/>electronic and digital forms of communication for information and news.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Citizens  must  be  informed,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  about  events  and  developments  in  society.  
<br/>Otherwise, they cannot truly fulfil their democratic obligations to give their views and participate in 
<br/>governance and general debate.An active and free press creates a progressive society.  It is a self-
<br/>correcting mechanism for a free and fair society.  Admission of national wrongs is part of that, so is 
<br/>the ability to learn from mistakes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will carefully study the arrangements by which 
<br/>one of our daily newspapers had received substantial amount of public funds for advertising over 
<br/>more than one-and-a-half decade.  We are also interested in the connection between that money and 
<br/>the newspaper’s servile admiration of, and bias towards the government of that era.  It was no more 
<br/>than a propaganda paper.  The Coalition Government has given an assurance that we will end that 
<br/>era of media oppression.  We are discussing new legislation reflecting democratic values.  There is 
<br/>also  discussion about  establishing a system  of self-regulation,  underpinned by a code of conduct, 
<br/>with a media council to adjudicate complaints by the public about media coverage as was the case 
<br/>before 2006.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After the election results of December 2022, the atmosphere in Fiji has changed dramatically.  
<br/>The climate of fear has gone.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his Address, His Excellency called for Fiji to be 
<br/>united as one nation we all call home.  We need to be united.  Those words resonate with me, with 
<br/>us, and with the entire population.  Fiji is home to us all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That leads me to the question of our national identity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I had previously 
<br/></span><span>stated that I favoured “Fijian” as our common name, however, I always knew that the question of a 
<br/></span><span>common name is a difficult one.  It is not a simple matter.  The commentary by lawyer Graham Leung 
<br/>in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> on Saturday dealt very well with the complexities involved.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are reaping what the former Government sowed in its 2013 Constitution, 
<br/>our national constitution of today.  It declared that we were all Fijians but did so without consultation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that should have taken place on such an important and sensitive national matter.  I am fully aware 
<br/>that many indigenous Fijians are less than persuaded.  Others too have divergent views.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recently mentioned the possibility of a referendum.  It is an option, but there may be other 
<br/>ways to proceed.  I am going to add to this debate by briefly quoting social media comments made 
<br/>by  Mr.  Ranjan  Charan,  a  People’s  Alliance  supporter  in  Ba.    He  argues  that  we  will  not  get 
<br/>togetherness  by  imposing  the  name  “Fijian”  on  everyone.    He  suggests  more  discussion  on  the 
<br/>common name.  He said, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I am convinced that we have enough good leaders on both sides of the House to get 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to a result that is acceptable to all.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> gentlemen from the West also said, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “Had the Fijians been consulted via their chiefs and others, they would have shared the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>name willingly.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He further stated, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There is no doubt in my heart that being the kind and accepting people that they 
<br/>are, the iTaukei will bestow on everyone the dignity of a common national identity in the 
<br/>term “Fijian”. All you need to do is to politely ask them.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  of  Veteran  Affairs  is  now  under  the  Prime  Minister’s 
<br/>purview. It will be in consultation with the Boards of the Ex-Servicemen and the Returned Sailors 
<br/>and Servicemen Association that I will be developing welfare papers for their benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National  unity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  complex  matter.    I  have  worked  very  hard  across 
<br/>boundaries to bring people together.  I worked in the Solomons, I worked in Nepal, and I will continue 
<br/>to do so here in Fiji. We all now belong to these islands.  Our national mission is for a society of 
<br/>equality, fairness and justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  hope  I  have  shared  some  food  for  thought  and  democratic  discussion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect, I commend the motion to Parliament. God bless us all and God bless Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-   Honourable Members, please  take note that we will  follow the  Batting 
<br/>Order accordingly.  Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I, at this 
<br/>juncture, wish to adjourn Parliament so we could take morning tea. When we resume, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition will be taking the floor.  Sir, we will also be flexible in allowing more time 
<br/>since you have requested for more time to deliver your response to His Excellency’s Address.  Thank 
<br/>you, honourable Members, we now adjourn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.32 a.m.

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.10 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Parliament that I speak in this morning 
<br/>is not the Parliament that it was last year.  The Fiji that I speak in today is not the Fiji of 55 days ago.  
<br/>Today’s Fiji  does  not  care to  follow the rule of the law.   It  is  a Fiji  where the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, his Attorney-General and his Ministers do not follow the Constitution which brought them 
<br/>to this Parliament in the first place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- They make their rules and disregard the law as and when it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suits them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  Parliament  where  the  Speaker  without  following  the  Standing  Orders  without 
<br/>debate,  has  decided  that  parliamentarians  can  speak  in  languages  other  than  English  and  say  a 
<br/>Christian prayer excluding those of other faiths - a complete defiance of the Standing Orders and the 
<br/>spirit of the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Same rhetoric. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- We have a Judiciary where the sitting Chief Justice has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suspended for frivolous matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- We have Independent Constitutional Officers forced to resign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or suspended with no regard for the Constitution and their independence and due process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Very poor, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  intelligent,  diligent  and 
<br/>professional civil servants removed, terminated, suspended and sidelined without rhyme or reason or 
<br/>due process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- We have our regulatory processes being eroded and illegal 
<br/>directives  are  issued  because  Ministers,  their  political  cronies  and  newly  appointed  civil  servants 
<br/>believe that their interests supersedes the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the honourable Prime Minister almost every second day stating how he will remove 
<br/>the Constitution and thinking of circumventing proper procedures laid out in the Constitution itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Reading </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> too much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  We  have  the  Rabuka-led  three  uneven  legged  stool 
<br/>Government  stating  its  intention  to  dismantle  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption 
<br/>(FICAC) even though there is a constitutional necessity for its existence.  His Government is ignoring

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the fact that we have ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the fact that we 
<br/>need  such  an  independent  body  to  eradicate  systemic  corruption  and  hold  all  public  officers 
<br/>accountable  and  maintain  our  credibility  with  our  donors,  bilateral  partners  and  multi-lateral 
<br/>development banks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have Ministers in the three uneven legged stool Government directly or indirectly stating 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the policies they promised during their campaign will now not be delivered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- One recently stated that those announcements were made in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the heat of the moment.  It was one of the three Deputy Prime Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Same old thing coming from the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Very poor.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  By  the  way,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  three  Deputy  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministers for a country of our size is a global record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  every  single  Member  of  the  three  uneven  legged  stool 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is a Minister or Assistant Minister.  Indeed, a record for Fiji… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Not resigning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … and perhaps even for the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Everyone is running away from you, look in the mirror! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  would  appear  that  buying  loyalty  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bribing one to obtain loyalty is the new norm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Even when no one is there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Civil servants including permanent secretaries, teachers and 
<br/>those  in  Government  related  companies  are  no  longer  recruited,  appointed  or  promoted  on 
<br/>objectivity, impartiality … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.- Talk about yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … and fair competition, ability, education, experience …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Talking about yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … and other characteristics of merit.

<div><span>It  is  now  who  you  know,  your  ethnic  group,  your  province,  whether  you  are  a  political 
<br/>supporter or crony, how much you flatter the powers that be or even perhaps how much money you 
<br/>may have paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- We now have an environment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are worried to speak openly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not kidding. They believe… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  …  they  will  be  subjected  to  unjustified  and  illegal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accusations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Freedom of expression is under threat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You know what you are talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Can you shut up?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Freedom of expression is under threat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Social  media  is  vile  and  toxic.  Supporters  of  these  three 
<br/>uneven legged stool Government are making extremely racist and religiously chauvinistic comments 
<br/>... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … and indeed threats and getting away with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Rubbish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shameful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- For example? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  These  are  even  on  pages  on  those  who  can  remove  those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comments but it is allowed to be perpetuated for the sake of political expediency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Shameful. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government and supporters who are dividing Fiji so rapidly that it is shacking our Constitutional 
<br/>safeguard of common and equal citizenry to its core. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what you have been saying all along.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- That is one for you honourable Prof. Biman Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Yet, only those who seemingly making comments, critical of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Government are threatened or hauled in … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … by the police or have a illegal stop departure orders or are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monitored or declared persons of interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.-  Look at yourself in the mirror. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- The farce of the comment “let love shine” is the biggest con 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- It is a hoax, idiotic and hypocritical of the highest degree. It 
<br/>is  very sickening  because as in  the 80s and early 90s, what  is  said  is  exactly opposite to  what  is 
<br/>happening on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  brief  context  within  which  His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji opened Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know when we were in Government and you were in Opposition, the then 
<br/></span><span>Opposition  had  chastised  and  berated  previous  presidential  statements  because  of  political 
<br/></span><span>motivations.  I do so today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not for political reasons but because His Excellency the 
<br/>President has failed to protect the Constitution, the rule of law and failed to halt the resultant chaos 
<br/>that is insidiously and rapidly creeping in and the impending disaster that is going to befall upon  our 
<br/>beloved country… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What a shame, the President is there because of you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … that will fall upon our people, upon our economy and upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji as Head of State in 
<br/>whom rests the executive authority of the State and who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji Military Forces failed to acknowledge the fact that the very Constitution which he is supposed 
<br/>to uphold is being stripped away almost on a daily basis.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- He’s receiving free and in impartial advice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- As the Commander-in-Chief, he has failed to provide proper 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>guidance to the RFMF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  short,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  who  previously  espoused  to  subscribe  to  the  values  of  the 
<br/>Constitution has now tragically ignored the mockery that the Rabuka-led Government has made of 
<br/>constitutional democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2014,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  maiden  speech,  I  thanked  my  wife,  children  and 
<br/>grandchildren and today my great granddaughter.  I had also thanked my parents who imbibed me 
<br/>with values I hold dear of love for family, love of community and love of country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Today,  I thank them  all.  I grew up  -  thanks largely  to  my 
<br/>parents  and  brothers  at  Marist  Brothers  High  School,  committed  to  the  notion  of  Fiji  as  one  big 
<br/>multiracial family in which everyone belongs to and everyone deserves substantive equal treatment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. V. BAINIMARAMA.-  I have always tried to  see my  fellow citizens through the 
<br/>prism of their own personality and character rather than their ethnic background or religious belief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- It does not matter to me who you are or what you believe in.  
<br/>What is most important to me is whether you are honest, courageous, compassionate, stand up for 
<br/>what is right, protect the vulnerable and treat the people the way you would like to be treated yourself 
<br/>with consideration and respect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I passionately believe in one Fiji in which everyone belongs and no one gets left behind  - 
<br/>putting our nation’s interests before ourselves and defending our unity as a nation against those who 
<br/>wish to divide us.  This is why I always want to pay tribute to my colleagues in the military.  For 
<br/>those  of  us  in  the  military  in  2006,  who  passionately  believed  in  national  unity,  came  to  the 
<br/>conclusion that the fabric of our nation was unravelling, and that the only radical intervention would 
<br/></span><span>enable us to pick up the threads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thus, the </span><span>coup.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- We had all gone through the trauma of 2000 and the mutiny 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that had caused us so much pain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Actions speak louder than words. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Sitiveni Rabuka then and now Prime Minister made a guest 
<br/></span><span>appearance during the mutiny with his fully pressed uniform, lurking to pick up the spoils but he was 
<br/>chased away when he was caught hiding under the table.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>35 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Subsequent to those events, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it became quite 
<br/>apparent rather quickly that those same racist and corrupt persons who were involved in the removal 
<br/>of the Chaudhry Government in 2000 had reared their heads again.  We had no choice, we took the 
<br/>tough decision necessary to keep Fiji united - we prevented large numbers of our people from being 
<br/>relegated to second or third class citizens, halted the spiralling out of control corruption and elitism, 
<br/>the rise in provincialism and began the task of reforming our society from the ground up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Only a radical intervention in 2006 was capable of getting Fiji back on track, of establishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>once and for all the universal democratic principle that all men and women are equal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Before 2006, that was simply not the case in Fiji, but under 
<br/>our current Constitution, it is.  We have a Constitution that not only guarantees genuine equality and 
<br/>democracy, but also provides Fijians with the range of unprecedented socio-economic rights.  It puts 
<br/>in place institutions that will not only address the issues of systematic corruption, but also provide 
<br/>unprecedented levels of accountability and transparency in public life and institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Republic of Fiji Military Forces for supporting the 2006 
<br/>reform process.  I wish to thank them for carrying out its duty in 2006 to be the ultimate guarantor of 
<br/>our national security of holding Fiji together and for the personal support I received as Commander 
<br/>and  those  around  me,  those  patriots  who  shared  my  vision  of  a  united  Fiji.    It  was  through  the 
<br/>unwavering  and  unassailable  support  of  the  RFMF  and  the  public  support  garnered  through 
<br/>nationwide consultations that led to the introduction of a genuine democracy, to lead the fight against 
<br/>corruption, tackle the self-serving elite and offer a vision of an inclusive nation with fairness and 
<br/>justice for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  And  all  of  this  was  done  through  our  Constitution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promulgated in September, 2013.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to inform the rank and file of the RFMF that all the 
<br/>philosophical  commitment  and  years  of  hard  work  of  the  RFMF  is  now  being  undermined  and 
<br/>disregarded by this Government.  Fijians, in particular, the weak and vulnerable, those who want 
<br/></span><span>actual and practical implementation of the rule of law, those who want the practical implementation 
<br/></span><span>of the Constitution and those Fijians who want socio-economic stability all look up to the RFMF to 
<br/>guarantee this, if and when it is under threat.  I appeal to the rank and file of the RFMF to preserve 
<br/>their manna, to maintain their credibility and calling and not forsake their Constitutional role.  I also 
<br/>wish to inform RFMF that its gift and legacy, the Fijian Constitution is being ignored and bashed on 
<br/>a daily basis and the current Prime Minister wants what the RFMF worked so hard for, removed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the President spoke about ILO Convention 169.  I remember when he was 
<br/>the President of FijiFirst, we had discussed numerous times about how the ethno-nationalists want to 
<br/></span><span>use 169 to justify the suppression of rights of others and to use it to advance elitism in Fiji.  It has 
<br/></span><span>come back now.  We had also discussed how 169 was meant not for the countries like Fiji, but for 
<br/>those indigenous people who had faced genocide, had lost their lands, their lands pillaged and taken 
<br/>away and their people raped and killed off.  We had also discussed how it was not applicable in the 
<br/>Fijian context, therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was surprised that he so easily rolled over and gave in to 
<br/>this Government’s ethno-nationalist agenda.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  The  Fijian  Constitution  protects  and  recognises  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indigenous people of this country … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear! hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Rotumans.  It recognises their uniqueness.  
<br/>It protects their lands and the ownership of their lands.  It absolutely stopped the permanent alienation 
<br/>of indigenous land unlike the 1990 and 1997 Constitutions which allowed for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land to be 
<br/>converted  to  freehold  when  Rabuka  and  Qarase  were  Prime  Ministers  under  the  SVT  and  SDL 
<br/>governments respectively.  Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this almost xenophobic and whipped-up inward 
<br/>looking fervour are at the expense of an inclusive society, and at the expense of a Constitution which 
<br/>states that all citizens are Fijians, but we have a Prime Minister who refuses to call citizens of this 
<br/>country  Fijians.    They  have  even  gone  to  the  extent  of  changing  the  Government  </span><span>Facebook</span><span>  and 
<br/>webpage from Fijian Government to Fiji Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- That is how ridiculous it has become.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- It reminds me of a joke about Harry in one of the villages in 
<br/>the Western Division but I will come to that sometime later on.  This is how regressive a society, a 
<br/>country we have become, rather amusingly the billboard promoting the World Hindi Conference - 
<br/>the conference facilitated under FijiFirst refers to the Fijian Government as the Fiji Government and 
<br/>the Government  of  India as the  Indian Government.   We have become  a  laughing stock.  We no 
<br/>longer have a matured government that feels confident enough to call itself the Fijian Government 
<br/>but can call other governments Australian, American, Indian and British Government – how petty, 
<br/>how pathetic, how immature and how insecure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Pathetic! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recent  FBC  saga  epitomises  the  disaster  and  chaos  that  is  unfolding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rather rapidly under this incompetent Rabuka-led Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Look forward, look forward, it is getting boring! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- This debacle which FBC epitomizes the manner in which this 
<br/>Government conduct itself, it is all over the place, it is amateurish and it is beholden to an ethno-
<br/>nationalist agenda and a bunch of incompetent people.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the 
<br/></span><span>matanigasau</span><span> farce - it is making a mockery of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amount of </span><span>matanigasau</span><span>, </span><span>sevusevu, salusalu</span><span> we have seen in the past 
<br/>few weeks can be summarised as not only self-glorification but the denigration and commodification 
<br/>of</span><span> iTaukei</span><span> culture.  The Rabuka Government wants to go back in time to ministerial portfolios that 
<br/>are no longer applicable in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century but they will do it come what may, because it is all about 
<br/>themselves individually not about the country or the organisations.

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You do not know your culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- And if their actions will cause social disruptions, they will 
<br/>still do it.  It is dogma.  For example, in their quest to get PWD come what may, they have already 
<br/>cost hundreds of job losses for those working for Fijian and foreign companies.  They will cause 
<br/>extra burden on government finances, they will increase the operational costs of the government, 
<br/>they  will  remove  modern  techniques,  engineering  standards  and  professionalism  and  they  have 
<br/>already  caused  grave  concern  amongst  the  multilateral  development  banks,  bilateral  partners  and 
<br/>specialised  UN bodies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Your disaster.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- $11 billion is too much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  They  want  to  use  the  churches  to  justify  this  agenda,  an 
<br/>anathema to the Constitution.  In all of this, the President who we looked up to because we believed 
<br/>that he genuinely believed the values and principles of the Constitution, has done an about turn.  He 
<br/>has failed the Fijian people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- He found out the truth! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  He  has  failed  the  Fijian  people  and  he  will  go  down  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>history… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- He listened to advice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … as the person who aided and abetted the most incompetent 
<br/>and divisive government - a government set out to destroy constitutional democracy and in a modern, 
<br/>inclusive and progressive Fiji that the RFMF and FijiFirst worked so hard for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- The chaos</span><span> </span><span>continues on this new dawn government where a 
<br/>permanent dusk seems to be falling on all fronts.  The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>Two are at loggerheads over the question of a mini budget.  The Fijian public are further subjected 
<br/>to  frightening  information  about  the  PM’s  secret  think  tank  group  who  without  any  proper 
<br/></span><span>appointment or authority, subject countless civil servants with illegal daily instructions which are 
<br/></span><span>only followed because of the fear or threats of phone tapping and victimisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government, Mr. Speaker, continues to appoint their cronies and failed candidates for 
<br/>jobs  and  two  jobs  without  these  positions  being  advertised  or  applications  and  interviews  being 
<br/>undertaken.  Parmesh Chand, who we understand failed twice to be appointed by the previous PSC 
<br/>is now PS of Civil Service and Pita Wise, advisor to the People’s Alliance Party is now the PS in the 
<br/>PM’s Office.    Both  men occupy these posts without any proper recruitment  process  provided for 
<br/>under the Constitution.  Another act of hypocrisy and corruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- The "love-all” Rabuka Government does not see the irony in 
<br/>constantly preaching  about  freedom  of speech, free media and lecturing  Fijians about  not  fearing 
<br/>anyone, but at the same time taking in activists and following lawyers and journalists at night, and 
<br/>stopping  them,  and  questioning  them,  Gestapo  Nazi  style  because  they  are  apparently  persons  of

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interest.  All of this, under the watch of the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, 
<br/>who it appears is now the </span><span>de facto</span><span> Commissioner of Police.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  under  the  Fijian  Constitution  everyone  is  free  to  practice  their  religion.  I 
<br/>remember when we had prayers in this Parliament last year, when the Speaker used to say Amen, 
<br/>Members used to say </span><span>Jisu</span><span>, they were free to do so and no one stopped them.  But the Speaker cannot 
<br/>make that part of his formal prayer because he has to be neutral.  He has to be inclusive.  In the same 
<br/>way Government must be neutral, must be inclusive, not exclusive.  Listen Biman!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Your </span><span>de facto</span><span> leader must have written your speech.  We know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  That  is  how  you  build  a  strong  and  united  nation.    Very 
<br/>simple, very just, very fair and very Christian.  Christ never thrusted himself onto others.  Christ was 
<br/>loving.  Christ taught love.  Christ never imposed.  Christ loved Jews and Gentiles alike.  Christ did 
<br/>not  rebuke people who came from  different  tribes, different  ethnicities, different  religions, Christ 
<br/>loved all because we are all God’s children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I want  all  Fijians irrespective of their backgrounds to  understand what  I  am 
<br/>saying, and I know most do.  I do not expect the Prime Minister, his three deputy PMs, his ministers 
<br/>or assistant ministers to accept or embrace this teaching of Christ.  To them, Christ’s teachings are to 
<br/>be  used,  distorted  and  abused  for  their  ethnic  and  political  agenda  and  personal  and  political 
<br/>advancement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that FijiFirst is the largest single political party in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- The next two largest political parties combined, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>could not get more seats than FijiFirst.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- It had to take the smallest party with three seats joining them 
<br/>for  honourable  Rabuka  to  become  Prime  Minister  and  all  29  to  become  Ministers  and  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You destroyed everything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, to be the largest party in Parliament meant that 
<br/></span><span>we received singularly the most votes.  It also meant that I, as the leader of FijiFirst had nearly double 
<br/>the number of votes than the current Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Wrong voting system!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- It also meant that many Fijians from all walks of life, from 
<br/>all parts of Fiji supported FijiFirst.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank our supporters, volunteers, 
<br/>all our candidates elected and unelected, all the families, the young and old, men and women and our 
<br/>General Secretary who all combined to make our electoral campaign a success. We will be meeting 
<br/>and reaching out to you on a regular basis starting with our own get together with our supporters this 
<br/>Saturday at 2.00 p.m. at Tilak High School, Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  pay  tribute  to  the  former  Supervisor  of  Elections,  a  professional  with 
<br/>international acclaim and a man who proficiently conducted three successful elections.  I wish to also 
<br/>thank the Electoral Commissioners and all the relevant development and bilateral partners, including 
<br/>the co-Chairs, Australia, India and Indonesia of the Multinational Observer Group (MOG), who all 
<br/>ensured that we successfully conducted the 2022 General Election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, thank you and God Bless all Fijians and Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please be reminded to keep to the timing so as to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure that we all participate in the delivery of the maiden speeches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and to all the people of Fiji joining us through televised broadcast 
<br/>around the world via Parliament </span><span>Facebook </span><span>live, ni sa yadra vinaka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  join  other  Members  of  Parliament  in  congratulating  you  on  your 
<br/>election  as  Speaker  of  this  august  Parliament  and  of  the  Deputy  Speaker,  honourable  Lenora 
<br/>Qereqeretabua on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, this date has a lot of significance for me 
<br/>not only because it was the day I was sworn in as a Member of Parliament but because it was also 
<br/>the first time I entered this esteemed Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a researcher working at the Office of the Leader of Opposition, I would only come as far 
<br/>as the corridors of this august Parliament to deliver printed documents and resource materials for the 
<br/>Members.  Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sitting in this august Parliament as a Member of Parliament 
<br/>and an Assistant Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the party leader of the People’s Alliance Party and our 
<br/></span><span>current honourable Prime Minister, for trusting me to be part of his candidate line-up in the 2022 
<br/>General Elections.  A lot has been said about the outcome of the recent General Elections but one 
<br/>thing I know for sure is that the people of Ra have been crying for change for far too long and have 
<br/>now rejoiced in the fact that two of their own are representatives in this august Parliament.  After the 
<br/>2014 and then the 2018 General Elections, no representatives from my province in Ra made it to 
<br/>Parliament.  I was studying in Japan in 2018 and saw how the outcome of the election unveiled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the years followed saw discrepancies in our political system, the lack of 
<br/></span><span>consultation  and  the  urgent  need  to  review  draconian  legislations  and  policies  that  governed  all 
<br/></span><span>aspects of Government machineries.  Almost a decade later, a daring daughter, wife and a mother 
<br/>from Nabalabala Saivou in Ra decided that it was high time that the voices of our people had to be 
<br/>heard and represented in this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  look  back  and  I  attest  to  God  faithfulness  and  in  no  way  was  my 
<br/>appointment as a Researcher at the Office of the Leader of Opposition, an accident. Who would have

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>known?  Only God knows. Just as He had assured us in his word in Proverbs 19: 21, I quote: “That 
<br/>we may have many plans in our hearts, but it is his purpose that always prevails”.  I would like to 
<br/>thank my Heavenly Father, the mighty God I serve, for His sense of direction and guidance and for 
<br/>granting me the strength and wisdom to be where I am today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank </span><span>Na Turaga Bale na Tui Ca’au </span><span>for his foresight and 
<br/>words  of  wisdom  and  encouragement.    </span><span>Vina‘a  va‘alevu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Sir.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  His 
<br/>Excellency for his most gracious Address and sharing with our beloved nation our plans and policies 
<br/>going forward as the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the Debate on the 
<br/>Opening Address of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili 
<br/>Katonivere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of people that I wish to acknowledge as they have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very instrumental in my upbringing and in my journey in fulfilling my political aspirations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My late paternal grandparents - Bubu Matia and Bubu Vula, who raised me up when I was 
<br/>at a tender age of three, living with them in the village, and taught me a lot of lifelong 
<br/>survival skills and familiarised myself with my kinship ties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My late maternal grandmother, Nau Siteri, who lived and looked after us in our home as 
<br/>my parents were sometimes away on duty travel and cooked delicious homecooked meals 
<br/>for us.  My children were blessed to have known their great grandmother who, at times, 
<br/>took the liberty of looking after them as well. 
<br/>I wish to thank a special person who recently passed, my Nau Salusalu, who offered to raise 
<br/>my three-month old daughter when I had to leave for studies in Japan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My husband, Aminiasi, from Tabuya, Nabukelevu in Kadavu, who has been my number 
<br/>one support in my political journey right from day one, encouraging me along the way and 
<br/>reminding me that nothing good comes easy, and if God is for us, who can be against us?  
<br/>Thank you for your love and all that you do Tamai Sakiusa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My children whom I love dearly - Sakiusa, Sanaila, Ruth, Vasiti, Lilian, Aloesi kei Dee and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Makereta. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My parents, Ralulu and Penina Cirikiyasawa, for their endless support and their assistance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in assisting me in my campaign trail - I thank them sincerely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My  siblings  -  Qoli,  Cagi,  Tuti,  Sera,  Paula  and  Vasiti,  for  their  financial  support  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>encouragement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mr. and Mrs. Senimili Bainivalu, I thank you sincerely. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mr.  Jove  Ravulaca,  Seattle,  USA;  Ms.  Esiteri  Matalau,  San  Jose,  USA;  and  People’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alliance Party, USA - I thank them for their financial assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My ACS Old Girls Lillian sisters, and families and friends whom I might have overlooked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, growing up, there was never a time where we lived as a nuclear family.  
<br/>There were always relatives from Ra and Vanua Levu at home with us to study, whether for their 
<br/>secondary or tertiary education.  My mother was a strong advocate for education and was always 
<br/>willing  to  have relatives stay with  us for the duration of their studies.  So, at  a young age, Sir,  I 
<br/></span><span>understood the value of  education, building  relationships  with  family  and relatives and to  always 
<br/></span><span>have a lending heart to help others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to especially acknowledge my relatives and those who honoured me with their votes.  
<br/>One  of  the  greatest  experiences  during  the  campaign  period  was  the  opportunity  to  meet  and 
<br/>reconnect with my relatives and to understand the importance of being related to someone.  What a 
<br/>wonderful experience it was!

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an honour for me to stand here as a Member of Parliament under the

<br/>develop, and move our country forward.  The People’s Alliance Party, the National Federation Party

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the Social Democratic Liberal  Party put aside their differences to work together to move Fiji 
<br/>forward, for where there is unity, God will command his blessings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support His Excellency’s call for Fiji to be united now more than ever.  As a nation, we are 
<br/>up against grave challenges - the impacts of climate change, globalisation and economic downturn, 
<br/>all while still recovering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for someone who was raised in the village and has worked with several 
<br/>communities during the  course of my  career,  I know the reality  on the ground.   I understand the 
<br/>everyday struggles of our people and I recognise the need to empower them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his foresight and 
<br/>vision for a united Fiji, a Fiji that is seeing a new dawn.  As the Assistant Minister for Tourism and 
<br/>Civil Aviation, in the first few days of taking office and having met so many stakeholders, I have a 
<br/>much stronger appreciation of the industry and its contribution to Fiji’s economy.  The industry - our 
<br/>national airline, have all done wonderfully well.  We can see this in the stellar recovery that has today 
<br/>allowed thousands of our people to return to the jobs they love. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tourism industry has exceeded expectations in terms of recovery.  We 
<br/>went from 146,905 visitors in 2020, which was the 16 percent of the 2019 levels, to a recovery of 71 
<br/>percent today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That’s why we never sold the airline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- We have had record breaking numbers for the month of July, 
<br/>September and November compared to 2019.  We have never seen so many Australians in Fiji in a 
<br/>single month as we did in December last year, and we have had a good turnout from New Zealanders, 
<br/>Americans and the Pacific Islanders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  economic  forecasts  also  show  that  high  visitor  numbers  and  related 
<br/>spending, combined with high prices, boosted tourism receipts, as per overseas exchange transaction 
<br/>records reached just over $1.4 billion, so the tourism truly is a multi-billion-dollar industry for us.  
<br/>The  pandemic  had  obvious  bearing  on  the  global  aviation  industry,  which  not  only  impacted  our 
<br/>tourism numbers, but trade as well in terms of cargo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, Fiji Airways carried a remarkable 1.3 million passengers.  This is 
<br/></span><span>a testament to the airline’s commitment to providing quality products and services to its customers.  
<br/></span><span>Based on the current booking trend and the overwhelming demand for Fiji as a tourism destination 
<br/>of  choice,  we  envisage  an  even  brighter  future.    It  is  our  belief  that  2023  will  be  an  even  more 
<br/>successful  year  with  passenger  numbers  and  forward  bookings  expected  to  continue  an  upward 
<br/>trajectory. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the opening of borders and easing of travel restrictions, passenger air 
<br/>transport has been recovering well with passenger numbers hitting almost 70 percent of pre-pandemic 
<br/>numbers.  We know that a safe and secure aviation system goes a long way in ensuring passenger 
<br/></span><span>confidence and satisfaction in air travel.  When passengers are confident and satisfied, the industry 
<br/></span><span>will be more competitive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji  and the Pacific rely  heavily on our national  airline for connectivity, 
<br/>trade and tourism, especially given our geographically isolated and dispersed islands.  In this regard, 
<br/>I want to also acknowledge the safety and security aspects of Fiji’s aviation industry.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  (CAAF)  leads  Fiji’s  aviation  safety  and  security 
<br/>obligations  as  a  member-State  of  the  United  Nation’s  International  Civil  Aviation  Organisation 
<br/>(ICAO).  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji was recently awarded the ICAO Council President Certificate in a 
<br/>special  ceremony  at  the  41</span><span>st</span><span>  Session  of  the  ICAO  Assembly  in  September  2022.    This  was  a 
<br/>recognition of the progress Fiji had made in improving the effective implementation of our safety 
<br/>oversight systems in compliance with ICAO standards.  The Fiji Civil Aviation System is well above 
<br/>the global average and the highest in the South Pacific, excluding Australia and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during my visit to CAAF and Fiji Airports, I met a lot of remarkable women, 
<br/>who are playing very critical roles in the aviation industry, and it is my hope that these women inspire 
<br/>the next generation to take up a career in aviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my job now as an Assistant Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is to 
<br/>help nurture these critical sectors - nurture it to a point where it has even greater capability to support 
<br/>other sectors of our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, direct flights to Hong Kong and Japan are starting in April this 
<br/>year, and we expect to see a boost in trade with Asia.  While we grow and sustain our traditional 
<br/>tourism markets, we want to diversify into emerging ones who we know have enormous potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways also plays a critical role in international trade through its A350 
<br/>wide-body aircraft cargo capacity.  In 2022, the company transported 30,000 tonnes of cargo, making 
<br/>growth  of  nearly  40  percent.    Air  freight  of  fresh  produce  and  frozen  fish  have  been  the  main 
<br/>commodities exported so far with Fiji Airways, projecting further growth in 2023.  This is an area 
<br/>we want to grow, not just through the airline, but having the right airport infrastructure to support 
<br/>and leverage Fiji’s position as a transhipment hub.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also encouraged by Fiji Airways’ commitment to become a sustainable 
<br/>airline.    They  have  established  an  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  Committee,  who  have 
<br/>embarked on a journey to achieving global standards in sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  great  airline  connectivity  requires  the  necessary  infrastructure.  The 
<br/>Coalition Government will encourage closer collaboration between our airports, our national airline 
<br/>and our boarder agencies.  It will open up new digital and streamline boarder processes offering a 
<br/>swift and secure path into Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This new facility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, along with other infrastructure improvements at airports 
<br/></span><span>and in  air traffic management will set  a new standard for  aviation  across Fiji,  ensuring travellers 
<br/>experience  a  level  of  service  that  we  can  all  be  proud  of.    In  addition  to  Fiji’s  Airports  Capital 
<br/>Investment Programme, we will invest in technological advancement to enhance the safety of asset 
<br/>operations across all 15 airports and facilitate smoother journey through the terminals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Using  video  analytics,  the  Fiji  Airports  operations  will  have  access  to  real  time  aircraft 
<br/>operations data to make smarter and proactive decisions.  In isolation, these are incremental changes 
<br/>but when they are combined, they become a truly transformation of change in the way our airports 
<br/></span><span>are operated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  Coalition  Government  we  fully  intend  on  delivering  to  our  people.  
<br/>With more of a strategic focus in the tourism sector, we can ensure everyone reaps the benefits.  Our 
<br/>focus will no longer be just to promote Fiji in a way where tourists come, stay at hotels and simply 
<br/>lie on the beach.  There is so much more to offer. The new tourism brand “Where Happiness Comes 
<br/>Naturally” speaks to that and reinforces what a special nation we are.  We will take tourism to new

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regions so that every tourism dollar is spread.  We will promote the new niche product such as sports 
<br/>tourism that can help achieve this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November this year we will host Spartan which is a series of obstacle 
<br/>races, and the event will take nearly 2,000 visitors to remote areas of Fiji so that communities too 
<br/>can benefit from this venture.  This will be our first major tourism event since the pandemic, so we 
<br/>are quite excited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from  sports  tourism,  we  will  place  a  lot  more  emphasise  on  eco-
<br/>tourism.  Tourists are becoming increasingly conscientious; they want more meaningful travel and 
<br/>activities  that  do  not  harm  the  environment.    This  is  an  area  where  we  can  leverage  and  should 
<br/>leverage as stewards of our land and resources.  We will encourage tourism products where you can 
<br/>swim with the dolphins in the village of Silana, take a tour of a coconut farm in Savusavu or track in 
<br/>the inlands of Ra.  The trend towards sustainability will remain in the long term, so we will invest 
<br/>more in this area, not only because it is what tourist demand but because sustainable tourism is the 
<br/>future for all of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is my sincere hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that during my tenure, I will serve the people of my 
<br/>country on the values of social justice and equality.   It  is  my  hope that our deliberations and the 
<br/>decisions we make in this august Parliament guarantee our people the two democracy they rightfully 
<br/>deserve.  May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji.

<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Honourable Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, allow me first to thank God for this place, time and opportunity that all of 
<br/>us have been called to such a place and for such a time as this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I move on with my contribution to the debate, as </span><span>Qase ni Vanua vua na Turaga Bale 
<br/>o Koya na Ratu,</span><span> I mourn the loss of Ratu Kolinio Rokotuinaceva Ravoka, youngest son and later 
<br/>younger brother to successive paramount chiefs of my </span><span>Vanua o Verata</span><span>. If not for the parliamentary 
<br/>sitting  today,  I  would  have  been  at  Ucunivanua  carrying  out  my  traditional  duties.  I  also  convey 
<br/>condolences  to  the  </span><span>Vanua  o</span><span>  Sukanacagi  on  the  passing  of  their  paramount  chief,  </span><span>Turaga  na  Tui 
<br/>Vitogo</span><span>. May they both rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I add my congratulations on your elevation to the Speaker’s Chair. It was 
<br/></span><span>historically not an enviable seat as we learnt when watching the ceremony of the dragging of the 
<br/>Speaker  on  previous  occasions  we  met  in  this  august  Chamber.  We  have  confidence  that  your 
<br/>experience as one of the longest serving parliamentarians, winning a seat in the preceding five general 
<br/>elections in 1999, 2001, 2006, 2014 and 2018 mean that you are more than equal to the task.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I respond substantively to His Excellency’s most gracious Address, with particular 
<br/>focus viz-a-viz the portfolio I have been entrusted by the honourable Prime Minister, I wish to begin 
<br/>by thanking His Excellency.  I also wish to acknowledge the dignity and decorum with which His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency  has  carried  himself  as  Head  of  State  in  the  recent  fraught  period  leading  into  and 
<br/></span><span>immediately after the general election that closed out 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For many of us, learning constitutional parliamentary norms, standing orders and conventions 
<br/>will  be  a  steep  learning  curve  but  we  have  confidence  in  the  leadership  team  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government and look forward to robust debates with His Excellency’s loyal Opposition.  I would

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not be here making my maiden address to this august Parliament , if not for the trust and confidence 
<br/>of every single voter who saw fit to elect me to this position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My first  vote of thanks  on this earthly plane  at  least,  go out  to  all my  voters primarily in 
<br/>Tailevu North but indeed everywhere in Fiji that voted for me - I am truly humbled. There is a saying 
<br/>in  the  indigenous  vernacular,  </span><span>“qoroqoroya  na  matai  luvena</span><span>”,  literally  translated  as  a  parent 
<br/>wondering at his own child’s face, but taken to mean a close relative praising another, something 
<br/>culturally considered unseemly.  Nonetheless, the home base of my support is none other than that 
<br/>of  my  own  family  –  my  beautiful  wife  and  campaign  manager,  Salote  and  her  siblings  and  their 
<br/>families.  She and I both acknowledge all those supporters in Fiji and abroad, volunteers and Party 
<br/>officials  who  assisted  in  the  campaign,  chief  among  them  being  Simione  Samate  of  Korocau, 
<br/>Cakaudrove, who has become like a member of our family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In mentioning the campaign, my wife and I became grandparents in the early stages of the 
<br/>Alliance  Party’s  formation  and  a  special  mention  must  be  made  of  our  precious  granddaughter, 
<br/>Lotiola,  who  brings  us  so  much  joy.    It  was  not  easy  juggling  the  demands  of  campaigning  as  a 
<br/>candidate, responsibilities of General Secretary, as well as life generally and as a new grandparent, 
<br/>and I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his unwavering trust in, and support of me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge  the  support  of  our  children  -  Makelesi,  Levani,  Fatafehi,  Mele,  Esetia  and 
<br/>Joelinda, not  forgetting  our sons-in-law Biutoka and Toga  and nephews  Jason, Koia, Sakiasi  and 
<br/>Tulele.  The wider extended families of my in-laws, my late siblings - Joeli, Suliasi and Jone and my 
<br/>sole surviving sibling, Tupou, and their respective families and in-laws.  I honour my own parents-
<br/>in-law;  my  late mother-in-law Sosefina Ongolea, originally from Lapaha, Mua, Tongatapu in the 
<br/>Kingdom  of  Tonga  and  my  late  father-in-law  Jekope  Rusivakula  from  Namuka,  Tai-o-Bau,  Bau, 
<br/>Tailevu.  I also honour my late uncle Sakiusa Rokotakala and aunt Makelesi Vora, who were my 
<br/>guardians at Vunibokoi District School, both of whom helped shape the person I am today.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I honour my own parents, my late father, Dr. Levani Raisevu Ditoka and our </span><span>Yavusa o Daviko</span><span>, 
<br/>our  </span><span>vanua  o  Verata</span><span>,  i  </span><span>Sanokononoko  vua  na  Gone  Turaga  Bale  o  Koya  na  Ratu</span><span>.    I  especially 
<br/>acknowledge other </span><span>vanua</span><span> with strong links to Daviko and other villages through Tailevu North and 
<br/>other  places  around  Fiji.    I  remember  my  late  mother  Mele  Lagilagi  Tikoilomaloma  and  her 
<br/>connections in Tubou, Lakeba and Dakuiloa, Oneata in Lau of </span><span>Mataqali Ceakena</span><span> and </span><span>Tavaga </span><span>in the 
<br/></span><span>Yavusa </span><span>and </span><span>Vanua o Lakeba </span><span>and Bukatatanoa respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  father’s  </span><span>vasu</span><span>  through  my  Tai  Eleni  of  Nakavu,  Nadi.    My  father’s  siblings  and  their 
<br/></span><span>families,  all  our  much-beloved  extended  family  from  the  villages  of  Tamavua,  Sanasana, 
<br/></span><span>Naivuruvuru, Lomawai, Wailevu, Naqarani and our own Navunimono.  My mother’s </span><span>vasu</span><span>, through 
<br/>my  </span><span>Pu  Roko  Lutu</span><span>  also  of  Tubou,  Lakeba.  All  my  mother’s  siblings  from  the  chiefly  </span><span>Tui 
<br/>Kaba/Vusaradave</span><span> clans of Bau, Vuanirewa, Onewai and Ceaekena clans of Lakeba respectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  not  a  fan  of  autobiographical  speeches  but  will  provide  Parliament  a  short  self-
<br/>introduction.  I began primary education following my physician father in his various postings at 
<br/>Veiuto  Primary  School,  Suva;  South  Pacific  Sugar  Mills  Primary  School  in  Rarawai,  Ba  before 
<br/>joining  Vunibokoi  District  School  where  I  was  classmates  with  my  predecessor  and  </span><span>tavale</span><span>
<br/></span><span>honourable Inia Seruiratu.  My secondary education began at Lelean Memorial School at Davuilevu 
<br/></span><span>where the honourable Jone Usamate was my senior.  I then concluded my secondary learning at the 
<br/>Marist Brothers High School in Flagstaff.  I joined the Royal Fiji Military Forces in 1985 and attained 
<br/>the rank of Captain by 1990.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I seek the indulgence and forbearance of my late maternal grandmother’s chiefly clan of the 
<br/>Vuanirewa in recounting my distinct privilege serving, whilst an army captain as Aide-de-Camp to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the father of modern Fiji, the late </span><span>Gone Turaga Bale na Tui Nayau, Tui Lau, Sau ni Vanua o Lau</span><span>
<br/>Ratu  Sir  Kamisese  Kapaiwai  Tuimacilai  Mara.  Chiefly  mana  or  </span><span>sau  </span><span>were  personified  in  this  late 
<br/>paramount chief and elder statesman who led us to independence and eventually served as President 
<br/>of the Republic with distinction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many skills were honed and lessons learned under his sharp and discerning gaze and not so 
<br/>soft rebuke (where warranted); not to mention his late wife, the  </span><span>Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui 
<br/>Dreketi</span><span> and the indirect tutelage of traditional diplomacy that she conveyed. The Turaga Tui Nayau’s 
<br/>fiery temper suffered no foolishness and her sharp wit knew no equal. May the </span><span>Turaga</span><span> and </span><span>Marama 
<br/>Bale</span><span> continue to rest in blessed memory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  served  whilst  a  Captain  as  Personal  Staff  Officer,  Mr  Speaker,  under  Commander 
<br/>Republic of Fiji Military Forces, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, as he then was yet another chiefly leader who 
<br/>I  had  the  privilege  of  observing  at  close  quarters  and  from  which  many  lessons  were  gleaned.  I 
<br/>acknowledge him and his late wife Adi Ateca Moceiwaqa Mara - may she continue to rest in peace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I finally attained the rank of Major and in  2002 served until  I sought resignation  and was 
<br/>honourably discharged from what had then become the regular force of the Republic of Fiji Military 
<br/>Forces into the Reserve of Officers, when I was offered the position of Private Secretary in the Office 
<br/>of the Prime Minister by the venerable, Mr. Jioji Kotobalavu. This was in the administration of the 
<br/>late </span><span>Turaga Tui Kobuca</span><span>, Mr. Laisenia Qarase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Qarase was yet another late statesman from  whom I gained immeasurably, not just in 
<br/>terms of leadership and integrity but on a personal level when I and his Police PPO’s from the Special 
<br/>Branch with the loyal support of the Fiji Police Force then organised Mr. and Mrs. Qarase’s extraction 
<br/>from  Suva  after  the  overthrow  of  the  SDL  government  in  2006.    As  Mr.  Qarase  had  correctly 
<br/>predicted, Sir, the true clean-up begins now. That is the reality of the matter.  I acknowledge Mrs. 
<br/>Leba Qarase and her family for their unwavering support for the </span><span>Turaga Tui Kobuca</span><span> and the values 
<br/>he stood for. May he also rest in beloved memory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon  return  to  Suva,  my  family  struggled  with  my  wife’s  single  income  while  all  Civil 
<br/>Service jobs were closed to me. In the intervening years two of my three surviving siblings sought 
<br/>asylum abroad as their connection to me appeared to be a red rag to a bull for some. I tried my hand 
<br/>at farming whilst also attaining my Masters in Commerce in Governance at the University of the 
<br/>South Pacific. Farming remains one of my passions today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I then gained employment in the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) until 2019 where I 
<br/></span><span>opted  to  take  my  FNPF  payout  while  seriously  considering  together  with  my  family  the  weighty 
<br/>decision of entering into politics leading to this very place and time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate what I said at the outset and return all the glory and honour of this, my life’s journey 
<br/>to  our  Creator,  Almighty  God  and  Sovereign  Lord,  without  whom  none  of  this  would  have  been 
<br/>possible to begin with. With that being said, Mr. Speaker, I now turn to my substantive response to 
<br/>His Excellency’s most gracious Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am deeply honoured by the show of confidence bestowed upon me by the honourable Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister in assigning to me the portfolio of Rural and Maritime Development and Natural Disaster 
<br/>Management.  To  a  certain  extent,  “</span><span>qoroqoroya  na  matai  luvena</span><span>”  may  apply  here  as  well  but 
<br/>nonetheless,  I  would  like  to  pay  tribute  to  my  Party  Leader  and  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka. His decisive leadership style can be best exemplified by his recent 
<br/>diplomatic accomplishment in bringing Kiribati back into the embrace of the Pacific Islands Forum 
<br/>and more broadly setting the tone for future engagements with our Pacific neighbours. In the short

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>47 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time I have worked directly under his guidance, I am confident that there is no better person to lead 
<br/>us in this daunting yet exciting new chapter in Fiji’s journey of nationhood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  I  applaud  the  decision  to  introduce  elections  for  the  District  Advisory 
<br/>Councils. This localization of democracy empowers rural and formal settlements and communities 
<br/>by  allowing  them  to  choose  their  own  representatives.  This  initiative  will  address  other  issues 
<br/>including proper demarcation of settlements and DAC constituency boundaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Elections of District Advisory Councillors will ensure that the voices of the rural informal 
<br/>settlements are heard. It also ensures that councillors are accountable to the people they represent.   
<br/>In fact, they provide the links between communities and Government in promoting and facilitating 
<br/>the implementation of Government programmes and projects at the community level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>His Excellency recognized the rights of the indigenous people of Fiji and I 
<br/>celebrate  the  decision  to  restore  the  </span><span>Bose  Levu  Vakaturaga</span><span>,  traditionally  the  apex  of  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.  
<br/>Indeed, the restoration of the Great Council of Chiefs does not seek to place indigenous rights above 
<br/>those of other communities, but to paraphrase the late honourable Justice Jai Ram Reddy  - it is a 
<br/>body for all people who call Fiji home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- The recent “</span><span>veisiko</span><span>” or visitation to His Excellency the President by 
<br/>the </span><span>vanua </span><span>of Bau and viral picture of </span><span>Turaga Taukei Bolatagane</span><span> and the </span><span>Turaga Taukei Mataiwelagi</span><span>
<br/>expressing themselves in joyful greeting, is a beautiful reminder of the good times we have ahead of 
<br/>us.  We have had a long and grueling campaign and harsh words have been exchanged by all parties. 
<br/>It is now time to pool our resources and work together for the good of our beloved Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For our country, it is vitally important, as a factor for long-standing stability, that we always 
<br/>maintain a careful balance between the rights of individuals and communities.   The special interests 
<br/>of  indigenous  people,  including  their  right  of  ownership  to  their  natural  resources  must  also  be 
<br/>protected.  The  interests  and  equitable  participation  in  all  facets  of  life  in  Fiji  for  the  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>is 
<br/>essential for the long-term peace, stability and sustainable development in the country.   Given the 
<br/>above, anything that affects them must affect the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  population  was  once  concentrated  in  the  rural  areas  and  maritime 
<br/>islands. About 67 percent of Fiji’s population lived in the rural areas in 1966.  By 2019/2020 this had 
<br/></span><span>dropped to 45 percent.  These areas constitute 94 percent of the total land area, and the rural economy 
<br/></span><span>has  the  largest  resource  base  which  includes  tourism,  agriculture  and  sugar  which  contributes 
<br/>significantly towards the national GDP and the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>as has been oft-mentioned in national discourse, our rural areas are resource 
<br/>rich but the majority are cash poor because we have been slow to appreciate the potential wealth and 
<br/>economic gains that we can derive from the sustainable use of our natural resources.   All efforts 
<br/>must now be made to unlock the potential to generate wealth in order to improve the living standards 
<br/>and the quality of lives of all citizens, to address food security and to reduce our import bills while 
<br/></span><span>boosting our exports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2017 National Census report showed that out of the 15 sources of water 
<br/>that are commonly used for drinking across rural households in Fiji, only 35 percent are connected 
<br/>to metered tap water and about 10 percent relies on high-risk water sources.  In addition, about 31 
<br/>percent of rural households use high risk sanitation in Fiji.  The Constitution guarantees all the people

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  Fiji  the  right  of  access  to  clean  and  safe  water  in  adequate  quantities,  and  access  to  adequate 
<br/>sanitation facilities. This is therefore a priority area for the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of rural-to-urban drift has become a major challenge in Fiji as the rural population 
<br/>and  households  migrate  to  urban  areas  in  search  of  better  standards  of  living,  quality  education 
<br/>facilities, accessibility to health centers, housing and recreational activities.  This was also driven by 
<br/>the fact that around 37 percent of the rural population were living below the poverty line compared 
<br/>to 14 percent in the urban areas as noted in the revised 2019/2020 Household Income and Expenditure 
<br/>Survey (HIES) Report.  To address these issues, Government will intensify efforts to create more 
<br/>opportunities in the rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, poor infrastructural facilities are identified as a problem. It is important to know that 
<br/>most of the population living in the rural areas that are characterized by lack or poor infrastructural 
<br/>facilities such as electricity and good roads, portable drinking water, a good communication system, 
<br/>health centers, et cetera. The absence of these facilities makes life difficult, miserable and unattractive 
<br/>in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is embarking on the process to develop the National Rural Development Policy.  
<br/>The policy is to guide and set the model, concepts and strategies for rural and maritime development 
<br/>in Fiji. Rural Development Policy can be broadly defined as all aspects of state action that directly 
<br/>or indirectly, influence the nature of economics and social development in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same note, the Ministry will play a lead role through the Integrated Rural Development 
<br/>Framework (IRDF) to coordinate rural development programmes amongst a number of government 
<br/>agencies,  Non-Government  Organizations,  Civil  Societies  and  the  private  sector  to  develop  and 
<br/>enhance  sustainable  livelihoods  for  Fiji’s  rural  sector.  The  IRDF  is  a  coordinated  bottom-up 
<br/>development planning process that is integrated with the top-down aspirations of Government that 
<br/>are  evidence-based  driven.  It  aims  to  promote  participatory,  inclusive  cooperation  between  all 
<br/>institutions, partners and stakeholders at the national and local levels involved in rural development 
<br/>planning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The long-term objective of Rural Outer Island Investment (ROI) programme is to enhance 
<br/>the livelihoods of people in the rural areas and outer islands of Fiji. The immediate purpose is to 
<br/>increase market access opportunities and services that will enable beneficiaries in the rural areas and 
<br/>outer islands to exploit those opportunities.  There is potential to grow our economy and improve the 
<br/>living standards of our rural people.  This forms the core of this Ministry’s deliverables, particularly 
<br/></span><span>in  unlocking  these  opportunities  and  developing  new  ones  to  assist  rural  communities  raise  their 
<br/></span><span>living standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  against</span><span> </span><span>this  backdrop</span><span>,  </span><span>this  Ministry  is  committed  to  implementing 
<br/>development strategies that bring Fijians living in rural areas, the same level of access to essential 
<br/>services and economic opportunities as elsewhere in the country.  As a rural development facilitator 
<br/>and  coordinator,  the  Ministry  through  partnership  with  other  rural  development  stakeholders  is 
<br/>committed to improving the quality of people’s lives as well as expanding their ability to be masters 
<br/>of their own future in rural and developed regions in our country. This can be achieved through the 
<br/></span><span>provision of economic and income generating opportunities and improving access to amenities and 
<br/></span><span>services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, substantial resources will continue to be directed towards developing the 
<br/>rural and maritime areas particularly our most vulnerable and isolated communities. Such activities 
<br/>include  the  construction  and  improvement  of  community  facilities,  water  supply,  housing,  social 
<br/>welfare services, marketing and distribution networks.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am excited</span><span> </span><span>about the decision to transfer the Rural Housing Assistance 
<br/>(RHA) programme and the Rural Outer Island (ROI) Programme to this Ministry. The Rural Housing 
<br/>Assistance  Scheme  (RHA)  was  first  established  in  1976  with  the  main  objective  of  providing 
<br/>assistance to the rural population to improve living conditions and reduce vulnerability to natural 
<br/>disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last decade, Fiji has experienced a total of 14 cyclones and flood 
<br/>events,  which  cumulatively  accounted  for  over  70  deaths  and  damages  over  FJ$3.13  billion.  The 
<br/>Climate  Vulnerability  Assessment  conducted  reveals  that  Government  will  require  about  FJ$9.3 
<br/>billion, in investment over the next 10 years to strengthen resilience, which is almost 100 percent of 
<br/>its annual GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Ministry  through  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office,  will 
<br/>continue its efforts to improve our nation’s disaster preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation 
<br/>initiatives.  I  would  particularly  wish  to  mention  that  disaster  rehabilitation  would  be  an  area  the 
<br/>Ministry intends to revisit and rebuild capacity in.  The 1995 National Disaster Management Plan 
<br/>and the 1998 Natural Disaster Management Act will both be reviewed in order to achieve this.  We 
<br/>will work to improve stakeholder coordination mechanisms and accomplish the goals of the 2018–
<br/>2030 National Disaster Reduction Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I resume my seat, I restate my unequivocal support of the motion and commend it 
<br/>accordingly to the House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament I thank you for your 
<br/>attention and your indulgence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  my  honour to  speak at  this  opening  session of 
<br/>Parliament  for  2023-2024.    At  the  outset,  I  wish  to  congratulate  you  on  your  appointment  as  the 
<br/>Speaker of this august Parliament and, of course, to your Deputy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President pointed out in no uncertain terms that the 2013 
<br/>Constitution is the Supreme Law of the land.  It was a timely reminder to all to abide by the 2013 
<br/>Constitution, and to do so in honour of the laws under which they were elected to office, and under 
<br/>which they all took oath of office, and we are all bound under it during the course of our duties to all 
<br/>the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President reminded us all of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
<br/>Indeed the pandemic itself is still felt everyday on a much larger scale than we ever did in Fiji and in 
<br/>various  parts  of  the  world.    The  FijiFirst  Government  through  its  quick  response  and  action, 
<br/>minimised its impact and paved the way forward for a quick recovery, a recovery we are all benefiting 
<br/>from.  We need to keep our guards up and keep listening to the medical advice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government then stood firm to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic 
<br/>and laid the foundation for a fast and strong economic rebound with a focus to get people back to 
<br/></span><span>work.  We managed to access the vaccines on time and roll out one of the world’s fastest vaccination 
<br/></span><span>drives.   We supported our national  airline (Fiji  Airways) with  a government guarantee to keep  it 
<br/>afloat as we recognised the vital role the airline will play in getting back the tourists.  But, we were 
<br/>told to sell all those airlines at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note the remarks by His Excellency the President, reminding us of our 
<br/>duties as equal citizens of diverse backgrounds of our beloved Fiji.  This is the point that we need to

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>act on with good intentions and integrity of our actions.  On this point, and on many other points I 
<br/>make today, and will make in the future, I must commend our leader the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>of Fiji between 2014 until the last election, honourable Bainimarama for his outstanding role as a 
<br/>leader of all Fijians.  Personally, he has inspired and motivated me and continues to do so as I enter 
<br/>the third term into Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Resign. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I am not going to resign.  I have got a thick skin, I am not resigning.  
<br/>There has been no other leader, apart from honourable Bainimarama, who has the following of most 
<br/>of our citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  He led a Party that dominated the last election with the highest number 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of votes received and that is the fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is the problem, relying on one person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it required the combined manipulation of three parties 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to come together to form this Government.  Stop hitting the airline or the plane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unlike previous leaders, inclusion of equality is not a political line for our honourable leader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but a heartfelt expression of his belief 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  do  not  do  a  running  commentary,  address  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I will - thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But a heartfelt expression of his belief that a united Fiji will be the best for Fiji and for all the 
<br/>Fijians.  He has instilled in  the FijiFirst  Party and among  all its representatives a strong sense of 
<br/>fairness and justice that we must always work for a nation that unites us all in the common goal of a 
<br/>Fiji for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Honourable Bainimarama’s openness and humility as he put together a 
<br/>plan and acted on it to make Fiji truly democratic, which remains his endearing legacy and one that 
<br/>will not end for him and for those who follow, like me, and the 46 percent of the Fijians who voted 
<br/>for him and the Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move on, I wish to take this opportunity to 
<br/>thank all those family members, well wishes and friends and the respected Tui Ba, who supported 
<br/>me in my previous two terms in office and in the last Election.  Their show of support along the 
<br/>mandate I have received from those who voted for me keeps me going to achieve the vision of a 
<br/>united and a better Fiji for all Fijians under the FijiFirst Party.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>51 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last Election campaign was a bit of a sad one for 
<br/>me.  I lost my niece, Sanjivni, who was my rock and pillar of strength, and she will forever be in my 
<br/>corner as I represent the values of inclusion, justice, and a Fiji for all Fijians that she was so passionate 
<br/>about as a young leader. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to express my sincere congratulations to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister,  honourable  Rabuka,  and  members  of  the  Government  for  taking  office  in  leading  this 
<br/>beloved nation of ours.  Sir, while I am sincere in my congratulations, I am even more sincere in my 
<br/>role as a representative of those Fijians who have given us such a mandate to ensure that governance 
<br/>is open, transparent, and fair to all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under  the oath  that  we have taken both,  as Government  and Opposition 
<br/>under the 2013 Constitution, we are all to uphold the supreme law of this beloved land of ours.  This 
<br/>oath applies to all of us in this Parliament, just as the laws of the land apply to all Fijians, and high 
<br/>among that law is the law of one vote for one person and we must respect each and every vote that 
<br/>puts all of us in this august Parliament.  After all, Sir, even the honourable Prime Minister has to 
<br/>acknowledge that in the final count, it was the one vote that has put him back into office.  So, let us 
<br/>not be dismissive of our people and their power.  Let us all respect the 2013 Constitution and its 
<br/>principle of fair and just governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note  of  the  rule  of  law  and  the  need  for  fairness,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  all  have 
<br/>witnessed actions by the Coalition Government that shows the revenge-driven nature of politics that 
<br/>faces  our  nation,  and  these  are  not  driven  by  concentration  of  good  governance.  Their  role  as 
<br/>Government is to take a measured and considered approach to decide on what is good for the good 
<br/>of Fiji and its people, and not only the interests of the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen capable officers, qualified civil servants and board members fight.  Loyalties 
<br/>are given Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has to stand the test of time.  The opportunity to provide loyalty with 
<br/>the right for every Fijian to show that as professionals, they are capable of working under different 
<br/>governments and leadership.  A public officer needs to be tested when the government changes and 
<br/>not given the boot in order to create opportunities for the candidate that lost in the election.  And 
<br/>many  of  these  new  appointees  come  with  grave  question  marks,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  about  their 
<br/>capabilities and their qualifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have created Ministries without budgets.  Ministries are stuck in the 
<br/>middle of their fancy titles with nothing to work with.  The honourable Prime Minister says mini 
<br/></span><span>budget, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister says no mini budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are reading the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> too much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is your newspaper now!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- In fact, all media are under you now.

<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- For16 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is indeed a good start for the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister of Finance…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  …to  go  to  India  to  have  a  meeting,  while  the  Ministries  are  looking 
<br/>around for money to run their operations.  I do not know whether it is a joke or what, but one of my 
<br/>friends said that in one of the Ministries, the officers are contributing to buy mops and broom.  I do 
<br/>not know, but that was what I heard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- $10 billion debt, that’s what you left.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We will correct that, do not worry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Worry about the workers that are being laid off, honourable Minister of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contractors and sub-contractors engaged by Fiji Roads Authority, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>workers are now being laid off.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You still have to complete the swimming pool.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And I hope ….   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do an investigation, honourable Minister of Finance, it is your turn now! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Go, do it!  Do not just say things, go and do an investigation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We’re going to investigate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, I challenge you to go and do an investigation.  Do not just come 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here with all these nonsense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Were you scared to do the investigation report?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Never ever!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Address the Speaker!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are not the Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You try to be what you are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in reality, what the honourable Minister of Finance should do is to work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the honourable Minister for Sugar and deliver on their promise of the sugarcane funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  You  have  destroyed  the  industry  in  16  years.  Just  have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>patience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Sugar is very vocal about his version 
<br/>of the failings of the sugar industry.  He does not say anything about the sugar politics of 1980s and 
<br/>1990s that laid the foundation of the demise of the sugar industry.  It was the FijiFirst Party, under 
<br/>the leadership of honourable Bainimarama, that bailed out the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, during that time, leases were not renewed. It was the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  who  came,  and  leases  were  renewed.    We  had  to  face  so  many  floods  and 
<br/>cyclones still, and here we have a Minister for Sugar who goes and says, “I am going to sell all the 
<br/>trucks”.  Does he know what he is talking about?  Do you know why the trucks were bought?  I am 
<br/>asking you now.  Do you know why the trucks were bought? To reduce the cost of cartage by the 
<br/>lorry association.  That is the fact!  Do not just go around and say, “Stop the ….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because you destroyed the industry, that’s the fact! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Criticising the Field Officers.  That is nonsense, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are talking nonsense.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Deliver on your promise … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We will.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- …  to the sugarcane farmers first, then talk about all your fancy ideas of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a sudden extraction on all things to save the industry.  When!

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  until  the  Coalition  Government  delivers  on  the  magical  $110  per  tonne 
<br/>return, all these sugarcane farmers of this country should take the Coalition Government to task for 
<br/>making empty and false promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We have heard that the honourable Minister for Sugar went around and 
<br/>said that they are not going to increase the sugar price, but these were the same people. Why?  You 
<br/>are on record of saying not to increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Come on, you are on record! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I hope so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you cannot deliver, tell them as openly as often, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you do when it comes to all other aspects of the sugar industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- For the town council election, you promised to do….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do not worry, I am going to contest. I am warning you now, I am going 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to contest the town council election too. Yes, so do not worry about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also note that the Coalition Government is, all of a sudden, quiet on the 
<br/>inflation and their promise to bring prices down on goods and services. They know very well what 
<br/>they said during the campaign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Oh, very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- They were very critical of our Government and made endless promises, 
<br/>but where were their promises when the prices of essentials, like onion, went up? Where were they? 
<br/>I want to ask them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just relax.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  People  were  coming  to  us,  $6  to  $8  a  kilogramme.  Where  were  you 
<br/></span><span>people?  This  is  truth,  that  inflation  and  prices  are  set  by  global  markets  and  we  pay  the  price 
<br/></span><span>according to supply and demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Since you never said   it during campaign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, they were not because of the votes. Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we heard 
<br/>these wild promises but once again, there is no delivery on these promises that some kind of magic 
<br/>that this Government would bring and keep prices down.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- People know about you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You will have your turn, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency talked about Fiji’s debt level. They should note that debt 
<br/>servicing and decisions on giving of international loans is based on Government policies, especially 
<br/>an assessment of its ability to service the debt. We all know, $10 billion debt. I know, they will go 
<br/>up to $25 million or $30 million debt. I know they will.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- We won’t! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You will. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have no idea of what was agreed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-The problem with you, honourable Minister of Finance is that, you think 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that you know everything, that is the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government, through sound economic policies and a good debt 
<br/>servicing record, was able to source funds for our pandemic recovery and rehabilitation and to serve 
<br/>that debt during those difficult times.  You know, you have seen the books now because you are 
<br/>sitting there. Come on, be honest!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I’m seeing a lot of things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, while critical of the debt 
<br/>levels which they used as a major part of their election campaign, have not given any indication to 
<br/>the Fijian people on what their plans are or they have to be in place to ensure that we have access to 
<br/>loans and grants in order to deliver on their promises and not just to come with some excuses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the moment, and this is very important, honourable Minister of Finance, the very budget 
<br/>most of you (not all) opposed on so many grounds last year while sitting on this side, is the same 
<br/>budget that is now the source of their operational funds.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, how come it was wrong 
<br/>last year and is right now?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There is something wrong, there is something wrong! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the trouble with you people, everything is FijiFirst.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to disclose why there was no mini-Budget because I have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reliably told by a group why there was none, but time will come, when I will. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is credit to the FijiFirst</span><span> </span><span>Government which you have to accept and its 
<br/>sound economic policies that the Budget was put into place and credit to the integrity of FijiFirst</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Government that funds were in the coffers that you are now using.

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have to warn honourable Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also sad to note that Government or private entities seek forgiveness from the Coalition 
<br/>Government  or  should  I  say  from  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  himself.    It  is  unheard  of  in  a 
<br/>democracy,  absolutely  unheard  of  that  Government  or  private  entities  or  groups  formally  seek 
<br/>forgiveness from a newly elected Government.  I want to ask, where is the independence and integrity 
<br/>of Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) when it comes forward to formally seek forgiveness?  Is 
<br/>it a joke? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the same time, questions must be raised of the many quickly forgotten 
<br/>promises of the Coalition Government.  What happened to the promise of increasing the minimum 
<br/>wage of to $5 and $6? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, you did it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I did it, $4.  What about your promise - $5 to $6, when is it coming?  The 
<br/>workers are asking me.  We did it, it came into effect in January, now the workers are asking, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, when is that $6 or $7 coming?  I said, “go and ask Minister of Finance.  Do not ask 
<br/>me.”  Very soon I will start naming you, so be careful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Sixteen years and it takes $4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to ask…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are a joke now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So it hurts, now I am a joke. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It hurts when $6, $7 and $8 comes, then it hurts and it becomes a joke for you.  You will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a real joke in this four years, honourable Professor Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you may wish to round off your speech.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>57 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, I will, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a past Minister of Employment, I wish to put on record that the last Employment Advisory 
<br/>Board Meeting was held last year in August after a lapse of 10 years.  I was very surprised to hear 
<br/>the statement that the Advisory Board meeting took place after  a lapse of 10 years which is not true. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the related note of job creation, the Vuvale Partnership signed by the two 
<br/>former Prime Ministers has enabled thousands of Fijians to find employment and to better look after 
<br/>their families and communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You will remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the FijiFirst Government and 
<br/>the Australian Government did their due diligence and ensured that a good spread of people were 
<br/>able to make the most of these opportunities and put to bed the doubts of the then Opposition that the 
<br/>policy will lead to the emptying of our villages and loss of labour (that was not true).  No such thing 
<br/>has happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you, I thank this august Parliament for this opportunity to speak on 
<br/>matters of critical importance towards an inclusive and a fair Fiji for all Fijians.  God bless us all, 
<br/>God bless Fiji and God bless you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now wish to adjourn  Parliament for lunch and we 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Honourable Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister,  the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament,  distinguished  guests  and  our  citizenry  people  of  Fiji.    Thank  you  for  giving  me  this 
<br/>opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Opening Address of His Excellency the President of 
<br/>the Republic of Fiji, </span><span>Turaga Bale Na Tui</span><span> </span><span>Macuata</span><span>, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere at the 2023-
<br/>2024  Session  of  Parliament.  Before  I  begin,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  you,  Sir,  on  your 
<br/>appointment  as  Speaker  of  this  high  Office  and  to  the  Deputy  Speaker,  honourable  Lenora 
<br/>Qereqeretabua.  This august Parliament and the people of Fiji look forward to your guidance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank His Excellency for his words of encouragement and reassurance as we, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the leaders and people of Fiji together walk this new journey of democracy.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  join  His  Excellency  in  acknowledging  the  previous  administration  and  the  smooth 
<br/>transition we have had.  We are inheriting a functioning Government and a country that is physically 
<br/>intact,  but  with  my  eight  years  in  Parliament,  we  could  have  done  better  and  we  will  do  better, 
<br/>especially in strengthening institutions.  They have been really weakened over the last few years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji demanded change because after 16 years they deserve nothing less.  So, I 
<br/>take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to thank our people for exercising their right and making their 
<br/>vote count.  I say this not as an elected Minister but as a citizen of our beloved nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am humble to be given the opportunity to be part of the leadership, to lead 
<br/>the people of Fiji and to lead in a spirit of conciliation and collaboration.  Our duty is to those who 
<br/>had faith and confidence to help us reach where we are today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I look back, it is hard to imagine that the fate of the nation essentially 
<br/>came down to my party.  Today, I stand very proudly alongside my colleagues from two other parties 
<br/>knowing that all the effort is starting to pay and in time this will be measured by our delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this opportunity to thank my family especially my wife, my children and grandchildren 
<br/>who stood by me as we set out to change the course of democracy.  My sincere gratitude to the </span><span>Gone 
<br/>Turaga e</span><span> </span><span>Mataiwelagi</span><span>, Ratu Apenisa Cakobau.  Under his presidency, I became Party Leader and 
<br/>our President today, Ratu Manoa Roragaca, </span><span>Na Taukei Waimaro</span><span> and also my thanks to the General 
<br/>Secretary and his team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I did on my appointment to Parliament almost a decade ago, I thank my people of Nadroga/ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Navosa from Namatakula to Yako, to the highlands and to the islands of Yatu Malolo and Vatulele.   
<br/>During this campaign, I stood also for parts of Ba and I am very grateful for the support, especially 
<br/>from the Yatu Yasawa.  My special tribute to my campaign team, </span><span>koicalevu Vava </span><span>Samu of Yako, 
<br/></span><span>koicalevu </span><span>Vuki also of Yako, </span><span>koicalevu </span><span>Namisi of Nawaka and </span><span>koicalevu </span><span>Buli Ratu of Narewa.  It is, 
<br/>therefore,  with  great  honour  that  I  deliver  my  maiden  speech  as  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On democracy, His Excellency the President in his Opening Address rightly highlighted the 
<br/></span><span>need for a clear focus on the rule of law and democratic processes.  Democracy is not true democracy 
<br/>if the values of transparency, accountability and respect are not upheld.  Laws are not made for the 
<br/>government.  They  are  made  by  the  government  with  its  people,  for  the  people.    We  made  a 
<br/>commitment as a Coalition Government to rid this nation of false promises that our people have been 
<br/>beholden to for far too long.  We made a commitment not just to hear, but to listen and act.  For the 
<br/>first time in nearly two decades, deliberations of the Cabinet are being shared with the public.  Even 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>59 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as Members of this august Parliament, we were never given the courtesy to contribute to matters that 
<br/>affect our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will no longer pass overnight legislations that take away the rights of 
<br/>the indigenous people in the name of streamlining investments.  We will no longer rob our people of 
<br/>their freedom of expression in the name of media safety; we will no longer deny residents, the right 
<br/>to choose who they believe has the best civic interest and we will no longer deny employees the right 
<br/>to be represented by unions.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is true democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  On  finance,  to  get  our  Parliament  in  order  is  our  priority.    We 
<br/>acknowledge the current fiscal space we are in.  We also acknowledge debt is not necessarily bad, 
<br/>but to have our national debt reach 85 percent of GDP or $10 billion by July 2023 is not responsible 
<br/>borrowing at all.  At a time where our focus should be on rebuilding, giving the people of Fiji basic 
<br/>infrastructure, such as adequate health, facilities and services, access to safe and clean drinking water 
<br/>and  sustainable  educational  services,  we  are  heavily  constrained.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  therefore, 
<br/>support the appointment of a Fiscal Review Committee and National Economic Summit in the spirit 
<br/>of transparency and consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Coalition Vision, there is goodwill amongst our people in the international community.  
<br/>This is not necessarily driven by politics, but a renewed sense of optimism that things have changed.  
<br/>As His Excellency the President stated, our mission is to build unity and trust and we truly  intend 
<br/>on doing so.  The principles of Christianity will remain the foundation of our policies.  We will work 
<br/>humbly with others for the common good; we will defend the rights of the poor and needy and give 
<br/>unconditionally to the vulnerable.  We will love our neighbours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  my  commitments  has  always  been  to  give  tourism  and  the  civil 
<br/>aviation  sector  the  stature  they  deserve.    Here,  we  are  talking  about  a  sector  that  contributes  40 
<br/>percent  of our GDP, a sector that supports thousands of jobs  and livelihoods.  Unfortunately, the 
<br/>previous administration did not see the importance of these key sectors and reduced two very critical 
<br/>arms of the Government (tourism and civil aviation) to mere government departments, clustered with 
<br/>many other departments.  Under this Government, this has changed.  We have restored the Ministry 
<br/>of Tourism and Civil Aviation as a standalone entity that can act as a better support system to the 
<br/>private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On tourism numbers, I strongly support His  Excellency’s statement that in the short term 
<br/></span><span>economic outlook supporting  tourism will  be critical  -  that is  a reality.   Fiji’s economic recovery 
<br/>continues on the back of a strong tourism rebound.  In 2022 our visitor arrival surpassed expectation, 
<br/>reaching 71.1 percent of 2019 levels underpinned by the Australia, New Zealand and the US markets. 
<br/>In December last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recorded the highest number of Australians in history in 
<br/>a single month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I come from the industry and I know how challenging the pandemic would 
<br/>have been on the operators, so I take this opportunity to thank the industry for its sacrifices and the 
<br/></span><span>remarkable commitment in getting us through some of our darkest days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first few days of taking office, I visited many tourism stakeholders.   
<br/>I can say with a lot of confidence that we are now in a new era of economic development.  In the first 
<br/>quarter of 2023, we have exceeded pre-trend pandemic levels as far as hotel bookings go.  Just in the 
<br/>last  week  of  January,  the  average  occupancy  recorded  was  75  percent.    In  2019,  the  average 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>occupancy for the same week was 43 percent.  The Revenue per available room (RevPAR)recorded 
<br/>for this week was $305, much higher than 2019 levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at February to April 2023, top countries searching for accommodation are Australia, 
<br/>New  Zealand  and  United  States  of  America  with  an  average  length  of  stay  of  up  to  seven  days.  
<br/>Tourists intend to stay longer and it shows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the confidence that people have in our 
<br/>tourism and Fiji as a country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an example Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Castaway Island considers 2022 as the best year since 
<br/>beginning  its  operation  in  58  years.    This  year,  they  forecast  it  to  be  even  better.    Nationally, 
<br/>occupancy rates were up to 74 percent in 2022 compared to 68.2 percent in 2019 with a higher guest 
<br/>satisfaction.  So, there is a lot of optimism Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to share that Fiji Airways forward bookings for the next twelve months is 40 
<br/>percent ahead of the same period in 2019.  When I met the executive management of Fiji Airways 
<br/>last month, they were recording bookings at an 8 percent rate weekly, even with our markets open, 
<br/>the  bookings  are  better  than  2019.  This  is  an  unprecedented  and  historical  achievement,  as  our 
<br/>national airline exceeded any and all expectations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forward  plans,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  -  we  are  currently  bound  by  the  budget  of  the  previous 
<br/>administration for the most part, but  we will continue to  deliver.   Nine years  ago,  I stood in  this 
<br/>august Parliament and shared my hopes of contributing to the development of our country.  At that 
<br/>time, we spoke of some $2 billion in tourism earnings.  As the former CEO of the then Fiji Visitors 
<br/>Bureau, I questioned who the billions were for.  I stand by that today as we strive for a more equitable 
<br/>sharing of the billions from tourism.  We will no longer confine our ethos on what we can do for 
<br/>tourists but also significantly, what they can do for us.  It will be a give and take. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On enhancing connectivity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over 90 percent of visitors to Fiji arrived by air.  
<br/>For us, our national airline carries 70 percent of arrivals.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways will continue 
<br/>to invest in advanced, fuel-efficient modern aircraft.  We are also looking at the addition of two new 
<br/>Airbuses A350s.  These aircrafts are the most advanced in commercial aviation and the remarkable 
<br/>addition to our fleet that adds to our reach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with added seats, we have the option to add capacity to fly to routes that are 
<br/>in demand and the flexibility to explore other markets.  As His Excellency shared, Fiji Airways is 
<br/>expanding its global network, which means that we will continue to invest in new routes.  We are 
<br/></span><span>already reporting strong numbers since the direct flights to Vancouver, Canada.  By April 2023, we 
<br/></span><span>will  also  be  returning  to  Japan  and  Hong  Kong.    The  forecast  for  2023  is  to  carry  two  million 
<br/>passengers and revenue of over FJ$1.5 billion in 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the North American middle-income market has a huge potential for us.  We 
<br/>are now exploring the possibility of flying to Dallas, Seattle or Houston without compromising our 
<br/>position on Open Skies. The national carrier is a five-star rated airline that is on a journey to becoming 
<br/>world class, a feat that very few airlines have achieved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our national air carrier is our pride, from its inception … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … to the days of Air Pacific ….

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>61 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Wait for it, wait for it!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Our national airline is our pride from its inception to the days of Air 
<br/>Pacific, and now Fiji Airways.  There is this weird belief by FijiFirst that they are the only ones who 
<br/>are proud of our airline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- But you were opposing it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We have been proud of it since the days of Air Pacific, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have supported it all along the way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- One of the CEOs proudly wanted to sell the planes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, soon we will drop the requirement for vaccination 
<br/>and insurance to enter Fiji.  We are a highly vaccinated nation, and this gives us the confidence to 
<br/>take the next step in easing travel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a new global brand.  We have just launched a new brand where 
<br/>happiness comes naturally.  This pays homage to our people, our natural, our rich culture, giving 
<br/>visitors a feel of what it truly means to be happy in our context.  Tourism Fiji’s website tracking 
<br/>shows 20 percent lift in traffic and 20 percent lift in new users since the launch of the new campaign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  driving  investments,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  an  increase  in  air  capacity  and  a  stronger 
<br/>appetite for the Fiji tourism brand, there is a risk of imbalance between rooms and seats.  It is a good 
<br/>problem to have but one that requires a concerted effort to attract investments.  At present we have a 
<br/>pipeline of investments valued at approximately $280 million with about a thousand rooms inventory 
<br/>that should create hundreds of jobs for our people.  That is the power of tourism in Fiji so we need 
<br/>more strategic investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to connect investment-ready projects to investors, so we have more 
<br/>rooms to be able to attract more visitors.  In March this year, we are looking to host the first Tourism 
<br/>Investment Summit in partnership with Investment Fiji and Tourism Fiji.  It is an exclusive gathering 
<br/>of 50 key tourism investors, hoteliers, brands and associated businesses that gives us the opportunity 
<br/></span><span>to attract legitimate investors to boost investments.  It is about time we think bigger and act on it.  A 
<br/></span><span>Tourism Investment Report will also be launched capturing key information that an investor requires 
<br/>to know that “Fiji is open for business”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point I want to clear the perception of high leakage in tourism.  We now own most of 
<br/>the properties in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, in the likes of the Marriott, InterContinental, Sheraton, Westin, 
<br/>GPH,  Holiday  Inn,  all  are  now  locally  owned  by  the  people.    In  community-based  tourism,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, I want to add that the intent is not to build multi-complex 5-stars all around Fiji.  Instead, 
<br/>we  want  to  nurture  and  support  smaller,  more  community-owned  businesses  who  can  add  to  the 
<br/></span><span>pipeline of inventory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  few  weeks  ago,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  I  met  the  people  of  Yasawas,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  In 2016, there were some 38 locally-owned businesses in Yasawa.  Today, there are only 
<br/>nine remaining.  If we bring them back online, which we will do, we are adding to the room bank 
<br/>that we sorely need.  Our plan going forward is to support our resource owners and our indigenous 
<br/>people, so they too can have a larger share of the tourism pie.  Tourism destinations like Yasawa who

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a huge potential have been somewhat neglected and we have spoken about this for years in this 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support indigenous Fijians, to support the </span><span>vanua</span><span> does not mean we are going back in time.  
<br/>Indigenous  communities  have  been  marginalised  to  the  point  of  being  considered  amongst  the 
<br/>vulnerable  today.  What  we  encourage  is  the  protection  and  appropriate  promotion  of  indigenous 
<br/>culture,  traditional  knowledge,  the  land  and  waters  on  which  it  is  based.    This  way  there  is  an 
<br/>equitable partnership between the tourism industry and indigenous people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  week,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  was  at  a  UN  Development  Programme  event  where  eight 
<br/>investment-ready projects are now being scaled up through a Blue Accelerator Grant Scheme.  One 
<br/>of them was the </span><span>Uto Ni Yalo</span><span> and </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Treks who intend to develop Fiji’s first ever ocean trail 
<br/>building using traditional sailing knowledge. We are bringing back some of the old ways and these 
<br/>are the types of products that can complement tourism in outer islands such as Yasawa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Ministry response for Civil Aviation, we also intend to invest in our 
<br/>airports  especially  those  in  the outer islands.    I have met  with  the Chair  and management of  Fiji 
<br/>Airports  Limited  and  we  are  looking  to  upgrade  the  airport  terminals  in  Labasa,  Nausori,  Nadi 
<br/>Domestic and Savusavu during the next 18 months.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the intent here is to create a 
<br/>level playing field. We want infrastructure to be built as such that it accommodates different aircraft 
<br/>fleets both the Fiji Link and Northern Air. We need to encourage healthy competition for the sake of 
<br/>not just tourists, but for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on dispersing tourism, Vanua Levu our second largest island needs to get 
<br/>the attention it deserves and so do the other islands in Fiji.  We are one and we should grow as one.  
<br/>We  are  now  advancing  discussions  with  the  World  Bank  to  finance  the  upgrade  of  critical 
<br/>infrastructure in the North.  I will soon be taking this to Cabinet and to our people of Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On improving business and private sector led investments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly 
<br/>support His Excellency’s statement on the Coalition Government’s focus on building confidence and 
<br/>trust with businesses and investors. For years we have been hearing about business reforms in this 
<br/>august Parliament - to what end, I do not know. Business reforms should be based on its impact to 
<br/>investors and to the people. We know that some good work has been put in making Fiji more investor 
<br/>friendly for both foreign and local investments.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to work on that intensely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my first week in office, we allowed the commencement of an important project that was 
<br/></span><span>issued a stop work for no apparent or legal reason.  This was a development worth $31 million and 
<br/></span><span>had  already  invested  $9  million  in  value.  We  cannot  defy  transparency  and  expect  investor 
<br/>confidence this way. We quickly uplifted this stop order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On regionalism, the honourable Prime Minister has lead Fiji’s re-engagement with our Pacific 
<br/>family. We are reminded of the power of a coalition - a partnership. We need to restore the balance 
<br/>of  interest  between  Fiji  and  the  Pacific.  We  are  one  people  with  common  identity  and  common 
<br/>challenges and opportunities.  Fiji does owe a duty of care to the Pacific family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  strengthen  our  relations  with  the  Pacific  Tourism  Organisation 
<br/></span><span>(SPTO).  As a regional Minister, I intend to usher in a new partnership built on a duty of care to one 
<br/>another. We will also bring back our island neighbours to be part of the Fiji Tourism Expo as was 
<br/>the case in the past.  It is a premier trade exchange with a huge international profile that bring buyers 
<br/>and sellers together - it should also benefit our neighbours.  Fiji should truly become the hub of the 
<br/>region, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  to  look  beyond  our  short  term  margins,  we  need  to  invest  our 
<br/>businesses, invest in our people and their capabilities, invest in preserving the environment - what 
<br/>we take we must return.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the people of Fiji, please remember your hardships are no longer yours alone to overcome. 
<br/>Time will bear testament. Our leadership as a Coalition Government is what will shape the society 
<br/>we want today and tomorrow. We will walk this journey together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and may our God Almighty bless our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  fellow  Members  of  Parliament,  a  very  good 
<br/>afternoon, </span><span>ram ram, salaam</span><span> and </span><span>bula</span><span> to you all.  Today marks my third term in Parliament. What a 
<br/>journey it has been for the past eight years, and I wonder what is instore for us for years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  congratulate  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  on  your  appointment  as  the  honourable  Speaker  of  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I respond to His Excellency, I must say, I had the support of many individuals who 
<br/>stood beside me during the campaign and through their effort and hard work, it was made possible 
<br/>for me to make it to Parliament for the third time.  To name a few, I would like to start with my 
<br/>parents - Mr. Ambika Prasad, Mrs. Malti Devi, my wife - Swastika Pooja Devi, for providing moral 
<br/>support before, during and after the Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the Northern Division, Mr. Nalesh Sami and his team, Mrs. Nirmala, Mr. Amrit, Mr. 
<br/>Hiren, Mr. Mukesh and Mr. Sami from Bua.  From the Western Division, Mr. Keshwa and Priya 
<br/>Sharma and Mr. Dev Nand. From the Central Division, Mr. Ratnesh Bawan and his team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is sad to note that given what has transpired in the past few weeks, some of my supporters 
<br/>have requested me not to mention their names as they fear they might be victimised for supporting 
<br/>FijiFirst</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh, no. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- This fear is not some conclusion, but reality on the ground.  Though 
<br/></span><span>I cannot take those names, but you all know who you are, and I thank you all from the bottom of my 
<br/>heart for your hard work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would  also  to  thank all my  voters who had  faith in  me to represent them  in  Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, once again, and  thank you for your precious votes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I have always said this in this august Parliament, to build any country, we need strong and 
<br/>independent institutions.  Independent institutions are regarded as the pillars of development for any 
<br/></span><span>nation.  The very reason it is called independent is because there should be no political interference 
<br/></span><span>or personal interest both, from inside and from outside the institution.  How can we have continuity 
<br/>in the institution when the Government of the day is undermining the institution because they do not 
<br/>like the individual that heads the institution and in the process, weaken the institution.  This shows 
<br/>direct political interference.  I would like to ask, why Constitutional Officers are removed on such 
<br/>allegations?

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge all Fijians, in particular those in the Public Service, to see and realise what is happening.  
<br/>The same tactics will be used against you tomorrow, if the administration is not happy with you.  The 
<br/>precedence  that  is  being  set  is  not  good.    We  are  talking  about  constitutional  officers  and  being 
<br/>suspended  and  terminated  without  rhyme  or  reason  without  due  process.    This  shows  a  lack  of 
<br/>adherence to the Constitution and national justice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is being paranoid and try to control everything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- You think about yourselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  They  treat  professionals  like  criminals,  showing  disrespect  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>professionals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having generalised perception that civil servants will favour Opposition  just because they 
<br/>were appointed at a time when FijiFirst was in Government is unethical.  Everyone needs to be given 
<br/>a fair chance to prove themselves and should not be removed from their position just because they 
<br/>were appointed during the term of the previous government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will come and go, Members of Parliament will retire, but what remains behind 
<br/>is the legacy and what we have built for our future generation.  We want our future generation to 
<br/>have a better and brighter future that was guaranteed under the FijiFirst Government.  No matter what 
<br/>differences  we have in  our policies, we should never  embed racial discrimination in  our younger 
<br/>generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Now, you are saying the right thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  It  was  unfortunate  for  Fiji  that  the  2022  General  Election  was 
<br/>fought, once again, on ethnic and religious lines by the three Coalition Parties.  It should have been 
<br/>fought on policies, development agendas and ideas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Look ahead, look ahead! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Fiji has a very young population and it seems like they have lost 
<br/>faith in the system and that is the reason they opted not to vote in General Elections.  What matters 
<br/>to younger generation is stability, opportunity, progress and prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the younger generation, division based on race, religion and ethnicity does not matter.  
<br/></span><span>We  need  to  empower  our  younger  people  and  not  divide  them.    No  country  can  realise  its  full 
<br/>potential if the Government will divide its own people.  A lot was said during Election campaign, a 
<br/>lot of things that were said or promised were either not practical or sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  been  saying  all  these  from  day  one  that  not  everything  is  practical,  we  need 
<br/>development, but we need to ensure that we are able to sustain that development.  Now, that you 
<br/>people are in Government, it will be interesting to see how many of those promises made during 
<br/>campaign are going to be implemented and how many of it will just remain as false promises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Like Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAN.-  Just  like  honourable  Kamikamica,  he  has  already  shown  his 
<br/>immaturity by saying that some of the things he said during the campaign was done in the heat of the 
<br/>moment.

<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Aww!

<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We never says such things in that heat of the moment.  Maybe his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>heat of the moment meant, ‘I lied’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Remember Government, the student are still waiting for their TELS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>loan to be written off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Everyone staying in  rural  and feeder roads are  waiting  for their 
<br/>roads  to  be  fixed.    The  FijiFirst  Government  started  a  programme  where  we  were  fixing  feeder 
<br/>roads… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You left a mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- … so let us see if that continues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You left a mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- People without electricity are waiting to be connected to EFL grids.  
<br/>People are waiting for Government Ministers and Assistant Ministers mobile numbers to raise their 
<br/>concern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- With us, people used to call us anytime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, distribute your mobile numbers to the general public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We share. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Even the official directory given by Parliament, they do not have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your mobile numbers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- They have the Secretary’s name, they are landline numbers.  Where 
<br/>are your mobile numbers? Please, distribute it to Fijians. Let them raise their concerns directly to you 
<br/>people.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People are wondering, that under FijiFirst Government there was no stage restrictions for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>student fare but now it is only two stages.  I will give a typical example of two schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are happy with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the distance between Nadogo Secondary School 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Naleba College is roughly around 29 kilometres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible intejection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  District  of  Nadogo  has    only  one  secondary  school,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  If a student is not able to secure a place in Nadogo Secondary, he or she must travel 
<br/>daily to Naleba College which is eight stages away.  Why are the poor parents paying for six stages 
<br/>while the Government covers only for two stages?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- This is Nadogo, the students are travelling from Dogotuki to Naleba 
<br/>College which is roughly around 50 kilometres, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  One can do the math, how many 
<br/>stages are there? What a change the Government has brought for the students and their parents?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Policies  are  all  over  the  places  without  any  coordination.  Ministers  are  still  trying  to 
<br/>understand their ministerial duties.  The honourable Prime Minister’s right arm is unaware what the 
<br/>left arm is saying or doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The Prime Minister’s own Ministers are questioning his decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inauble interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The Government’s legal Advisor is giving legal advice which is 
<br/></span><span>not in line with the law. Someone needs to put the act of the current administration together because 
<br/></span><span>this  will  have  undesirable  impact  on  the  nation  such  as  corruption,  breakdown  of  rule  of  law, 
<br/>discrimination, and this will create a chaos. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- $32,000 a month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have a better way of utilising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  The  FijiFirst  Government  was  offering progress and prosperity, 
<br/></span><span>social  economic  stability  and  equal  rights.    What  are  we  seeing  for  the  past  few  weeks?  
<br/></span><span>Disorientation, confusion and miscommunication.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Ministers think they can do anything. The honourable Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General is issuing directive for stop departure when he does not have the powers to do so.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  It  should  be  done  and  can  only  be  done  by  the  FICAC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissioner … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It was issued by FICAC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- …or through a Court Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Shame, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  separation  of  powers  between  the  three  arms  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government -the Executive, the Legislature and Judiciary, is no longer there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Those three institutions should be separate from each other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQANIBETE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Members  of  Parliament  and  now,  the  Government  Ministers 
<br/>coming into Parliament in a drunk state for their swearing in ceremony.  Bending of law as and how 
<br/>it suits them.  Changing the Manifesto, as now the Coalition Government realises that some of the 
<br/>promises uttered during campaign cannot be fulfilled because it will be unsustainable.  So now, the 
<br/>Coalition Government has a very good reason to hide, that is, it is a Coalition Government and all 
<br/>Parties must compromise on their manifesto.  So, it is all about change, change and change, and since 
<br/>the word ‘change’ is so deeply rooted in their head, they opted to change their manifesto as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who is going to suffer at the end of the day?  The ordinary Fijians - Fijians who were lured 
<br/>into believing that everything PAP, NFP and SODELPA were saying will be done and will be good, 
<br/>but now, it is going to change.  One thing that will be maintained and will be consistent is going to 
<br/>be the everchanging policies of the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, things that were consistent with FijiFirst were our policies and principles.  
<br/></span><span>We stood then for the  Fijians, and we will continue to stand for the Fijians.  I urge the Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government to change the name of the recruitment system from OMRS to FNRS because the way 
<br/>people are being chosen under the current administration is not on open merit but on favouritism and 
<br/>nepotism.  So, let us call it favouritism and nepotism-based recruitment system.
