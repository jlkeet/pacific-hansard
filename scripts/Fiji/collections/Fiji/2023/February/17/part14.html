<h3>“WE, THE PEOPLE OF FIJI</h3>
<div><span>“WE, THE PEOPLE OF FIJI  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  RECOGNISING  the  indigenous  people  or  the  iTaukei,  their  ownership  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei lands, their unique culture, customs, traditions and language.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  His  Excellency’s  Address,  he  referred  to  ILO  169  Convention  and  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).  Those two Instruments were labelled 
<br/>by the Opposition as irrelevant to Fiji because the indigenous Fijians were well protected, a narrative 
<br/>they religiously advanced for the past 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on that, they executed a systematic erosion and weakening the iTaukei institutions and 
<br/>rights.  They promulgated 37 legislations which directly marginalised the iTaukei, contrary to ILO 
<br/>Convention  169  and  UNDRIP.    More  importantly,  they  contradicted  the  Preamble  of  their  own 
<br/>Constitution - a direct assault on the iTaukei people, its institutions and culture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei have emerged from the last 16 years, battered and bruised.  But let me re-assure 
<br/>this august Parliament and those who are listening, we shall, and we will overcome.  The voice of 
<br/>our chiefs who wanted our country to be on the better side of history on 10</span><span>th</span><span> October, 1874, continues 
<br/>to whisper through the ages.  Today, we reaffirm that enduring spirit.  For those who think they can 
<br/>continue to bulldoze their way through and suppress our voice - today is your answer. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>the journey to right the wrong has already started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  His  Excellency  announced,  the  Great  Council  of  Chiefs  (GCC)  will  be  re-established.  
<br/>Cabinet has approved the framework to bring it back. Fijians will be consulted on what way  they 
<br/>think should be the best option for the GCC. We will follow the process for its re-establishment but 
<br/>with wide consultation. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  2007,  the  previous  Government  gradually  weakened  the  GCC  until  it  was  de-
<br/>established in 2012, without consultation.  The absence of GCC gave the Minister for iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>absolute discretion to make decisions and allowed for the introduction of 37 legislations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  enable  their  motive,  the  previous  Government  chose  to  ignore  UNDRIP  and  ILO 
<br/>Convention  169  as  the  principle  of  free,  prior  and  informed  consent  is  deeply  embedded  in  both 
<br/>Conventions.  It is the very principle that they removed from section 12 of the iTaukei Land Trust 
<br/>Act through Bill No. 17, which later became Act 22 of 2021.  This removed the requirement for any 
<br/>lessee to obtain iTLTB consent for any mortgage, charge, pledges and caveat.  Again, there was no 
<br/>consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  contrast,  the  Coalition  Government  has  been  consistently  doing  consultations  from  day 
<br/>one.  Cabinet has agreed to review the iTaukei Land Trust Act and to remove the amendment made 
<br/>by Bill No. 17 or Act 22 of 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is working towards endorsing UNDRIP.  Of the 
<br/>37  legislations  that  marginalised  the  iTaukei,  19  falls  under  our  Ministry,  11  will  be  addressed 
<br/>through the two Cabinet decisions I have just mentioned.  We have just breathed some life into the 
<br/>valley of 37 dry bones.  Be assured that the remaining 26 will be restored.  Never before has any 
<br/>Government  faced  a  massive  challenge  like  this,  but  it  is  a  challenge  that  will  be  met.    We  will 
<br/>persevere, we will overcome, we will succeed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency mentioned that the principal iTaukei laws will be reviewed.  
<br/>These will be underpinned by strategic reviews of iTaukei institutions, to improve their efficiency to 
<br/>better serve the iTaukei and other stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next month, we will organise a forum for natural resource owners and users.  We want them 
<br/>to tell us how we can better utilise our natural resources to improve our livelihood.  This will shape 
<br/>and  inform  our  contribution  to  some  of  Government’s  broader  initiatives,  such  as  the  National 
<br/>Economic Summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important issue for the iTaukei is Traditional Knowledge and Expression 
<br/>of  our  Culture.    The  iTaukei  Traditional  Knowledge  is  a  body  of  knowledge  that  is  developed, 
<br/>sustained and passed on from generation to generation with the iTaukei communities.  It forms part 
<br/>of our culture and spiritual identity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  not  protected  by  Fiji’s  current  intellectual  property  system.    Expression  of  culture 
<br/></span><span>result from the creativity of individuals, groups and societies that have cultural contents, for example, 
<br/></span><span>meke</span><span>  and  traditional  songs.    There  is  a  draft  Traditional  Knowledge  and  Expression  of  Culture 
<br/>legislation which will again go through the consultation process before it is brought to this august 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  for  the  past  few  weeks,  I  had  visited  Provincial  Council  Offices  of  Rewa, 
<br/>Tailevu, Naitasiri, Namosi and Serua.  I was overwhelmed by the warm welcome I received from the 
<br/></span><span>vanua</span><span>.  There is a rising tide of approval that this Government is on the right track.  We want our 
<br/></span><span>provinces and their commercial arms to succeed. To do that, we must improve their governance and 
<br/></span><span>empower their people.  It is about governance and empowering our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to acknowledge the leadership of the iTaukei institutions and their commercial arms - 
<br/>Fijian Holdings and Fijian Trust Fund for totalling supporting the Coalition Government’s vision.  
<br/>They have already taken concrete steps within their current mandate and legislation to deliver this.  
<br/>In two to three years, we will see real changes, not superficial or </span><span>ad hoc</span><span>.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>298 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the other topical issues of traditional or </span><span>vanu</span><span>a governance, there are 6,219 
<br/>chiefly or customary titles in Fiji. Of these, 2,892 or 47 percent have been confirmed by the iTaukei 
<br/>Lands Commission.  The remaining 53 percent are still vacant.  This demonstrates a challenge for us 
<br/>but  we  will  overcome  that.    We  will  look  at  ways  to  encourage  unconfirmed  title  holders  to  be 
<br/>confirmed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>vanua</span><span> system will have to be formalised under the enabling instrument which is also part 
<br/>of the Coalition Government’s Manifesto on the co-existence of the provincial and the </span><span>vanua</span><span> system.  
<br/>The current practice is to encourage their confirmation, but we really have nothing to empower them.  
<br/>The  lease  distribution  formula  that  used  to  support  them  was  forcefully  removed,  again  without 
<br/>consultation. The impact is now obvious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  through  the  Traditional  Leadership  Training  at  CATD  in  Nadave,  we  will 
<br/>continue to empower them for better management of their roles and resources.  Further the </span><span>turaga ni 
<br/>koro </span><span>(village headmen)</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>mata ni tikina</span><span> (tikina representatives) will be empowered to effectively 
<br/>implement planned programmes for the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, with emphasis on good and proper governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To this end, we would like to acknowledge the tremendous support rendered by the various 
<br/>NGOs, assisting in the running of different training programmes at the centre.  We look forward to a 
<br/>closer working arrangement with them as we progress with the development of our youths.  Likewise, 
<br/>the iTaukei institutions - Fijian Holdings and iTaukei Trust Fund are currently exploring mechanisms 
<br/>that will trickle down their portfolio to the 1,173 villages and 250 registered informal settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  iTaukei  community  has  been  neglected  in  the  past.  We  appear  to  have 
<br/>continued  the  protection  mode  from  the  Colonial  era  with  institutional  changes  in  2018  being 
<br/>operationalised without proper resourcing.  To the other communities, we request that you bear with 
<br/>us.    As  we  restructure  and  empower  our  indigenous  people  to  cope  with  the  realities  of  today’s 
<br/>challenges, we will be calling for your participation and support in these processes. We believe that 
<br/>improving the well-being of the iTaukei will have its ripple effect on the other communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are very mindful of the sentiments express by the late honourable Jai Ram 
<br/>Reddy while addressing the then GCC as expressed in His Excellency’s Address. Indeed, we want 
<br/>all communities that call Fiji their home to thrive and be at peace.  This can only come about if the 
<br/>well-being  of  the  iTaukei  are  properly  addressed  in  tandem  with  their  implications  on  the  other 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition has bombarded us with discrimination this week.  They have 
<br/></span><span>supported with the biblical line that we are all equal in God’s eyes.  We do not dispute that, but they 
<br/>failed to mention the principle of positive discrimination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Qarase Government had put  in  place the  Social  Justice  Act  to  improve the  economic 
<br/>positions of the </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>  It was part of the 50/50 by 20/20 vision.  If that vision was given a chance 
<br/>to succeed, Fiji would have been in a different place by now.  But we all know, the rest is history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, I would like to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span><span>and the FijiFirst Government for the last 16 years of service in Fiji.  It allowed them to amass a pool 
<br/></span><span>of skill-sets in various disciplines.  It is my hope that these areas of development expertise within the 
<br/>Opposition can be readily made available when called on for the development of our nation.  We 
<br/>may be on a different side of this august Parliament, but I believe, we all have the same goal for our 
<br/>people and the nation.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by reaffirming my strong commitment to implement His

<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Jeremiah 17:7-8 says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Blessed are those who trust in the Lord for they are like trees planted along the 
<br/>river banks, with roots that reach deep down into the water, such trees are not bothered 
<br/>by the heat or worried by long months of drought.  Their leaves stay green, and they go 
<br/>on delivering delicious fruits.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, </span><span>mia’u sa bula sia</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise today in this august Parliament to lend my full support to His Excellency the President, 
<br/></span><span>Turaga  Bale  na  Tui  Macuata</span><span>,  for  his  most  gracious  and  inspiring  Address  at  the  inauguration  of 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,  I would like to  begin  by first  congratulating you on your election as the 
<br/>Speaker  of  this  august  Parliament.  Being  no  stranger  to  Parliament  and  as  the  longest  serving 
<br/>parliamentarian, honourable Members of this august Chamber have full confidence in your leadership 
<br/>qualities and ability to guide Fiji’s democratic process within the next four years.   This 
<br/>is  also  a 
<br/>proud moment for me and the people of my province in Cakaudrove to witness our paramount chief 
<br/>being elected to this prestigious position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  congratulate  honourable  Lenora  Qereqeretabua  for  being  elected  to  this 
<br/>esteemed  office  as  the  Deputy  Speaker  of  the  Fiji  Parliament.  Your  elevation  to  this  prestigious 
<br/></span><span>position in your second term in Parliament, is an inspiration to all the women and young girls in Fiji 
<br/></span><span>and the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the last few years in Parliament, the credibility and dignity of this 
<br/>august Parliament has at most times been tarnished by acts of political and personal vilifications, 
<br/>vengeance,  verbal  abuses  and  unprofessional  acts  and  disrespectful  conduct  on  both  sides  of 
<br/>Parliament.  Since being elected to Parliament in December 2022, it is my sincere desire and hope 
<br/>that  this  august  Parliament  will  embody  the  collective  spirit  of  inclusiveness,  collaboration  and 
<br/>respect for one another.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must strive to trust and have hope in each other. Together, we can find solutions if only 
<br/>we  put  our  political  differences  aside  and  work  together  for  the  betterment  of  our  nation,  in 
<br/>cooperation and unity.  We must lead by examples and let the people of our beloved Fiji see our 
<br/>renewed  spirit  of  love  and  compassion,  our  collaborative  approach  while  debating  for  a  better 
<br/>solution to our problems. This will bring a new dawn of hope, of a promising and a brighter future 
<br/>for Fiji.

<div><span>300 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the experience and knowledge of the Opposition in running the Government 
<br/>for the last 16 years can be relied upon and I acknowledge that there will be many opportunities to 
<br/>learn  from  them.    I  reiterate  the  sentiments  raised  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister’s  inaugural 
<br/>address to the nation in which he highlighted Government’s stand to develop a positive relationship 
<br/>with the Opposition, as part of a broader initiative to enhance national unity.  Government will always 
<br/>be prepared to consider the ideas from the Opposition carefully to ensure inclusiveness and foster 
<br/>greater ownership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my deepest appreciation to 
<br/>all the voters for their confidence and trust in my ability to be able to effectively represent them and 
<br/>to raise their concerns in this honourable Parliament.  At this juncture, I wish to acknowledge the 
<br/>hard work of my campaign team from Vaturova - Ropate Matakibau, Gabiriele Sisa and Ananaiasa 
<br/>Koro.  First and foremost, to the </span><span>Turaga na Tui Vaturova</span><span>, </span><span>Valelevu i Na’ase</span><span> and the </span><span>Bose Vanua o 
<br/>Vaturova</span><span> - this is the power-base of my journey in my political life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to extend my esteemed gratitude to the other four Yavusa in the </span><span>Vanua o 
<br/>Vaturova</span><span> - </span><span>Yavusa o Vusaratu</span><span>, </span><span>Yavusa o Wacawaca</span><span>, </span><span>Yavusa Lekutulevu</span><span>, last but not the least </span><span>Yavusa 
<br/>o Ravunivatu</span><span>.  </span><span>Vina’a va’alevu Vaturova na veiva’menemenei</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Equally important, I would also like to convey my sincere gratitude to the support rendered 
<br/>to me from the people of Vaturova living in Australia, especially to Sosiceni Towa, Reverend Waisea 
<br/>Kania  who  is  my  mentor,  and  my  two  cousin  brothers  -  Anare  and  Semiti  Vocea,  and  my  sister 
<br/>Rayape Posselt, and also others whom I have not mentioned their names.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  acknowledge  the  support  from  the  United  Kingdom,  especially  to  Nau  Lo  and  Pita 
<br/>Dovibua from the United States.  I would also like to convey my most sincere gratitude for the support 
<br/>and kind words of encouragement I received from the </span><span>Turaga na Tui Koroalau</span><span> and the Villages of 
<br/>Vuinadi, Vunidogoloa, Nabua, Natoa, Bucalevu, Nakawaga and Nukubolu, not forgetting the </span><span>vanua 
<br/></span><span>of  Nacuqu  in  Korosi,  the  villages  of  Nagigi,  Nacavanadi,  Waivunia,  Vivili,  Naidi,  Nukubalavu, 
<br/>Nacekoro and Yaroi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The overwhelming support from the </span><span>Turaga na Tui Vunidawa</span><span> and the people of Koronatoga 
<br/>and Tabia have been encouraging. I would also like to take my hat off to my former school teacher -  
<br/>Mr  Setareki  Koroilagilagi  for  giving  me  the  chance  to  replace  him  in  the  </span><span>Vanua  o  Wairiki</span><span>.    The 
<br/>overwhelming support that was rendered to me from the Wairiki people will never be forgotten.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  pay  tribute  to  the  support  I  received  from  the  village  of  Nadrala  in  Nadroga.    I 
<br/></span><span>acknowledge the support from the Methodist Church congregation from the </span><span>Tabacakacaka Nasea</span><span> in 
<br/>Labasa and </span><span>Wasewaselevu o Macuata</span><span>, especially from members of my church in Kaleli, Vatunibale. 
<br/>Thank you once again for your kind support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  I  have  been  receiving  kind  words  of  encouragement  from  Reverent  Tevita  Mau  in 
<br/>Dreketi  in  Macuata. 
<br/>  Equally  the  same,  the  brilliant  support  from  my  neighbours  at 
<br/>Kauvula/Kaudamu Road in Delainavesi, together with those staying at the settlement in Lovonilase.  
<br/>I am indebted and honoured with the support of the residents of Tamavua-i-Wai.  You stood beside 
<br/></span><span>me  and  voted  for  me  amongst  the  many  political  opponents  that  flooded  the  corridors  of  your 
<br/></span><span>settlement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>the strongest pillar of my support is none other than that of my own family. 
<br/>I would like to pay special tribute to my beautiful wife, Miriama Vocea, and my son - Ken, daughter-
<br/>in-law - Bella, granddaughter - Anaseini Rosi, and my niece - Anaseini Galo, who have always stood 
<br/>by me and are my source of inspiration. I would like to convey my deepest appreciation to my home

<br/>and other parts of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing  in  this  dignified  Parliament  today  brings  me  back  memories  of  my  humble 
<br/>beginning  and  upbringing  in  my  village  of  Ravita  in  Vaturova.    Mr.  Speaker  Sir,</span><span> </span><span>you  will  all 
<br/>understand the challenges</span><span> </span><span>of having to be brought up in a family of four children by my late mother, 
<br/>Mere Waqavuka, singlehandedly.  She was an iron lady.  Everyday was a struggle, not only for me 
<br/>and for my elder siblings, but moreso for that courageous woman who was my only beacon of hope. 
<br/>And for the audacity of that very special woman, I pay tribute to all the single mothers in Fiji today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>the hardships we faced as a family and having to witness my mother going 
<br/>out of her way to ensure that I was accorded the same privilege that children who came from other 
<br/>families enjoyed, will continue to be my source of motivation to do well in life but perhaps, to serve 
<br/>the underprivileged families and communities in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My late mother was well-versed with the techniques of cutting copra and I often accompanied 
<br/>her to carry out such heavy tasks in order to send us to school and for the survival of our family. I 
<br/>paid  tribute  to  my  late  mother  and  my  late  siblings,  Inoke  and  Losalini,  while  Rayape,  my  only 
<br/>surviving sibling now resides in Sydney.  I only wish they were still around to witness this grand 
<br/>occasion from humble beginnings to where I am today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from my primary education at Vunisalusalu Primary School in Vaturova, I 
<br/>continued my secondary school at Ratu Kadavulevu School in Tailevu.  This is where my leadership 
<br/>qualities were recognised and nurtured.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After completing my University Entrance, my mother was not in a position to send me further 
<br/>for  tertiary  education,  so  I  opted  to  join  the  then  Public  Works  Department  (PWD)  as  a  casual 
<br/>labourer  during  the  construction  of  the  Natewa  Bay  West  Coast  Road  from  Tabia  right  up  to 
<br/>Nayaroyaro in Dogotuki, Macuata.  After six months as a labourer, I was promoted to Clerk, and 
<br/>then moved on to be the Chief Clerk in the establishment of the PWD Depot in Saqani which is still 
<br/>there today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After serving eight years in PWD, I then moved on to work for the Auditor-General’s Office 
<br/>for  a  term  of  three  years.    My  sheer  determination  and  motivation  to  succeed  in  life  led  to  my 
<br/></span><span>promotion to the Ministry of Employment and Industrial Relations which I served for three years 
<br/></span><span>before progressing to the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management.  
<br/>That  was  where  I  spent  more  of  my  Civil  Service  career,  spanning  24  years  culminating  in  my 
<br/>ascending to the position of Divisional Commissioner Northern from 2015 to 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to my appointment as the Divisional Commissioner Northern, I was 
<br/>fortunate to be given a diplomatic posting to the Fiji Embassy in Tokyo as a Principal Foreign Service 
<br/>Officer from 2012 to 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst working in Government, I was given two opportunities to pursue further studies.  From 
<br/></span><span>1994  to  1997,  I  completed  by  Bachelor  of  Arts  (majors  in  Management  and  Sociology)  at  the 
<br/>University of the South Pacific.  In 2007, I was offered a New Zealand Aid Scholarship to pursue my 
<br/>Master in Public Management  and Public Policy where I graduated in December 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during my tenure as a civil servant in Government, I also worked on part-
<br/>time basis as a sports reporter and commentator with the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation.  One of the

<div><span>many highlights in this field is providing live commentaries of the Wellington 7s and Los Angeles 
<br/>7s respectively in 2004, and to co-commentate during the Fiji National 15s Test matches with Japan 
<br/>during my tenure at the Fiji Embassy in Tokyo.  I also did live commentaries of the South Pacific 
<br/>Games that was held here in Fiji in 2003. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  still  have  those  skills  with  me  and  ready  to  utilise,  if  you  so  wish  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>organise any sports tournament in future for honourable Members of this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that background, I am  deeply  honoured to  the honourable Prime  Minister, who has 
<br/>found me worthy to be appointed as the Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and 
<br/>Disaster Management.  More than 30 years of experience in the Civil Service will boost my capacity 
<br/>to deliver to the best of my ability in the rural development field, which I always am passionate about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency’s Address is one of the remarkable clarities, visionary and 
<br/>optimistic with  Government’s priorities laid out in  the next  four years.  His Excellency’s call for 
<br/>unity is timely and sets the direction to this august Parliament to lead the way for Fiji.  I wish to 
<br/>reiterate the sentiment raised by His Excellency, and I quote from Pages 12 to 13 of His Excellency 
<br/>the President’s Address on Friday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2023: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Now more than ever, we must be united as one nation and strengthen our resolve 
<br/>to work together to meet our collective challenges.  We must continue to look after each 
<br/>other, especially those less fortunate and the most vulnerable members of our society.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our citizens anticipate honourable Members of this august Parliament to demonstrate unity in our 
<br/>diversity.  We must not let the people of Fiji down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a decision to transfer the Rural Housing Unit and the Rural Outer Island 
<br/>Programme  back  to  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development,  as  was  disclosed  by  His 
<br/>Excellency  the  President  during  his  Address,  is  fully  supported.    The  Ministry,  through  its  rural 
<br/>development machinery at the divisional, provincial and district level, in  collaboration with other 
<br/>line  Ministries  and  stakeholders,  will  assist  in  the  coordination  and  implementation  of  this 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Rural Outer Island Programme (ROI), the revival of this programme, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, will continue to empower rural farmers, coupled with market-driven approaches to enhance the 
<br/></span><span>livelihood  of  our  rural  dwellers.  The  Ministry  has  recognised  the  importance  of  agriculture  as  a 
<br/>critical  enabler  to  support  rural  development  and  will  be  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture on this front.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the Ministry is currently engaged in consultation with other line agencies in terms 
<br/>of discussing other non-agriculture sectors that can be considered in the revamped ROI development 
<br/>programme,  particularly  on  those  development  issues  that  were  raised  in  the  last  14  Provincial 
<br/>Council meetings. Development issues such as rural roads, rural water supply, solar power supply, 
<br/></span><span>communication networks and seawall were some of the common requests that were noted from the 
<br/></span><span>last 14 Provincial Council meetings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  our  rich  natural  resources,  coupled  with  development  issues  mentioned  above,  the 
<br/>integrated  approach  amongst  agencies  and  development  stakeholders  can  tailor-made  some 
<br/>development initiatives through this programme to maximize returns for our rural communities. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>303 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this same approach, the Ministry is pushing to invest more on economic empowerment 
<br/>development programmes in our rural communities. This will ensure that economic proceeds from 
<br/>those  projects  will  fund  the  future  development  priorities  of  the  community.  As  evident  in  the 
<br/>development  issues  raised  from  the  last  14  Provincial  Council  meetings,  only  7  percent  of  those 
<br/>development issues were economically related, which may indicate the level of economic activities 
<br/>that  exists  in  our  rural  communities.  This  statistic  is  alarming  and  it  needs  to  be  addressed  with 
<br/>urgency, Mr. Speaker Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once that is realised, Government can then focus on large capital investment for funding, and 
<br/>communities can fund its own development aspirations without fully dependent on Government.  It 
<br/>is about time now that we teach our rural communities how to fish rather than give them fish</span><span> </span><span>all the 
<br/>time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>the culture of dependency on Government has been in existence and thriving 
<br/>for so long, and this new Coalition Government is on its way to ensure it is minimised. On the same 
<br/>token,  our  rural  communities  must  be  empowered  to  be  independent  but  with  adequate  capacity 
<br/>building  and  support  from  Government  to  utilise  their  rich  natural  resources  to  support  their 
<br/>development aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  revitalising  of  cooperative  business  model,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,</span><span> </span><span>His  Excellency  has 
<br/>enlightened this august Parliament on the new efforts by Government to revitalise the cooperatives 
<br/>movement which includes the reform of the Cooperative Act and updated for better organisation and 
<br/>outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the cooperative movement  in  Fiji  was introduced in  1947 which focused 
<br/>predominantly  towards  the  development  of  grassroot  communities  and  the  increasing  number  of 
<br/>consumer cooperatives that are located mostly in rural and maritime areas. Cooperative is founded 
<br/>based on the values of “</span><span>solesolevaki</span><span>” and aligned to people’s communal way of living in the rural 
<br/>areas.  It  has  been  identified  to  have  the  potential  to  address  socio-economic  issues,  such  as 
<br/>unemployment and poverty, which are prevalent in our rural community today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, Lovia Cooperative located in Gusuisavu Village in Naitasiri, in its 10 years 
<br/>of  existence,  has  achieved  great  milestones.  From  a  consumer  store  to  transportation  and  bakery 
<br/>services, the business has been able to employ 18 villagers and in 2019 alone, earned a total revenue 
<br/>of approximately $595,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the Nukusolevu Cooperative in Nasarowaqa in Bua has generated income through 
<br/></span><span>utilising idle land to adopt integrated agricultural farming approach. With the assistance of the Fiji 
<br/>Sugar  Corporation,  the  cooperative  has  successfully  developed  103  hectares  of  vacant  land  in 
<br/>cultivating sugarcane and other crops. Since its registration in 2019, the cooperative has harvested 
<br/>about 2,087 tonnes of cane, generating an income of $177,450. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Nayarabale Youth Farm of Cakaudrove which was formed in 2008, is among the best 
<br/>proofs  that  success  is  achievable  for  our  indigenous  people  when  they  are  given  the  necessary 
<br/>opportunity and support, as well as discipline and skills.  Built on the principle of </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> and 
<br/></span><span>utilising social capital, indigenous values and ethos for the benefit of society as a whole, the farm has 
<br/></span><span>developed  from  having  zero  capital  to  generating  over  $100,000  in  revenue  annually.    This 
<br/>accomplishment, among others, is a testament worth noting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Rural Housing Assistance Programme, this Scheme was established 
<br/>with  the  main  objective  of  helping  rural  population  to  improve  living  conditions  and  reduce 
<br/>vulnerability to natural disasters.  The Ministry is currently finalising this programme, including the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potential  partnership  with  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  in  terms  of  scaling  up  this  housing  assistance 
<br/>programme for our rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  National  Disaster  Management,  Government  will  prioritise  the 
<br/>mainstreaming of disaster risk management initiatives through the National Disaster Management 
<br/>Office.  This will be implemented through the continued partnership with Government agencies, civil 
<br/>societies, business communities, academia and development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the devastating impacts of tropical cyclones has increased in recent years 
<br/>with increasing intensities and frequencies.  For the last three Tropical Cyclones namely, Category 4 
<br/></span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> that made landfall in Fiji within eight months, a total of  9,300 
<br/>houses were partially damaged and 3,300 houses were fully damaged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  other  consequences  of  extreme  weather  events  is  the  displacement  of 
<br/>communities as in the case of Coqea and Nabavatu Villages in Vanua Levu, where a total of 124 
<br/>households were affected after </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> in January 2021.  Similarly, the village of Dreketi on Qamea 
<br/>Island was affected by a massive landslide in 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it saddens me to inform this august Parliament that little to no progress has 
<br/>been made in relocating the aforementioned communities.  It is inhumane to expect the villagers of 
<br/>these communities to remain in their current deplorable status where community members continue 
<br/>to live in tents since their displacement in January 2021.  This is a case of travesty to the highest 
<br/>order  as  I,  for  one,  fail  to  fully  comprehend  the  stress  on  their  mental  and  physical  well-being.  
<br/>Moving on, Sir, the Coalition Government will work with stakeholders to resolve the root causes 
<br/>hindering the relocation of the aforementioned communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to correct one statement, if you may 
<br/>allow me, that was said in this Parliament on Monday by honourable Bulitavu where he mentioned 
<br/>that Mr. Joji Senitabua Leweniqila was campaigning for People’s Alliance Party and later came to 
<br/>vote in the SODELPA Management Board Meeting.  That is not true, Sir.  Mr. Joji Leweniqila has a 
<br/>twin brother called Kolinio Nadavo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Kolinio Nadavo was actively campaigning for People’s Alliance Party.  They are very 
<br/>identical twins and very hard to differentiate between those two.  So, during the campaigning period, 
<br/>Mr.  Joji  Leweniqila  was  in  Suva  working  for  a  law  firm  and  not  in  Vanua  Levu,  as  alleged  by 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu.  So, to state that this Coalition Government is in power by default, is a false 
<br/></span><span>accusation.  I think it is only proper for honourable Bulitavu to apologise to this august Parliament, 
<br/></span><span>as well as to Mr. Joji Leweniqila, for what has transpired.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you, once again, for your patience, indulgence, and I commend and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support the Address by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji in this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I thank the Arms of Providence for 
<br/></span><span>guiding me here to this Chamber of representatives this morning.  I acknowledge the God Almighty 
<br/></span><span>for His plans and His design, and I also acknowledge the advice that I get from those who advise me 
<br/>spiritually in my imminent space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  this  august  Parliament  and  to 
<br/>support the motion of the honourable Prime Minister in thanking His Excellency the President of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, </span><span>na i Taukei Bolatagane, Turaga na Tui Macuata, </span><span>Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, for his 
<br/>gracious Address and opening of Fiji’s Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow me first to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on your appointment as Speaker of Fiji’s 
<br/>Parliament.  Along with your Deputy, the honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua, Fiji and her people will 
<br/>look to you with expectation to deliver to them a Parliament that will be filled with decorum, respect 
<br/>and mutuality.  Perhaps, in times of heated debate, they would look to you, Sir, as a guide to steer 
<br/>the lively and constructive deliberations for the interest of our great nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, after all, is the ultimate seat of democracy in our land and you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>sit at the topmost.  I have, no doubt, it is a role that you will be able to discharge with a sense of 
<br/>dignity and passion, and these are traits that the people of Fiji have seen in your long service as a 
<br/>parliamentarian in this august Parliament in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to welcome those in Fiji and around the world who are listening from the 
<br/>comfort of their homes, offices and those who are in transit, or relaxing and through their gadgets are 
<br/>able to hear me today via livestream, making my maiden speech in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>ladies  and gentlemen who are seated in  the public gallery;  I ask of your indulgence to  say a few 
<br/>acknowledgements:

<br/>without which I am incomplete, my ultimate partner in life, the mother of my children, happy belated 
<br/>birthday.  Mr. Speaker, I was not able to take her out for dinner last night and in my defence, I said 
<br/>that I was here until after 9.00 p.m. So, to Sera, I got paid this week and the dinner bill is on me 
<br/>tonight.  To eternity! Thank you and I love you!  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>and I thank you for your support and your prayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To Sera, Teta, Semiti and Israel, you have made my life richer since you came to join us, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will do my utmost to be the father I can be in your life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my grandchildren - Puggy and Telly,  you are listening in from Labasa - I know you are 
<br/>taking away Pu Sera from me soon and that decision I do not like, but enjoy your short stay with your 
<br/>dad and your mum in the United States of America for a short while, but if you so decide to stay there 
<br/>in the USA, that is fine, just send your grandmother back to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  the  People’s  Alliance  Party  (PAP)  Suva  Branch  Constituency  Executives,  youth 
<br/></span><span>volunteers,  supporters  and  voters  from  Cunningham,  Vunivau,  Samabula,  Raiwai,  Saioni,  Jittu,

<br/>University of the South Pacific, thank you for giving me an opportunity to have taught you and I pray 
<br/>that in your learning, you will strive to become better lawyers than we are today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have graduated to this Parliament from the other side of these hallowed halls 
<br/>of the Government Buildings where I have practised as a lawyer for the past 23 years. My earlier life 
<br/>as a lawyer was spent at the DPP’s Office as a Prosecutor, then I joined the Land Transport Authority 
<br/>as its Manager Legal Services.  In 2006, I became Fiji’s third Director of the Legal Aid Commission.  
<br/>In 2009, I opened my law firm that is now known as, Vosarogo Lawyers, to this day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have traversed the contours of Fiji’s legal system in my 23 years of practice 
<br/>as a lawyer in this country, Tuvalu in 2016 defending their Prime Minister, the late honourable Apisai 
<br/>Ielemia  and  in  Vanuatu  in  2020,  in  defence  of  their  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Chalot  Salwai 
<br/>Tabimasmas  in  his  criminal  trial.  You  will  also  be  aware,  Mr.  Speaker,  of  my  defence  of  our 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister in 2018 that enabled him to stand in that Election, two days away from 
<br/>the polling day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from the Magistrates Court to the Supreme Court of this country, I know only 
<br/>too well the cost that befalls us all when rights of people are violated, when freedoms are curtailed, 
<br/>when fairness of trials is compromised by appearance of bias and when those in power feel entitled, 
<br/>as was the case in the past 16 years of national life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  cost  of  living  rises  to  unprecedented  level,  unemployment  is  rife  like  never  before, 
<br/>when moral decay seep through the social fabric of our society, when sexual offences against women, 
<br/>children  and  the  vulnerable  reminds  us  of  how  horrible  our  society  has  become  and  the  almost 
<br/></span><span>unpayable national debt, a disastrous burden on our children’s future – a partisan Government like 
<br/></span><span>the FijiFirst Government of the past can no longer be the answer to the future generation of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji First Government was offered the hand of bipartisanship in the past two sessions of 
<br/>Parliament. Mr. Speaker, what did they do with that? They behaved as if they have been gifted with 
<br/>exclusive wisdom to govern, even with impunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know, Mr. Speaker, of the relationship of the rule of law and confidence of business 
<br/>and more importantly, the confidence of genuine investment. In case, honourable Members on the 
<br/></span><span>other side had missed it – I said, “rule of law” and not “rule by law”, and I emphasise that because 
<br/></span><span>there is a difference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  is  known  for  its  countless  mischiefs  of  ruling  by  law  and  not 
<br/>subjecting themselves to the rule of law in the 16 years of its partisan Government. Since 1970, never 
<br/>has  there  been  a  history  or  period  of  lawmaking  where  the  Government  has  protected  itself  in 
<br/>provisions of ‘ouster clauses’ in laws, making their actions unappealable and unreviewable by the

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>308 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Courts, even if there is public outrage of the law and the executive actions that they took. There is 
<br/>unrestrained power of the Minister for Immigration to declare a person as a prohibited immigrant, as 
<br/>was the case of Professor Pal Aluwhalia, without the supervisory or appellate function of the Court 
<br/>to keep a check on the executive exercise of power.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is unrestrained power in the Supervisor of Elections and Electoral Commission given 
<br/>to them just as recent as August 2022 (laat year), powers to require from anyone information, even 
<br/>if  its  privileged,  confidential  or  secret  with  ridiculous  fines  of  between  $50,000  to  $500,000,  or 
<br/>imprisonment of five years, or both.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In an era, when the rest of the world is moving towards transparency, accountability and more 
<br/>importantly, taking responsibility, Mr. Speaker, the FijiFirst Government of the past moved towards 
<br/>secrecy.  They  moved  towards  hiding  their  footprints  –  footprints  which  are  now  surfacing.    The 
<br/>people  of  Fiji  have  now  begun  to  know  -  exorbitant  pays,  ridiculous  bonuses  and  extravagant 
<br/>overseas spending on taxpayer dollar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we ask ourselves, Mr Speaker, does the FijiFirst Government in the past realise that it was 
<br/>not  their  money  to  spend  as  they  wish?    It  belongs  to  hardworking  Fijians.  I  am  reminded,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, by the words of the 16</span><span>th</span><span> President of the United States of America - Abraham Lincoln when 
<br/>he said, “Nearly all man can withstand adversity but if you want to test a man’s character, give him 
<br/>power.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the effect of power badly handled by the former 
<br/>Government in the past 16 years. Their ‘non-consultative approach’, ‘we are better than you 
<br/>approach’, has truly cost them the 2022 General Election, and they would do well (my suggestion, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker) is to consider the young guns in their ranks, the charismatic honourable Bia and the 
<br/>bipartisan honourable Niudamu to be their new leaders quickly before the next sitting of 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, change takes a long time, but it happens.  The words of Dr. Martin Luther 
<br/>King Jr. rings true, and in this hallowed Chamber, even more: “The arc of the moral universe is long 
<br/>but it always turns toward justice”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  who  of  us  would  have  forgotten  the  treatment  and  termination  without 
<br/>recourse to law of the many Chief Executives Officers, Permanent Secretaries, Board members and 
<br/>many  more  since  2007,  at  the  orders  of  none  other  than  the  present  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition, the very same right honourable gentlemen, who complained of the mistreatment of senior 
<br/></span><span>civil servants without proof and without essence in this Chamber on Monday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the fear that people felt was tangible through the past 16 years has now come to 
<br/>an end.  The rule by two in the government of many has come to an end.  The business embargoes 
<br/>on those who do not support FijiFirst has now come to an end; the regional bully that Fiji had for the 
<br/>past 16 years has now come to an end; the travel restrictions on those who do not agree with their 
<br/>ideologies has now come to an end; and to the wife of the late Dr. Brij Lal of Tabia, Labasa, Madam 
<br/>Padma Lal, I say to you, welcome home! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the Fiji this Coalition Government is going to deliver - holding true 
<br/>to the lyrics that once rang proudly through our island home, the envy of the Pacific as the land of 
<br/>freedom, hope and glory for all races and all faiths.   I can only hear clearly now the lyrics of the song 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that once described us in our quest for real democracy:  “ Together hand in hand, we can prosper in 
<br/>this land - several races, one nation, one destiny, several races, one nation and free!” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will deliver that Fiji to her people, a Fiji of equity, 
<br/>not just of a common name - a nation of possibilities for our children, where everyone gets a fair shot 
<br/>and everyone gets a fair share.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what baffles me is that that FijiFirst Government of the past feels accomplished 
<br/>with  the  overseas  employment  scheme  to  Australia.    When  a  government  cannot  generate 
<br/>employment opportunities to its citizens here at home, that government has surely run out of ideas, 
<br/>they  have  run  out  of  innovation  of  job  creation,  and  thank  God,  the  people  of  Fiji  by  their  vote, 
<br/>enabled us to run them out of their government seats in December.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government looks to create employment opportunities for our young people in 
<br/>the  ICT  sector,  working  in  a  highly  conducive  and  trusted  PPP  environment  to  host  back-office 
<br/>operations, hosting for international firms and companies, providing hundreds, possibly thousands 
<br/>of jobs for our young people in the coming decade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be a real focus on agriculture, food processing that will be able to 
<br/>increase our export base on multiple products for overseas market and lessening reliance on food 
<br/>imports that we can grow here at home locally.  We know that this will require a lot of effort, but we 
<br/>must be prepared as a country to work so we can lift the burden of inflation on our people and make 
<br/>life affordable for all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen brands of Grace Roads come to Fiji and make their money.  They give everyone 
<br/>in  the  industry  a  fair  go,  and  it  is  good  for  competition.  But  why  could  not  we  have  our  own 
<br/>companies modelled, encouraged, funded, monitored and facilitated for future growth in our own 
<br/>land, in our own country and in their own backyard?  Why was there no incubation of such businesses 
<br/>in the past 16 years?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must start believing in ourselves, Mr. Speaker, and as a Government, that is precisely 
<br/>what we intend to do - identify our resource, pull in the expertise, find the funding model, bring in 
<br/>the  money,  monitor,  and  provide  facilitation  advice  to  get  projects  off  the  ground  to  become 
<br/>profitable and competitive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to respond to His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span><span>whilst opening the session of Parliament.  Sir, State leases is an important revenue earner for the 
<br/></span><span>Government.  We want to ensure that Government is positioned to collect all that is owed through 
<br/>such services as State leases. This will help us plan better and do more for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a press release earlier this week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I called on State lessees, whose rental 
<br/>arrears  on  State  Land  to  pay  up  their  rental  arrears  owed  to  Government  which  currently  sits  at 
<br/>$23.8million, almost 60.3 percent of the State lease revenue Government potentially can receive in 
<br/>2023.  The Ministry is one of Government’s top revenue earners with over $89.5million collected 
<br/>between 2017 to 2022, and we will ensure to tighten up our processes and to improve our collection 
<br/></span><span>rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President  talked  about  disaster 
<br/>preparedness.  The Mineral Resources Department, Sir, has the Seismology Section that monitors 
<br/>earthquakes and tsunamis in Fiji on a 24/7 basis.  For the Seismology Section to effectively perform 
<br/>its functions, the Fiji Seismological Network comprises six outer remote stations that send in datasets 
<br/>to our Observatory here in Nabua.

<br/>United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have left, perhaps, the best for the last.  I was born the youngest to a doctor 
<br/>father and a budding nursing student mother.  My dad was one of the top science students in his time 
<br/>at Queen Victoria School and graduated with a gold medal at Medical College.  He served his life as 
<br/>a dedicated civil servant right up to his last breath at Tukavesi Health Centre where he was asked to 
<br/>serve, after retiring as the Divisional Medical Officer Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  worked  hard,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  moved  from  hospitals  to  Health  Centres,  as  the 
<br/>Government required him, taking me to five primary schools in six years of my primary school life 
<br/>- Delana Methodist Primary School in Levuka, Naroi District School in Moala, Kama District School 
<br/>in Tukavesi, Vuya District School in Nabouwalu and Holy Family Primary School in Labasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, with a lot of caution of possibly four or five more secondary schools, he decided to 
<br/>send me to boarding school, that I had no choice about.  So, for the next seven years. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  like  10  other  honourable  Members  of  this  august  Parliament,  I  spent  at  Matavatucou,  Queen 
<br/>Victoria School in Tailevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my last year at Emalus Campus in Port Vila, I visited my dad in Tukavesi 
<br/>Health Centre during a semester and found him frail, a fraction of the image of the handsome dashing 
<br/>young doctor he was. On an evening of a small mix, I told him, “Ratu, I think you should retire now 
<br/>and  spend  your  golden  years  in  peace  and  tranquillity  in  the  village”,  which  is  only  two  villages 
<br/>away.  He said to me in the vernacular, smiling, “</span><span>Fili,</span><span> </span><span>‘qo na ka au sa vosa bubului kina, ke au na 
<br/>mate kina, au sa qarava na noqu i tav</span><span>i” (Fili, this is what I took an oath for and if it requires of me, 
<br/>I am prepared to lay my life for it). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He was a healer. He died in the same hospital he served after two hours of admitting himself 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to a bed straight after his afternoon ward rounds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I stand here knowing that without his broad shoulders, I have stood on all this time since his 
<br/>passing in 1999, I would not be visible, and I would not be where I am today.  A man of few words 
<br/>and taught by his own actions. A man who loved his backyard farm, a doctor who smoked a lot and 
<br/>absolutely loved his grog.  He remains an idol to this day. I acknowledge you here, the late Ratu Dr. 
<br/>Jone Vuatalevu Vosarogo, in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, it is his life service to heal that I hope to emulate 
<br/></span><span>in this Parliament, not as a doctor, but as a bridge of divides, a lifter for the downtrodden, a source 
<br/></span><span>of hope for the young, an instrument of peace and stability for all, and an agent of bipartisanship in

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my apologies for taking a  bit of time to get here, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you for giving me the time to make my speech this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Sitiveni Rabuka, the Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  honourable  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama,  Members  of  Parliament,  people  of  Fiji; 
<br/>thank you for giving me the floor to speak on the motion before this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I would wish to congratulate you on your appointment.  As the Speaker, you come 
<br/>to this role with long years of experience as a parliamentarian, as a minister and as a Member of 
<br/>Parliament and we look forward to your leadership as you lead us over the next four years for the 
<br/>betterment of our work in this Parliament to serve the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also congratulate the honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua on her appointment as the Deputy 
<br/>Speaker and congratulations to all for being appointed as Members of Parliament especially those 
<br/>that are coming into Parliament for the first time - I think most of you have already delivered your 
<br/>maiden speeches.  Congratulations for making it here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I congratulate the honourable Prime Minister for his appointment as Leader of Government 
<br/>and congratulations to the three Deputy Prime Ministers, the Ministers and the Assistant Ministers 
<br/>for their appointment and to all the other Members on the Government side.  My apology, I forgot 
<br/>that there is no one else apart from the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Ministers, the Ministers 
<br/>and the Assistant Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to also congratulate the honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama for getting the most 
<br/>number of votes amongst  all of us who stood for this past  election.  Getting more votes than the 
<br/>combined votes for the Prime Minister, honourable Sitiveni Rabuka, the three deputy Prime Ministers 
<br/>and the Leader of Government combined - congratulations honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I start my speech this afternoon by, first of all, thanking God for my life and for my being 
<br/>here in Parliament by the grace of God, delivering this speech serving the people of this country, and 
<br/>I thank the FijiFirst Party and our leader for allowing me to be a candidate for this election.  It is an 
<br/>honour and a privilege to join Parliament as a Member of the first ever FijiFirst Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank my wife Cagi, our five daughters and our seven living grandchildren for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support, love and encouragement.

<div><span>Thank you for those who helped me in my campaign in the Lami to Nausori and Naitasiri 
<br/>area with Va, Apo, James, Jolame, Ilimo, Filipe; my strong support team that includes my tavale -

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his speech on Monday, the honourable Leader of the Opposition told Parliament that the 
<br/>Fiji of this week is not the Fiji of early December last year; the Fiji of today is not the Fiji of two 
<br/>months ago.  Yes, a significant change has taken place.  There is now a new Government in place, 
<br/>and we all know that and we, on this side, understand that.  We know that our role for the next four 
<br/>years will be on this side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Government has done its very best in these past 50 days of rubbishing everything 
<br/>that  FijiFirst  has  done.    I  note  that  they  have  been  taking  a  lot  of  photos  of  things  that  need 
<br/>improvement. I think in the interest of fair representation, perhaps they should have taken the press 
<br/>that  they  have  taken  a  round  to  the  Navosa  Hospital,  the  new  Nakasi  Health  Centre,  the  Makoi 
<br/>Maternity Unit and the new Matewale Bridge up in Navosa that is about to be opened.  That would 
<br/>have given a well-rounded picture of what the FijiFirst Government has been able to achieve and 
<br/>provide for the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is now a much better place than prior to the time that the Bainimarama Government and 
<br/>the subsequent FijiFirst Government came into being - a much better place.  I just want to highlight 
<br/>a few of these changes - changes that we should not forget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, in terms of ethnic division, the Bainimarama and the FijiFirst Government addressed 
<br/>the issue that has always been Fiji’s major stumbling block.  Our racial politics that has always led 
<br/>to political strife and economic despair for our people, affecting their livelihoods for years on end 
<br/>and decades in some cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We live in a country where everyone feels they are victims - </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> feel that they are victims, 
<br/>Indo-Fijian brothers and sisters feel they are victims and all such groups have grounds for feeling 
<br/>that  way.    There  is  history  behind  it,  things  that  have  happened.    These  feelings  are  built  in  our 
<br/>communities,  our  homes,  around  our  churches  and  temples.    It  permeates  our  society.    These 
<br/>sentiments, however, are very easily fanned into flames that lead to people saying things that, in turn, 
<br/>lead to more strife very, very easily.  This is the big challenge that any Government in Fiji will always 
<br/></span><span>have, to be able to address this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ethnicization has been our downfall, again and again and again.  When we build our politics 
<br/>on rhetoric ethnic issues, we bring to the fore these feelings that lead to disaster.  During the height 
<br/>to the political campaign, it was disgusting and it still is.  We, on this side, worked to build a common 
<br/>identity that brings together everyone in this country as a Fijian. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And I will say today for the people of Fiji that this was a very huge, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enormous and gigantic first step - it was a huge step.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People have talked about it over the decades, different leaders have stood up in this Parliament 
<br/>and talked about it.  No one had the gall to be able to do it. The Bainimarama-led Government, as 
<br/>espoused in the 2013 Constitution, came and gave us a common national identity - to address that 
<br/>very issue of ethnic divide that exists in this country.

<div><span>We  brought  about  the  one  person,  one  vote  of  equal  value  -  a  godly  concept  and  a  super 
<br/>phenomenal  change  for  this  country,  never  ever  achieved  before.    People  have  stood  in  this 
<br/>Parliament, talked and dreamt of that day that, that would happen.  They have dreamt for that day.   
<br/>The FijiFirst Government and its leader who is not here with us, made it happen - one man, one vote, 
<br/>equal vote, equal value. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This always seem like a giant mountain to climb but the Bainimarama-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>led Government did that in 2013, it finally happened.

<div><span>We also turned Fiji into one constituency to drive home the importance of unity because one 
<br/>of the things that happens in our country, we always start with racial divide, then it breaks down into 
<br/>provincial divide, and then it breaks up into all sorts of divide.  We need unity, we need to build that 
<br/>unity into the way we conduct our elections and into the way we call ourselves.  When we do that, 
<br/>we build a stronger united country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  thing  that  I  think  that  this  side  of  Parliament  has  done  is  the 
<br/>economic development of this country.  If you look at the way the GDP growth has taken place from 
<br/>1970 to the year 2006, the speed at which it grew, and you compare that from 2007 to maybe up to 
<br/>2020 or 2021, it has increased very rapidly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has  been a lot of  changes that have been taking  place in  terms  of the nine years of 
<br/>consecutive growth.  I know that honourable Professor Prasad always tries to belittle that, but it is 
<br/>not an easy thing to have nine years of consecutive growth.  In this country, we have always had ups 
<br/>and downs.  When you  have a consecutive economic growth,  it shows that  fundamentals  in  your 
<br/>economy have been working well and are being managed well through strong policies and through 
<br/>systems and processes that make it work because the world is a turbulent world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, right now, the world is going to global recession in some parts of the world, over the 
<br/>next part of this year.  But through the efforts of this FijiFirst Government, we have been able to do 
<br/>that - nine years of consecutive growth had been a great achievement in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third issue that I would like to talk about is iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>security and development.  We have 
<br/>strengthened considerably the security of every iTaukei.  We made sure that their land really became 
<br/>inalienable, that no one would ever be able to alienate any piece of iTaukei land ever again - that was 
<br/></span><span>done under our watch.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  That  was  done  by  a  government  that  was  said  to  be  never  doing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anything for the iTaukei</span><span>.</span><span>  Done in our watch!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  reduced  the  iTLTB  poundage,  forever  forcing  iTLTB  to  become  more  efficient.    We 
<br/>commenced the payment of the 80 percent royalty for mineral resources to landowners, bringing in 
<br/></span><span>millions of dollars into their pockets that they could use for development and look after their people.   
<br/></span><span>By the way, when this was introduced in Parliament, I seem to recall that honourable Members of 
<br/>the Opposition at that time, some of whom are still sitting in this Parliament, some are still in the old 
<br/>Party, others migrated to the other party, they actually opposed this motion of giving royalties to 
<br/>landowners.  Chew on that!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We created the landbank as a way of assisting landowners to get some land that they were not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>using and get some revenue out of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Tell them!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  They  opposed  it!    I  find  that  unfathomable.    How  can  you  oppose 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something like that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  developed  land  development  packages  for  the  iTaukei  landowners,  assisting  them  to 
<br/>develop their own land so that they could get the kind of benefits that previously only third party 
<br/>developers could get.  On the outskirts of Sigatoka, you go up to Yadua, with the Grace Road Bowser 
<br/>there, you see that piece of land - Government funded that.  We wanted to overturn that thinking that 
<br/>the iTaukei are asset rich but cash poor.  We are doing it all over, it is growing and growing.  That 
<br/>was done by this particular FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Changes were made to the Freehold Land Buy Back Scheme, not started by this Government, 
<br/>started  by  others  to  make  it  easier  for  repayments  to  be  done.    Obstacles  were  removed  and  the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands even went to the extent of subdividing the land, renting it out, collecting the rentals  
<br/>and once the amount that the landowner owed had been collected in rentals, then giving the land to 
<br/>the landowner. That is how far we went. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- How many in the Central Division? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is how far we went. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- None. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Listen and learn!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Fourth is the socio-economic rights in the Constitution.  This FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  has  put  into  the  Constitution  that  puts  all  of  us  here  into  this  Parliament  the  socio-
<br/>economic rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- By doing that, we have made it a requirement that for any government 
<br/>to  deliver,  you  are  now  required  to  deliver  on  socio-economic  rights  because  we  put  it  into  the 
<br/></span><span>Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure  development,  vast  new  developments  were  made  in  infrastructure  -  water, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>roads, jetties and bridges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Waila. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Waila is not us, private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More coming.  The four-lane highways, water going under the sea to get to the islands of 
<br/>Moturiki, water going under the sea to get to Galoa in Bua and Malake in Ra.  Massive improvement 
<br/>in roading infrastructure to cater for the massive explosion of the number of vehicles on Fiji roads, 
<br/>the sizes of vehicles have been increasing and the huge expansion in the road network.  I always 
<br/>appreciate the former Prime Minister and current Leader of the Opposition in telling us how he got

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a Naitasiri boy, the former Minister - Timoci Natuva, to see that under his Government that the road 
<br/>up to Naitasiri was tarsealed and a lot of that is taking place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electrification at a greater level with the removal of impediments for rural dwellers, such as 
<br/>the 10 percent deposit that used to be there.  Now, we have solar home systems, more than 13,000 
<br/>all across the country.  Power came from Monasavu, it lit up Suva, all these corridors but the villages 
<br/>around there were dark and all that area up in Naitasiri were all dark.  This FijiFirst Government 
<br/>made a change to that.  Today, you go up the road in Namosi, you will see electricity poles.  As you 
<br/>leave Nakorosule going up, the road is there, electricity is there – this Government did that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last year, I was driving around Nadarivatu and as I was driving around, I see all the villages  
<br/>lit up with electricity. We have been moving direct government operations out of government and 
<br/>into the realm of statutory bodies to reduce the size of government, to keep the regulatory function 
<br/>and the policy functions in government and move the operational arm out hitherto the development 
<br/>of Water Authority of Fiji, Fiji Roads Authority, Energy Fiji Limited, et cetera. There is still a lot to 
<br/>be done on this modality, I think this Government is looking to change it a bit but that is the proven 
<br/>modality all around the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of free education, another huge mountain.  I will never forget the day sitting in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bainimarama Cabinet… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It all started before you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- … when the late honourable Filipe Bole who was the Minister then 
<br/>and the day that it was announced, he was very emotional because for a long time, this has been one 
<br/>thing that has held people back.  People who born with on their shoulders, who had lots of money, 
<br/>always had their education but others sometimes their education was blocked because they did not 
<br/>have enough money to fund out, so the Government stepped in.  Tuition, bus fares, textbooks, ECE, 
<br/>the  higher  education  system,  the  national  qualification  framework,  the  establishment  of  our  Fiji 
<br/>National University continuing to provide assistance for everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot has been achieved, significant steps have been made to move towards the evermoving 
<br/>target of a better Fiji.  Is it perfect?  No, it is not.  It is not perfect because this is always a journey.  
<br/>This is part of the legacy that now rests in the hands of the current Government.  It is for you to build 
<br/>upon that, take note of  what  was done well and to  continue to  improve  it -  continue the  work to 
<br/>improve areas that need improvements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I ponder on that legacy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of things come to my mind to watch 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out for: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Democracy and the rule of law.  In His Address, His Excellency the President had referred to 
<br/>the importance of democracy. It pains me, therefore, to reflect back on what transpired at the 
<br/>end stages of the Election process.  The current Prime Minister wrote to the President about 
<br/>his concern about vote counting glitch and copied this letter to the Military and the Police to 
<br/>step in and do something about what he thought was going wrong with the counting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was nothing wrong.  I do not know what he was asking His Excellency 
<br/>to do, to stop the counting, or was he trying to overturn the normal Election procedures? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Votes in this country have always been counted manually. This past Election was counted 
<br/>manually, the one before that, before that, before that all counted manually, always manually.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>317 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The shocking thing for me, Sir, was when the President of the Methodist Church of which I 
<br/>am  a  member,  did  the  same  thing  without  any  evidence,  without  knowing  that  anything 
<br/>untoward had happened, did the same thing totally untoward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Three Elections, three glitches - that is why.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The FijiFirst and its leader stood by those results.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We stood by those results. We did not try to change those results. So, when push comes to 
<br/>shove, who stood by to make sure that the manner in which democratic governments are appointed 
<br/>was preserved? Who was it? At the final turn, who was it? It was the Leader of the Opposition, the 
<br/>leader  of  FijiFirst.  It  was  him  who  stood  by  that  principle  of  adhering  to  the  way  in  which 
<br/>governments change. He did not try to tamper with that particular process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My request to the Government is this, when push comes to shove, stay the high road, stay the 
<br/>course. You have decided to bring back the Great Council of Chiefs which is your prerogative, which 
<br/>is your right.  You interpret this as a way of bringing back iTaukei issues, even though as I have 
<br/>pointed out that under the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government we did a  lot of things than of all 
<br/>of those other governments that said that they were pro-iTaukei did not do. They did not make it, 
<br/>such that land could not be alienated - we did that. We did all of those things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have said that you are going to bring it back to raise the iTaukei issues.  As I pointed out, 
<br/>under the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government, so much was done to better the lot of us (iTaukei 
<br/>and indigenous people).  There is always great glory in the GCC, but there also have been episodes 
<br/>of shame.  There were actions that was taken in 1987 maybe by individual members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is my request to the Government, the plans that you make for what you see as a good 
<br/>course can be highjacked by those who use such institutions for their own agenda. You have your 
<br/>own intent to your plan, they can be hijacked - that has happened in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my concern about some of the issues that I have raised earlier on in my speech. If you 
<br/>are going to bring back the GCC, please, remove all party politics from it because that is not what 
<br/>happened in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is part of the review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Free it from party politics. Do not take us down that route again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We are moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Make sure that is serves its primary purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sure, no problem! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My fellow Members of Parliament, we have made it here at last. All 
<br/></span><span>of us have come from different backgrounds. People have spoken about their different backgrounds.  
<br/></span><span>For me, Jone Usamate, I am the son of a housegirl, a single mother, who used to be a housegirl in 
<br/>Imthurn.  So, I think one of the advantages of Imthurn because I was with all these European people 
<br/>around me, at least, it gave me slightly good English so that helped me a lot.  So, even when things 
<br/>go wrong, it helped me out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been brought up there. My mother was actually the housegirl for Hugh S. Robinson –

<div><span>the gentleman who set up Fiji National Provident Fund many, many years ago.  I have lived there, I 
<br/>visited schools, eventually my mother got married and I was brought up by my stepfather and her in 
<br/>the village of Wakanisila.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tabuya, we are sitting opposite each other, we are both from Wakanisila.  I have 
<br/>been brough up in Kinoya, Cunningham, Nakasi, in the church going to various schools, working my 
<br/>way  through  initially  with  a  degree  in  economics  and  administration  and  later  on  a  masters  in 
<br/>management.  I worked slightly at the Reserve Bank of Fiji on a part-time basis while a student at 
<br/>USP.  I taught in Lomary Secondary.  I started work at the Fiji National Training Council and worked 
<br/>my way up for 10 years to become the Director General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For 10 years, I served as the Director General, I worked a bit at the Fiji National University 
<br/>for  two  years  as  Director  for  Quality  Assurance  in  TVET  and  from  2012,  I  have  been  here  as  a 
<br/>Minister, initially for the Bainimarama Government and then for the FijiFirst Government for two 
<br/>terms.  Finally, I am still here as a Member of Parliament on the Opposition side, but still with the 
<br/>critical role of plying myself for the benefit of the people in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning as my daughter was driving me here, I was thinking of the importance of our 
<br/>role, the importance of your role and the roles of all us on this side.  It really is a great honour and a 
<br/>privilege for all of us  to be in Parliament.  It  is not  just a privilege, it is an honour to  be here as 
<br/>legislators - to make rules and laws and to set a direction for our country to build a better Fiji.  It is a 
<br/>role we must not take lightly, and we must never lose sight of that – that we serve all, we serve all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like me, a lot of people are going to come to you and say we come from the same province, 
<br/>please, help me out.  I voted for you, I voted for your party.  Sometimes this can be very difficult or 
<br/>“please, my son is here, give him a job”.  It is important for us, at all times, all of us to remember 
<br/>that we serve all equally.  We give favours to none.  We treat everyone equally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  as  the  President  has  referred  to  us  on  this  side  of  Parliament  as  the  loyal 
<br/>Opposition.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are the loyal opposition, we will be the loyal opposition.  We 
<br/>will be loyal to this country and not play politics just for its sake.  We will keep the Government 
<br/>accountable in the best interests of the people of this country.

<br/></span><span>Assistant  Ministers,  colleague  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  fellow  Fijians,  ladies  and

<br/>we, again, come together in this august Parliament for yet another term in a new year and a new 
<br/>season.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to respond to His Excellency the 
<br/>President’s most gracious Address, delivered in this august Parliament on Friday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/>to mark the official opening of the 2023-2024 Session of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I first offer my congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on your recent appointment to 
<br/>the  esteemed  role  as  Speaker  of  this  august  Parliament.    Your  long  years  of  service,  experience, 
<br/>chiefly wisdom and sense of humour will, undoubtedly, be of immense value in the discharge of your 
<br/>duties in this privileged Chamber.  I also convey the same to the Deputy Chairperson, the honourable

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to begin by acknowledging God the most highest for the good gifts 
<br/>and blessings that he has showered over my life, my family and our beloved nation, not only recently 
<br/>but over the so many past years.  Our past journey together as a country of one people, one nation 
<br/>and with a common purpose and destiny has not been easy, but together we survived.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the future is uncertain and full of challenges and opportunities, the 
<br/>key learnings from the past can help us manoeuvre safely through the uncharted waters that the future 
<br/>presents  and  arrive  safely  together  at  what  I  prefer  to  call  “our  preferred  destination”,  and  that 
<br/>preferred destination is a better Fiji for all Fijians - a Fiji where we respect, appreciate and celebrate 
<br/>the diversity and aspirations of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am here, again, today because of the grace and favour of God and I honour his 
<br/>calling on my life to continue serving the people of this country as a Member of Parliament of the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji, to Him be all the Glory.  This is my third consecutive term as a Member of the Fijian 
<br/>Parliament and  I am  most  grateful  to  be given this  opportunity  to, again, serve the people of our 
<br/>beloved nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am humbled to be given this noble privilege and wish to thank all Fijians who put their trust 
<br/>in me and voted me in as part of the FijiFirst Party under the leadership of its leader, honourable 
<br/>Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama.  I stand here proudly on behalf of all our committed and loyal voters 
<br/>and supporters both, locally and abroad, knowing the fact that FijiFirst is still the largest single Party 
<br/>in this Parliament on our own.  I, therefore, wish to acknowledge those who voted us in and I give 
<br/>them and every other Fijian our utmost assurance that we will continue to serve them and their interest 
<br/>to the best of our ability and ensure that their voices are heard through our representation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need to acknowledge all those who supported me in the 2022 Election 
<br/>campaign.  From the Party leadership and most particularly, for the campaign teams on the ground.  
<br/>I wish to thank particularly the Party Leader and the Party General Secretary for their able leadership, 
<br/>guidance and support. I also acknowledge all the party candidates who fought the elections with us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To all our candidates who fought the elections.  It is unfortunate that we cannot all be in this 
<br/>Parliament together, but we were such a great team and we who are fortunate to be here, are able to 
<br/>do so not on our own but through our collective effort and teamwork.  I salute you all and say, ‘thank 
<br/>you again most sincerely’.  I convey my best wishes to you in your future endeavours and to your 
<br/>families and loved ones too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to  acknowledge  and  covey  my  heartfelt  gratitude  to  my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>campaign teams in Tailevu and, of course, Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>The same goes to the Northern Teams in Labasa and Savusavu - Sai Vuki, Mataiasi Taka, Mataiasi 
<br/></span><span>Uluinakubou and Team Savusavu comprising of Isei Nainoca, Mika, Maikeli Vosayaco, Bryce and 
<br/></span><span>of my good friend from Rabi, Mr. Takosi - to you all, no words can fully express my appreciation 
<br/>and  gratitude  for  such  a  great  effort  and  unwavering  support  to  me  and  FijiFirst  in  the  recent 
<br/>Elections.

<br/>aunties and all the relatives, so I am the youngest of six siblings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  attended  Vunibokoi  District  School  in  Verata,  as  already  alluded  to  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Rural Development, perhaps the best school in Fiji because we were in the same class 
<br/>from that school, before attending Ratu Kadavulevu School for my secondary education.  I started 
<br/>work with the Native Land Development Corporation before I joined the Army in 1987 and served 
<br/>for about 21 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  service in  Government  includes being  Commissioner Northern from 
<br/>2007 to 2011 and then posted to Suva as the Permanent Secretary for Rural Development for a year.  
<br/>From 2011 to 2012 and in late December, 2012, I was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries 
<br/>and  Forestry.    But  when  </span><span>TC  Evans  </span><span>hit  Fiji  that  same  year,  I  was  given  the  extra  portfolio  as  the 
<br/>Minister for Rural Development and Disaster Management.  Again, after the 2014 General Election, 
<br/>and  from  the  period  2014  to  2018,  I  was  the  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management and Meteorological Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly, I also wish to perhaps, highlight something that I consider a 
<br/>highlight of my service as well.  I was appointed the Global Climate Champion and served in that 
<br/>capacity for two years from 2016 to 2018.  Climate change is perhaps, the biggest existing time shield 
<br/>threat that we are facing and I was honoured to serve in that capacity after the meeting in Marrakesh, 
<br/>Morocco,  in  2016.    I  have  attended  four  COPs  during  that  period  while  serving  as  the  Climate 
<br/>Champion.  Initially in 2015, COP 21, COP 22 in Marrakesh and COP 23 in Bonn Germany where 
<br/>Fiji was the President and in Katowice, Poland for COP 24.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have served in various Ministries, as I have highlighted, and I can assure 
<br/></span><span>you that together with the loyal and dedicated staff of those respective Ministries, we were able to 
<br/></span><span>make some positive developments and progress in certain areas where Government had placed high 
<br/>priorities as a matter of policy, as well as those arising out of the changing circumstances.  However, 
<br/>not all can be progressed and achieved at once, and it is my hope that the current leadership, under 
<br/>the new Government, can continue, improve and complete some of the unfinished works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  efforts  of  the  dedicated,  professional  and  hardworking  staff  of 
<br/>those respective Ministries, ably led by the Permanent Secretaries and the  Senior Management.  I 
<br/>salute them all for their professionalism, sound advice, unwavering commitment and dedication to 
<br/></span><span>duty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  wish  to  focus  my  contribution  on  His  Excellency  the  President’s 
<br/>Address.    To  begin  with,  His  Excellency  the  President  stated  that  he  was  grateful  to  note  that 
<br/>following  the  conduct  of  the  2022  General  Elections,  the  change  in  Government  has  taken  place 
<br/>peacefully and swiftly, and the new administration has commenced its work with the mandate of the 
<br/>people.  It must be noted that this peaceful and swift transition clearly demonstrated that we, as a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>321 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Party, accept and respect the outcome of the 2022 General Elections based on the following - we won 
<br/>the election, no doubt, whatsoever but unfortunately, that we could not form government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, you lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  FijiFirst is still the largest single political party in this Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and for that, we remain proud. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  We  have  contributed  significantly  to  the  development  of  our 
<br/>country  during  our  term  in  government;  and  we  have  confidence  in  the  democratic  process  and 
<br/>system of governance as enshrined in the 2013 Constitution.  It is in that spirit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>we as a party with all sincerity, faith and goodwill fully embrace the change that took place though 
<br/>to our favour. Not only that but because of national interest, respect the rule of law and embracing 
<br/>the foundation for a sustainable democracy and with Fiji at heart. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our satisfaction comes from knowing that despite the results, democracy is 
<br/>well and truly alive in our country that is the democracy handed over to the Coalition Government.  
<br/>On the other hand, it is common knowledge that the post-election Coalition Government was formed 
<br/>not  as  a  direct  result  of  its  outcome,  but  through  the  end  swing  negotiations  and  the  single  vote 
<br/>majority casted in the SODELPA management board meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- SODELPA did not want you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What worries me is this, it was during those negotiations that I had 
<br/>a glimpse of the culture we are to expect in the government that would be sworn in a few days later.  
<br/>First, the offer was made to the member or maybe members of the management board before the 
<br/>eventual voting took place and, again, immediately after the swearing in took place, it was to my 
<br/>astonishment that every single member of the Government is a Minister or Assistant Minister, apart 
<br/>from the three Deputy Prime Ministers.   Allow me to simply explain my concerns, Mr. Speaker, Sir.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Too much mess going on there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It would appear that buying loyalty or bribing one to obtain loyalty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is going to be the new norm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- My observation is that the Coalition Government is hanging on a 
<br/>very fine thread and the honourable Prime Minister, in order to maintain it must keep pleasing its 
<br/>Members at any cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  an  unstable  Coalition,  given  that  the  SODELPA  General  Secretary  had  publicly 
<br/></span><span>announced  that  the  SODELPA  Management  Board  had  not  been  consulted  on  many  Coalition 
<br/>appointments.  I have just seen that the Fijian Teachers Association as SODELPA’s landlord has 
<br/>locked them out due to outstanding rent arrears.  This could perhaps cause constitutional crisis, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But government has been formed and I, therefore, wish to congratulate the Coalition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>322 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government for taking over the helm of leadership and governance for the country under the Prime 
<br/>Minister, honourable Rabuka, and as stated by His Excellency, “you are now the government and 
<br/>have the responsibility of leading our nation for the next four years”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to  quickly highlight how the new administration has  commenced its  work with  the 
<br/>mandate of the people as stated by His Excellency.  As I did state yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 
<br/>interesting to note the sudden change in the perception and words of some of the former Opposition 
<br/>Members now appointed Ministers, as they come to realise the reality of running a government  - 
<br/>learning is a never-ending process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  would  not  realise  how  irresponsible  or  probably  sometimes 
<br/>dishonourable  they  were  in  the  past  as  Opposition  Members,  distorting  the  truth,  spreading  false 
<br/>information,  questioning  the  authenticity  of  reports,  devising  conspiracy  theories,  discrediting 
<br/>Government incentives and programmes, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the same professional, hardworking and committed staff who were with us when we 
<br/>were in Government are still the same ones, perhaps a few changes because changes are happening 
<br/>everyday and we hope that they are constitutional, they are still with them now.  There are a lot of 
<br/></span><span>matanigasau</span><span> going on, but I would recommend to some of these honourable Ministers, it would be 
<br/>good  if  they  also  present  the  </span><span>matanigasau</span><span>  to  some  of  these  officials  to  improve  their  working 
<br/>relationship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More worrying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the promises they made during the Election campaign.  
<br/>People’s Alliance Party made its own promises, NFP does the same and so as SODELPA. Whose 
<br/>promise will take precedence over the others? I will not go into the promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  then  stated,  and  I  quote:  “I  must  acknowledge  the 
<br/>contribution and achievements of the previous government in steering the nation in the past 16 years.”  
<br/>I sincerely thank His Excellency for doing so because we need to give credit where it is due.  I wish 
<br/>to put it this way, Sir, the Coalition Government  is inheriting a far better Fiji from where it was, 
<br/>whether eight or 16 years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are handing over to you, not a perfect but a better Fiji than the one we inherited.  That is 
<br/>our legacy which we are, indeed, proud of and the expectation is for the new Government to continue 
<br/>and make it even better.  What qualifies me to say a better Fiji? I will just limit it to three key issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2013 Constitution - the 2013 Constitution was a product out of the consultation process for 
<br/></span><span>the People’s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress undertaken during the period from January to 
<br/>December 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No consultations.

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>323 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The overarching objective of the People’s Charter is to build Fiji… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Not the People’s Charter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … into a non-racial, culturally vibrant and united, well-governed 
<br/>and truly democratic nation - a nation that seeks progress and prosperity through merit-based equality 
<br/>of opportunity and peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER- Honourable Members, no running commentary, please.  Let us listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The honourable Tikoduadua is making a lot of noises. I remember 
<br/>during the Charter consultation process, he came as Permanent Secretary for the Prime Minister’s 
<br/>Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is true, honourable Seruiratu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The 2013 Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises and protects 
<br/>the indigenous people of this country, iTaukei and Rotumans.  It  recognises their uniqueness  and 
<br/>protect  their land and the ownership of their land. It  absolutely stops the permanent  alienation  of 
<br/>indigenous  land,  unlike  the  1990  and  1997  Constitutions  which  allowed  for  iTaukei  land  to  be 
<br/>converted to freehold under the SVT and SDL Governments respectively.  Sir, to me, I prefer to label 
<br/>the 2013 Constitution the firm base that the honourable Naivalurua referred to in his earlier speech - 
<br/>institutions, systems and processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the public sector has established service standards, effective work systems, 
<br/>effective  leadership,  transparency,  accountability  and  high  productivity.  This  is  of  particular 
<br/>importance  too  when  you  want  to  create  an  enabling  environment  where  the  State  supports  the 
<br/>economic activity. We will come to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  refer  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  inclusive  economic  institutions  that  allow  and 
<br/>encourage participation by the great mass of people in the economic activities that make best use of 
<br/>their talents and skills and that enables individuals to make the choices they wish.  To be inclusive, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, economic institutions must feature, secure private property and unbiased system of law and a 
<br/></span><span>provision of public services that provides a level playing field in which people can exchange and 
<br/>contract and it also must permit the entry of new businesses and allow people to choose their careers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to emphasise here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that inclusive economic institutions require secure 
<br/>property rights so that those with such rights will be willing to invest and increase productivity and 
<br/>at  the  same  time  economic  opportunities  is  not  just  for  the  elite,  but  for  a  broad  cross  section  of 
<br/>society.  We are listening to all your presentations, and this is why we are recommending to ensure 
<br/>that we have institutions, systems and processes in place.  I talked about creating the environment 
<br/></span><span>yesterday and this will be critical for the Government in the next four years if most of that dreams 
<br/></span><span>and intentions are to be realised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To function well, society also needs other public services; roads and transport, networks so 
<br/>that goods can be transported, public infrastructure so that economic activity can flourish and some 
<br/>type of basic regulation to prevent fraud and maleficence.  This is what we are leaving behind and 
<br/>this is what we are conveying to the Government.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>324 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, a strong economy - it is always good to talk money as you talk strategy.  You know it 
<br/>well.  While the Coalition Government is contemplating on growing and strengthening the economy, 
<br/>I  wish  to  remind  them  on  the  facts  of  the  Fijian  economy  under  the  FijiFirst  Government.    Fiji 
<br/>recorded its strongest periods of post-Independence economic growth in the decade leading up to the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  The  Fijian  economy  registered  its  nine  years  of  consecutive 
<br/>economic growth from  2010 to  2018, underpinned by rising  productivity, increased public sector 
<br/>investment  and  infrastructure  development,  growing  private  sector  activity  supported  by  high 
<br/>business  confidence  and  overall  political  and  economic  stability  provided  under  the  decisive 
<br/>leadership of the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was one of the longest periods of sustained economic growth in Fiji 
<br/>which led to major improvements in job creations, infrastructure development, improved access to 
<br/>better  public  services,  more  income  generating  opportunities,  increased  asset  and  wealth 
<br/>accumulation by Fijians and significant advancement in the overall living standards.  Majority of the 
<br/>Fijian population became better off, compared to years ago.  During this period, our GDP doubled 
<br/>from $6 billion to almost $12 billion at the end of 2019.  Sir, GDP per capita or income per person 
<br/>on average increase from around $6,600 to over $13,000 per person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our foreign reserves increased to over $3.6 billion, equivalent to 8.3 months 
<br/>of imports, compared to just $500 million in 2006 which was equivalent to 1.9 months of import.  
<br/>This is the highest level of reserves in our history and reflects the strong balance of payment position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquidity levels in the financial sector increased to over $2.5 billion.  Why am I saying this? 
<br/>Because that will be the challenge for the new Government.  At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>are not denying the fact that following this spirit of economic boom, Fiji recently has had three years 
<br/>of consecutive economic decline induced by the devastating COVID-19 pandemic and, of course, 
<br/>other global activities… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Except you had negative growth in 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … but the FijiFirst Government stood firm to keep the economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>afloat during the pandemic and laid the foundation for a fast and strong economic rebound.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to quickly make a few observations and remarks on the Coalition 
<br/>Government’s  policies  and  intentions  as  outlined  by  His  Excellency  the  President  in  his  opening 
<br/>Address.  My colleagues from this side of Parliament who had spoken earlier have covered most of 
<br/>the issues of significance and in the interest of time, I need not make repetitions.  Let me say this, 
<br/>Sir, there is a ray of hope in the policies and intentions of the Coalition Government.  As outlined by 
<br/>His  Excellency,  I  have  some  deep  concerns  about  their  ability  to  deliver  them,  not  that  I  am  a 
<br/>pessimist, Sir, but I say this out of my own observation and some analysis based on the statement 
<br/>itself.  Allow me to clarify that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of the same breath where their policy intentions are outlined, cunningly concealed within 
<br/>is the contingency plan. The excuse that they will use when promises cannot be fulfilled, when they 
<br/>cannot deliver and I will read it out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  debt  level  severely  limits  the  Coalition  Government’s  capacity  to  borrow 
<br/>further for critical capital expenditure.  On infrastructure such as roads, ports, hospitals, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>325 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>water and sewerage, our national  debt  also  restricts  the Government’s  ability to  direct 
<br/>spending into areas such as education, health and social welfare payments.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have a plan, but they also have in place a contingency plan which I 
<br/>also term it will be the excuse for them to use when they cannot deliver.  To the people of Fiji, we in 
<br/>the Opposition hope that you have not been deceived or to use some of their terms, some of the other 
<br/>honourable Members are hoodwinked vote buying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The different parties in the Coalition Government … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Vote buying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … before the elections were well informed of Government’s debt 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>level but yet, continue to promise almost everything to you in order to gain your votes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We were heavily criticised and ridiculed because of the debt level, 
<br/>yet they boldly made those promises. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was one of their trump cards in 
<br/>their campaign rallies. Now, when they are in Government, they realised how irresponsible they were 
<br/>in making those promises but to make them look good, they are passing the blame to the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- False promises! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- To the Coalition Government, it is simple.  To borrow more and 
<br/>be able to do more, just grow the economy.  I will say it again, to borrow more and be able to do 
<br/>more,  just  grow  the  economy,  like  we  did.      Stop  making  excuses  already.    It  portrays  a  bad 
<br/>impression on you.  I repeat, it portrays a bad impression on you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Have  faith  in  your  own  ability,  please.    It  seems  that  you  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already defeated, even before the battle begins. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.SN. KAMIKAMICA.- You are running away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Look at yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Everyone is running away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- You  are all Ministers, Assistant  Ministers, three  Deputy  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministers and, of course, with an experienced leader, the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Three resigned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, we are still 26. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is for you, Deputy Prime Minister. Enough of the heat of the

<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Through  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  he  is  a  warrior  from 
<br/>Naivitoni, I want to test him.  I say to you, again, enough of the heat of the moment rebuttals. Please, 
<br/>honourable Kamikamica get real, toughen up and get on with the job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  He  is  starting  to  run  away.  Very  soon  there  will  not  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anyone there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I will conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I wish to refer to what I 
<br/>have stated from the very beginning of my statement, that we are now into a new season. The baton 
<br/>has been passed on to the Coalition Government. The transition has been smooth and swift because 
<br/>it is our firm belief that we have laid the foundation for a better tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the new season will bring is the lingering question that we 
<br/>all have as citizens of this beloved country.  The season brings mixed feelings, hope or despair, good 
<br/>or bad, lack, sufficiency or abundance, challenges, obstacles or opportunities for better or for the 
<br/>worse.  This is the reality and is inevitable, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we on this side of Parliament have made our responses and have genuinely stated our 
<br/>views, observations and some analysis on the itinerary of Government in the coming years.  We are 
<br/>constructively criticising the intentions of Government in the best interest of our nation, and we and 
<br/>the people that we are called to serve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  mindful  of  the  state  of  the  economy,  the  external  threats  and 
<br/>challenges, our internal security situation, the geopolitics and other pressing issues.  If it so pleases 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and his Cabinet, we offer our assistance, if and where needed, given 
<br/>our knowledge and past experience. But, at the same time we will hold you accountable and never 
<br/>deviate from our core values and principles which underpins our mission and vision in the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, therefore, plead on behalf of all Fijians to the honourable Prime Minister, through you, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, and his Coalition Government, serve proudly and lead wisely. We will all finish one 
<br/></span><span>day, but how will we be remembered?  What is the legacy that we will leave behind?  I hope and 
<br/>pray that we will all serve with humility, commitment, loyalty and patriotism.  Let us all build a better 
<br/>Fiji together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude with these words from Colossian 3:12-14, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“God loves you and has chosen you as His own special people.  So be gentle, kind, 
<br/>humble, meek and patient.  Put up with each other, and forgive anyone who does you 
<br/></span><span>wrong, just as Christ has forgiven you.  Love is more important than anything else.  It 
<br/></span><span>is what ties everything completely together.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to me personally, this is the foundation of our journey forward.  I thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for your indulgence, may God bless our beloved Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise as the mover of this motion to give my Right 
<br/>of  Reply  and  I  thank  all  honourable  Members  who  have  contributed  to  the  debate  to  thank  His 
<br/>Excellency the President for his most gracious Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank some honourable Members who had played a part in my own role as a 
<br/>citizen, as  a man of the country.  I thank you, Sir, for being a gracious paramount chief for your 
<br/>people of Cakaudrove and I thank you that you have been elected to continue to serve Fiji, as well as 
<br/>Cakaudrove in accepting the nomination and being elected to be Speaker of this august Chamber.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members who had served with me in the Military 
<br/>Forces of our country.  I thank the honourable Naivalurua who is here with us - the third honourable 
<br/>Member for Naitasiri as he admitted the other day.  He was a very loyal young Officer and he missed 
<br/>out  on  a  great  military  award  for  bravery  because  of  the  quota  system  in  the  realm  -  the  British 
<br/>Empire, British Commonwealth and the realm at that time.  He served loyally with me in Lebanon, 
<br/>and I had to ask him to go on a few dangerous Missions and, fortunately, he came back alive and he 
<br/>is here with us, but I thank him for those years of service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Smiling now, I thank the honourable Member who just joined Parliament with FijiFirst, the 
<br/>honourable Tuinaceva.  Thank you very much for the bus you provided for us, for my Party and for 
<br/>us when you were working with my brother, Kamlesh.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- I hope you have paid, Sir! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- We paid and he did not give us a discount and I am glad he did not 
<br/>because we would have had to  say how we managed to  pay such a higher rate for the buses that 
<br/>Vishnu Holdings provided for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Naupoto who is also smiling very brightly across the 
<br/>floor of this august Parliament.  I remind him that honourable Marape is expecting him on Wednesday 
<br/>in Denarau to play golf with him for the </span><span>Ratu Mara Somare Cup</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank my own nephew, the honourable Bulitavu, who kept me tap dancing 
<br/>while I was out in the wilderness, casting arrows and shooting me as I was trying to dance my way 
<br/>back into this august Parliament.  Welcome back </span><span>na gone</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this side of Parliament, I thank my honourable colleagues who came 
<br/>along when I was cast adrift by three of them but now they have come on board with me and we hope 
<br/>that we can satisfy the expectations, as very lucidly pointed out by honourable Seruiratu, challenging  
<br/>us to build on what they have built in the last eight years of their leadership as FijiFirst Government 
<br/>of Fiji.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>328 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate our collective gratitude to His Excellency the President for his 
<br/>most gracious address in opening this historic session of Parliament.  His reminder and admonition 
<br/>to  the  Parliament  and  the  nation,  to  get  us  to  unite.    Now,  I  remember  I  have  not  thanked  the 
<br/>honourable Bala, who hosted me many times in Ba and I thank him very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- You betrayed yourself, you were smiling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Bala and I had to dedicate the millennium globe in Ba when he 
<br/>was Mayor. And I asked him the other day when we are going to go out and campaign to run for the 
<br/>Municipal Election.  He said to me, “Do not tell my boss.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has been a very eventful week. Captain, I will 
<br/>come to  you. I thank you most sincerely for the way you have conducted the business of Parliament.  
<br/>I  am  sure  that  all  honourable  Members  will  agree  with  me  that  there  is  already  a  change  in  the 
<br/>atmosphere in this august Parliament, and we thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This has been a very eventful week.  Fiji has been hosting the World Hindi Conference in 
<br/>Denarau, Nadi.  More than 1,000 delegates from all over the world have come together for this Hindi 
<br/>Language Conference. Almost one billion people in the world speak the language, yet they believe 
<br/>it is important that they come to have a conference on the Hindi language because they respect and 
<br/>accept that our language is a very important component of our identity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing us to speak in Hindi and the </span><span>Vosa Vakaviti</span><span> in this 
<br/>Parliament.  Unlike some doubts expressed, it was a decision of the Business Committee and I thank 
<br/>you for being brave enough to introduce that subject to the Business Committee, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This week has also been notable with the fact that the USP Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pal 
<br/>Ahluwalia and his wife have returned.  Also, unlike some thinking that I would go and apologise to 
<br/>him - I did not.   The students and the Board at USP did that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also thank Parliament for the extension of the guarantee for the Fiji Development Bank 
<br/>borrowing which we did  yesterday.  There have  been some criticisms about  the changes in  some 
<br/></span><span>Boards and I mentioned that when I gave my opening address moving the motion that we had to do 
<br/></span><span>that for Reserve Bank and FBC because there had been an exodus of former Board members.  I thank 
<br/>the honourable Members for supporting that guarantee motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  noteworthy  but  sad  event  in  Parliament  this  week  has  been  the  referral  to  the 
<br/>Privileges Committee of the conduct of the former Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition,  honourable  Bainimarama.    I  will  only  say  because  it  is  something  that  is  before  the 
<br/>Privileges Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a veteran parliamentarian, you are no stranger to the culture of robust 
<br/></span><span>debates  in  Parliament.    There  are  also  some  words  that  are  unbecoming.    We  have  heard  some 
<br/>honourable Members using these words and one honourable Member was calling out, “you are lying, 
<br/>you are lying” this morning.  That used to be unparliamentary language, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you have been reading about the history of the British Parliament, you would probably have 
<br/>read somewhere that Sir Winston Churchill was calling out “you are lying” and there was a Point of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order by a member on the other side of Parliament who said that the honourable Member was using 
<br/>unparliamentary  language.    Sir  Winston  Churchill  very  quickly  stood  up  and  apologised  to  the 
<br/>Speaker  and  said,  “Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  withdraw  ‘lying’;  I  was  just  stating  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Member was stating a terminological inexactitude” and the Speaker said it was  alright.  So he sat 
<br/>down and the other Member was happy until he went back and looked it up the dictionary and found 
<br/>out that ‘terminological inexactitude’ exactly meant lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the tenor of the debate and the contributions, I am very hopeful.  I 
<br/>think with the break that we are going to have after this one week of sitting, we will come back and 
<br/>those ghosts, obstacles, and those dangerous things we see, will now disappear.  This is the opening, 
<br/>this is the beginning of across-the-floor co-operation for the people of Fiji and as I mentioned in my 
<br/>first  address,  we  may  differ  but  we  have  one  common  mission  and  that  is  to  govern  in  the  best 
<br/>interests of all the people of Fiji; all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I call on honourable Members on both sides of Parliament to cooperate.  There will be time 
<br/>when we will come across to you to find out why did you do this when you were minister for this.  
<br/>And discussions outside the ministerial offices, outside Parliament will lead us to find out why we 
<br/>are doing this when they did it that way before.  How should we do it in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question of climate change and I congratulate the honourable Seruiratu 
<br/>for his role as our climate change champion a few years ago.   I remember sending one of my ministers 
<br/>in the SVT/GVP Government to attend the first World Conference in Rio.  Two years after that, they 
<br/>called together the Conference of Parties for COP1 for their first meeting.  We have been having 
<br/>those conferences of parties until the present day.  We have all been talking about what we should be 
<br/>doing,  what  we  can  be  cooperating  with  other  countries  on  to  try  and  limit  the  damages  and 
<br/>destruction caused by, sadly, human greed, human hurry.  Where are we hurrying to?  Why are we 
<br/>trying to do all these things? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We still have not found the answer, but we are beginning to slow down the destruction of the 
<br/>environment and hopefully we will get to a time when we will have a sustainable rate of development.  
<br/>I go back to the United Nations putting out all these Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that we 
<br/>had all tried to abide by and comply with in our own government development plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of those goals and conventions put out by the United Nations Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the 
<br/></span><span>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous People (UNDRIP).  I know there are 
<br/></span><span>different interpretations, some like my own nephew, the honourable Bulitavu believed it should only 
<br/>be applied where the indigenous people form a minority in the population of that country.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to differ and I would like to refer him to the original document and how they 
<br/>arrived at the declaration.  It is up to countries to find out whether we can use that objectively without 
<br/>sidelining any of our ethnicity in our own homeland. Now that we all call Fiji our homeland and we 
<br/>are all Fijians, I hope that all Fijians will take heed of the cry of the indigenous people of this land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many common subjects that we can talk about as I mentioned on 
<br/></span><span>Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023  -  protecting  our  children,  eliminating  violence  against  women, 
<br/>improving services in our towns and cities, providing better opportunities, inspiring our sports men 
<br/>and women and alleviating poverty to create a happier and more prosperous Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I started my Dinner Address at the Sheraton, I spoke to them in </span><span>Gorkhali, 
<br/></span><span>the language of the Nepalese soldiers who served in the British Army.  It was a requirement for all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>330 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those British Officers and I was classified as a British Officer then joining the </span><span>Gurkas</span><span> to learn their 
<br/>language.  I spoke to them in </span><span>Gorkhali</span><span> and they all clapped, whether they followed everything I said 
<br/>or not - I am not sure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  the  fact  that  someone  tried  to  communicate  with  them  and  the  Conference  on  Hindi 
<br/>Language is a conference on how to communicate using the Hindi language as a medium.  When you 
<br/>try to communicate with someone even if it is just being “</span><span>bula</span><span>”, the chap would stand still and ask, 
<br/>“you from Fiji?” The response is, “yes.” And then, “you speak Fijian?” Response is “no.” Alright, 
<br/>and then you converse in English.  But the fact that you reach out to them in your language and they 
<br/>understand  that  language  breaks  the  ice,  breaks  down  the  barriers  and  you  have  something  in 
<br/>common, you both recognise that one word, “</span><span>bula”</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I reiterate my thanks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing </span><span>vosa vaka-Viti</span><span> to be used in 
<br/>this august Parliament.  I switch very quickly to the channel, and I must congratulate our simultaneous 
<br/>Interpreters for the work that they are doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank our colleagues from the National Federation Party and 
<br/>SODELPA, a party I had once belonged to, looked after me and promoted me to be the Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, I thank them for the four years of working together. Now that we are together again, we 
<br/>are very happy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, to dispel any worries that honourable Seruiratu had mentioned here in Parliament 
<br/>that we have an unworkable or unstable Coalition, I would like to say, “it is not an unworkable or 
<br/>unstable”, </span><span>se cava Vasu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call on my Coalition colleagues, we have been given a challenge, we have 
<br/>been challenged by the honourable Members of the loyal Opposition of the Republic of Fiji, they 
<br/>want us to perform, we can show them, “yes, we will build on what you have built and we shall 
<br/>perform.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- We are subject to the laws of the land and you can do what we have 
<br/></span><span>now done, to some who may have overstepped the law, you can do that to us when you get to be on 
<br/>this side, if you ever get back to this side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for allowing me to table this address so that you can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>look at what you can attack me on and come back the next time you come back to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  group  will  be  joining  me  on  a  trip  to  present  our  </span><span>reguregu  </span><span>to  the  </span><span>Gone  Turaga  na  Tui 
<br/></span><span>Vitogo,  Taukei  Sukanacagi</span><span>.    His  Excellency  the  President  has  asked  that  we  also  take  his 
<br/>condolences, he has also contributed to what we are taking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again thank all the honourable Members who have contributed to 
<br/>this debate.  I am sorry, I have not been able to address each of your concerns individually.  You will 
<br/>notice that when you read the Address, when it gets to you, I have tried to address every concern you

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you all very much, I wish you all a pleasant weekend and a happy break before we

<div><span>come back together again.  I commend this motion to Parliament.

<br/>them.  I now adjourn the meeting for half-an-hour.
