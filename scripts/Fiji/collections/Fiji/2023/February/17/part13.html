<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>285 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You must embrace it, I  know you are  embracing it.  The 2013 Constitution, that names us all as 
<br/>Fijians.  I also urge all of us to respect everyone’s wish to practice their faith and not impose our 
<br/>Christianity but let our light shine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet colleagues, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament and those joining us via livestream; </span><span>mia’u bula re</span><span>, good day to 
<br/>you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, I humbly thank the Almighty God for His spiritual guidance enabling me 
<br/>to stand here today.  I wish to join my colleagues in congratulating our Speaker, honourable Ratu 
<br/>Naiqama Lalabalavu on his appointment. Congratulation is also extended to Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to express my gratitude to His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili 
<br/>Katonivere for his opening speech earlier this month in which he emphasised the need of maintaining 
<br/>a spirit of unity as a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a new Member of this august Parliament, please, allow me to introduce 
<br/>myself.  I proudly bear the name of my late father’s best friend, Iliesa Sovui Vanawalu.  I am grateful 
<br/>to be registered in the i </span><span>Vola ni Kawa Bula</span><span> for two </span><span>yavusa</span><span> – Yavusa Tubulevu, Koro Valenisausau 
<br/>and Yavusa Tuarewa, koro o Laucala in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Wailevu, in the province of Cakaudrove.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I spent my primary school years in Wailevu West and Wailevu East District School and high 
<br/>school years at Niusawa Methodist High School in Taveuni.  I graduated from The University of the 
<br/>South Pacific (USP) with a diploma and then later a Degree in Commerce. I continued my education 
<br/>with  USP,  earning  a  Postgraduate  Certificate  in  Human  Resources,  a  Postgraduate  Diploma  in 
<br/>General Management and ultimately, a Masters Degree in Business Administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was  raised by Ta Timoci  Tamaibece  and Na  Ema Vakadranisau (may their souls rest  in 
<br/>peace). I am married to Unaisi Vakacowaqa Vanawalu from the Tokatoka Drona, Tikotiko Turaga 
<br/>mai Nauaua, Turaga na Roko Tui Kama, Muanisolo, Naceva in Kadavu. We are blessed with three 
<br/>children  -  Lesia  Baledrokaroka  Vanawalu,  Lilieta  Vanawalu  Wainiqolo  and  Siteri  Vanawalu 
<br/>Masirewa. They all graduated from USP and have their own families. I am a proud grandfather to 
<br/></span><span>seven grandchildren - Lorana, Iliesa (Jnr), Saiasi, Buna, Semisi (Jnr), Timoci and Tutu Levi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I started my career with the Forestry Department in 1982 before joining the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>Military Forces in 1983, where I had the opportunity to be part of the United Nations Peacekeeping 
<br/>in Lebanon and the Multinational Force and Observers Force in the Sinai Desert.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  1987,  I  decided  to  venture  out  into  other  fields  of  telecommunication.  I  joined  the 
<br/>Department  of  Post  and  Telecommunication  as  a  Postal  Assistant  and  rose  up  the  rank  to  be  the 
<br/>General Manager of Postal Services throughout Fiji. It was late last year when I resigned from formal 
<br/></span><span>employment to represent the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Wailevu under the banner of the People’s Alliance Party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can declare with humility and pride that after 52 long years my </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wailevu, the biggest </span><span>tikina</span><span> in Fiji is now represented in this august Parliament for the first time.

<br/>support all along during my campaign in your two villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to anyone I have not explicitly thanked for helping me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>represent you in this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a great honour for me to address you all as the Assistant Minister for 
<br/>Education.  I wish to concur with the honourable Minister of Education when he said that this year 
<br/>is  going  to  be  a  challenging  one  but  one  which  will  bring  about  change  for  better  and  with  no 
<br/>vulnerable community left behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in embracing change, we strive to bring forward the things that worked well 
<br/>for all sectors, particularly our education system. At this point, I thank the past administration for 
<br/>their contributions in reaching out to our families providing them with needed assistance to ensure 
<br/>more of our children have access to education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to enable our students to grow as responsible patriotic citizens with a strong 
<br/>civic sense and loaded system of belief, a meaningful change in our education centre is called for.  
<br/>This change requires new structures, new tools, as well as new knowledge.  But more than anything, 
<br/>there is a major culture change and transformation that our education system must go through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the heart of any transformation in the education system, there are our 
<br/>children.  Efforts must be enhanced to ensure that the interests and welfare of our future leaders will 
<br/>take priority at all times.  It is also important that they are supported in developing and reaching their 
<br/>full potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  brings  us  to  the  overall  performance  of  our  students  who  sat  for  their  external 
<br/>examinations in 2022. The performance of our students is commended, given the condensed learning 
<br/>and teaching span in the year, due to the 2021 learning programme being accommodated in 2022.  
<br/>We had 7,751 students sitting for Fiji Year 13 Certificate Examination and recorded a pass rate of 88 
<br/>percent in comparison to 70 percent for 2021.  The 13,281 students sat for Fiji Year 12 Certificate 
<br/>Examination in 2022 and recorded a pass rate of 64 percent in comparison to the 66 percent for 2021, 
<br/>two years after COVID-19 - 17,366 Year 8 students sat for their Year 8 External Examination and 
<br/>recorded a pass rate of 62 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As stated by our honourable Minister for Education, efforts will be made to continue to uplift 
<br/>student  performance  in  external  examinations.    At  the  end  of  this  first  week  of  school,  about  90 
<br/>percent of students enrolled for the Year 2023 had returned to primary schools while the secondary 
<br/></span><span>school percentage stood at 89 percent. Our ECE attendance stood at 86 percent and I am positive that 
<br/></span><span>the number has increased further, since then. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker Sir,  we  cannot  underestimate  the  significant  role  our  teachers  play  for  our 
<br/>Ministry and in our economy as a whole. Teaching is the mother of all professions and teachers play 
<br/></span><span>multiple  roles  –  educationists,  counselors,  parents  and  nurses  as  well  -  as  such,  this  needs  to  be 
<br/></span><span>acknowledged.    While  the  Ministry  designs  policies,  it  is  the  teachers  who  ensure  the  successful 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>288 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation of this in their schools.  Had it not been for the teachers’ support and willingness to 
<br/>take  up  the  challenge  of  adapting  to  the  many  changes  implemented  at  the  ministerial  level,  our 
<br/>education system would have been crippled a long time ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the short time since we have taken office, both the honourable Minister and I have come 
<br/>to realise the value of our teachers as the greatest human resource in our Ministry.  The current review 
<br/>process will ensure that the welfare of our teachers is given due consideration.  Our Ministry will 
<br/>work closely with the two teacher unions to safeguard the teachers’ welfare and interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the curriculum in our schools has seen some changes in recent years.  One of the changes 
<br/>was the introduction of Life Mathematics in secondary schools in addition to pure Maths.   While the 
<br/>integration of morale and civic education in the school curriculum under the previous administration is 
<br/>commended, the growing number of indiscipline cases involving our students in recent times, calls for 
<br/>an urgent need for spiritual guidance in both the homes and in schools.  This will be further strengthened 
<br/>by the re-engagement of Chaplains and religious teachers in schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, better monitoring of strategies to determine the success rate of the changes we 
<br/>implement in our curriculum, is imperative. There is an urgent need to thoroughly review the curriculum 
<br/>to enhance quality education, to ensure that we are actually working towards meeting the targets under 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goal 4.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  while  policies,  curriculum  and  staffing  are  important,  the  aspect  of  service 
<br/>delivery in schools, infrastructure cannot be overlooked.  Infrastructure is paramount when it comes to 
<br/>creating a conducive environment for teaching and learning.  Also, due consideration must be given to 
<br/>the overall safety of those we serve.  It is also our aim to provide timely assistance to schools affected by 
<br/>natural disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  26</span><span>th</span><span>  January,  the  Ministry,  in  partnership  with  UNICEF,  had  conducted  an  Education  in 
<br/>Emergency  (EIE)  Disaster  Preparedness  Training  for  155  participants  mainly  ECE,  Primary  and 
<br/>Secondary school teachers.  This training is going to be instrumental in handling emergencies in our 
<br/>education settings, ensuring that schools are better prepared to provide timely feedback to the relevant 
<br/>authorities so that timely assistance can be provided to the affected schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, for any organisation to function effectively, its infrastructure must be of quality.  
<br/>This is of utmost importance when it comes to serving the future leaders of our nation.  It is saddening to 
<br/>note during our visits to the Government schools, the deteriorating status of the infrastructure, particularly 
<br/></span><span>the teachers’ quarters and the classrooms. In large boarding schools like ACS, issues with water supply 
<br/></span><span>are a frequent occurrence and it is happening until date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem can be largely attributed to the absence of a Board of Governors as a governing 
<br/>body. The Board of Governors that had been abolished by the previous Government, was responsible for 
<br/>supporting the Heads of Schools in the operation of the schools and its property. They provided effective 
<br/>oversight into the management and governance of Government schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry will continue to work closely with schools, school management 
<br/></span><span>and the donor partners to improve the school infrastructure so that our students have an environment 
<br/></span><span>that supports their learning.   I echo the words of our honourable Minister for Education that we will 
<br/>continue with the provision of the Free Education Grant, free textbook assistance and the Transport 
<br/>Assistance Scheme for our children. This year, the Coalition Government initiated the Back to School 
<br/>Support of $200 for all families with a combined household income of $50,000. This was a timely 
<br/>assistance that has helped thousands of families.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The schools are commended for working closely with the Ministry of Finance.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Education is ensuring that families receive the support to help prepare their children for the new 
<br/>academic year.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the combined household income threshold for the eligibility criteria 
<br/>to  qualify  for  the  transport  assistance  stands  at  $16,000.    Todate,  we  have  received  90,650 
<br/>applications for this assistance.  This assistance is not limited to Government Schools, but is provided 
<br/>for all schools in Fiji, including management-based schools and faith-based schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since taking office, the honourable Minister for Education and I had the 
<br/>opportunity to visit 15 schools in the Central Division and three schools in the Western Division.  
<br/>The Ministry of Education acknowledges the immense contribution and support by the faith-based 
<br/>schools and management schools towards education and the future of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plans are underway to  reinstate the Board of Governors in  13 schools, which include two 
<br/>primary schools.  Wider consultation with respective stakeholders is paramount and the Ministry of 
<br/>Education will continue to consult with all relevant stakeholders prior to making any further changes, 
<br/>whether it is in regards with the curriculum, policy making or any other decision that may impact to 
<br/>change the direction of our education cycle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would like to state that education is essential for the 
<br/>advancement of any nation to prosper and I believe that all the honourable Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament will agree with me.  Therefore, a concerted effort is required to advance the aim and the 
<br/>objective of progressing the education system in Fiji.  This can only be achieved when all concerned 
<br/>can  learn  to  work  together  for  the  betterment  of  our  children.    As  stated  by  honourable  Bia  “as 
<br/>responsible leaders, we need to put aside self-interest, let us not make this about us, let us be the 
<br/>vessel of change, the change for a better Fiji.”   May God bless each one of us, may God bless Fiji.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I call on the honourable Tuinaceva to deliver his maiden speech.  He used

<div><span>to be a very popular figure at one time on television.  He hails from Matuku.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>.  I rise with joy to deliver 
<br/>my maiden speech.  I take this opportunity to congratulate you on being elected as Speaker - the same 
<br/>sentiment goes to your Deputy, the honourable Qereqeretabua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader 
<br/></span><span>of  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of

<br/>the gallery, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka saka</span><span>.  I return the glory to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who has 
<br/>sustained me and lifted me up my head.  He is a pillar of strength, and I know, without Him, I am 
<br/>nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am here to honour the vote - the vote that carries the hope, dreams, cries, 
<br/>burdens, and the needs of those who voted for me.  To qualify as a leader, I must first serve.  I only 
<br/>lay claim to leadership if I first serve.  Serving the people, giving them a voice, fighting for justice 
<br/></span><span>and  protection  of  their  constitutional  rights,  and  working  with  them  to  find  the  solutions  to  their 
<br/></span><span>problems.  To serve is to lead, therein lies the honour of being a parliamentarian serving the best 
<br/>interests of all Fijians must be the heart of all that we are doing here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  emphasise  serving  the  best  interest  of  all  Fijians  irrespective  of  race,  colour  or  creed 
<br/>especially serving the isolated, the forgotten or the marginalised, those left behind who are in need 
<br/>of  basic  necessities  or  suffering  from  what  they    believe  to  be  a  result  of  some  kind  of  unfair

<br/>as leaders.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am here to honour the vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I want to acknowledge the Minister for Health, honourable 
<br/>Dr. Ratu Lalabalavu on his maiden speech on Wednesday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.  He spoke are few 
<br/>lines on the issue of Non-Communicable Disease and the measures the Ministry is taking to tackle 
<br/>this huge problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to explain the reason I decided to touch on this subject and bring it 
<br/>to the early part of my speech.  The NCD subject brings painful memories to me, I lost many members 
<br/>of my  family  and  friends because of NCD.  As  I stand here this morning,  I have voters who are 
<br/>listening and watching who are very sick and those dying because of NCD.  To them there is nothing 
<br/>else important to them at this very minute, but they want their lives and health back.I assured them 
<br/>that I will try and get help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  an  engineer,  I  have  learnt  that  when  something  is  broken,  we  fix  it 
<br/>straightaway.  Failing that can be catastrophic, it is common sense really.  Our people are falling, 
<br/>taken by NCDs at a horrifying rate, young men and women falling and the rate of our orphan children 
<br/>growing. It is a problem of monstrous proportion, just about 20 years ago, NCD cases occupied less 
<br/>than 50 percent of the hospital beds, now it is well passed that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To say we are witnessing a rise is putting this issue mildly. We are seeing an explosion of 
<br/>NCDs  and  we  need  to  give  this  monstrous  problem  the  attention  and  response  it  deserves.  Our 
<br/>response should be reactive, we should be out there stopping it.  Experts say our highly processed 
<br/>food junk  diet is  to  be blamed.  What  has been  done about  ensuring there is  a greater local  food 
<br/>access? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even then, the late NCD National Director, Dr. Isimeli Tukana said, “Fijians are faced with 
<br/>the  option  of  the  devil  and  the  deep  blue  sea.”  Both  options  (processed  food  and  local  food)  are 
<br/>harmful as further alluded to by the late Dr. Tukana and I quote, “We encourage Fijians to cut down 
<br/>on sugar, fat and salt and eat more fruits and vegetables” but even the supposedly healthier options, 
<br/>the vegetables are full of harmful chemicals and pesticides like glyphosate widely used across Fiji 
<br/>for spraying even home compounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, the International Cancer Research Agency put out a global alert about glyphosate as 
<br/>a probable carcinogen.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know as I am a farmer, I know what we put into the soil, 
<br/></span><span>so what are we going to do about this?  Do we have options and alternatives?  Are we going to be 
<br/></span><span>brave enough to tackle this problem and prioritise Fijian health and wellbeing or are we going to 
<br/>continue killing our population?  All lives matter (every woman, men and child) but we only serve 
<br/>the best interest of the Fijians when we make this statement true and do not let another Fijian fall to 
<br/>an NCD. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is our country without its productive generation?  What hope is there?  
<br/>If our population is sick and dying, as member of this august Parliament, I am willing and stand ready 
<br/>to help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many years ago, a young Lauan maiden from the Yavusa Waitui in the village of Daliconi on 
<br/>the island of Vanuabalavu gave birth to a son. She gazed at him and whispered loving words to her 
<br/>baby, she wondered whom he would grow up into.  She did not have much money but her love was 
<br/>there. Her son grew up to become a parliamentarian, that son addresses to you today.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>291 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Standing here, I honour my late mother, Kelera Vakatalai Soqe 
<br/>- a wonderful single mum, a woman who was my first source of knowledge and to value honour and 
<br/>hard work; a woman who taught me to love, care for others and forgive; a woman who  taught me 
<br/>how to demonstrate tolerance to  those who hurt  me no matter how painful  it is to  have patience, 
<br/>respect and humility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the role every mother, every woman, every parent 
<br/>plays in our homes today, nurturing our children for the next generation of Fijians.  My big </span><span>vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu</span><span> to my wife and children, who have stood by me through it all.  Thank you my brothers and 
<br/>sisters, cousins, nieces and nephews and my two beautiful granddaughters, Bethy and Cathy, and  
<br/>extended family.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Nausori, Narere, Nadera, Raiwai, Nabua from Suva, Sigatoka, Nadi, Lautoka and Ba. From Lomati 
<br/>in  Matuku  and  Daliconi  in  Vanuabalavu  and  many  others  who  worked  day  and  night  to  take  me 
<br/>through this General Election process. Indeed I arrived on the backs and the strength of others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, importantly a big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to the leadership of the FijiFirst Party for 
<br/>giving me this opportunity to serve, for this I am grateful. I believe in the value the party stands - 
<br/>equality, harmony, unity and modality.  During its term in Government, FijiFirst put in place policies 
<br/>and  created  opportunities  for  the  young  and  old  ensuring  rights  for  women,  minorities  and  the 
<br/>disabled and protecting the vulnerable in our society.  It is  a party that is committed to improving 
<br/>the lives of all Fijians. It pushed and continue to strive for oneness.  His Excellency the President, 
<br/>Ratu Viliame Katonivere, emphasised oneness that we need as a nation to respond to multitude of 
<br/>challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The COVID crisis has taught us many lessons, perhaps, one that we overlooked is that death 
<br/>is non-divisive, that we are equal in death and so should we be equal in life. Perhaps, if we adopt this 
<br/>cue from nature, we will find the harmony that we seek, we will find justice in our diversity as a 
<br/>people, that no race, no group is greater than another. That is when equality truly manifests and we 
<br/>become one people, one nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the democratic system that enables this oneness – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a  democratic system  founded on  the  sacred  value  of equality  for  all  regardless of race, 
<br/></span><span>colour or creed and that we must protect;  
<br/>a system that values all young Fijians and all young boys and girls to grow up and have the 
<br/>opportunity to lead their country;  
<br/>a system that allows us parliamentarians to represent and speak the desires of the people 
<br/></span><span>and fight to bring them into being;  
<br/></span><span>a democracy that hears the people, protects them and gives them the right to build and live 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>292 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their dreams, find belonging and carve peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, peace is worth that - peace is an active pursuit of agreement, tolerance and 
<br/>understanding within our diversity.  As a nation, it is not about denying our different ethnic identities 
<br/>but rather embracing our rich uniqueness as Fijians - a people of many races and colours.  None is 
<br/>greater or smaller than the other and we are all the same even as we are different.  This tolerance, 
<br/>this peace is our feeling of belongingness with one another.  Our oneness in our troubles and in joy, 
<br/>a peace I seek to promote as a Member of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but our oneness is often sacrificed on the altar of divisive race politics.  One 
<br/>look at the social media and we see the outpouring of rage and racial hate.  It mirrors our behaviour 
<br/>as leaders, our people look up to us and follow us, but this year, we have the opportunity to create a 
<br/>different reflection - a reflection of oneness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  must  not  create  perceptions  that  we  are  unequal,  that  one  group  is  more  deserving  of 
<br/>attention than the other.  In the spirit of oneness expressed by His Excellency the President and I 
<br/>quote: “I urge you to deliberate with full intention, advocate with thoughtfulness and inclusivity, and 
<br/>debate with respect and finesse.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for if our intentions are pure, I feel the winds of change coming – a wind 
<br/>that brings prosperity, peace and progress that will sustain and be around for many years to come, 
<br/>irrespective of which political party runs the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our journey ahead is challenging.  Poverty, climate change, ecological crisis, growing rates 
<br/>of mental health problems, transnational crimes, geopolitical uncertainties and illicit drugs that even 
<br/>our children are now exposed to, to name are few, each with its impact that undermines us.  As much 
<br/>as this requires us to be one and act together, it also demands of us as leaders to be critical thinkers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Critical thinking requires a deep understanding of issues to help us make decisions best for 
<br/>the people.  Critical thinking is an attribute we must promote in our education system. As a nation, 
<br/>we  must  have  a  culture  of  critical  thinkers  as  a  form  of  resilience.    We  live  in  an  age  of  digital 
<br/>explosion, social media and the weaponization of information. Critical thinking enables everyone to 
<br/>protect themselves and make informed decisions, not a population that rise and falls on the whims of 
<br/>others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has had four Constitutions in 40 years.  It is a worrying trend that shows 
<br/></span><span>our uncertainty as a society in the democracy that we decide.  It also shows the worrying state of our 
<br/></span><span>leadership, our inability to construct something that sustains.  Talks of another Constitution Review 
<br/>ignites the question of when this ends.  People are tired that every government change may mean a 
<br/>constitutional change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I challenge us all leaders here today, let us think critically.  Let us focus 
<br/>only  on what  is  necessary for the best  interest  of all.  With a host of  challenges that besiege our 
<br/>country and the dream to shape a better tomorrow for our people, it is time to think critically.  We 
<br/>must work together and make better decisions.  Admittedly, we will make mistakes, we will be tested 
<br/></span><span>but our children will not turn around and accuse us of not trying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in serving, we have the duty to go back to our communities, to hear their voice.  
<br/>A long-standing joke about politicians is that, we only show up around election time and disappear 
<br/>until the next election. We uphold our democracy - when we go back, hear them and enable their 
<br/>voice to be heard in this Parliament, voicing what is really happening and not what we assume is.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>293 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, after being sworn in on 24th December, 2022, I have been going back to the 
<br/>communities, settlements and villages.  It was a joy to talk and listen to their requests. Their </span><span>talanoa</span><span>, 
<br/>some of which I would like to highlight but before doing that I want to say that I do clearly understand 
<br/>the  Government  process  and  machinery  on  any  authority,  and  observing  and  engaging  in  any 
<br/>development project, does not happen overnight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mt. Speaker, Sir, from the </span><span>Tikina o</span><span> Wailevu, the villages of Natuwa, Vunidamu and Natuvu 
<br/>and  nearby  settlements  are  waiting  to  be  connected  to  the  grid  -  that  is  already  running  past  the 
<br/>respective  villages  and  terminating  at  Uluivalili  College.    Further  down  the  Wailevu  West  Coast 
<br/>Road  from  Valeni,  Laucala  and  Naiqaqi  Villages  are  humbly  requesting  the  grid  to  extend  from 
<br/>Uluivalili to their villages.  They are even requesting if it is costly, they will accept whatever form 
<br/>of energy provision that can be provided and that includes solar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same request is coming from the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Navatu - the villages of Nasinu, Korolevu, Drano 
<br/>and  Navakaka  and  the  </span><span>Tikina  </span><span>Naweni.  As  for  the  villages  of  Naviavia,  Keka,  Navunibuabua 
<br/>Settlement,  Kilaka,  Nakorovou,  Nadivakarua  and  Raviravi  in  the  Bua  Province,  the  villages  are 
<br/>appealing for a source of power and a good communication network to connect them to the rest of 
<br/>Fiji and the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at Uluisavudua Settlement in Sawani, Naitasiri, it is just about 8 kilometres 
<br/>from Nausori Town and there is no running water supply and electricity.   Uluisavudua is mainly a 
<br/>farming community with huge potential and there is a need to upgrade the road on that particular 
<br/>locality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I have said, some part of the work has already started but I am here to ask 
<br/>and appeal to the Government, on behalf of the people, to look into that and find a way to see if these 
<br/>projects can be completed.  I am looking forward to work with the respective Ministers.   I also give 
<br/>a bit of support from the community to get this work done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have also attended a number of </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session where people have brought 
<br/>up issues for discussion, and some of the concerns they highlighted relate to security, stability, health 
<br/>and equality.  On issues of security, some fear hatred and anger, and attack on social media because 
<br/>of the political party they support.  Many just want political and economic stability to quietly raise 
<br/>their children with the confidence of an economic future.  Others spoke of the importance of equality 
<br/>to be treated equally and for equality to be the stabiliser of our democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we serve let us take time to truly hear what the people say, so that we honour 
<br/></span><span>their vote, honour our dreams as a nation and honour the dignity of this Parliament.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I am here to honour the vote, I am here to serve.  May God bless us all, </span><span>vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  I intend to adjourn Parliament for a lunch break and 
<br/>following  that  when  we  resumed,  we  will  continue  with  honourable  Ifereimi  Vanu,  Minister  for 
<br/>iTaukei  Affairs,  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts.    We  have  five  other  speakers  before  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister is invited to give his Right of Reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once the report from the Privileges Committee is at hand, hopefully we will deal with it when 
<br/>we complete the Reply to His Excellency’s Address which is part of the motion as well.  Honourable 
<br/>Members, now we adjourn for lunch.

<br/>her appointment as the Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to express my deep appreciation to His Excellency the President for his gracious, 
<br/>uplifting and excellent Address in opening the 2023-2024 Session of Parliament.  It certainly ushers 
<br/>in  a  new  dawn  in  Fiji’s  effort  for  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  governance  of 
<br/>democracy process.   From  the standpoint of the  Ministry of iTaukei  Affairs, the various pointers 
<br/>highlighted with respect to the review of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>statutes and institutions, are very long overdue.  
<br/>They truly reflect the hopes and dreams of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, I wish to acknowledge the great work of our Saviour Jesus 
<br/>Christ in my life, whose leadership and guidance have landed me in your midst today.   allow me to 
<br/>speak in my mother tongue in thanking my supporters.
