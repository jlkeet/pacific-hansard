<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON HIS EXCELLENCY’S ADDRESS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  continue  with  the  Responses  to  His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency’s  Address  and  I  now  call  on  the  Assistant  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways, 
<br/>honourable Tomasi Tunabuna, who I might add is just like in the previous Parliament, a lone ranger 
<br/>sitting on this side.  You have the floor, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  (Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members of Parliament, my fellow Fijians present here today and those who are watching 
<br/></span><span>the Parliament session live from wherever you are; </span><span>miau sa bula re</span><span> and a very good morning to you 
<br/>all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I thank the Lord Almighty for His blessings, guidance 
<br/></span><span>and  strength  that  has  enabled  me  to  be  where  I  am  today.    I  will  be  presenting  to  you  later  a 
<br/></span><span>recollection of journey through life and my career.  I will do so to help you all to understand that I

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am here this morning to testify His glory and to answer to His calling.  Sir, Daniel 2:21 from the </span><span>Holy 
<br/>Bible</span><span>, says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“He  changes  times  and  seasons;  he  removes  kings  and  sets  up  kings;  he  gives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am deeply honoured and privileged this morning to be here and to deliver 
<br/>my Maiden Speech as a new Member of this august Parliament, and also as Assistant Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  join  the  previous  speakers  in  congratulating  you  on  your 
<br/>appointment  as  Speaker  of  this  august  Parliament,  and  I  also  congratulate  honourable  Lenora 
<br/>Qereqeretabua on her appointment as Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I send my sincere appreciation to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>most gracious, inspirational and moving Address on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to spare a few lines in my maiden speech to express my 
<br/>deepest  sympathies  and  condolences  to  the  people  of  Turkey,  Syria,  the  Northern  Part  of  New 
<br/>Zealand and also parts of Fiji for the devastating losses to their properties and loved ones. We pray 
<br/>for God’s blessings and fulfilment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was successfully voted into Parliament in the 2022 General Election under 
<br/>our People’s Alliance Party (PAP) banner and now, as a Member of the Coalition Government with 
<br/>the National Federation Party and SODELPA.  Sir, I pay my respect to the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for giving me this opportunity and having faith in me to be part of PAP. I am now serving alongside 
<br/>remarkable leaders - leaders with vision, leaders with principles, leaders with good governance and 
<br/>leaders of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I humbly accepted the request from the representative of the </span><span>Vanua o Bua</span><span> to be a candidate 
<br/>for PAP.  At this juncture, I wish to extend my deepest respect and appreciation to my supporters 
<br/>from the </span><span>yasana vakaturaga o Bua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Miau sa bula re beha a lewe ni yasana vahauraga o Cahau ni abua. Sa iho a Gone uraga a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Respectful greetings to the honorific Cakaunitabua chiefdom and the people of the province 
<br/>of Bua. Respectful greetings to high chief the Tui Bua, and all the chiefs and nobles of our 
<br/>traditional Cakaunitabua chiefdom. My utmost gratitude for the immense support and loyalty 
<br/>shown to me during the recent Elections. Victory is finally ours in our having a representative 
<br/>into  Parliament  where  our  voice  can  now  be  heard.    Thank  you  so  much  for  your  loyal 
<br/>support.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I grew up under the care of my late mother in her village in Saolo, Wainunu, 
<br/>Bua. My dad was a seaman and was always at sea. I salute and acknowledge them both, and I only 
<br/>wish they were here.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>262 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I attended Ratu Luke Memorial School in Wainunu and gained entry into Ratu Kadavulevu 
<br/>School where I passed all my external exams, including the City and Guilds of London Institute’s 
<br/>Agriculture Engineering Course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had wanted to become a Livestock Officer and was enrolled at the Fiji College of Agriculture 
<br/>in Koronivia and on my final year, I was one of the 10 students who were studying to graduate as a 
<br/>Livestock Officer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank Ms. Marieta Rigamoto, the former Principal of Fiji College of Agriculture and 
<br/>later became the Assistant  Minister for Agriculture. She was  a powerful  and hardworking icon.  I 
<br/>thank her sincerely for her motherly role in my life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From a very early age, I was exposed to the world that required me to meet challenges, make 
<br/>tough decisions, gain experiences and develop myself.  I was led to believe that opportunities ahead 
<br/>of me could be made possible through focussed vision, hard work, perseverance, determination and 
<br/>sacrifice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  joined  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  as  a  young  Locality  Officer  in  the 
<br/>remote and highlands of Naitasiri.  I transitioned through the career ladder to the position of Director 
<br/>Animal Health and Production and later acted Permanent Secretary for Agriculture on a number of 
<br/>occasions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  those  who  have  been  part  of  my  upbringing  as  a  junior 
<br/>officer in the Ministry of Agriculture - Dr. Ken Cokanasiga, Dr. Robin Yarrow, Dr. Tabunakawai,  
<br/>Mr. Turagacati, Peter Manueli, Shiu Chand and the late, Philip Alifereti, to name a few.  Life then as 
<br/>a civil servant was simple and we found security and care in our workplace.  There were well defined 
<br/>systems and processes in place.  We were treated with respect and kindness.  It was the way the world 
<br/>should be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank Mr. Ratuvuki, Mr. Ucuboi, Mr. Mason and also Mr. Ligairi, Mr. Tamani, Mr. 
<br/>Baya, Dr. Anand Deo, Mr. Bolawaqatabu, Mr. Mudaliar, Mr. and Mrs. Waibuta, Ms. Taylor, Mrs. 
<br/>Nawaikula, Mrs. Toganivalu and Ms. Rakuita, the late Navukiboro, Mr. Ilaitia Boa and Mr. Rakalou, 
<br/>who helped me manoeuvred my way through and assisted me when the loads were heavy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though work could have been challenging at times, we could find time 
<br/>to discuss and realign our path to eliminate losses and keep damages to the minimum. We invested 
<br/></span><span>in our organisation, appropriately designed staff structure, developed succession plans and prioritised 
<br/></span><span>capacity building in line with sound recruitment procedures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was able to manage, mitigate and transfer risks from natural disasters.  The introduction 
<br/>of exotic diseases was negligible. Flood was not very frequent, and recovery was always fast.  The 
<br/>impact from animal and plant diseases were kept below economic injury level and responses were 
<br/>appropriately designed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was one of those senior officers that was unceremoniously removed from 
<br/></span><span>my office while I was performing the duties of Director Animal Health and Production at the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Agriculture.  Even though it was a bitter experience but for me and my family, it helped us grow 
<br/>stronger.  I had to make tough choices and accepted challenges as a result of that situation.  My 32 
<br/>years of service ended abruptly without any due recognition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I returned home to Sawani in the province of Bua and settled down in the community.  This 
<br/>was when I came to finally face the difficulties and hardships rural communities are confronted with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if they do not appreciate the untapped potential that exists in rural communities.  I began to influence 
<br/>people to treat agriculture as a business and as a source of livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was appointed to be a </span><span>Mata ni Tikina o Nadi</span><span> (Nadi District Representative) 
<br/>in  Bua  and,  again,  I  was  unceremoniously  removed  from  my  position  upon  instruction  from  the 
<br/>Provincial  Administrator  Bua  from  higher  authorities.  I  was  worried,  however,  from  that  point 
<br/>onwards, I was very confident that if I was going to contest the Election, I will definitely sit in the 
<br/>seat of Parliament.  It was just a matter of time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that experience was the driving force to joining politics.  I had to answer to 
<br/>the call from the </span><span>vanua o Bua</span><span> (Province of Bua) to represent them in this august Parliament.  It will 
<br/>be an upward battle and I am fully confident that my knowledge and experience will help me make 
<br/>the difference in this sector.  I had envisioned the plans and proper measures to achieve the desired 
<br/>outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now focus on agriculture and waterways.  I must thank the staff of 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways for their endurance and resilience as the last 16 years was 
<br/>far too long.  I thank the staff for their warm welcome ceremonies accorded to us whenever we visit 
<br/>them.  This is an indication of the huge relief and massive support to the change in Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge His Excellency the President of Fiji for highlighting 
<br/>the  need  to  ensure  that  all  citizens  have  access  to  safe  and  nutritious  food.    The  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture’s activities are earmarked to realise food and income security.  Agricultural growth and 
<br/>expansion will stimulate economic activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  currently  reviewing  the  existing  Ministry’s  Strategic  Development  Plan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which underpins five key strategic priorities, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve Food and Nutrition Security. 
<br/>Increase Farm Household Income. 
<br/>Climate Smart Agriculture. 
<br/>Commercial Agriculture.  
<br/>Improve Public Sector Performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  was  able  to  grab  the  opportunity  to  expand  production  or  primary 
<br/>produce, reduce our imports and increase exports to premium markets to bring in the much-needed 
<br/></span><span>foreign  exchange.  This  has  enabled  the  Ministry  to  remain  committed  to  support  agricultural 
<br/></span><span>development  that  will  continue  to  accelerate  the  process  of  transitioning  smallholder  farmers  to 
<br/>commercial level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  in  Fiji,  agricultural  initiatives  are  being  undertaken  to  address  the  most 
<br/>important issues affecting our rural population.  Production of local food, particularly indigenous and 
<br/>traditional food that can withstand climate change and often nutritious meals for our local population.  
<br/>As  a  result,  agricultural  support  must  be  distributed  holistically,  and  farmers  are  provided  with 
<br/>support packages needed to actively pursue commercial agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to support His Excellency’s statement for farmers to have guaranteed 
<br/>income  from  both,  local  and  export  market.  Farmers  will  be  encouraged  to  work  in  clusters  to 
<br/>facilitate access to market, finance, training and technology.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will develop the framework that addresses domestic and international issues, 
<br/>including food and nutritional security, climate change, feedstock for renewable energy, and the use 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>264 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of land and water resources for production to meet domestic and export market demands.  In addition, 
<br/>the Ministry will continue to  improve infrastructure that will reduce flooding  in  lower catchment 
<br/>areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  view  of  His  Excellency’s  statement  of  growing  the  economy  by 
<br/>increasing  the  size  of  the  pie  through  diversifying  our  resources,  the  Ministry  is  aware  of  the 
<br/>unregulated and unsustainable land use practices which has caused an increase in soil erosion and 
<br/>sedimentation into our waterways, thus increasing flooding.  The Ministry is committed to establish 
<br/>a national dredging plan of action to address the problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been promoting nature-based solution seawall construction 
<br/>to reduce communities’ exposure to coastal erosion and high-way action during storms surges.  Sea 
<br/>level  rise  has  long  been  a  threat  to  coastal  communities  with  rippled  effects  of  coastal  erosion, 
<br/>saltwater intrusion and coastal flooding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also extends support during periods of prolonged drought to 
<br/>many farmers who are unable to properly irrigate their farmlands and assist them with irrigation kits 
<br/>and install multiple gravity-fed irrigation systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to engage and build strong lasting partnerships with all relevant 
<br/>international  stakeholders,  potential  investors,  donor  partners,  agencies  and  communities,  as  they 
<br/>continue to  progress  towards our vision to  grow  beyond. The Government  would like to  thank it 
<br/>partners, such as Food and Agriculture Organisation, United Nations, European Union, South Pacific 
<br/>Community, the World Food Programme and many other stakeholders whom we are very grateful to 
<br/>be engaged with, and we look forward to their continued support towards the development of the 
<br/>agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government acknowledges the strong engagement with 
<br/>our partners in development through our consolidated Coastal Protection Programme, and I wish to 
<br/>make  mention  of  the  contribution  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  International  Union  for 
<br/>Conservation Nature (IUCN) and the Kiwa Initiative and Adaptation Fund.  We are also grateful for 
<br/>the support we get from our bilateral partners and we wish to continue our collaboration in the coming 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  is  committed  to  capacity  building  and  human  resource 
<br/>development. It is obvious that there is room for improvement, for it was overlooked and mismanaged 
<br/></span><span>by the previous Government. This had resulted in huge demands for skilled and experienced human 
<br/></span><span>resources.  There will be thorough consultations with academic institutions as to the courses offered 
<br/>so that these will meet industry demands.  Having said that, it is important that proper planning is 
<br/>required to address the constraints faced in the development of the agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to extend my deepest appreciation to my family - my beautiful wife, 
<br/>Seruwaia Susu Tunabuna, my children, my in-laws, grandchildren and my brothers and sisters.  I also 
<br/>pay tribute to my twin sister and brother, Bano.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  support  from  the  </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> </span><span>Muanaicake,  na  lewenikoro  o  Sawani  Nasawana,

<div><span>[I thank the support from the Muanaicake Clan, the villagers of Sawani, Nasawana, Saolo, 
<br/>Nasolo and Nasavu, the District of Kubulau, Wainunu, Nadi, Solevu and Vuya.  I express my 
<br/>sincere gratitude also to the remaining Districts in the chiefly Bua Province.]

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for welcoming me back to Parliament and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will allude to that a little later.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, my fellow Fijians present here today and those witnessing through other 
<br/>means outside this Parliament; it is, indeed, a great pleasure to join my parliamentary colleagues and 
<br/>the people of Fiji to welcome the beginning of the third term of Parliament since 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I join my fellow colleagues to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for your successful election 
<br/>to the high office. This august Parliament will surely be guided by your exemplary leadership and 
<br/>profound vision.  I also wish to congratulate honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua for her appointment 
<br/>as the Deputy Speaker.  Let me also congratulate all our Members of Parliament for their successful 
<br/>election to Parliament and let us work together for a better Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before us and I thank His Excellency the President for 
<br/>his  wise  counsel  and  leadership.    His  Excellency’s  tenure  as  President  marks  another  highlight, 
<br/>furthering his sterling career as a leader of the people which he carries out with humility, grace and 
<br/>charm.    His  messages  of  peace,  unity  and  harmony  have  formed  the  cornerstone  of  his  public 
<br/>pronouncements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  first  thank  my  wife,  Mrs.  Sadhana  Singh,  a  retired 
<br/>teacher; our son and daughter in-law; our daughter and son in-law; and our four grandchildren for 
<br/>their  unconditional  love  and  unwavering  support  at  all  times.    I  also  wish  to  extend  my  sincere

<br/>nationwide and abroad for the support that they rendered during the Election.

<div><span>of Fiji, who inspired me to return to Parliament are also thanked from the bottom of my heart.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I come from a small coastal village, Niurua, which is about 20 kilometres 
<br/>on the coast down from the chiefly village of Naduri.  I am from Macuata by the way.  My late parents 
<br/>and my late elder brothers were the ones that taught me the values that I strongly nurtured.  Sir, my 
<br/>late father stood for justice, fairness, humanity, and my late elder brothers were also those who always 
<br/>made sure that the weak were not bullied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  out  of  the  12  siblings,  I  am  number  10  and  when  my  eldest  brother  got 
<br/></span><span>married, I was merely a year old.  I am blessed to have a very large extended family.  I was a teacher 
<br/>for 26 years and my training was at Corpus Christi Teachers College and my further education from 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I express my deep gratitude to the stalwarts of the National Federation Party 
<br/>and  the  Coalition  Government  colleagues  and  supporters  for  their  hard  work  and  commitment  to 
<br/>ensure we achieve our set goals and objectives. Our deep sense of unity and solidarity will enable us 
<br/>to collectively overcome the challenges that lie ahead.  These counsels of humility and grace, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, are virtues that form the foundation of our diversity.  Its principles are embedded in the 
<br/></span><span>message of His Excellency the President that he imparted, not only to all of us, but to the people of 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency addressed the need for national unity. This is vital to meeting our growing 
<br/>challenges and looking after the less fortunate and marginalised in our society.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>267 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a leader committed to genuine democracy, our honourable Prime Minister is a towering figure of 
<br/>vision, genuine commitment and firm focus for a united Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will adhere to the virtues of truth and justice to 
<br/>achieve genuine democracy, compassion and care for all. And herein, I will talk about something that 
<br/>is very dear and near to my heart.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am grateful to the honourable Prime Minister for his display of trust and confidence in me.  
<br/>The  workers  of  Fiji  have  this  Coalition  Government’s  assurance  that  we  will  not  abandon  them.  
<br/>Personally,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  fought  for  workers’  rights  for  the  past  23  years.    My  ministerial 
<br/>appointment  will  not  change  this  fact.    As  stated  earlier,  a  unified  approach  through  dialogue, 
<br/>consensus  and  mutual  agreement  is  the  most  ideal  way  forward  for  workers,  employers  and 
<br/>government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tripartism, that is, workers, employers and government trying to collectively 
<br/>resolve issues will be the new order of industrial relations.  Sir, the values and vision upon which my 
<br/>Ministry  was  established  after  the  independence  of  our  nation  will  remain  the  cornerstone  in 
<br/>everything that we do.  It will help us navigate the multiple crisis facing the employment sector and 
<br/>act as the basis of policies. It will help us to fairly quickly assess the profound and rapid changes in 
<br/>the global arena.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this reason, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations remains 
<br/>deeply committed to advancing social justice as a condition for lasting peace through sustained and 
<br/>inclusive economic growth that fosters decent work and a sustainable working environment for all. 
<br/>Given the impact of current challenges on employment and labour markets, my Ministry stands ready 
<br/>to support workers, employers and all our stakeholders to achieve full and productive employment 
<br/>and decent work for all based on unique, normative mandate and tripartite structure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  highlighted  by  His  Excellency’s  the  President,  the  People’s  Coalition 
<br/>Government  has  re-established  the  diminished  Tripartite  Forum  on  equal  appointment  of 
<br/>representatives from government, employers and trade unions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  inform  Parliament  that  the  first  Employment  Relations 
<br/>Advisory Board Meeting (ERAB) for 2023 was held on 8</span><span>th</span><span> February with its membership consisting 
<br/>of equal representation of workers, employers and government in line with ILO Convention 144 on 
<br/>Tripartite Consultation which Fiji ratified in May 1998.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was surprised by the utterances of honourable Bala during his contribution 
<br/>to  the debate on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February on the ERAB.   Let me just remind honourable Bala that 
<br/>under  his  leadership  as  the  then  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations, 
<br/>there was no equal representation in ERAB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  That is what you say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The uneven representation of tripartite members resulted in unfair and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unjust …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I had to hold Felix’s hand and bring him to the meeting.  Keep that in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mind before you say anything. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>268 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- … decisions were made by the board with no genuine consultation. The 
<br/>Fiji Trades Union Congress (FTUC) refused to be part of that ERAB because it was not constituted 
<br/>according to the ILO Guideline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have equal representation of five members each from employers, 
<br/>workers  and  the  Government.  This  means  that  the  decisions  made  by  ERAB  will  be  fair  and  all 
<br/>tripartite members will be able to fully express their opinion and have consensus on matters brought 
<br/>for discussion in ERAB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I never expected this from you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you do wrong you have to be corrected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What is wrong? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The wrongs have to be pointed out when they are corrected…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Here comes a political party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  right  to  organise  collective  bargaining  was 
<br/>curtailed  under  the  FijiFirst  Government  and  freedom  of  assembly  and  freedom  of  speech  was 
<br/>something that they never allowed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Increase the minimum wage rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Under  their  leadership,  individual  contracts  imposed  on  the  Civil 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Service were deliberately intended to diminish the rights of workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Collective bargaining became a thing of the past, union busting was the 
<br/></span><span>name of the game.  As the General Secretary of the Fiji Teachers Union (FTU) at the that time until 
<br/>recently, Sir, the numerous letters that we wrote to the Ministry of Education, the numerous e-mails 
<br/>that  we  would  send  to  the  senior  staff  including  the  Minister,  there  was  no  response  or 
<br/>acknowledgement, let alone a substantive reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Aww, shameful! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with my close association with the FTUC, we noted 
<br/></span><span>that our application to conduct a peaceful march was denied eight times without any valid reason - a 
<br/></span><span>one sentence.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Secretary of FTUC, Mr. Felix Anthony, was arrested in 
<br/>May 2019 at the Ministry’s Conference Room on level four, right in the presence of the Director 
<br/>International Labour Organization (ILO), the then Minister, honourable Bala…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I was not there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is lying.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>269 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  …  and  other  executives  from  the  workers’  organisations,  who  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gathered there for a good faith meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- After Felix Anthony was arrested, honourable Bala said, “Sorry, it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out of my hands”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- All lies, speak the truth! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tripartite Agreement that was signed in 2016 by 
<br/>the three social partners (the Government, the employers and the unions) to review the labour laws 
<br/>to bring it in conformity with the ILO Convention ratified by Fiji… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It was already ratified . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It is my right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  …was  not  honoured  by  honourable  Bala  and  his  Ministry.    The 
<br/>Coalition Government will ensure that this is done, and we will reclaim our international standing in 
<br/>relation to compliance with ILO Conventions and various recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  also  totally  surprised  when  honourable  Bala  talked  about  the  $4 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>minimum wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it took the FijiFirst Government 16 years to give the people of Fiji the national minimum wage 
<br/>of $4.  The FTUC had been fighting for that way back then in 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Again, it is a lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. C.J. Singh interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I’m not talking to you, this is not your supermarket. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! No running commentary, please, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the minimum wage was  implemented without full 
<br/>participation of the Tripartite partners and without the endorsement of the Tripartite Wages Councils, 
<br/>which has been dysfunctional for the past 10 years.  The Coalition Government will ensure that all 
<br/>the machinery of the Tripartite Forum are brought back to ensure that we give workers, employers 
<br/>and Government equal representation in decision-making for the betterment of all.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>270 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  review  of  the  labour  legislation  which,  again,  is  pending  from  2015 
<br/>when the Tripartite Agreement was signed in Geneva and the second one signed in 2016, which was 
<br/>pending since then (commitment not honoured), now the review has been discussed by ERAB and 
<br/>members of the Board are tirelessly working to ensure we meet our goals and objectives urgently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Essential National Industries List which is in breach of the ILO Guideline, is also now 
<br/>going to be addressed.  My Ministry also acknowledges His Excellency the President for reiterating 
<br/>the importance of our  Vuvale  Partnership with  the Australian Government  in  not only  improving 
<br/>opportunities under the Labour Mobility Programme, but also ensuring the welfare of our workers is 
<br/>protected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, braindrain and lots of skilled labour remains a crucial issue for Fiji.  While 
<br/>labour  mobility  raised  international  issues  which  cannot  be  solved  overnight,  we  need  to  start 
<br/>thinking of other mechanisms to upskill our people to remain in the country.  We will work closely 
<br/>with  other  stakeholders  to  put  in  place  the  necessary  skills  training,  skills  building,  technical 
<br/>vocational training, competency, efficiency and apprenticeship schemes to accomplish that.  Again, 
<br/>you cannot change history. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some 29 Technical Colleges were opened less than a decade ago - about eight to nine years 
<br/>ago and these Colleges were opened for about four to five years.  About $40 million, I believe, had 
<br/>been invested and all those Colleges were closed after that short period.  Now, they are all white 
<br/>elephants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they opened those Technical Colleges, they closed all the technical vocational training 
<br/>centres that were attached to secondary schools all over Fiji.  Subsequently, closing those Technical 
<br/>Colleges meant there were no more technical vocational basic training - gone.  Very smartly, the 
<br/>Technical Colleges were passed onto FNU without the necessary funding, and because the national 
<br/>University was not provided with funding, it was compelled to close and that was exactly what the 
<br/>Director Human Resources of Technical Colleges shared with me because we had 200 members who 
<br/>were laid off straight after that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  We  are  now  exploring  means  of  opening  some  of  those  Technical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Colleges to see that we are able to resume technical vocational training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 16 years of uncertainty over the right to freedom of association, freedom of 
<br/></span><span>speech, right of assembly, right to strike or picket when negotiations with employers fall through, 
<br/>will come to an end when unions, employers and Government come together to discuss and reach 
<br/>solutions amicably.  The harassment and intimidation and arrest of Trade Union leaders, especially 
<br/>when they conduct union activities and highlight grievances facing workers, will now become a thing 
<br/>of the past.  I want to share this as well with this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The President of the FTU was offered a promotion in return for relinquishing his position as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the President of the Union.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- When he refused, he was demoted and transferred to another district.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- … invited the President of the Union to his office and assured him a 
<br/>promotion and that commitment was given in writing by the then Permanent Secretary and that letter 
<br/>is still with my President.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Table it in Parliament!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I will show it to you, honourable Bala.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  will  work  very  closely  with  the  Tripartite  partners  through 
<br/>effective social dialogue and genuine consultation.  The re-establishment of 10 Wages Councils will 
<br/>see  that  workers,  employers  and  Government  are  able  to  come  together  and  determine  a  decent 
<br/>minimum wage for the different sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  When, when? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- You will see soon.  Come to my office and I will tell you.  Come to

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enhanced labour leadership and good governance to build capacity to improve efficiency 
<br/>and accountability; 
<br/>Improve labour market policies and standards to ensure best practices and fair compliance 
<br/></span><span>process; 
<br/></span><span>Promote  and  facilitate  sustainable  employment  to  ensure  effective  and  efficient 
<br/>management employment opportunities; and 
<br/>Strengthen workplace productivity through collaboration, innovation and ICT capabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to effectively administer and enforce the provisions of the 
<br/></span><span>Employment Relations Act 2007, Health and Safety Work Act 1966, National Employment Centre

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>272 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Act 2009, Industrial Associations Act 1941 and all relevant subsidiary legislations for the welfare 
<br/>and prosperity of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  profound  changes  occurring  in  our  communities,  which  I  have  experienced 
<br/>firsthand, and we need to better understand in order to respond to them effectively.  We need to stop 
<br/>for a moment, we need to listen and then we need to move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members would fully agree that our communities are wary of 
<br/>bickering, bullying and grubby tactics.  Those unholy trades have too often been demonstrated in the 
<br/>political landscape across Fiji and continuously made headlines that pollute our society.  It is time to 
<br/>set a better example for our communities, especially for our younger generation that bullying  and 
<br/>aggression are not tools for negotiation.  If we are to become progressive, inclusive and innovative 
<br/>in a fair society, as we say we are, it is now time for us to say ‘no’ to poor conduct, time-wasting in 
<br/>the political realm and that sometimes is also seen in this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us nurture the possibilities of progress instead of being fearful of change and retreating to 
<br/>the safety of our comfort zone.  Let us be innovative and efficient in our processes and culture of 
<br/>work as we ask of our businesses and our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to live by examples.  Most communities understand that there are lots of things a 
<br/>local  MP  cannot  do  alone.    They  also  understand  that  a  concerted  effort  from  them  and  their 
<br/>communities with the support of Members of Parliament and Government can make real headway to 
<br/>achieving their goals.  In order for this new culture of leadership in politics to succeed, we must rise 
<br/>above the corrosive force of working in silos and being territorial.  We should work beyond that.  The 
<br/>last thing our beloved Fiji needs is for our elected representatives to build and camouflage themselves 
<br/>in silos.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lack of political morality results in conflict, wasted effort and stagnation.  We no longer have 
<br/>time on our side, nor endless resources to spend energy in these senseless actions.  Our focus should 
<br/>be to drive forward a united and interconnected community and a State that looks beyond just one 
<br/>issue  of  political  ideology  that  seeks  knowledge,  promotes  creative  thoughts  and  works  to 
<br/>demonstrate  what  can  be  done  instead  of  harping  about  what  cannot  -  that  looks  beyond  which 
<br/>Government is in power and comes together in this Parliament to create the outcomes sought by the 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent Election results determine that we can and must uplift the lives 
<br/></span><span>of ordinary citizens.  This is what drives us as Members of our Coalition Government.  Politics is a 
<br/></span><span>call to duty and leadership.  More importantly, politics must be a call to service and dedication to 
<br/>bettering the lives of all Fijians through deeds, as the new Government is doing, and not mere words.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, I must commend the honourable Prime Minister for his fair and firm leadership 
<br/>and his concept of ‘let love shine.’  This Government will ensure that we work together and strive 
<br/>forward for a common purpose, and that purpose is the best of all things in a prosperous and united 
<br/>Fiji for all Fijians.  As a trade unionist would like to say, Mr. Speaker, united we stand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for tea and when 
<br/>we return, I shall be calling upon the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to take 
<br/>the floor.  Parliament is adjourned.

<br/>He changes times and the seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings; He gives wisdom

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly,  I  warmly  congratulate  you  on  your  appointment  as  Speaker  of 
<br/>Parliament.  I join others in wishing you, Sir, the very best in your role as Speaker.  The people of 
<br/>Lomaiviti are united, particularly the people from Gau Island and Somosomo City, and you have our 
<br/>support and look forward to working with you to lift our beloved Fiji to a higher destiny, to a new 
<br/>plateau of compassion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my journey started at Assemblies of God Primary School and Intermediate 
<br/>School before I moved to Central Fijian School in 1982 (now Sila Central High School).  I would 
<br/>like to acknowledge and pay tribute to Mr. Peni Vunisau Hunt Sila, also known as Misiada Sila, for 
<br/>his foresight and the sole founder of the school back in 1958 to serve the educational needs of the 
<br/>students from Tailevu, Naitasiri and Rewa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He was particularly involved with the banana plantation business at that time when he heard 
<br/>parents,  particularly  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>,  complaining  about  the  problem  of  not  finding  any  school  for  their 
<br/>children  since  established  schools  like  Queen  Victoria  School  (QVS),  Ratu  Kadavulevu  School 
<br/>(RKS),  Adi  Cakobau  School  (ACS),  Lelean  Memorial  School  (LMS)  and  others  were  full.    He 
<br/>decided  to  use  his  personal  savings  from  his  business  to  start  a  new  school  to  accommodate  the 
<br/></span><span>students who had no school available for them at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  used  his  office  in  Nausori  Town  to  be  his  new  school  and  named  it 
<br/>Central Fijian School.  He later requested the Komai Nausori to offer him a piece of land to lease, 
<br/>which enabled the school to be relocated to its present location.  In August 1990, the administration 
<br/>and management of the institution were officially handed over to the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initial school motto reflected the dedication and hard work of its founder, 
<br/></span><span>Turaga  Naita</span><span>  from  Toga,  Rewa  -  “</span><span>Visibility  Through  Excellence”</span><span>  than  “</span><span>Labour  Conquers 
<br/></span><span>Everything”</span><span>,  to  bring  into  focus  that  everything  is  possible  through  perseverance,  dedication, 
<br/></span><span>personal drive and self-determination.  The theme was changed in 1991 to “</span><span>Striving For Excellence”</span><span>, 
<br/>building a culture of excellence and aim at lifting the mediocre and casual attitude in staff to make 
<br/>the school more competitive in whatsoever it undertakes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I vividly recall in 1982 when I enrolled in Form 3. We were assembled near the library and 
<br/>the Principal shouted in a loud voice, “those of you who want to be doctors, engineers, technicians

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>form a line to my right. Come to my left those of you who want to be teachers, civil servants, lawyers 
<br/>and politicians.” I wanted to be a lawyer so I went to the left.  Little did I know that it would turn 
<br/>into a reality when I was admitted to the bar in 1999, sworn in as a Resident Magistrate in 2012 and 
<br/>Attorney-General and Minister for Justice on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022.  I wish to pay tribute to my former 
<br/>principals - Mr. J. Roqica, Mr. Eroni Sauvakacolo, Master Sefa Finau and, of course, all the past 
<br/>teachers of Central Fijian School.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank God for giving me the strength, wisdom, knowledge 
<br/>and understanding. Who would have thought that a son of a Methodist Pastor from Tovulailai, Nairai, 
<br/>Lomaiviti, would be here today to deliver his Maiden Speech in this august Parliament. My hope as 
<br/>a Christian is not fundamentally rooted in men’s goodwill and rationality, but in God alone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank my immediate family - my beautiful wife sitting in the 
<br/>gallery, Mrs. Pamela Elder Turaga; my children - Josevani Bola, Sereima Radinikoroi Turaga and 
<br/>Pamela Turaga, for their unceasing prayers and support.  I also acknowledge my Tata Levu Tamai 
<br/>Lili and Tinai Lili, thank you for your prayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my eldest brother - Tata Levu Waisake Qoli; Tamai Navi in Sydney, Australia; my only 
<br/>sister - Avisaki Bau; Tinai Audrey of Melbourne, Australia; Tamai Johnny - Iliesa Celua and his 
<br/>family  in  Nakasi; Tamai Maciu  in  Nepani  and my late younger  brother  who is  in  heaven, Siveni 
<br/>Bainiua Turaga. My younger brother was laid to rest the day I was sworn in as honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seek your indulgence to speak in my mother tongue.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>275 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[First and foremost, I express utmost appreciation towards my Kubuna e Wai Clan, its 
<br/>Tui Nairai chieftain, my beloved village of Tovulailai, the Ratu and Rokotuibau chieftain, the 
<br/>Matapule and Qalilevu chieftain of Tui Vutuna and the Qalisau chief of the Komai Lawaki 
<br/>chieftain - thank you, indeed, for the prayers and support which enabled the achievement of 
<br/>this  esteemed  position  in  Government.    Also  acknowledged  is  my  extended  families 
<br/>respectfully from the Kaci clan and Lasakau Clans from the village of Vione and Qarani in 
<br/>Gau in Fiji and abroad for the Election preparation and support which thus, enabled me to be 
<br/>where I am today 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gratitude is extended also to the Lomaiviti Province Associations at Nadi, Lautoka, Ba 
<br/>and Rakiraki.  To my PAP Team in Australia, America and the Cook Islands, victory has been 
<br/>attained through your unity and solidarity in unfurling the banner of the Lomaiviti Province 
<br/>in the execution of State duties by the Coalition led by the notable Navatu warrior, Brigadier 
<br/>Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My esteemed gratitude also to my kin from the Yasawa Islands – warm greetings to you 
<br/>my kin.  Thank you very much for the support based on the ancient traditional relationship 
<br/>between Kubuna e Wai  and the Yasawa Islands.  It is sincerely hoped that this traditional 
<br/>relationship is sustained and further strengthened for posterity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With utmost respect to the Takalai Gau Chief, the Ratu chieftain of Naiviqeleqele, the 
<br/>Tui Vanuaso of Turagalewena, and the Toranibau of Batiki, the Ratu of Tui Moturiki, the Tui 
<br/>Levuka of Nabukebuke, the Rokotakala of Nakorovatu, the Tui Wailevu of Wailevu, the Ratu 
<br/>of Bureta, on Koro Islands the envoy of Mudu from Mudu, and Tui Naigani of Cawa.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  express  my  sincere  gratitude  to  my  congregation  -  Naisonisoni  Methodist 
<br/>Church in Waqadra and the Namaka Circuit within the Nadi Division.  Special thanks to the </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>na  i  Vakatawa</span><span>,  Manasa  Ratumuri  and  Jiko  Usumaki  and  their  Radini  and  the  Church  elders.    A 
<br/>special mention of my spiritual mentor, Mr. Taione Koroisavou, and his lovely wife.  I wish to also 
<br/>acknowledge  our  Church’s  former  Minister  at  Namaka  Methodist  Church,  Reverend  Tomasi 
<br/>Daunakamakama, and his family and my current Minister, Reverend Tevita Rokomokosoi Kete.  I 
<br/>also wish to express my gratitude to the present support of the Divisional Church Minister, Reverend 
<br/>Tevita Vuniwaqa.  Last but not least, my Church members of Nasareci Methodist Church and the 
<br/>members of the community at Nepani, Nasinu, for their support and commitment, endless prayers 
<br/>which have given me the strength and determination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the community leaders 
<br/></span><span>who first settled at Nepani Housing Estate in 1975 and the current leaders, who have one way or 
<br/>another have positively influenced my life throughout the years until today, who have moulded the 
<br/>life skill that I have embraced in my life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special thanks to the following people who have been part of the Turaga Team in Lomaiviti 
<br/>- my campaign manager, Manasa Kikau; my PAP Team (Koro), including Eleni Luvunitoga, Koli 
<br/>Daulakeba, Walesio of Nacamaki, Naivaka of Nasau and Tavale Vilimoni of Nasau, Koro.  To my 
<br/>media  officer,  Ratu  Mosese  Mataika,  who  is  seated  at  the  gallery,  I  am  forever  grateful  for  your 
<br/></span><span>dedication and support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  moral  support  from  the  St.  John  extended  families 
<br/>throughout Fiji and abroad, Nairai, Kadavu, Qauia and Lautoka.  I also wish to acknowledge my 
<br/>family from Daku, Vunikavika, Diwana family and from Buca Bay, Tunuloa, Waivure Estate - the 
<br/>Elder family.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>276 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am fortified by the words of Joshua 1:9 which states, and I quote:  “Be 
<br/>strong and courageous, do not be frightened, do not be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you 
<br/>wherever you go.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>II Timothy 1:7 states, and I quote: “For God gave us the spirit not of fear, but of power, love 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and self-control.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deuteronomy 31:6 states, and I quote: “Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dared of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them, for He is the Lord your God who goes with you, He will not leave you or forsake you.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  His  Excellency the  President  for  his  Address  to  Parliament, 
<br/>stressing  on  the  urgency  of  the  need  to  embody  a  collective  spirit  of  resilience  and  dissolve  and 
<br/>respect for every single person in Fiji, as well as the rights of communities in Fiji.  Those are the 
<br/>foundation and pillars of which a strong and prosperous nation is built upon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Martin Luther King Jr. told us something that we need to hear.  He said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today.  We are confronted with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fierce urgency of now, in the s unfolding conundrum of life and history.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Senator Robert F. Kennedy said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes 
<br/>out  against  injustice,  he  sends  forth  a  tiny  ripple  of  hope,  and  crossing  each  other  from  a 
<br/>million different centres of energy and daring those ripples builds a current which can sweep 
<br/>down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from villages, </span><span>tikina</span><span> (Districts), the 14 provinces of Fiji, including Rabi and 
<br/>Kioa and Rotuma, from our towns and cities, our people have caused ripples of change and together, 
<br/>we have swept down the walls of oppression that existed for the past 16 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my role as Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, I am committed to seeing that the 
<br/>dreams of our people realised through the observance and adherence to the rule of law and the chains 
<br/>and shackles of oppression are once and for all broken.  This is a new chapter for Fiji and prioritising 
<br/>the needs of our country is of paramount importance.  It is, therefore, our collective duty to seize 
<br/>every opportunity to progress our nation in the best way possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Justice William Robert Marshall, QCSC, former Resident Justice of Appeal 
<br/>of Fiji, petitioned the former Prime Minister, our current Leader of the Opposition, to address, and I 
<br/>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“… progressive inroads into the independence of the judiciary which process has 
<br/>culminated  since  mid-April  2012,  in  a  judiciary  which  at  all  levels  now  does  what  it 
<br/>perceives is required of it by the Executive.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  he  persuaded  the  former  Prime  Minister  to  change  the  Executive  policy  immediately,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, this was not done, nor was the advice accorded to him heeded.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight two instances that were reported in the Fiji 2020 
<br/>Human Rights Report that were of particular importance to the rule of law by the United States of 
<br/>America.  Firstly, is in relation to my ruling on 15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2020 at the Nadi Magistrates Court which 
<br/>subsequently led to the non-renewal of my contract.  The matter went on appeal the next day to be 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>277 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>called before Justice Perera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  was  shocking  here  was  that,  my  predecessor  conveyed  a  press  conference  in  the 
<br/>morning before the review of my decision was called at around 2.30 p.m., criticising my ruling which, 
<br/>in  my  opinion,  is  a  clear  breach  of  the  separation  of  powers,  the  </span><span>subjudice</span><span>  principle  and  what 
<br/>appeared to be a </span><span>prima facie</span><span> case of contempt of court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The second incident, Mr. Speaker, is the 19th  May, 2020 High Court 
<br/>Ruling made by Justice Temo that dismissed the conviction of civilians caught violating the national 
<br/>curfew which was overturned, and Magistrates were directed not to follow Justice Temo’s Ruling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, fast forward to 2023, Justice Temo is now the current Acting Chief Justice. 
<br/>The Resident Magistrate who lost his job on 10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2020, is standing before you as the Attorney-
<br/>General  and  Minister  for  Justice.  Today  is  the  day  of  restoration.  It  starts  today,  it  will  flow 
<br/>throughout this year because God is with us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Who will be against us?  Let justice flow like a river.  The people of 
<br/>this nation have been praying for the last 16 years - praying for freedom, pray for mercy.  </span><span>Tukuna 
<br/>dua noqu Nana mai</span><span> Somosomo, </span><span>vakawati i</span><span> Nawaikama, Gau, “</span><span>Sa rauta mada na veivakalolomataki, 
<br/>sa  rauta,  keimami  vinakata  na  veisereki.    Sa  rauta  na  veivakaukauwataki,  keimami  vinakata  na 
<br/>galala</span><span>”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[In the words of a maternal aunt from Somosomo and married into Nawaikama Village 
<br/>in Gau, “ Enough with the exploitations, we want freedom! Enough with the enslavement, we 
<br/>want liberty!”]    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians are enjoying today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I received a message an email from an unknown person from Canada 
<br/>of Indian descent, I do not know this person (not an iota) and this is what he said “It is a day of hope, 
<br/></span><span>what  the  Coalition  Government  has  done.”      That  is  the  word  on  the  street,  go  out  and  see  for 
<br/></span><span>yourselves.  I have been stopped here and there with people hugging me - thank you I do not even 
<br/>know them.  There is  finally a new freedom  –  a freedom  that this Coalition  Government  gave to 
<br/>them, that they can now work from 55 to 60 years - work is not limited and your contract is extended 
<br/>until the age of 60. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  a  commitment  of  this  Government  to  ensure  that  locals  who  are  best  positioned  to 
<br/>understand our laws and culture, are trained and recruited into the Judiciary. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>is the policy of localisation.  It is a global practice, and it is not unique to Fiji.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Constitutional Offices Commission under the Government has, for the 
<br/>first  time,  provided  a  transparent  report  of  its  proceedings,  and  this  is  something  that  we  will 
<br/>maintain.  Prior to this unfortunately, the Commission operated on a cloud of secrecy, unknown to 
<br/>the  people  of  Fiji.    The  same  can  also  be  said  for  the  operation  of  the  Prerogative  of  the  Mercy 
<br/>Commission.  This is a clear sign of democracy truly alive in Fiji.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>278 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I add, it is the very first meeting of the COC that resulted 
<br/>in the expulsion of my predecessor who used to stand here, out of this Parliament, because he did not 
<br/>know the law that was actually  drafted.  That  is  untold, unknown for an Attorney-General  not  to 
<br/>know the law they have drafted. What happens when you draft laws without consultation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I impress upon the Members of this Parliament to maintain decorum 
<br/>in the way we conduct ourselves in addressing issues in this Parliament.  May I plead to my fellow 
<br/>honourable Members, we must avoid disgraceful and contemptible conduct, including what we say 
<br/>and above all, we must accord the high level of dignity and respect to another or integrity as Members 
<br/>of this Parliament must never be questioned or compromised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this respect, I salute the steadfastness  of the level of integrity that committed to the rule of 
<br/>law by His Excellency the President, Office of Public Prosecution, Commander of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji  Military  Force,  prior  to  and  after  election.    It  is  a  cardinal  role  of  my  portfolio  as  Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Justice to provide the best legal advice to His excellency the President to 
<br/>maintain and uphold the rule of law, and that is exactly what I did in my first official meeting with 
<br/>His Excellency the President in January this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what will I say, the rule of law is simply that no one is above the law and it 
<br/>must be applied across all arms of Government and the people. During my official visit with Fiji 
<br/>Corrections service last Friday, 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, I impressed upon the management staff of the need to 
<br/>accord respect and dignity amongst the officers and in the treatment of inmates.  This is not only 
<br/>demanded by the Constitution, but its moral obligation towards another fellow human being.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  removal  of  discriminatory  policy  against  women  employees  at  the  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service who were terminated on the grounds of their pregnancies is one of the latest positive changes 
<br/>made.  I am appalled that at this time and age such a policy even existed.  To that end, I will ensure 
<br/>that no policy of that nature will continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Media Industry Development Act 2010 is a highly controversial law and 
<br/>many have questioned how this law came about.  I was informed at a workshop held last Thursday, 
<br/>9</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, that my predecessor summoned journalists and other representatives from media 
<br/>organisations at Holiday Inn and was surprisingly told to submit their comments to the draft Media 
<br/>Industry Development within two hours.  That was the only consultation framework undertaken by 
<br/>the  FijiFirst  Government,  where  a  new  law  with  far  reaching  impact  on  the  media  industry,  was 
<br/>promulgated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is totally unacceptable.  To the media industry, be rest assured, this 
<br/>Government  has  begun  the  work  to  review  the  Media  Industry  Development  Act  2010,  with  the 
<br/>commissioning  of  a  team  of  media  personnel  and  experts.    This  is  to  ensure  that  any  form  of 
<br/>regulations and reflective consultations respect the rights of people, removes any punitive promises 
<br/>against journalists and media personnel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Elections Office (FEO) will also be conducting an internal audit of the 
<br/>Results Management Information System which governed the results process of the 2022 General 
<br/></span><span>Election.  This is to identify the issues surrounding the glitch situation that occurred on Election day 
<br/></span><span>last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The confidence of our people in FEO must be restored, as the FEO is also tasked with the 
<br/>conduct  of  elections  for  some  36  registered  trade  unions  for  this  year  as  well  as  the  conduct  of 
<br/>elections for Local Government.  The respective laws governing this must enable a transparent and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>279 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight the progress made within the Ministry of Justice.  With 
<br/>the digitalisation of records which has been progressed and includes the records of the Office of the 
<br/>Administrator General,  Births,  Deaths  and Marriages, Official Receivers, Registrar of Companies 
<br/>and Registrar of Titles, once this entire process is completed, online service will be expanded across 
<br/>all registries and offices to provide efficient service delivery, and I am committed to see this process 
<br/>through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, it is my prerogative to see 
<br/>that all laws are up-to-date, improved or repealed, if need be.  This includes the Review of the Legal 
<br/>Practitioner Act 2009 to improve the standard of legal practitioners in the country, and to remove the 
<br/>onerous requirement that does not serve any practical purpose - to include the Fiji Law Society, an 
<br/>apex of legal profession in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also the importance of government is the review of the laws that affect the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and particularly the amendments that were brought about by Act No. 22 of 2021, otherwise 
<br/>commonly  known  as  Bill  No.  17.    The  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  will  work  closely  with 
<br/>Government Ministers to have this progressed and to ensure that  the necessary consultations with 
<br/>key stakeholders are carried out.  At this juncture Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to quote the words 
<br/>of Edmund Burke and British political figure in the 18</span><span>th</span><span> Century who said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The great difference between the real leader and the pretender is that the one sees 
<br/>into the future, while the other regards only the present; the one lives by the day and 
<br/>acts upon expediency; the other acts on enduring principles and for the immortality.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am no pretender.  I am deeply humbled and honoured and remain a servant 
<br/>of the people of Fiji.  You my brothers and sisters were called to be free but do not use your freedom 
<br/>to indulge the flesh rather serve one another humbly in love (Galatians 5:13).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I conclude Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> April 1991, I was fortunate to be employed in the 
<br/>Public Service Commission in a department that was headed by the honourable Prime Minister then, 
<br/>Sitiveni  Rabuka.  Today,  I  stand  before  this  august  Parliament  as  his  Attorney-General  (31  years 
<br/>later), I give glory to the Lord.  I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, may God bless this august Parliament 
<br/>and may God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable colleagues; may 
<br/>I begin by congratulating you on your appointment, and I congratulate all Members of these august 
<br/>Chambers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before entering politics, I was and am a trained surgeon in Fiji and New 
<br/>Zealand and worked as a consultant and Associate Professor.  I have been humbled to lead Pacific 
<br/>Surgeons and I am a member of the International Society of Surgery.  I currently engaged in global 
<br/>surgery which is advocating for access to safe and affordable surgery worldwide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health and Medical Services which I used to lead was called the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services with emphasis on services and as part of civil service reforms, our staff 
<br/>were encouraged to focus on customer service experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  achieved  some  of  the  targets  of  the  2022-2030  Sustainable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development Goals. We achieved it at the end of 2022, and I want to share a few with us: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>280 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>By 2030 to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.  
<br/>At the moment in Fiji, it is 34 deaths per 100,000 live births, half even before we have not 
<br/>reached 2030.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Another target is by 2030 - prevent deaths of newborn and children under five years of age.  
<br/>With all countries aiming to reduce neo-natal mortality to as low as 12 per 1,000 live births 
<br/>and under five mortality to as low as 25 per 1000 live births. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, UNICEF in October, published an article that Fiji has achieved 
<br/>the Sustainable Development Goal 2030 target of reaching below 12 deaths per 1,000 live births for 
<br/>neonatal mortality rate and 25 deaths per 1,000 live births for under-five mortality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how was this achieved?  It was achieved because we strengthened maternal 
<br/>child access. We have more specialised Obstetricians and Paediatricians trained locally with Masters.  
<br/>The honourable Minister for Health now has gone through that training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On increasing workforce and positions, importantly, the current Permanent Secretary when 
<br/>he was an Obstetrician, together with his colleagues advocated to stop deliveries in nursing stations 
<br/>and  health  centres  because  there  was  no  expertise  for  high-end  Obstetrics  where  access  may  be 
<br/>limited for emergencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  meant  there  were  higher  volumes  at  Labasa,  Lautoka  and  CWM  Hospital,  thus  the 
<br/>establishment of the Makoi Maternity Hospital and the need for another 200-bed maternity hospital 
<br/>at CWM Hospital for which the first phase is complete. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by my successor, there are more than 7,000 staff in the Ministry of Health and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medical Services with nearly 1,000 doctors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  pursuing  Universal  Health  Coverage,  the  FijiFirst  Government  have  had  some  of  the 
<br/>nursing stations reclassified and changed into health centres with Doctors and Nurse Practitioners in 
<br/>charge such as Dawasamu, Namara, Nabobuco, Nawaicoba and Tau in Nadroga, to name a few. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, we outsource the General Practitioners Subsidy Scheme, Private Dentist Subsidy 
<br/>and Free Medicine Programme, utilising participating retail pharmacies.  These were initiated by the 
<br/>Fiji Government.  Thus, Fijians do not have to congregate in health centres but utilise these healthcare 
<br/>providers in the private sector, increasing accessibility for all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are, however, certain interventions that not all private health providers will offer. One 
<br/>is  birthing  facilities  and  the  provision  of  emergency  caesarean  sections  for  the  care  of  the  sick 
<br/>newborn and the very ill child needing intensive care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ba Hospital, under ASPEN, and Savusavu Hospital are being used by specialists, including 
<br/>the fact that Savusavu Hospital for more than a year has been doing emergency operations in the past 
<br/>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specialists have been travelling throughout the breadth of the country performing clinics, and 
<br/></span><span>outreach teams using the FEMAT umbrella.  We were the nineth country in the world - the first Small 
<br/>Island Developing State to be EMT certified by WHO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our nation, for the past three years, has been fighting a 1 in 100 pandemic. Under 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government, we were decisive, timely and courageous. We vaccinated and contained 
<br/>the pandemic, despite also addressing the other health priorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>281 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, every health system has faced its challenges over the last three years. I met  an 
<br/>African Minister of Health in a WHO meeting and he said, “My brother, in Africa we have COVID, 
<br/>Malaria,  Ebola,  HIV  and  NCDs.”  We  only  have  to  look  at  some  of  the  news  articles  to  see  the 
<br/>challenges the other first world countries have.  Challenges such as spending more than 24 hours in 
<br/>the Emergency Department, or large numbers waiting on the elective waiting list, or the National 
<br/>Health  System  up  in  Britain  where  our  health  system  is  actually  mirrored  around  has  its  own 
<br/>significant challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  post  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  in  the  last  four  years  has  seen  the  completion  of  extensive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>repairs of several and new hospitals: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rakiraki and Ra Sub-Division has seen $2 million invested into it;  
<br/>$2 million to Tavua and Tavua Sub-Division;  
<br/>$2.5 million to Nadi Hospital;  
<br/>$2.5 million to Nabouwalu Hospital;  
<br/>the new $1 million Nasau Health Centre in Ra;  
<br/>the holding beds at Nausori Health Centre and Valelevu Health Centre;  
<br/>the completion of the new Nakasi Hospital;  
<br/>$2  million  for  the  CWM  Emergency  Department,  as  well  as  roadway,  parking  and 
<br/>continuing minor works that happen within the hospital;  
<br/>the new $50 million Ba Hospital now run by ASPEN Medical;  
<br/>the first phase on the new CWM Maternity;  
<br/>the new CWM Administration at Toorak which has now made available the third floor of 
<br/>the Paediatric Hospital to be for children with adolescence care;  
<br/>the new $30 million Navosa Hospital - concrete to what honourable Professor Prasad had 
<br/>said, this hospital is important because our people in the rural areas need access;  
<br/>the new Sawakasa Health Centre;  
<br/>$9 million Rotuma Hospital;  
<br/>$2 million upgrade to OT and X-ray Lautoka Hospital and the minor maintenances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These things have happened, despite healthcare facilities being the epicentre and places for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>super spreader events, the isolations, lockdowns and containments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been lauded for our decisiveness and effectiveness, and I have alluded to that before, 
<br/>in legislative and incentivising measures for our COVID vaccination strategy. So, we quickly reached 
<br/>80 percent fully vaccinated, opening our borders ensuring economic recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government has set aside large sums of financial resources to fight the virus, 
<br/>vaccinate and provide social protection.  In actual fact, upwards of $500 million.  These included 
<br/>also paying for repatriation, isolation facilities for repatriation and positive patients, and also our staff 
<br/>who were contained and isolated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that under the leadership of the honourable Bainimarama, 
<br/>the  FijiFirst  Government  saved  lives  and  saved  livelihoods.    That  was  a  whole  of  government 
<br/>approach and necessary budget appropriations were approved which included reducing capital works 
<br/>to safeguard the salaries of civil servants.  That also included the deferment of the second phase of 
<br/>the CWM 200-bed new maternity hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, health workers attrition was at it greatest before the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/>In fact, the late Dr. Salimoni Tuqa, reviewed and prepared a paper in 2000 which said that between 
<br/>1987 to 1999, 75 percent of doctors left the Civil Service. There was very significant attrition then in 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>282 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in other healthcare workers and nurses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the honourable Bainimarama’s leadership, these measures have been put in place: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase in salaries for all civil servants.  Salaries for technical staff (some of the technical 
<br/>staff in Ministry of Health begin at $28,000 and some of the higher specialists earned more 
<br/>than $140,000 a year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Support to encourage more training, resulting in greater access through FNU, University of 
<br/>Fiji and TISI Sangam up in Vanua Levu.  We have two medical and nursing schools and 
<br/>upward recruitment of 100 doctors and 200 nurses per year.  In the current budget, there 
<br/>are places for 300 nurses through Toppers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  has  been  support  internally  through  Government  scholarship  and  via  multilateral 
<br/>partners for post-graduate training.  We have doctors trained here like I, with the Masters, 
<br/>and going across overseas.  We have nurses also pursuing Masters in Australia.  We have 
<br/>oral surgeons train locally here at FNU and since the establishment of the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and  Medical  Services,  we  now  have  more  than  700,  and  the  establishment  within  the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services is now more than 7,000 staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, COVID-19 stretched healthcare workers to the limit, we acknowledge that, and with the 
<br/>existing challenges, some of them had burnt out and experienced mental challenges.  There has been 
<br/>an estimated shortfall of 10 million healthcare workers worldwide by 2030, predominantly in low 
<br/>and middle-income countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is no secret that despite our best intentions, attritions will continue.  The 2020 State of the 
<br/>World’s Nursing Report found that we would need 6 million more nurses by 2030 to reach global 
<br/>health  targets.    Shortages  of  healthcare  workers  are  felt  most  acutely  in  low  and  middle  income 
<br/>countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New Zealand has even made it more conducive for migrant healthcare workers and despite 
<br/>our Civil Service salary bill, at the moment, been $1.1billion, the Fiji Government must build on the 
<br/>work already done by the FijiFirst Government, not only to retain but more importantly recruit new 
<br/>staff.  I have heard some parents of healthcare workers said that posting and recruitment is facing 
<br/>hiccups because of the sudden policy changes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the new Fijian Government to take a cue from the FijiFirst Government’s initiative to 
<br/>improve the working conditions,  salaries and benefits  of Ministry of Health and Medical  Service 
<br/>workers.  Under the FijiFirst Government leadership, our civil servants have had increases in salaries 
<br/>and whilst under the health and economic downturn by COVID-19 and contrary to what politicians 
<br/>(some of them on the other side Parliament) have recommended, honourable Bainimarama as Prime 
<br/>Minister did not allow any pay cut to any civil servant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Your Government’s mission, as His Excellency had said, 
<br/></span><span>is to build unity through social cohesion and further improve and strengthen our economy through 
<br/>sustainable growth with the ultimate objective of improving the lives of all the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  fast  economic  recovery  post  COVID-19  is  now  facing  a  subdued  velocity.    The 
<br/></span><span>differences in policies that we see with honourable Ministers is sowing mistrust and uncertainty in 
<br/></span><span>our economy.  The vendetta and deviation from the Constitution is something that our multilateral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>283 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partners will watch with interest.  We will all have to follow the law and that begins with following 
<br/>the Constitution.  As leaders, as Ministers and Assistant Ministers, you must initiate confidence in 
<br/>Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency also said that the Government must continue to adhere to 
<br/>the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers as a cornerstone of our democracy, and the 
<br/>necessity for public servants to perform their duties independently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  we  have  also  seen  over  the  last  50  days  the  appointment  of  failed  candidates  of  the 
<br/>Coalition without due diligence.  Application for Board memberships closed on 31</span><span>st</span><span> January, but 
<br/>appointments were made prior to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Fijian Government has not followed Section 123 of the Constitution in this Civil 
<br/>Service  and  civil  servant  appointments,  promotions  and  removal.    This  is  a  direct  breach  of  the 
<br/>Constitution.  We feel for the career civil servants that we have been working with over the last few 
<br/>years, that may be also limited in advancing their careers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the Coalition Government to adhere to the constitutional requirements for appointments 
<br/>in  the  Civil  Service  and  reassure  our  civil  servants  that  their  hard  work  and  competency  will  be 
<br/>recognised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also been informed by civil servants, in particular some senior ones that they are 
<br/>being watched, their phones are being tapped and they are being monitored. This is not how to run a 
<br/>modern-day Government, Sir. This Government should get on with the governing of the country, as 
<br/>supposed  to  feeling  insecure  and  watching  over  their  shoulders.    please,  be  confident  with  your 
<br/>policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, His Excellency also said that on the pressuring issues facing the nation, particularly on 
<br/>the  economy,  Government  must  recognise  that  the  private  sector  is  a  critical  driver  of  economic 
<br/>growth. They need freedom and flexibility to pursue their aims, but they must operate within the law 
<br/>and respect the environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have also seen over the last 50 days how the Fiji Government has interfered 
<br/>with the private sector. By asking to keep employees when the company is becoming insolvent, to 
<br/>taking back employees when the Judiciary has already made a judgment or otherwise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also seen how the Director Environment was under siege by a private company.  Sir, 
<br/></span><span>the private sector is not limited to big multinational companies but more importantly, to the small 
<br/>and medium enterprise, which is a large employer and a major drive of our economy.  They all must 
<br/>be protected but must know that every business will be treated equally under the rule of law. They 
<br/>must be stimulated, but under the rule of law.  They can operate but must operate under the rule of 
<br/>law.  They can operate, but not damage our environment under the rule of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I raise my concerns and reservations to the establishment of the Great Council 
<br/>of Chiefs (GCC).  I know that my honourable colleague also raised it when he spoke yesterday, and 
<br/></span><span>I must admit and was wondering whether it is because he is from Navosa and my mother is from 
<br/></span><span>Navosa but I think that is nothing to do with that. The rights and privileges of the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, Sir, is 
<br/>vested in the 2013 Constitution.  Never before has our land as </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>have been more secure than 
<br/>with the 2013 Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, even without the GCC, your position and role as our high chief in Tovata has 
<br/>remained and may I also say, even more solidified.  The institutions – the Ministry of iTaukei, the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provincial Offices; the Provincial, </span><span>Tikina</span><span> and Village meetings; the Native Lands Commission; the 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs Board, to name a few, provide the many platforms to champion our course.  In my 
<br/>many discussions, our common grassroots people’s priority is work, education, health services, jobs 
<br/>and the enhancement of our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>values.  These are being met by the current reforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Chamber holds people who are chosen and voted by the people to represent 
<br/>them. Even in the United Kingdom, they have had modernisation in their House of Lords.  No longer 
<br/>only filled with Hereditary Peers, but now have appointed Lords, people who are reputable, learned 
<br/>and representative of them as a modern nation, its people, and its diversity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  honourable  Aliki  Bia  and  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma’s  emotional  speech  yesterday 
<br/>reminds us that Fiji is truly a multicultural and multi-ethnic country where some can easily be pushed 
<br/>to the margins and forgotten even when they cannot claim to be a Fijian. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our roles whether in Government or in Opposition is to encourage your youth 
<br/>to be better than all of us.  We need to continue the inclusiveness and we must embrace and respect 
<br/>the different ethnicities, religion, and beliefs that our visionary former Prime Minister and visionary 
<br/>leader  of  FijiFirst  begun.    Our  children  must  be  taught  not  to  discriminate.  We,  therefore,  must 
<br/>continue to cultivate this inclusiveness so that our modern Fiji is really the way we should be.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bainimarama as Prime Minister last year, I invited him as then Co-Chair of the 
<br/>Early Childhood Development of the Pacific to open and declare our website open.  Sir, racial rhetoric 
<br/>and vitriol cannot go unchallenged.  It seems that a vendetta rather than a true desire to govern has 
<br/>been the focus. We must show our children that we are true leaders.  Every child as our successor 
<br/>should never feel alienated.  Fiji is for all its citizens and its citizens under the 2013 Constitution are 
<br/>called Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Christian, I would like to comment also on the debate and the desire of the Coalition 
<br/>Government  to  remove  secular  State  from  our  Constitution.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many  are  non-
<br/>Christians in this country, and I know you and I, on are few workshops when you were a Member of 
<br/>the Opposition, we have had discussions on this.  Many showed compassion, love, respect and other 
<br/>Christian values more than we Christians.  Just like you, Sir, I would love to have them join my faith, 
<br/>but this should not be forced down their throats.  If any, let our actions be the greatest witness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Matthew 5:16 states and I quote: “Your light must shine before people in such a way that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to at this juncture thank my family, my beautiful wife, Miriama, my 
<br/>brother Vili, Rokoseni, Adi Maibole and Paula, Jaoji and my children, Roko Tukana and Marica, 
<br/>Talei  and  Sukani,  Rajieli,  Bainivalu,  Cherriane  who  is  at  home  with  us  and  my  granddaughter, 
<br/>Miriama.  I also would like to thank my supporters in Moala, Navosa, Tailevu, where my mother’s 
<br/>heritage also comes from, my in-laws of Naitasiri and also my fitness group, we play touch rugby 
<br/>with every lunch hour, I would like to name are few, Pete, Biss, Dels - I would like to thank them for 
<br/>their support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  conclude  this  morning  and  as  an  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  hailing  from  Lau  and  my 
<br/></span><span>mother from Viti Levu, so I qualify to be able to talk as an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, and as a Christian, I urge all of
