<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.1 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the matter of the allegation under Standing Order 62(3), the Committee voted and 
<br/></span><span>found  the  Hon.  Josaia  Bainimarama  in  breach.  Consequently  the  Committee 
<br/></span><span>deliberated  where  the  majority  surmised  that  the  penalty  be  24  months,  while  the 
<br/>minority  surmised  that  an  apology  would  suffice,  but  because  Hon.  Josaia 
<br/>Bainimarama was cooperative in his testimony, the Committee voted and imposed a 
<br/>penalty of 18 months (reduced by six months, Mr. Speaker, Sir) with an apology to 
<br/>His Excellency the President and to the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the matter of the allegation under Standing Order 62(4), the Committee voted and 
<br/>found  the  Hon.  Josaia  Bainimarama  in  breach  specifically  of  Standing  Order 
<br/></span><span>62(4)(c).  Consequently the Committee deliberated where the majority surmised that 
<br/></span><span>the penalty be 24 months, while the minority surmised that an apology would suffice, 
<br/>but  because  the  Hon.  Josaia  Bainimarama  was  cooperative  in  his  testimony  the 
<br/>Committee voted and imposed a penalty of 18 months (reduced Mr. Speaker, Sir, by 
<br/>six months) with an apology to His Excellency the President and to the public.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Committee, I share these findings to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>350 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members and to the public that consideration had already been given and the  penalty 
<br/>reduced by 12 months.  It could have been four years, which meant the rest of the session but it was 
<br/>reduced to three years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, in consideration of the honourable Prime Minister’s appeal, Mr. Speaker, as Leader 
<br/>of the Government in Parliament whom we, on this side of Parliament, have absolute loyalty to as 
<br/>our leader, has displayed the passion and humility as stated by honourable Professor Prasad, under 
<br/>Standing Orders 104 and 105, I wish to move an amendment to the Motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it requires under Standing Order 105 that the mover of the amendment must put 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it in writing and pass it to the Speaker.  That has been done and you have that before you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that the amendment be made to the motion as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama  be  suspended  for  18  months,  effective 
<br/>immediately to be served until 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024; 
<br/>Honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama issue a written apology to His Excellency the 
<br/>President within 14 days from today, 17th February, 2023; 
<br/>Honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama issues an apology to the public within 48 hours 
<br/>from today, 17th February, 2023; 
<br/>During the period of suspension, honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama is not allowed 
<br/>to enter the Parliament precincts; and 
<br/>If the honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama fails to apologise as outlined in (2) and (3) 
<br/>above, that the penalties be served consecutively for a total of three years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the motion before Parliament, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  actually  request  from  the  Opposition 
<br/>Chambers if we can get 10 minutes break, we would like to deliberate on the amendment and come 
<br/>back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this is the problem when one sits in this Chair.  The 
<br/></span><span>rule in the House of Commons is that, you have to always lend your ears quite a lot to the lesser and 
<br/></span><span>smaller parties, but I have been hearing they are the biggest party in Parliament, but this side is the 
<br/>Government. So, as such, I am always obliged to try and listen to what they want to bring up.  All 
<br/>they are asking for is another 10 minutes extra. Do you agree to that, honourable Members?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- 10 minutes is fine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- And if you put  that forward, honourable Leader of Government, all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition is asking is another 10 minutes so they can have some discussion on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, we do not object to that, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members, we will adjourn for 10 minutes and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hope you return. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 9.25 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 10.00 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I am just trying to sort out the papers in front of me.  
<br/>Before we took the break on the request of the Opposition, we were on the verge of that amendment 
<br/>to the recommendation.  Based on that amendment, the honourable Members of the Opposition have 
<br/>also had a chat with me and they would also like to add on to the debate by saying a few words based 
<br/>on the amendments you have raised, honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament.  I feel that 
<br/>it is only proper that we listen to them.  If we can agree immediately after that on the continuation 
<br/>and see how best we can resolve all these and come to a better amicable solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note honourable Members of the Opposition, there are seven of you on the list that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in front of me that would like to speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Members, this is not easy.  As I have stated, the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has to lend his ears as well, not only to one side but both sides of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Respect the good faith, do not play around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk to this 
<br/>particular  motion.    We  appreciate  the  suggestions  that  have  been  made  by  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister and the amended motion.  We would like to share some thoughts on the matter at hand and 
<br/>the way that we have seen this particular situation play out, which I think is important to take into 
<br/>consideration as we consider the revised recommendations that have been made by the Committee.  
<br/>A number of things that I would like to point out to the Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You never gave us a chance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- In relation to parts of the Standing Orders that were quoted – Standing 
<br/>Order 62(3) and (4), if I was to read from the Standing Orders, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which talks about 
<br/>Prohibited References.  In Standing Order 62(3) it states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  conduct  of  members,  the  President,  the  Chief  Justice  (performing  the 
<br/>functions of the office of President under section 88 of the Constitution), members of the 
<br/>judiciary, or other persons acting in a judicial capacity must not be raised, except on a 
<br/></span><span>motion  with  notice  introduced  with  the  Speaker’s  permission.  In  any  other  situation, 
<br/></span><span>reference to the conduct of any of these individuals is out of order.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It talks about the perceived offence and it is saying that if anyone goes against or commits 
<br/>this, it is out of order, which in my reading means that if someone does something in Parliament that 
<br/>you believe contravenes this particular provision of the Standing Orders, if it is deemed to be out of 
<br/>order, the statement must be made in Parliament that, that is out of order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go back a few years, every time that we have His Excellency’s addressing Parliament 
<br/></span><span>(there have been a lot of times),  the honourable Tikoduadua also admitted during our meeting that 
<br/></span><span>other Members, including himself (hope you will agree with that) that when His Excellency has made 
<br/>the statement, there have been Members of the Opposition who have gone against it.  We have even 
<br/>had to some extent where Members of the Opposition have said, “His Excellency’s Address is like 
<br/>he is still campaigning for FijiFirst.”  The same kind of statement that was made here that denigrated 
<br/>the Office of the President at that particular point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>352 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In those instances, we stood up when it was stated and we made a Point of Order because that 
<br/>is the way it is reflected in the Standing Orders.  If something it is out of order, then we raise a Point 
<br/>of Order so it is dealt with immediately at that  particular point in time.  That is the thing that has 
<br/>been brought up here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second part here is talking about and I quote Standing Oder 63(4): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “It is out of order for a member, when speaking, to use –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offensive words against Parliament or another member; 
<br/>treasonable words; 
<br/>seditious words…”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Seditious words are what they are talking about here. The first point that I want to make there 
<br/>for that particular point too, if there is an offence, the Point of Order is raised in Parliament, and it is 
<br/>dealt with at that particular point in time. That did not take place… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- …on this particular occasion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It talks about seditious words - seditious.  The definition is to incite or cause people to rebel 
<br/>against the authority of a state or monarch.    If you are to read every single word that the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition stated in his statement, nowhere in his statement does he tell anyone to 
<br/>rebel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.- You are just trying to be a smart Alec.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Let me read that again for the honourable Member who is listening 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from afar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is the definition of seditious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You should be embarrassed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Inciting  or  causing  people  to  rebel  against  authority  of  a  state  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monarch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are trying to be a smart Alec.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is the definition of seditious.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame on all of you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Maybe I should read it again.  Inciting or causing people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to rebel against authority of the State or Monarch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are a mockery of this Parliament.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Nowhere in this transcript because we were not given the opportunity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to fully vent and aerate the things that we wanted to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Nowhere in the transcript did he tell them to go and do anything that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was seditious.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  It  was  imputed  and  those  were  the  words  of  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Complainant himself. Nowhere! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- No merit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The statement that they have tried to talk about was the statement that 
<br/>was made on page 35 of the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>in which the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, 
<br/>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to inform the rank and file of the RFMF 
<br/>that all the philosophical commitment and years of hard work of the RFMF is now being 
<br/>undermined and disregarded by this Government.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He said, “I have to inform”, he did not tell them to take any action.  He said, “I have to inform” and 
<br/>in the latter part of that same paragraph, at the end, he states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I appeal to the rank and file of the RFMF to preserve their manna, to maintain their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>credibility and calling, and not forsake their constitutional role.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their constitutional role is not about taking over Government.  Read the Constitution, Section 131(2), 
<br/>what does it say?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that constitutional role is about the RFMF ensuring all the time the security 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Nowhere in that Constitution does it say that the Army takes over.  If 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you go into the earlier parts of the Constitution…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please, just confine yourself to the  amendment.  The 
<br/>amendment is the point that I am allowing the Members of the Opposition to say what you want to 
<br/>say on the amendment. I hope you will not take us back to where we left off before the Committee 
<br/></span><span>came down with the recommendations.  So, all I am asking is, please, stick to the amendment.  That 
<br/></span><span>is the agreed point where we are going to begin from and we allow you to say, based on what is there.  
<br/>Otherwise, you are going back to the very beginning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>354 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we were not really given an opportunity to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aerate the way that we saw what had happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  We are asking someone to  give an apology  when he did  not incite 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He did not incite anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate is behaving like a smart 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alec, unfortunately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Point  of  Order  on  your  Point  of  Order,  that  is  unparliamentary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>language.  Withdraw your statement, withdraw it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are not the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is unparliamentary language.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We still have him on the floor, could we listen to honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are absolutely right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Point of Order is very clear.  You had the opportunity to 
<br/>speak on the original motion, but you did not.  Mr. Speaker allowed an amendment motion which is 
<br/>before Parliament and now you are going back to the original motion, instead of talking about the 
<br/></span><span>amended motion.  You are now abusing Parliament’s time by going back to the discussions that has 
<br/></span><span>already taken place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what we have been saying all along.  This is total disrespect to the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister of the country who has made the suggestion.  Talk about the amendment, 
<br/>whether you accept the amendment or not, we have had the debate on the original motion.  That is 
<br/>over!  Your debate and contribution now should be on the amended motion, whether you accept the 
<br/>18 months and the apology or not, and what is the reason for that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Can you confine yourself to what I have stated, honourable Usamate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to correct the assertions that have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been made by honourable Professor Prasad.  If you look at Standing Order 104(3): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="99">Page 99</a></div>
<div><span>355 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“An  amendment  to  a  question  is  put  before  the  original  question  is  put  and  an 
<br/>amendment to a proposed amendment is considered as if the proposed amendment were 
<br/>an original motion.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that is the case, this is now an original motion, that gives us leeway to talk about the facts 
<br/>pertaining to the original motion.  That is the point, and that is why I have been raising what I have 
<br/>been saying from the Standing Orders.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I do not want us to play around with English.  The 
<br/>amended motion is the one that I agreed that we could speak on and please just confine yourself to 
<br/>the amended one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amended  motion  basically  gives  a  sanction 
<br/>reduced to 18 months provided that the Leader of the Opposition apologises to the public, apologises 
<br/>to  His  Excellency  and  if  he  does  not  apologise  then  the  three  years  comes  into  play  and  that  is 
<br/>precisely why I am stating what I am stating.  You only apologise if you know that you have done 
<br/>something wrong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And as I have pointed out here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why I was talking about what I talked 
<br/>about.  You require him to apologise, you cannot apologise if there was no call for sedition taking 
<br/>place.  If that did not take place and how can there be an apology.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It carries no weight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why I am talking the way that I am talking… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is why you lost, very embarrassing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am not embarrassed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am standing here, I am not embarrassed.  My emotions are mine, I 
<br/>know my emotions.  You do not know my emotions.  So, you cannot tell me what my emotions are… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Embarrassment is an emotion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Address the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He is talking to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Do I still have the floor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Go.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>356 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was trying to elucidate, that is why I was making 
<br/>that statement.  You cannot apologise if you have not done anything wrong.  All the accusations have 
<br/>been imputed, there has been no explicit statement inciting anyone.  So, if that is the case how can 
<br/>you apologise for something that you have not done.  You apologise for what you have done, you 
<br/>apologise for what you have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  all  the  cases  that  have  been  brought  here  about  the  cases  that  went  to  the  Privileges 
<br/>Committee, explicit words were spoken and heard and recorded.  In this case there are no explicit 
<br/>statements.  It is inferred from things that are taken from here and there and from there one tries to 
<br/>build up a case of what was meant but those are imputations, they are all inferences, there is nothing 
<br/>explicit that says that there was any seditious talk or trying to belittle the behaviour of His Excellency 
<br/>the President. That is my point.  Thank you very much for the opportunity to address this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are trying to interpret English. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have honourable Bala and honourable Members, the rest of the list is here 
<br/>but I will only accept the first seven that have come before me after my discussions.  So, we will take 
<br/>the seven.  Honourable Usamate has spoken, now it is honourable Bala.  You have the floor, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for the consideration 
<br/>on the motion which is now in the amendment form.  At the outset, Sir, I oppose the amendment 
<br/>motion that is before us and I will give the reason.  Instead of saying, “thank you” to the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition for leading our beloved nation for eight years… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…  it  was  the  greatest  privilege  for  all  the  Fijians  but  the  Leader  of  the  Government  in  
<br/>Parliament has come up with an amendment motion which is no different from the original motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Read it properly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been  noted that the Minister for Home Affairs 
<br/>saying, that the words used by the honourable Leader of the Opposition are matters which are out of 
<br/>order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  ask  the  honourable  Minister  and  President  of  the  National 
<br/></span><span>Federation Party, why did they not raise any Point of Order which is provided under the Standing 
<br/></span><span>Orders … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Read your Standing Orders. It is not required.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- …for the honourable Leader of Opposition to withdraw the comment if 
<br/>it was out of order but at that time there was none?  I also wish to ask, where is this freedom of speech 
<br/>that we are talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So you are talking about freedom of speech now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Is this the change that we were looking for, for the freedom of speech or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is because of one man’s opinion that it became a breach? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition spoke on the role of His Excellency 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the President and the RFMF which is stated in the 2013 Constitution. We are not kids.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- He never ever said in this Parliament that he was asking the RFMF to go 
<br/>and take over the Government, he never said that.  Where are you people coming from?  Is this a 
<br/>politics of revenge?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The report is already there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  whatever  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition 
<br/>stated in this Parliament were the concerns of the thousands of people that he brought and he spoke 
<br/>about.  Let us not forget when His Excellency the President addressed this Parliament, there was one 
<br/>week break and in that break there were thousands of our supporters who were not happy with the 
<br/>way it was stated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am  putting  it to  you because a lot of people are telling us they were not  happy with the 
<br/>address and that is exactly what the honourable Leader of Opposition has said.  He has brought in 
<br/>the concerns of the public and people because this is the peoples Parliament.  Understand that you 
<br/>are a lawyer you should know better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Where is your evidence?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bala, I will ask again, please, confine yourself to the amended 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering all those things, we, therefore, do not agree 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that there has been any breach of the promise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation made by the Leader of Parliament looks like it is based 
<br/>on,  as  I  have  stated,  politics  of  revenge  when  it  should  have  been  a  balanced  one  given  the 
<br/>circumstances.  I would ask the honourable Members from that side to exercise a degree of common 
<br/>sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.N. KAMIKAMICA.- And you don’t have any? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  If you people really respect  your leader who is the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister, you will oppose this amended motion that is before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Before I offer the floor to  honourable  Dr.  Waqainabete, I would like to 
<br/>remind us once more. At this juncture, we have reached it through the intervention of both sides from 
<br/>the original recommendations after hearing the interventions from both sides that has come as a result 
<br/>of that the amended recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the amended recommendations have been put, you had also asked that you be given a 
<br/>chance to speak on the amended motion and that is exactly what Parliament is doing.  So, honourable 
<br/>Dr. Waqainabete, I hope you will confine yourself to what is before us now - the amended motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- I thank you for giving me an opportunity.  I will keep it 
<br/>very short, Sir.  If you look at section 66 of the 2009 Crimes Act which talks on sedition, a “seditious 
<br/>intention” is an intention –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the Government of the 
<br/>Republic of Fijians by law established; or

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  excite  inhabitants  of  Fiji  to  attempt  to  procure  alteration;  otherwise  than  by  lawful 
<br/>means, of any matter in Fiji as by law established; or   
<br/>to bring into hatred or contempt to excite disaffection against the administration of justice 
<br/>in Fiji; or 
<br/>to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the inhabitants of Fiji; or 
<br/>to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population of 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And then it says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But an act, speech publication is not seditious by reason only that intends –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>b) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>c) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to show that the Government of the Republic of Fiji has been misled or mistaken in 
<br/>any of its measures; or  
<br/>to point out errors or defects in the Government or Constitution of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>as by law established or in legislation or in the administration of justice with the view 
<br/>to remedying of such errors or defects; or 
<br/>to persuade the inhabitants of Fiji to procure by lawful means the alterations of any 
<br/>matter in Fiji as by law established; or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then it has got another (d) then it goes on to (2). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition was commenting in response to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the speech by His Excellency the President.  He was commenting because as we all know that the 
<br/>speech of the President is made by the Government, so that is the speech of the Government of the 
<br/>day - the Coalition Government and he was responding to the speech of the President and addressing 
<br/>the Constitutional roles.  That is what he has done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- If he was here, he would have explained it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me finish.  You have had your time, 
<br/>honourable Tikoduadua.  Addressing the constitutional role in this, that you have been given today 
<br/>to look at the report, there is no verbatim.  We do not look at the verbatim of the report, it is not the 
<br/>verbatim.  Normally speaking when we have had this in the past, the verbatim actually comes also, 
<br/></span><span>so we would be able to see the words that have been expressed by the complainant and also by those 
<br/></span><span>who are being complained against in the Privilege Committee.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those short 
<br/>comments, I do not support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the debate was on the President’s Address.  It was 
<br/>not another day where he mentioned about the President, it was about the speech, and I do not support 
<br/>the motion before Parliament simply because the Leader of the Opposition has done nothing wrong.  
<br/>He  commented  on  the  speech  and  previously  even  last  year,  the  Opposition  Members  showed 
<br/>disrespect to the President. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Left, right, centre… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We did not refer this matter to the Privileges Committee, we did not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do that because there was no need to refer that to the Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- There is a difference…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to raise another point.  There are people who 
<br/>have raised or showed disrespect inside and outside Parliament.  With due respect to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, he also called for military intervention during election time.  That also created fear 
<br/>in people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That is not the issue… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- But what I am trying to say, this report which is before us, the reality 
<br/>is  the  Standing  Committee  report  that  comes  to  Parliament  is  far  superior  than  this  report  that  is 
<br/>presented to us.  It does not have all the information where we can make an informed decision.  You 
<br/>cannot make an informed decision.  There should be questions asked, responses given so  that we 
<br/>can read all that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is shorter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, it is not about being shorter, it is about presenting a proper report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So the quality of the report is not good, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And no one can make an informed decision and, therefore, I do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  surprised  that  this  motion  has  been  brought 
<br/>before this Parliament at a much faster rate at which we used to bring Bills under Standing Order 51 
<br/>– interesting!   Even faster than that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  oppose  the  amendment  by  the  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Government in Parliament because it reflects injustice, revenge and vengeance. What our leader was 
<br/>basically doing …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you ask outside? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- But the amendment did not come as we expected.  So, what the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  was  doing  was  basically  responding  to  the  Address  by  His 
<br/>Excellency the President. We, as Members of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, are covered under Parliament 
<br/>privilege. By removing the honourable Leader of the Opposition, we are removing the voice of 29.08

<br/>votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Sir,  136,829  Fijians  voted  for  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- In past, Mr. Speaker, there were many instances as elaborated by 
<br/>my fellow colleagues, the Opposition then had objected to the Presidential Address.  They opposed 
<br/>and voted against the Address. Most of the words were uttered against the Presidential Address which 
<br/>was  demeaning  to  the  President,  but  no  one  was  taken  to  the  Privileges  Committee.  That  is  why 
<br/>Members are covered under the parliamentary privilege.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I was part of one the Privileges Committee. Yes, we do understand, your case 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>came, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do understand, Sir, the honourable Draunidalo’s case came, the honourable Tikoca’s case 
<br/>came but when we were in the Standing Order, we set a precedence. We thought the penalties that 
<br/>were actually given to the honourable Members was too harsh.  We gave an option, either to apologise 
<br/>or  be  removed  from  Parliament.  As  honourable  Members,  they  were  given  an  option  if  they 
<br/>apologised, they did not have to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- This was brought to us and we actually adhered to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is a lie.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We were trying to amend at that point in time the differences that 
<br/>were  there  between  the  Government  and  Opposition.  Now,  we  are  going  back  to  the  same  place 
<br/>where we actually started and the precedence was set against your case, Sir.  This is not on, this is 
<br/>not right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, I was asked to do both.  Apologise in the newspaper, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>apologise to the former Speaker and then I went out for two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And the lesson learnt from all those, Mr. Speaker, by the time we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actually came….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I have a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Where is he? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, throughout this week we have been hearing of respect, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>preaching from the Bible and here we see hatred… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- …for the person who has done so much for the nation, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>one person who stood for every Fijian.  We all know that from day one, FijiFirst was up against all 
<br/>other parties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  And the main objective was just to  remove  FijiFirst  Party from 
<br/>Government and now is about removing the honourable Leader of the Opposition from Parliament. 
<br/>The person who had a vision for Fiji, a person who stood by his principle, a person under whose 
<br/>leadership thousands of Fijian students are educated today, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is not on if we are actually going to remove him like this.  The 
<br/>person who even respected the current Prime Minister and ensured that the immunity clause in 1997 
<br/>Constitution was part of the 2013 Constitution. I would like to ask honourable Prime Minister, is this 
<br/>the gift you want to give to the person who ensured that you are always protected for what transpired 
<br/>in 1987? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, as I have stated before and this will be the second 
<br/>time that I am stating it, this has come about after interventions from both sides, and has resulted in 
<br/>the amendment of the original recommendations.  Based on that, I have allowed that you be given 
<br/>time to speak on the amended motion.  Can we just confine ourselves to that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I have a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I think honourable Maharaj just lied in Parliament.  He ought 
<br/>to apologise to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to Parliament because he said  that when he was in the 
<br/>Privileges Committee, when his Party was looking at the privilege issue, they were asking those three 
<br/>honourable  Members  who  were  suspended  to  apologise  and  if  they  did  not,  they  would  not  be 
<br/>suspended.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a lie, because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you, yourself apologised and you were suspended.  
<br/>This bunch used to lie outside of Parliament, inside Parliament and now they are lying in Opposition 
<br/>as they were lying in Government.  He should be asked to apologise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Professor Prasad.  Carry on, honourable Maharaj.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>362 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, I think we need to improve 
<br/>the quality of the volume the other side, because honourable Professor Prasad is in Nadi I believe, so 
<br/>he was not able to hear properly.  I did not actually say what he just uttered, he can actually read that 
<br/>from the Verbatim Report.  Finally, I oppose the amended motion by Leader of the Government in 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I am the last speaker, let me just put a few things 
<br/>into perspective.  The motion that was before the floor was amended after an offer was made by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  The reason why everyone did not speak is because the perception this 
<br/>side …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you come again, honourable Koya?  I did not hear you quite right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why not everyone spoke from this particular 
<br/>side  when  the  first  motion  was  on  the  floor,  was  because  the  offer  and  the  speech  given  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister was interpreted a particular way.  This is why honourable Seruiratu had 
<br/>asked if we could ask you, Sir, to ask the matter to go back to the Committee for re-recommendations, 
<br/>to fit what was our perception of what the honourable Prime Minister said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What came back from honourable Tabuya was not that which was perceived.  This is why a 
<br/>request  was  made  that  if  there  is  an  amendment  because  of  that  particular  amendment,  that 
<br/>amendment was not aligned with our thoughts because in terms of sanctions, what our interpretation 
<br/>at that time was that the honourable Prime Minister had spoken about forgiveness and also apologies.  
<br/>He had not mentioned the word of being taken out of Parliament for a particular length of time.  I 
<br/>can be corrected by you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but that was what he interpreted.  That is the reason why 
<br/>not everyone spoke.  We have a very loyal bunch of people on this side of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not a laughing matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is actually quite offensive in light of the fact that…. 
<br/>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite embarrassing that I am talking about loyalty, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when honourable Tabuya spoke about loyalty to her leader, please respect that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Expeditiously  and  quickly  finishing  something  off  is  not  justice,  Sir.  
<br/>Everyone has a right to be heard.  We have got plenty of lawyers on the other side, everyone has a 
<br/></span><span>right to be heard.  People on this side of Parliament want to defend their leader just as you do your 
<br/></span><span>leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all that was asked and that is why honourable Usamate pointed out 
<br/>that within the provisions of the Standing Orders when you amend the Orders, it is to be treated as 
<br/>an original motion.  Having said all that, I think everyone has a bit of a say.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have a few things just raise before you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to the floor and to the general 
<br/>public so that they do know, bearing in mind that there is a dissenting opinion in the Report on the 
<br/>floor but not all of the records are on the floor. The Verbatim Report is not on the floor and the reason 
<br/>why we did not sign it and we objected to it because our opinion was that the whole matter, the whole 
<br/>file,  Verbatim  Report,  et  cetera,  needs  to  come  to  the  floor.  Why?    Because  the  ultimate  arbiter, 
<br/>ultimate judge of all of these is this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee comes with a recommendation.  
<br/>The recommendation came three for and two against. So, all of these needed to be on everyone’s 
<br/>table.  There maybe some on the other side that may not agree with what is actually on the floor.  
<br/>That is all that is being asked.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I will tell you why I actually raised this and this is part of what was 
<br/>given to everyone.  The original letter of complaint that came to you, Sir, which you accepted, which 
<br/>you read and which you forwarded to us at the Committee to look at in terms of the matter being 
<br/>raised for the Privileges Committee to look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that letter Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was given to you by honourable Tikoduadua and everyone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has this, starts off by saying, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “We, write respectfully to your high office.  A matter of privilege in which our humble and 
<br/>considered opinion is set out in the Standing Order 134.  We, Mr. Speaker, Sir, raise for your 
<br/>consideration that a prima facie breach of Standing Order 62(3) and Standing Order 63(4) by 
<br/>the Leader of the Opposition, honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama in his response to His 
<br/>Excellency  the  President’s  most  gracious  speech  on  Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023.    The 
<br/>motion  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  is  the  primary  order  of  business  this  sitting 
<br/>week, as agreed to at the last Business Committee meeting of 27</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Speaker, it give us no joy to raise this but the words uttered by the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition in denigrating and humiliating our Head of State, His Excellency 
<br/>the President also Commander-in-Chief, while appealing to the rank and file in the RFMF is 
<br/>in our considered view (Note, please extract other language from Hansard)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not the duty of the Committee to extract anything from </span><span>Hansard</span><span>, it is your complaint. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Semantics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Please, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Semantics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- There is a big difference between “we” and “I” and it goes on regarding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the actual aggressive and arrogant, rhetoric warrants sanction, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, it says and I quote, “We humbly simply seek your ruling…”  Honourable Kamikamica 
<br/></span><span>is saying semantics.  Let me tell you something, he has come before the Committee, taken an oath 
<br/></span><span>and said on oath after giving this letter to the honourable Speaker, to take on board and decide </span><span>prima 
<br/>facie</span><span>.  He has come to the Committee and said it is “I”.  I am the only one that complained, one 
<br/>person.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is the difference? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>364 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a grave injustice.  The point is if it is “we” 
<br/>honourable Minister, that could mean all of you, it could mean NFP, it could even also mean the 
<br/>members of the Committee that was sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Semantics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not semantics.  The point is that if it is we, honourable Minister, that 
<br/>could mean all of you, NFP, it could even also mean the Members of the Committee that were sitting 
<br/>here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Look at the substance of the issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Before you get to the substance of any issue, you need to look at the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>complaint. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Honourable Member, you should think about what you are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not about that. You start with the actual charge my friend.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that of course will be raised by this side of Parliament as an issue at a later stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is how you treat the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Whether  he  has  been  truthful  on  oath  or  whether  he  misled  you  and 
<br/>Parliament by saying it was more than one complainant, that is a grave matter that needs to be looked 
<br/>into and obviously taken on board by this side of the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Why didn’t you raise it up in the Privileges Committee? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You were not there, it was.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- He does not have to be there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You were not there, it was. You are not aware of it because the whole 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report is not before you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Semantics!  Just picking on words! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I am not here to listen to people who were not sitting there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am being polite, Sir.  By his own admission also, in the verbatim report he 
<br/>says  that  we  make  statements,  I  made  some  statements  that  question  the  validity  of  what  His 
<br/>Excellency the President said in terms of the content of his speech.  It has been done before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned earlier it has been done before.  It has been objected upon.  We all stood up 
<br/></span><span>and said  it is  out  of order and again  it is  out  of order. What  it is,  Mr. Speaker, is  that within the 
<br/>provisions … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is very different.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Is he finished? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="109">Page 109</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Carry on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You are neither the Speaker nor the Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sections that were referred to by honourable Tikoduadua, and the alleged 
<br/>offences that were committed in accordance with the breach of the Standing Orders 62 and 63, these 
<br/>breaches stand in your purview. You have the absolute right under these orders to stop a person if 
<br/>they are out of order.  You did not, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Are you questioning the Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That is entirely your prerogative, Sir.  You obviously did not see it as a 
<br/>grave injustice. You even have a right to terminate his speech if you saw it that way. You did not, 
<br/>Sir. No one else in this House even stood up at that time if they saw it as a grave offence. No one did 
<br/>it. It was brought up at a later stage.  Again, after the honourable Minister went outside and said this 
<br/>is treasonous in the news, et cetera and then came and complained to you after.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More importantly, Sir, also nowhere does that and I think the lawyers will understand this - 
<br/>nowhere  in  any  part  of  his  speech  does  the  Leader  of  Opposition  fit  the  mould  of  any  seditious 
<br/>comment.  It is a matter of fact in his comments the proviso he actually put in there is the comments 
<br/>that were actually made by him.  He did not ask for any illegal act to be done.  He merely asked that 
<br/>they follow the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a particular provision in the Constitution and that very same provision was referred 
<br/>to by the honourable Prime Minister.  No, he did not, that was fine nothing happened.  He actually 
<br/>did it outside Parliament. All that was asked for was that. So, it was not like he was instigating or 
<br/>inciting someone to go and do something unlawful. Why would he?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Because he lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Especially in light of the fact that this was in 2013.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- You thought you would rule forever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- All of this was done by - we all know!   So, the point is, it is incumbent 
<br/></span><span>upon us to be just.  We must be just, fair, give everyone the right to be heard regardless and despite 
<br/>what we hear from the other side - the quips that come across, but the little knowledge becomes very 
<br/>dangerous.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was done by the honourable Leader of the Opposition was a speech that was given and 
<br/>was not seditious by reason, but it only intended to show some mistakes.  The same way that the 
<br/>other side had done with previous occasions with our former Presidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, for one on this side of Parliament, Sir, completely disagree with both the recommendations 
<br/></span><span>whether it be the original motion or the motion currently before Parliament; the amended version, 
<br/>purely on the basis Sir, that we do not find any guilt and I urge everyone to please ensure that they 
<br/>make a very informed decision because there are two people’s dissenting opinions there but we do 
<br/>not see the evidence there Sir.   I thank the honourable Prime Minister also for making the generous 
<br/>comments that he did.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>366 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wanted to speak on the motion on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amended motion before you give the Right of Reply … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am giving the Right of Reply to the honourable Tabuya now, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Professor Biman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, I had already requested through the Secretary-General that 
<br/>I  would  want  to  contribute  to  the  amended  motion  before  you  give  the  Right  of  Reply  to  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am giving the Right of Reply to honourable Tabuya now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am not sure if I misunderstood.  All I was saying is that I 
<br/>also want to contribute to the amended motion before the Leader of Government Business has the 
<br/>Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, I also wanted to contribute to the amended motion because 
<br/>seven Opposition Members have spoken.  I also wanted to contribute on the amended motion, before 
<br/>you give the Right of Reply to the Leader of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will grant you that opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- One versus seven. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say this right at the outset, that they 
<br/>talked  about  the  expectation.    Honourable  Koya  talked  about  the  expectation.    We,  on  the 
<br/>Government side also had an expectation when the honourable Prime Minister made that offer and 
<br/>we all agreed with that.  We know how compassionate and how thoughtful the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister  can  be  with  these  things.    That  was  our  expectation  and  like  the  interpretation  that 
<br/>honourable Koya and his group had. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am actually quite astounded by the debate not only on the substance 
<br/></span><span>of the motion which they went back to, but also astounded at the hypocrisy of some of these people 
<br/></span><span>who sat in the very same Parliament on three occasions and interpreted what those three honourable 
<br/>Members including yourself Mr. Speaker, went through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Koya, being a lawyer, talks about a Point of Order and he is now blaming you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, and saying that you should have stopped him.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Speak on the amended motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, there is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I honestly believe that he is not actually hearing things. I did not point 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fingers at you, Sir, and I did not speak about a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You lied.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I did not speak about a Point of Order. I did not infer it anyway… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You were not listening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, could you just confine yourself to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amended motion, as I have also asked the honourable Opposition Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  am  just  confining  myself,  Mr.  Speaker,  on  the  amended 
<br/>motion and I am just responding to what honourable Koya said.  He was saying that the fact that, 
<br/>what he said may have been out of order, should have been raised there and dealt with. Now, what I 
<br/>am saying, Mr. Speaker, is if something is said in Parliament by an honourable Member and it is out 
<br/>of order, it does not necessarily mean that it is not a privileged matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me just respond  to  a point that all of them have been making in  their  response to  the 
<br/>amended  motion  and  it  is  important  for  us  to  respond  to  that  Mr.  Speaker.    They  are  saying  that 
<br/>despite the amended motion the substance is not correct. They are saying that there was no inference 
<br/>or no attempt by the honourable Leader of the Opposition to bring the office of the President into 
<br/>disrepute and they are referring to examples of Opposition Members in the past making references.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nowhere - no Opposition Member in my recollection in the eight years said that the President, 
<br/>the Commander in Chief of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, failed to acknowledge the fact that 
<br/>the very Constitution which he is supposed to uphold is being stripped away almost on a daily basis.  
<br/>That is a direct attack on the integrity, on the reputation, and on the role of the President of Fiji.  No, 
<br/>Opposition Member ever said that the President failed to uphold his constitutional role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is not correct. What is said is very clear and I think the amended motion 
<br/>gives  an  opportunity  to  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  gives  an  opportunity  to  all 
<br/>honourable  Opposition  Members  to  reflect  on  their  own  past,  reflect  on  their  own  hypocrisy  and 
<br/>accept  that  the  Government  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  have  provided  -  as  honourable 
<br/>Seruiratu said - a start of a new beginning of negotiation and dialogue.  But what they did, they asked 
<br/>for 10 minutes, they went out, like puppets and consulted their Master, which they did in the past… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-You are talking nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It has now become habitual of honourable Professor Prasad to use these 
<br/>fancy  words  that  he  suddenly  thinks  is  good  behaviour  in  this  Parliament.    He  has  belittled  new 
<br/>Members of Parliament, he is now trying to say all these things about parrot, et cetera, he ought to 
<br/>stop.  He is the Minister of Finance.  Control yourself, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I will not be threatened by your loud voice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Deputy Prime Minister, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to make that point.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 108, I withdraw the amendment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the question on the original motion be put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Madam, did you quote Standing Order 108?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 108(2).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Standing Order 108(2) allows for the original motion to come back to life 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after the second motion is withdrawn.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- Debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, there will be no debate here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  as you embark on that honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Government in Parliament, I hope you have taken into account the lengthy discussions we have had 
<br/>here, the plea from the honourable Prime Minister in trying to find a way forward.  We have heard 
<br/>from  honourable  Seruiratu  and  honourable  Naupoto  on  the  issues  of  trying  to  forge  ahead  a  new 
<br/>beginning.  That is where I came in as Speaker just to kind of clarify the issues that had been raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been given another breath of life, so to speak, and where we were in the original motion.  
<br/>Now,  that  you  have  put  forward  the  amendment  to  the  motion  and  that  is  why  the  rest  of  the 
<br/>honourable Members of the Opposition, seven of them have asked to be heard as well.  That is why 
<br/>I  am  seeking  a  Right  of  Reply.    Have  you  changed  your  position  on  this  based  on  all  that  has 
<br/>transpired?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Based on what was offered by the honourable Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Yes,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I insist on the withdrawal  under Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order 108 and move that the question in the original motion be put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are not going to have another debate on this.  We 
<br/>have had a run around on this.  We have tried all our best to see how best we can resolve this, but 
<br/>now the Government has decided otherwise, so the original recommendation still sticks here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being opposition, Parliament will now vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are supporting the motion from here, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Professor Prasad I was just about to ask for your vote.

<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Voting for the motion, Sir.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The two honourable Members have voted and we are waiting for the results 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the vote, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I seek your indulgence here, all I am asking for is another vote to be taken since the results 
<br/>from the first vote is totally, I might use the word, “glitch”.  Honourable Members, all I am asking is 
<br/>if we can take another vote.
