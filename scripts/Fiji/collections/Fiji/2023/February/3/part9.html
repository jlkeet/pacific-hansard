<h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s official opening of Parliament.  I also welcome 
<br/>our  guests  seated  in  the  gallery,  and  those  watching  the  live  broadcast  and  the  livestreaming  of 
<br/>today’s proceedings from the comfort of their homes, offices and electronic devices, thank you for 
<br/>your continued interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today  is  another  special  occasion  in  the  parliamentary  calendar  as  it  marks  the  official 
<br/>opening of the first session of the third term of the Fijian Parliament.  The State Opening will be 
<br/>officiated by His Excellency the President, </span><span>Turaga na Tui Macuata</span><span>, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gratitude – Former Speaker  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  before  I  proceed,  I  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  and 
<br/>acknowledge  my  predecessor,  His  Excellency  Ratu  Epeli  Nailatikau  for  his  great  service  in  this 
<br/>honourable Chair and to Parliament.  I wish him well in his future endeavours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resolution – Business Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  Business  Committee  meeting  on  Friday,  27</span><span>th</span><span>  January,  2023,  the  Business 
<br/>Committee resolved and agreed through vote that Standing Order 28, to some extent Standing Orders 
<br/>29 and 30 be waived so as to allow the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enable the honourable Members of Parliament to speak in the </span><span>vosa vaka-Viti</span><span>, or Hindi as 
<br/>apart from English, so as to allow them to express themselves fully and make meaningful 
<br/>contributions on issues of national importance; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Allow the translations to be reflected in the </span><span>Hansard Report</span><span>; and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Allow the Speaker to pray the way he wishes to pray and will not be offended if someone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>else prays the way they pray. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, when a Member of Parliament speaks in the </span><span>vosa vaka-Viti </span><span>or Hindi 
<br/>languages, the translations can be from the vernacular to English.  These translations can be heard by

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members  on  Channel  1  on  the  </span><span>vosa  vaka-Viti</span><span>  and  Channel  2  in  Hindi  on  the  audio  system  in 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the video broadcast translation, it would be difficult for now as two voices will be heard 
<br/>on the same channel; the voice of the Member of Parliament who is talking in the vernacular and the 
<br/>voice of the translator.  This option can be explored for the long term as it involves the software and 
<br/>hardware upgrade which needs to be sourced internationally.  The </span><span>vosa vaka-Viti</span><span> or Hindi languages 
<br/>will be recorded in the </span><span>Hansard Report</span><span> with the translated version (English) appended to the back of 
<br/>the  </span><span>Hansard  Report</span><span>,  for  which  will  be  uploaded  on  the  Parliament  website  after  seven  days  in 
<br/>accordance with Standing Order 32.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Formalities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  at  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  advise,  as  is  customary,  that  honourable 
<br/>Members of the Judiciary will be joining us in Parliament to hear the Address of His Excellency the 
<br/>President of the Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable  Members  of  the  Judiciary  escorted  into  Parliament  by  the  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Government in Parliament)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  please,  may  I  ask  if  you could  all  be  upstanding  as  we  receive  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members of the Judiciary to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members of Parliament and the Judiciary, we shall now proceed to receive His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(His Excellency the President escorted into Parliament by the honourable Speaker, Secretary-
<br/>General and Leader of the Government in Parliament)  
<br/></span></div>
