<h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, all those joining us in the gallery and 
<br/>those  watching  proceedings  on  television  and  the  internet.  Thank  you  for  taking  interest  in  your 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Business Committee Decision 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  at  this  juncture,  I  will  reiterate  my  communication  on  Friday,  3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>February, 2023, whereby I had informed on the decision of the Business Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Business Committee had resolved and agreed through vote that Standing Order 28, to 
<br/>some  extent,  Standing  Order  29  and  Standing  Order  30  be  waived.    The  waiver  allows,  to  some 
<br/>extent,  Standing  Orders  29  and  30,  the  use  of  the  vernacular  languages,  the  provision  of  the 
<br/>vernacular translation in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, and lastly, for the Speaker to pray the way he wishes to 
<br/>pray and will not be offended if someone else comes and prays the way they pray.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As most of you may be well aware, precedence has been set in the last two terms of Parliament 
<br/></span><span>where  at  the  Business  Committee  level,  matters  were  raised,  discussed  and  determined  by  the 
<br/>Business  Committee  and  following  that,  the  Speaker  formalises  the  decision  on  the  floor  of 
<br/>Parliament, which is also exactly what I had done on Friday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition (and I note he is not present) is a Member of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Business Committee and he was present at that meeting where he had also participated in the
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
<div><span>98 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliberations.  Therefore, his obvious disregard of the Business Committee decision, as well as the 
<br/>communication on Friday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023, comes as a surprise because he was present at that 
<br/>meeting.  The Business Committee had resolved and agreed through vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  I  reiterate  that  the  Business  Committee  had  agreed  to  those  issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through vote and, therefore, that will be the end of the matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Matter of Privilege 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On another matter, honourable Members, I have received a notification on Monday afternoon 
<br/>from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration,  raising  a  matter  of  privilege 
<br/>pursuant to Standing Order 134. The matter of privilege is against the response to His Excellency’s 
<br/>Address by the honourable Leader of the Opposition on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In accordance with Standing Order 134(2), the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and 
<br/>Immigration has, in his notification, outlined the facts and the resulting grounds on which he believes 
<br/>that  there  has  been  a  breach  of  privilege.  The  facts  and  the  grounds  notified  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That on the morning of 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, during the debate on the motion to thank 
<br/>His  Excellency  the  President  for  his  most  gracious  Address,  the  honourable  Josaia 
<br/>Bainimarama uttered words that are denigrating and humiliating to  the Head of State, His 
<br/>Excellency the President and also as Commander-in-Chief, whilst appealing “to the rank and 
<br/>file”  in  the  RFMF  which,  in  view  of  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and 
<br/>Immigration,  are  highly  seditious  and  disrespectful  while  dishonouring  the  dignity  and 
<br/>bringing Parliament into disrepute, which are in contravention of Standing Order 62(3) and 
<br/>(4). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I have now had the opportunity to review the uncorrected </span><span>Daily 
<br/>Hansard</span><span> for Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, and I have considered the matter raised by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration and have decided as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Privilege is  accorded to  everyone in this  august  Parliament as a matter  of right, and 
<br/>Standing Order 133 states that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every Member, and any other person speaking in Parliament has - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, subject to these Standing Orders.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  any  Member  can  say  whatever  they  want  in  Parliament  but,  honourable 
<br/>Members,  what  you  say  in  Parliament  is  subject  to  the  Standing  Orders.  The  dignity  and 
<br/>respect of Parliament must, at all times, be upheld.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this respect, Standing Order 62 states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(3)   The conduct of members, the President, Chief Justice (performing the functions 
<br/></span><span>of the Office of the President under Section 88 of the Constitution), members of 
<br/>the judiciary, or other persons acting in  a judicial  capacity must not  be raised, 
<br/>except on a motion with notice introduced with the Speaker’s permission.  In any 
<br/>other situation, reference to the conduct of any of these individuals is out of order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is out of order for a member, when speaking, to use -
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>99 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offensive words against Parliament or another member; 
<br/>treasonable words;  
<br/>seditious words; or  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>words  that  are  likely  to  promote  or  provoke  feelings  of  ill-will  or  hostility 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between communities or ethnic groups within Fiji.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The words used by the honourable Leader of the Opposition are matters which are out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of order in this Parliament and constitute a </span><span>prima facie</span><span> breach of privilege.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  the  above  and  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  134(2)(a)  and  Standing  Order 
<br/>127(2)(c),  I have decided there is  a  </span><span>prima facie</span><span>  breach of privilege and  I hereby refer the 
<br/>matter to the Privileges Committee for its consideration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Privileges Committee is directed to meet from lunch time today - Wednesday, 15</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>February,  2023,  and  provide  its  report  for  tabling  in  Parliament  on  Friday,  17</span><span>th</span><span>  February, 
<br/>2023, and Parliament shall consider the Report of the Privileges Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deferment of Motion – Adoption of Sitting Calendar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, on the deferment of motion to Thursday’s Order Paper, honourable Members, please, 
<br/>kindly take note that I have allowed the motion listed as Item No. 4 on today’s Orders Paper to be 
<br/>deferred until tomorrow. The motion is on the adoption of the sitting calendar and the Secretariat will 
<br/>circulate the amended Order Paper on Thursday, 16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, or probably soon.  
<br/></span></div>
