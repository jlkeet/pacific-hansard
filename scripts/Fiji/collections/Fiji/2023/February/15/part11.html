<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON HIS EXCELLENCY’S ADDRESS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of this 
<br/>august Parliament, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka </span><span>and good morning 
<br/>to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to add my acknowledgements to His Excellency the President of the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, for his most gracious and inspiring Address a 
<br/>few days ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to begin by warmly congratulating you on your appointment to 
<br/>the seat of Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji, and honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua 
<br/>on her appointment to the seat of Deputy Speaker of this august Parliament.  We pray that the Lord 
<br/>will bless you both and give you wisdom and strength for these important roles for Parliament and 
<br/>for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency reminded us of how we have forged ahead as a resilient nation with committed 
<br/>efforts to address the global pandemic, natural disasters and a period of uncertainty, distress and loss 
<br/>that gripped our nation.  His Excellency also called on this august Parliament to embody the collective 
<br/>spirit of resilience and resolve of our people, bringing the hope of a promising future for the citizens 
<br/></span><span>of our beloved nation, which we all call home. And this must be facilitated through, “a clear focus 
<br/></span><span>on  the  rule  of  law  and  democratic  processes,  including  transparency,  accountability,  respect  for 
<br/>human rights and freedom, and listening to the views of the people through genuine consultation.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency has also pointed to the herculean economic challenge before us, inherited by 
<br/>the People’s Coalition Government, which we must now work with to deliver Government’s service 
<br/>to the people of Fiji.  With a restrictive national debt level, we must, nonetheless, forge ahead

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cautiously and thoughtfully to meet the expectation of our people in the services we are expected to 
<br/>deliver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Minister responsible for Health and Medical Services, I salute all 7000 
<br/>health workers serving around Fiji  and thank them for their commitment and effort in seeing our 
<br/>nation through one of its most turbulent times – fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in the last three 
<br/>years and keeping it at bay, which we still continue to do today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We acknowledge all our development partners, health partners and donors who stood by us 
<br/>and  supported  our  effort  in  dealing  with  the  outbreak  in  Fiji.  We  also  acknowledge  our  Non-
<br/>Governmental  Organisations  (NGOs)  and  various  organisations,  such  as  Foundation  for  Rural 
<br/>Integrated  Enterprises  (FRIENDS),  the  Fiji  Nursing  Association,  the  friends  of  Tavarua  group, 
<br/>families, social and community groups, and individuals who we did not hear about, yet whose efforts 
<br/>were critical to the overall success of our response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the health sector, His Excellency the President revealed that the People’s 
<br/>Coalition  Government  is  drafting  plans  for  the  revival  of  the  health  and  medical  services  in  our 
<br/>hospitals by improving and maintaining facilities, services, skills training and patientcare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my first three weeks as Minister, we have managed to visit over 50 healthcare facilities so 
<br/>far in the Northern, Western, and Central Divisions, and conversed with many hundreds of healthcare 
<br/>workers across Fiji.   This has  informed my  view that there are two key elements  essential to  our 
<br/>vision for excellence in healthcare.  These are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A  dramatically  improved  and  maintained  health  infrastructure  from  the  Divisional 
<br/>Hospitals such as the Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) and all the way to the 
<br/>most remote nursing station. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A well supported, appropriately remunerated and capable healthcare professionals. You can 
<br/>have the best health infrastructure, however, without the capable, caring and professional 
<br/>staff,  we  would  not  have  a  healthcare  system.  From  nurses  to  doctors  to  cleaners  to 
<br/>community health</span><span> </span><span>workers - all need to feel appreciated and be adequately supported.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are big issues to address, and it will take time, but we will embrace this challenge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my previous contributions in this august Parliament as an Opposition 
<br/>Member,  I  highlighted  the  Opposition’s  concern  on  the  reduction  in  budgetary  allocations  for 
<br/>infrastructural works for the Ministry of Health.  Our recent visits have confirmed what we feared 
<br/>would be the outcome.  Except for a few healthcare facilities that are in a good shape, majority are 
<br/>in a poor state with damaged infrastructure, an insufficient program for maintenance and upkeep and 
<br/>with poor water, hygiene and sanitation facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health and Medical Services will prioritize improving and maintaining our 
<br/>220 health facilities and associated infrastructures.  In doing so, we can improve the environment in 
<br/>which healthcare is delivered to our people and improve the working environment for our valued 
<br/></span><span>medical staff who are sent to these facilities to live, work and serve the people of Fiji.   We will place 
<br/></span><span>greater emphasis  on providing these facilities with  better access  to  water, sanitation and hygiene, 
<br/>power, and internet connectivity wherever possible, in a sustainable and environmentally friendly 
<br/>manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has come under the spotlight lately and has been scrutinised 
<br/>by the media and members of the public on social media.  Their focus is on the state of some of our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>101 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hospitals and medical infrastructure around the country, and I agree with them, Sir, because after 
<br/>visiting  medical  facilities  around  the  country,  majority  of  the  infrastructure  is  in  need  of  repair, 
<br/>renovation or a total makeover.  There has been significant neglect for the past 16 years.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As many will now be aware, the honourable Prime Minister has instigated improved freedom 
<br/>of the media.  One element of this was to facilitate a media visit to Colonial War Memorial Hospital 
<br/>(CWMH) last week. This is a crucial step in showcasing the challenges we face and how the Ministry 
<br/>with the support of our bilateral and multi-lateral development partners, civil society, the private sector, 
<br/>communities and like-minded individuals, all have an important role to work in partnership to deliver and 
<br/>improve health infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry welcomes the proposed re-introduction of the Public 
<br/>Works Department (PWD) as the maintenance and upgrading of rural roads and river crossing,s and the 
<br/>maintenance of government buildings will be their priority. Having access to roads is a social determinant 
<br/>of health, as it ensures that all Fijians living in remote areas will be able to reach their nearest health 
<br/>facility and have access to healthcare. We look forward to working with PWD in repairing, renovating or 
<br/>rebuilding some of our medical facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On human resource, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we come to the issue of our health workforce. I wish to 
<br/>acknowledge and share with you the appreciation of the staff of the Ministry (and I am sure for other civil 
<br/>servants) who were very relieved when the Government amended the retirement age from 55 years to 60 
<br/>years. It is a very significant change in Government’s workforce strategy and ensures that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Our human resource base is immediately widened, providing a better platform to address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>workforce attrition and staff shortage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A  return  on  investment  for  Government  and  the  country’s  effort  in  building  up  the 
<br/>experience and skills of our workforce through years of development and honing, which is 
<br/>delivered here at home for the benefit of the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immediate  access  to  a  more  knowledgeable  and  highly-skilled  and  experienced  health 
<br/>practitioners and administrators workforce, who would have been lost immediately upon 
<br/>attainment of the retirement age of 55 years old.  Prior to this change, other countries in the 
<br/>region and around the world have been the recipient and benefactor of our well trained, 
<br/>experienced and very capable health workforce and civil servants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talk to any international expert in Human Resource for Health, and they will inform you 
<br/>that retiring  employees  early is not the strategy  for staff shortage in  health.  In fact, the 
<br/>opposite is true, you keep them longer while you build up the new intakes’ capabilities and 
<br/>skills.  I am afraid that the previous Government’s strategy has been incorrect through all 
<br/>these years and as a result, we have no capacity to be able to cater effectively for any surges 
<br/>in staff attrition rates, like we have been experiencing in the last 24 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need well supported, appropriately remunerated and capable healthcare professionals who are 
<br/>compassionate and caring.  As an example, we have 3,056 nursing positions across Fiji and the nursing 
<br/></span><span>workforce is crucial in all aspects of health services.  They are a major part of our professional and caring 
<br/></span><span>health system delivery.  However, last year alone, 807 nurses (approximately 26.4 percent)</span><span> </span><span>have resigned 
<br/>from the Ministry.  The issue has been noted in the media in the last few years but finding a quick solution 
<br/>is going to be a challenge.  It is an issue that we cannot shy away from and requires a multifactorial and 
<br/>a multisectoral approach.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Minister, we will work together with the wider Ministry and Health Facility Leadership teams 
<br/>and with the Government to look for solutions to these issues. Our solutions will be approached in an 
<br/>inclusive and consultative manner.  While nursing has been highlighted in the attrition rate, other cadres 
<br/>of healthcare workers are also affected.  As a Ministry, we will find solutions to these concerns through 
<br/>consultation and dialogue with each cadre because health service delivery is not only about doctors and 
<br/>nurses, but many other important cadre of healthcare professionals and support service teams that make 
<br/>the healthcare system function.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my 53</span><span>rd</span><span> day as the Minister for Health and Medical Services and the old 
<br/>saying by English playwright John Heywood that ‘Rome was not built in a day, but they were laying 
<br/>bricks  every  hour’,  is  a  reminder  of  the  fact  that  it  requires  time  and  patience  to  create  something 
<br/>significant and majestic. This rings true to my ears as I try to grasp the challenges ahead in rebuilding 
<br/>these medical facilities and the staff that deliver the services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services will focus its attention over the 
<br/>next four years on critical legislations that facilitate the delivery of health services in Fiji. We intend to 
<br/>address the delay in the revision of the Public Health Act 1935 which has taken more than 10 years now 
<br/>and is still not completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A review of the Radiation Health Act 2009 is needed with the development of health services and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the increasing use of radiation sources by other industries and Government agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will  look  into  the  complete  review  of  the  Tobacco  Control  Act  2010  and  the 
<br/>Tobacco Control Regulations 2012 to update the legislation to meet upcoming needs and expectations in 
<br/>these areas of operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other health-related legislations that need updating, given the development and 
<br/>advancement of health technology and standards of health practice to facilitate the effective and efficient 
<br/>delivery of health services to the people will be assessed, reviewed and updated as necessary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lesson of the COVID-19 pandemic is that, we ignore infectious diseases at 
<br/>our own peril.  The Ministry will endeavour to further improve our surveillance, prevention, response 
<br/>and protection programmes for infectious diseases that are endemic to Fiji, as well as those that we can 
<br/>import from abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  must  be  ambitious  to  challenge  our  current  approach  and  way  of  thinking  and  explore 
<br/>opportunities  to  pursue  interventions  that  can  lead  to  a  marked  reduction  in  disease  burden  and  the 
<br/>possible elimination of tropical diseases that have plagued us for many decades, such as leptospirosis, 
<br/>typhoid, dengue fever, scabies, tuberculosis and leprosy, to name a few.  We must also be ready with a 
<br/>comprehensive response  plan when  disease outbreak such as the COVID-19 pandemic hits us in  the 
<br/>future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on HIV/AID infections, it is alarming to see that Fiji has increased its estimated 
<br/>new HIV/AIDS infections by 129 percent over the last decade from 2010 to 2021, putting Fiji in a pool 
<br/>of 38 countries with an alarmingly rising infection rate, according to the UNAIDS Global Report.  The 
<br/></span><span>Global AIDS Monitoring 2022 Report for Fiji showed a 173 percent increase in AIDS-related deaths 
<br/></span><span>between 2010 to 2021.  According to the Global AIDS Monitoring Report, Fiji is amongst the top five 
<br/>countries of rising new HIV infections in the Asia Pacific among 15 year to 24 year old age group with 
<br/>an approximate rate of 50 percent increase in cases since 2010.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2021, nine of the 151 new infections diagnosed were cases of mother to child 
<br/>transmission.  Fiji has now recorded a total of 1,417 cumulative cases of HIV since 1989.  The Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>103 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will  intensify  its  efforts  and  work  collaboratively  with  our  partners  to  strengthen  our  capacities  for 
<br/>prevention,  access  to  diagnosis  and  treatment,  and  the  governance  of  our  HIV/AIDS  response 
<br/>programme.  As a community, we must  also  work hard  to  root out the  culture of stigmatisation  and 
<br/>discrimination against people living with HIV, so that they can gain equitable access to health services 
<br/>and the care they need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another lesson of the pandemic was that the high-risk population which included 
<br/>those  with  chronic  Non-Communicable  Diseases  (NCDs),  suffered  the  most.    His  Excellency  the 
<br/>President rightly pointed to the heavy burden that NCDs place in our community and our economy, and 
<br/>80 percent of annual deaths in Fiji are attributed to NCDs and 65 percent of our people are overweight or 
<br/>obese.  The 2018 Economic Burden Report noted that each year, Fiji loses $406 million due to major 
<br/>NCDs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people are sadly dying early due to NCDs, and it is also costing Fiji a lot.  Fiji’s food balance 
<br/>sheets  over  the  years  have  shown  that  the  composition  of  dietary  intake  is  shifting  away  from  the 
<br/>traditional rootcrop-based diet to cereal-based.  Now, starchy staples provide 22 percent of total energy 
<br/>intake with cereal-based foods increasing to about 38 percent of total energy.  This impacts on the health 
<br/>of the nation through increased NCDs and obesity, but also through food imports which are recorded as 
<br/>relatively  high  at  7  percent  of  the  GDP  -  approximately  $793.2  million.    As  a  result,  NCDs  and  its 
<br/>complications are reaching crisis levels with a high number of health diseases such as stroke, blindness 
<br/>and amputations in our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one thing is certain, that there is a lot to be done and we, as a Ministry, cannot 
<br/>do it alone.  As an example, because of constrained staff and resources, Twomey Tamavua Hospital, our 
<br/>only specialist rehabilitation hospital ina Fiji, is able to fit some 100 prosthesis for amputees each year, 
<br/>although the demand is much higher.  However, in partnership with development partners, they were able 
<br/>to fit some 500 life-changing prosthesis in just 50 days.  That shows what can be achieved with the right 
<br/>resources, coordination and will.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, the Ministry has, again, in partnership with a core development partner, agreed 
<br/>on a planned project to build a new rehabilitation hospital with improved facilities to deliver a wider 
<br/>scope of advanced rehabilitation services.  The work for this begins this year and once completed, will 
<br/>significantly enhance our ability to deliver rehabilitation services to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Digital Health Strategy, the enhancement of the communication and digital 
<br/>platforms  within  the  Ministry  is  important,  as  this  will  facilitate  better  disease  surveillance,  patient 
<br/>referral, supply chain and inventory management, resource planning and mobilization, and governance 
<br/>of its daily operations. Our Divisional and Sub-Divisional Command Centre operations will function 
<br/>much more effectively with access to a better digital and communications platform. In this regard, the 
<br/>Ministry is pursuing the establishment of a 5-Year Digital Health Strategy and Implementation Plan with 
<br/>the associated package of digital support to address governance, operational system, and human resources 
<br/>in line with the Government’s overall digital plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are mindful of the state of the economy, as highlighted by His Excellency the President, and 
<br/>we will do our part in reducing wastage and improving efficiency.  One example of this is working with 
<br/></span><span>a  development  partner  to  roll  out  an  improved  supply  chain  management  system  called  mSUPPLY, 
<br/></span><span>across Fiji.  We have so far covered close to a third of all health facilities (or 58 health facilities) that are 
<br/>now using the improved software to monitor and order medicines and medical supplies.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So far, our analysis indicate that this system has reduced average processing time of orders from 
<br/>an average of six days to just over a day-and-a-half.  It has also improved inventory listings so that health 
<br/>facilities can readily know their stock status at any point in time.  This national level ambition has shown 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how improvements can be made at scale.  The supply chain reform is planned to be completed nationwide 
<br/>by the end of 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  overall, in the health sector,  we  recognize  that the  demand  is  great but the 
<br/>resources are scarce.  We will need to work smarter and more efficiently in trying to improve healthcare 
<br/>service delivery conditions.  There have been some obstacles in the past in our ability to access funding 
<br/>in a timely manner, which have contributed to unused budgetary allocation each year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges that in the last five financial years from 2017-2018 
<br/>to 2021-2022, the Ministry had underspent its annual budgetary allocations by an average of 13.6 percent 
<br/>(ranges  from  4  percent  to  22  percent)  each  year.    Below  are  some  of  the  major  reasons  for  the 
<br/>underutilization of our budget: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Medical  items  ordered  through  indents  under  the  Fiji  Pharmaceutical  &amp;  Biomedical 
<br/>Services (FPBS)’s allocation for overseas procurement of goods and services were delayed 
<br/>from overseas suppliers, hence payments spilt over into the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special expenditures of funds provided as cash grants from development partners were held 
<br/>under Requisition (‘R’) and were not released on time to facilitate operational activities on 
<br/>the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Allocations for Capital Construction were not fully utilized in each financial year as the 
<br/>budget allocated was for the total project, but funds were paid out on completed phases.  
<br/>Delays were noted in the processes relating to tendering for purchasing of medical items or 
<br/>infrastructural works, contracting suppliers and settlement of approved payments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  unfavourable  weather  and  disruptions  to  the  global  supply  chain  for  medicine  and 
<br/>equipment in the last 36 months caused by the global pandemic were factors beyond our 
<br/>control  that  contributed  towards  the  delay  in  the  timely  completion  of  projects  and 
<br/>purchases. Those factors also impacted most of the major projects that were administered 
<br/>through  the  Construction  Implementation  Unit  (CIU)  and  not  within  the  control  of  the 
<br/>Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an area we wish to improve over the next four years.  To overcome those 
<br/>obstacles,  we  will  work  more  closely  with  the  central  agencies  to  better  plan,  strategise  and  utilise 
<br/>resources  allocated  to the Ministry  for its operations.   The Ministry  will also pursue partnership  and 
<br/>collaboration  with  development  partners to facilitate the delivery of  quality  healthcare service to our 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that regard, I extend my heartfelt thanks to all our development partners for their assistance 
<br/>pre-COVID-19 and especially during COVID-19, and look forward to strengthening and deepening our 
<br/>relationship in the near future.  I call on our wider development partners, individuals, members of the 
<br/>community, the private sector, civil society and bilateral and multi-lateral partners to come on board and 
<br/>assist us in partnership to deliver a strong health service for everyone – the poor or rich, rural or urban 
<br/>dwellers, women, men and children.  All Fijians alike deserve good health which, in turn, impacts on a 
<br/></span><span>more prosperous economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In concluding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President stated that now more than ever, we 
<br/>must be united as one nation and strengthen our resolve to work together to meet our collective challenges.  
<br/>On that note, I wish to extend my most sincere gratitude to the honourable Prime Minister for his wisdom 
<br/>and foresight and most importantly, his efforts to re-establish the linkage between the Government, the 
<br/>People and the Church, or metaphorically speaking, the three-legged stool. I believe that without the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support of the people, </span><span>vanua</span><span> and the church (</span><span>Lotu</span><span>), Government (</span><span>Matanitu</span><span>) will not function as it 
<br/>should as this is a Government chosen by the people and it is a Government that will stand for the 
<br/>people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The support of this three-legged stool is needed as we grapple with ongoing and emerging 
<br/>challenges and in his Address, His Excellency the President urged that this august Parliament embody 
<br/>the collective spirit of resilience and resolve of our people, as this will bring hope of a promising 
<br/>future for the citizens of our beloved nation which we all call home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my supporters within 
<br/>the island of Taveuni, Qamea, Yanuca, Yacata, Naitauba and the </span><span>vanua o Cakaudrove</span><span> in Mabuco, 
<br/>Korocau and Tunuloa, for their support in trusting and believing in me through their votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank you, Sir, for my upbringing and to my loving mother for her daily words 
<br/>of encouragement and support; to my beautiful wife - Kalisiana; and my three sons - Tuikilakila, 
<br/>Raivalita and William, for their never-ending support and love as they travelled near and far with me 
<br/>during the campaign trail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I humbly stand tall here today as the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services 
<br/>because of all the support you rendered, and I will endeavour to carry out my duty to the best of my 
<br/>ability in serving the people of this nation - Fiji.  </span><span>Floreat</span><span> Fiji! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honorable Members of Parliament; greetings and 
<br/>a very good morning to you all present here today, at home and those visiting via other mediums.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my honour to speak at the opening session of this august Parliament for 
<br/>2023-2024.  I am so honoured to be elected again for a second term and I thank the Almighty God 
<br/>for  giving  me  the  strength  and  wisdom,  and  for  the  people  of  this  nation  for  having  trust  and 
<br/>confidence in me and voted me in.   I am indebted to the voters of Nadi, Votualevu, Sabeto, Tunalia, 
<br/>Korovuto, Marasa and Nabitu in Sigatoka; I pledge to visit each of these areas and hopefully I will 
<br/>be able to meet you all in person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  current  political  system  allows  Members  of  Parliament  to  represent 
<br/>voters, be their voice in Parliament and directly and indirectly help them realize their aspirations. I 
<br/>pledge to do my best to serve them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I go further, I would like to thank my wife Mrs Saleshni Kiran Kirpal for 
<br/>her  understanding,  support  and  care  during  my  campaign.  She  flew  in  from  the  United  States  of 
<br/>American. I also wish to thank my two daughters Shreya Kirpal and Siya Kirpal, my team in Nadi - 
<br/>Ashwin  Chand,  Michael  Naidu,  Shynal,  Babu  Sweets,  Mr  and  Mrs  Ranjeet,  Mr  and  Mrs  Navin 
<br/>Chand, Ronil Kumar, Rajeev Deo, Anal Ram, Korovuto Nari Group, Nikita Reddy, Duruga Reddy 
<br/>and my hardworking staff of Professional Valuations Pte Limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, each one of us in this Parliament have taken oath to uphold this Constitution. 
<br/>However,  not  long  after  taking  the  oath,  I  note  that  a  few  Members  in  Government,  notably  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and honourable Attorney-General arguing to amend the Constitution.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, it baffles me. Instead of outlining their agenda and plan to address development needs of 
<br/>this country, they are talking about the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Instead of talking about how the work the remote and rural population can continue be lifted 
<br/>out of poverty they are talking about amending the Constitution.  Instead of talking about how our 
<br/>vulnerable  coastal  population will be protected, they are talking  about  changing  the Constitution.  
<br/>Instead of talking about how our squatter households (the work which FijiFirst started) will be given 
<br/>a  secure  title  so  that  they  can  construct  decent  homes,  they  are  talking  about  amending  the 
<br/>Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have lost direction of their boat right from the day ‘go’.  The entire 
<br/>country  is  waiting  to  hear  how  they  will  be  protected,  supported  and  assisted,  and  how  their 
<br/>aspirations and dreams will be realised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to start  governing this country and deal with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>above, rather than meddling with the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also note the honourable Prime Minister’s intention to remove the secular 
<br/>State provision in the Constitution.  Every Fijian has the right to practice their own religion under the 
<br/>secular State, but I do not understand the reason behind this Government in getting it removed from 
<br/>the  Constitution.    Secular  State  simply  means  that  the  State  or  Government  cannot  push  and 
<br/>propagate one religion or denomination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  you  are  elected  into  government,  you  are  the  leader  of  all 
<br/>communities.  It is your legal and moral duty to protect, look after and support every community 
<br/>immaterial of their ethnicity or religion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my humble plea to the Government to rise above communal politics 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and start behaving as Government and look after every citizen in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Very soon, very soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now turn my attention to finance and budget.  
<br/>I note the appointment of honourable Prasad as Minister of Finance.  He had joined the chorus last 
<br/>in the last Budget in July to oppose it.  Now, when he has an opportunity to deliver his own budget, 
<br/>he is saying that the budget is alright.  Within six months, he has changed his tune.  That is nothing 
<br/>but hypocrisy at its best. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Honourable  Prasad,  be  brave  to  deliver  the  mini-budget,  like  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister said, and also create transparency.  Please, get moving now as we are 
<br/>watching closely and if the Budget is not of standard, we will dissect it Head by Head, line by line.  
<br/>You may take this as an advice or caution, or an early shock - it is up to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to promises made by the trio - PAP, SODELPA and NFP.  
<br/></span><span>Sir, SODELPA made promises during the Election campaign to remove TELS and replace it with 
<br/>full scholarship.  University studies has started but no sign of scholarship at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Because you overspent! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>107 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TELS programme gave a sigh of relief to poor 
<br/>parents, as most of the students who were unable to qualify for scholarships has opted for TELS and 
<br/>were able to fulfil their dreams.  But God knows what will happen to them now since the Coalition 
<br/>Government  wants  to  cease that programme.  It  will be very difficult  to cater for all the students 
<br/>under the scholarship programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The late Mahatma Gandhi said, and I quote: “If we want to reach real peace in this world, we 
<br/>should start educating children”.  The FijiFirst Government has been instrumental in the education 
<br/>of every child so that we have a literate society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  The  NFP  promised  $100  per  tonne  price  for  sugarcane  but  no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announcement till now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, some sugarcane farmers in Nadi have come to me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>asking if the price of sugarcane has been increased to $100 per tonne as promised by NFP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Very soon, very soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  I  gave  the  NFP  leader’s  number  but  they  told  me  that  there  is  no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Can the honourable Minister for Sugar give us some confirmation on 
<br/>the price increase during his speech, which I think, is on Thursday, as farmers are looking forward 
<br/>to some good news. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hail from Marasa, Nadi, a remote area and I know how my father and 
<br/>mother toiled hard to give us a better education and put food on our table among three siblings.  I 
<br/>know the hardship of the farmers in rural areas and have always been the victim of political promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijians are waiting for the slash on 15 basic food items and $5 per hour 
<br/>as promised during the Election.  It is almost more than 50 days but nothing is coming, honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- You had 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- But the promise was made by NFP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  agriculture  can  help  reduce  poverty,  raise  income  and  improve  food 
<br/>security.    Our  FijiFirst  Government  made  major  inroads  in  improving  the  livelihood  of  our  rural 
<br/>population… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  …and  I  do  hope  this  Government  will  continue  the  good  work  left 
<br/>behind by us.  We are watching and we will not hesitate to raise our voices if we see any diversion 
<br/>of resources from this sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Most welcome, most welcome! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I list all the promises, it will take the whole day.  I 
<br/>now wish to ask them if they are really serious about delivering their promises or was it a mere vote-
<br/>buying exercise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  wish  to  state  some  specific  issues  of  the  Coalition  Government 
<br/>witnessed over the last six weeks, which I term as their ‘honeymoon’ period.  Sir, it is ridiculous for 
<br/>the new Chairman of FBC Board to get rid of a modern FBC corporate logo which took nearly six 
<br/>months of hard work to develop and replace it with a Micky Mouse logo and it seems that it will be 
<br/>changed again as announced by the Chairman on Sunday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, anyone running a professional corporation would know that branding can take 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decades to consolidate, and logos are not pulled out of a hat or from some free websites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What about the bonus? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to see that honourable Gavoka praised Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airways, as previously, he used to criticise our airline and was praising Qantas… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Aww, yes.  Momo! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- At least, now as honourable Minister for Civil Aviation, has realised how 
<br/>important it is to keep our national carrier which is the critical link for our tourism industry.  It is not only 
<br/>generating revenue directly, but also indirectly via visitor spending.  He should thank the FijiFirst Party 
<br/>for protecting the airline during the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- He was critical of the A350s, now he is singing its mantra.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- He is making it out as if  the two A350s are his doing, it is not.  It is from 
<br/>the former AG’s doing.  You should know him better. But from your actions, it appears you do not like 
<br/></span><span>him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to commend honourable Bainimarama for his wholehearted effort in 
<br/>maintaining  the  most  deadly  disease  (COVID-19)  by  taking  early  precautions,  while  some  bigger 
<br/>countries were waiting.  His decisive leadership made this possible by getting the COVID-19 vaccine for 
<br/>all Fijians and keeping our borders closed to save our nation from this disastrous pandemic.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also I commend the doctors, nurses, Fiji Police, Fiji Military Force and all other 
<br/>organisations and individuals who had helped in one way or the other, in keeping our people safe and 
<br/>secure during the height of COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all have a collective responsibility to our beloved nation.  It is my hope that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we can work together for the common good of the current and future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to guide us, we must be united with a vision that  portrays a strong, secure, 
<br/>peaceful and prosperous Fiji, whose people are educated and healthy, and who manage their resources in 
<br/>an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our aim should be to decrease poverty, promote equal opportunity, promote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperity and enhance peace and stability to help Fiji achieve its long-term development vision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue our journey, we must always stop to give thanks for the many 
<br/>blessings that God has bestowed on us.  Be humble to those whom you meet on your way up, as you may 
<br/>meet the same people on your way down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh, yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- We must show gratitude for what we have.  Despite our challenges, we are 
<br/>abundantly blessed.  Never take anything for granted.  Give thanks for each breath of life, each sunrise 
<br/>and each sunset, for we are able to smile, sing and laugh and not be persecuted for our religious beliefs, 
<br/>political beliefs, our opinions and our ability to associate with whichever Fijian we want to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that together, we as Fijians can take our nation to new heights.  We 
<br/>will be united and we will be a nation that will continue to prosper. May God bless this nation and all of 
<br/>us.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public who are here today and those 
<br/>joining us through livestream, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni bula vinaka saka</span><span> and a very good morning to you 
<br/>all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to express my heartfelt thanks to His Excellency, the President of the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji, for his most gracious Address on the occasion of the Official Opening of Parliament 
<br/>session.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured this morning to make my maiden speech.  I would like to convey 
<br/>my  sincere  gratitude,  first  and  foremost,  to  the  Lord  God  Almighty  for  the  opportunity  we  all  have 
<br/>together today, especially in my first opportunity as Minister for Housing and Local Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to congratulate you on your election as Speaker.  It is, 
<br/></span><span>indeed,  a  tribute  to  your  long  service  to  this  nation.    Sir,  you  can  be  rest  assured  of  my  full  and 
<br/></span><span>wavering support and I am sure we have a lot to learn in your guidance and wisdom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a blessed place with abundance of resources, goodness of its people, 
<br/>richness in its diversity and the promise that our people have shown by opting to vote for a change.  
<br/>We have had constitutional crisis, </span><span>coups</span><span>, reconciliations, disasters and development, but our spirit of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resilience  has  enabled  us  to  survive  and  prevail  against  all  of  it,  including  the  last  16  years  of 
<br/>dictatorship and acclaimed change.  It spells out hope for a better Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we may have politicians and political parties come here and boast about their electoral 
<br/>strength as a whole or as a coalition in terms of votes and seats but let me remind them, politics is a 
<br/>game of numbers.  Until yesterday, the turf was yours, today it is ours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Tomorrow it will be ours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- We will use it to define and deliver.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  let  me  congratulate  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  all  my  Cabinet 
<br/>colleagues upon appointment as a Government of Fiji.  We are fully aware of the great responsibility 
<br/>we have undertaken, including the promises we have made, our capacity to deliver the same, and the 
<br/>expectations  it  has  raised  in  our  people,  including  those  on  the  Opposition  benches,  who  have 
<br/>forgotten theirs and are talking about us.  Welcome to the change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to congratulate honourable Members of this Parliament upon their 
<br/>election and let me wish each and every one of them a fruitful tenure of office.  The Parliament is the 
<br/>highest court in the land, it is a place of dignity and decorum, and let us respect and recognise the 
<br/>high  standards  set  out  by  our  elder  statesmen  and  work  towards  enhancing  the  same.    It  is  an 
<br/>institution not to legislate only, but a place of advocacy of public interest, and that equates to the 
<br/>maxim.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very humbled to have a seat in this Parliament and be the voice of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people who have chosen me to be here.  Therefore, I want to give credit to whom credit is due.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand proudly in this august Parliament today as a result of the endorsement 
<br/>of the </span><span>Bose Vanua ko Nabukebuke</span><span> and the blessings of the </span><span>Turaga Bale na Vunivalu na Tui Nam</span><span>osi.  
<br/>Hence,  I would  like to  express  my  sincere gratitude to  all my  loyal supporters in  the province of 
<br/>Namosi and most important of all my high chief, </span><span>na Turaga Bale na Vunivalu na Tui Namosi</span><span>.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my story is one of many thousands.  I have had all facets of life since my 
<br/>upbringing.  I was born and raised as a simple village boy and began my primary education at Nakavu 
<br/>Village School before completing it at Deuba District School.  I continue my secondary education at 
<br/>Queen Victoria School in Tailevu.  After completing my secondary education, I pursued my tertiary 
<br/>studies  at  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  and  graduated  with  a  Bachelor  of  Arts  Degree  in 
<br/>Accounting and Economics and Masters in Business Administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir upon completion of my studies, I joined the workforce as a secondary school 
<br/>teacher  and  later  worked  for  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  before  my  last  employment  at  Housing 
<br/>Authority.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  struggles  and  challenges  I  went  through  and  the  overwhelming 
<br/>support I have received has made me more prepared to serve the people of our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency’s Address was visionary that outlined the key mandates of 
<br/>this Coalition Government to work and achieve what is in the best interests of our people.  I would 
<br/></span><span>like  to  express  my  support  to  His  Excellency’s  sentiments  on  the  re-establishment  of  the  Great 
<br/></span><span>Council of Chiefs.  This is the true leadership that we have chosen to move forward with the people, 
<br/>then to be in solitude. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had alluded earlier, I hail from a province where agriculture is the main 
<br/>source  of  livelihood.    I  am  grateful  and  fully  support  the  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises 
<br/>(MSME) Bill that will be finalised to serve the local and export trade.  This direction gives hope to

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the people who toil the land every day, and what better way to reward their hard work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters still evident 
<br/>in our societies, it is imperative that we work in unity, building our nation to be resilient and have 
<br/>the ability to recover more efficiently and continue to progress, despite the many challenges we may 
<br/>come across. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the line Minister for Local Government, I stand by the commitment to 
<br/>serve every individual with 13 Municipalities around Fiji, we take pride in this vision and the very 
<br/>reason of our existence.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the main policy directions that was highlighted by 
<br/>His Excellency was the municipal council elections.  The preparation is already underway following 
<br/>Cabinet’s endorsement on 31</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023.  Let me remind this august Parliament that the last 
<br/>municipal  election  was  held  in  2005,  almost  two  decades  ago.    Where  is  the  democracy  that  the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government so highly speak about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  September  2014,  honourable  Bala  promised  the  nation,  council  election  when  he  took 
<br/>office  and  this  was  his  statement  to  the  media,  and  I  quote  from  the  Fiji  Village  article  on  25</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2014: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The new Local Government, Housing and Environment Minister, Praveen Bala 
<br/>said, his immediate task is to see that municipal council elections take place around the 
<br/>country, he said he has been involved in the Local Government ministry for the last 20 
<br/>years and should not have any problems in carrying out his duties.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last Government gave empty promises, whilst the People’s Coalition Government takes 
<br/>action.  Within three months, I want the Opposition to listen carefully – we will have a clear plan for 
<br/>our Council elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- We will not give excuses… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Are you going to deliver?
