<h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3>
<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, on Thursday 30</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, I informed Parliament of two things, that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had approved honourable Bala’s request to present his evidence on Monday. 11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2023; and 
<br/>I had received official communication from honourable Sashi Kiran on a matter of 
<br/></span><span>prima  facie</span><span>  breach  of  Parliamentary  Privilege  by  the  honourable  Member,  that  is, 
<br/>honourable Parveen Bala, and that I would address the matter at a later date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I will now address Parliament on my: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ruling on the evidence submitted by honourable Bala; 
<br/>Instruction on the matter raised by honourable Sashi Kiran; and  
<br/>Ruling on the official communication from honourable Ketan Lal with respect to the 
<br/>alleged breach of privilege by honourable Charan J. Singh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Submission of Evidence – Hon. P.K. Bala 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  having  reviewed  and  assessed  the  evidence  submitted  by  the 
<br/>honourable Bala, I am satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to support the statement he made in the 
<br/>Parliament.  Therefore, I hereby rule that the matter will not be referred to the Privileges Committee 
<br/>and this is the end of this matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Matter of Privilege - Hon. S. Kiran 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the official communication from honourable Sashi Kiran on a matter 
<br/>of </span><span>prima facie </span><span>breach of Parliamentary Privilege by honourable Parveen Bala, please, kindly take 
<br/>note that I have instructed for legal opinion and, therefore, I will deliver my Ruling on the matter at 
<br/>a later date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, for your information and I seek your forbearance on this, it takes a 
<br/></span><span>while to get an opinion because of the so many cases that are before the Solicitor-General’s Office.  
<br/>I hope you will bear with that because it is quite a prolonged case, just to await for legal opinion to 
<br/>come through so as to ensure that we are always transparent in what we do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Breach of Privilege - Hon. C.J. Singh  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On another matter, honourable Members, I have received official notification on Tuesday, 
<br/>12</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 from honourable Ketan Lal, raising a matter of privilege pursuant to Standing 
<br/></span><span>Order 134.  The matter of privilege is against the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and 
<br/></span><span>Sugar  Industry  with  respect  to  his  comment  when  responding  to  a  question  on  Monday,  11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2023, where he referred to honourable Lal as a “bloody small kid”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I have duly perused the Uncorrected </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>of Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September,  2023,  specifically  on  page  1631  and  on  the  face  of  the  uncorrected  transcript,  I  am 
<br/>satisfied that honourable Singh uttered those words.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, I hereby rule that honourable Singh must withdraw the words, “bloody small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kid”, and I further rule that the matter will not be referred to the Privileges Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the honourable Singh to withdraw the words, “bloody small kid”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw that comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  That statement is withdrawn, honourable Lal, and honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members of the Opposition.  Please take note that, that is the end of the matter. 
<br/></span></div>
