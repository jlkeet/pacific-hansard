<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  seeing  an  economy  that  has  rebounded 
<br/>strongly and the momentum is expected to continue.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  ...the  labour  market  has  recovered  strongly  and  the  tight 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>market is naturally pushing up wages which is benefiting our workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very slow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are looking at more reforms to entice new investments 
<br/>and new sectors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that will create more and better paying jobs.  The Government has 
<br/>generally provided a renewed sense of optimism and confidence to our investor community.  We can 
<br/>see that quiet evidently, we are in the process of reversing some of the policies, for example just this 
<br/>week we have reversed the policy on retirement age of local government workers from 55 years to 
<br/>60  years  and  in  the  next  calendar  year,  the  people  of  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  know  about  the 
<br/>review process with respect to the National Living Minimum Wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion let me say that honourable Sharma’s statement was based on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generalisation without any evidence, he linked crime rate to this and that... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...so it was all over the place. The Government, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, is firmly focused on looking after our most vulnerable, the policies announced in the 2023-2024 
<br/>Budget and as I said earlier the Government is firmly in control of the situation. We want to assure 
<br/>the  people  of  this  country  that  no  one  is  going  to  be  left  behind  in  terms  of  the  policies  that  the 
<br/></span><span>Government has pursued as part of our Budget and what we will pursue in the future. Thank you, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour Mobility 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you, for giving me the opportunity to talk on 
<br/>the important  topic of labour mobility.  A lot of us have been talking about it for some time now.  I 
<br/>think during the end of last year and at the beginning of this year, there were lots of concerns about 
<br/>the issue of labour mobility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour mobility, as we all know, is just about geographical movement of labour, or people 
<br/>working and moving from one area to another, or occupational movement, where people move from 
<br/>one occupation to another.  We know that it is always a function of supply and demand.  If a certain 
<br/>area in a country or a certain type of business want certain people, there is a lot of demand, then 
<br/>people will move towards that type of occupation.  So that happens all over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1931 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes that supply and demand, people are prepared to move to one country or one place 
<br/>to another because there is a demand from the other side, and sometimes, some people under the 
<br/>lower scale might be thinking, “I should move because last year, before I voted, I was promised $5 
<br/>per hour and all of a sudden when the Government comes in, the people who said they are going to 
<br/>raise the minimum wage rate to $5, did not do it, and that does not happen.”  Then they will realise, 
<br/>that is  hypocrisy.   “I  am promised something, as soon  they get  into Government,  they talk  about 
<br/>hypocrisy, but they do not deliver it after nine months in office.  Maybe I should pack up my bags 
<br/>and go.”  Maybe those are some of the ways that people have been thinking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those sorts of supply and demand issues are something that compel or push 
<br/>labour mobility.  Also, in other countries there are aging societies, where a lot more people are older 
<br/>and they are not producing enough people to replace their labour supply.  We have all these things 
<br/>happening, the growth of globalisation and in some of these countries a lot of their workers have 
<br/>become lazy.  One of the things we see now is that, a lot of our workers who are going to Australia, 
<br/>are going into the areas where Australians themselves do not want to go - the rural areas.  That may 
<br/>be because, they have a lot of welfare, so to assist the people who are unemployed, which means they 
<br/>still earn money that makes them lazy to go and do the work, they need people to come from other 
<br/>countries, and this is something you will find all over the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People go from one country to another to do a particular kind of employment, it is a flow, and 
<br/>other people come in to  replace them from somewhere else.  So there is  a constant movement of 
<br/>people in this whole issue of labour mobility.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour mobility is not something 
<br/>new in Fiji.  Over the past few decades, and past few 100 years, we might say that even within Fiji, 
<br/>we have seen mobility.  People are moving from rural areas to urban areas, around different parts of 
<br/>Fiji.   People  changing  jobs from  one job  to  another in  Suva or moving from Lautoka to Suva or 
<br/>Labasa to Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mass migration from Labasa to Suva is an example of labour mobility over the years, and 
<br/>people are beginning to change occupations.  We have seen, for instance, these past few years, people 
<br/>who are formally qualified to become teachers or professionals have been moving out leaving one 
<br/>occupation to another.  This morning when I came into the office, I met one of my good friends here, 
<br/>who was vacuum cleaning, because, as you have mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of people in this 
<br/>Parliament, your staff are doing three jobs at once, because people have moved out of Parliament.  
<br/>Those are the kinds of things that we are finding in Fiji.  These are some of the trends that we have 
<br/>seen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour mobility has been exacerbated over the past few years to a large extent by people with 
<br/></span><span>lower-level  types  of  jobs,  especially,  with  the  surge  in  this  seasonal  employment  programmes, 
<br/>particularly, in Australia and New Zealand.  Over the past few years, we have seen the development 
<br/>of  Recognise  Seasonal  Employment  Programme,  the  Seasonal  Workers  Programme,  the  Pacific 
<br/>Labour Scheme and now we have the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme, coupled with the 
<br/>eHub Programme in which Australia allows people to come and study and work at the same time.  
<br/>The  vast  numbers  of  our  people  have  gone  onto  this  particular  programme.    So,  it  has  been 
<br/>exacerbated over the past few years.  So, you have this internal mobility within the country and then 
<br/>you have the mobility offshore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of our people have been moving for a long time, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I think honourable 
<br/>Ravunawa came back from Mongolia and he met about 30 teachers, people who teach English in 
<br/>Mongolia, interesting.  I know that we have our people in Japan who are teaching English and other 
<br/>things, we know that all over the Pacific, our professionals are taking up a lot of jobs all over the 
<br/>Pacific so there is a demand for these skills from Fiji.  Fiji has become what the Australians used to 
<br/>be in the Pacific - we have sort of taken over that role.  We are providing the specialist people as

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>experts in different fields to various countries all over the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have been listening to the debates and what we have been talking about 
<br/>in Parliament this week, there was a comment I think earlier when we were talking about something 
<br/>on  those  airports  in  Nadi  or  Civil  Aviation,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Gavoka  and 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica highlighted the loss of our aviation experts in CAAF because 
<br/>of their abilities and capabilities.  There have been demands for their service, so they have moved 
<br/>out over the years.  There was earlier this week a question on the loss of nurses in the health sector.  
<br/>The nurses are not only moving within the country one of the reason is because we are saying our 
<br/>growing private sector health establishment especially around Nadi and parts of Suva. So you can 
<br/>see  there  are  more  opportunities  for  these  nurses  and  they  begin  to  move  around.    It  gives 
<br/>opportunities for them but it also creates problems from the places that they are leaving, to their initial 
<br/>places of employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a question on the loss of nurses and I think if I am not mistaken honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister Prof. Biman Prasad mentioned earlier this week that we have lost 10 percent of our 
<br/>workforce on Tuesday but I am not too sure what that timeline is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Last 18 months 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Last 18 months which is a big number, so it is a big number of people 
<br/>that are moving from one part of Fiji to the next and I also saw the written question that was done by 
<br/>honourable Pio Tikoduadua about the number of people that have left from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> August 
<br/>this year - 3,650 left for  education and training, 5,552 for employment and 1,946 for migrating.  So, 
<br/>the numbers are quite substantive in terms of people moving around all over the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not totally a bad thing, there are a lot of good benefits that will come 
<br/>out of this.  Remittances have really grown, remittances if my figures are correct here, I was looking 
<br/>at a report from the UN World Food Programme where they are telling us that in 2022 the remittances 
<br/>had reached about $1.04 billion which amounts to about 9.4 percent of nominal GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Almost one-tenth of the total wealth that we have in this country comes from the work of 
<br/>people  that  are  offshore,  one-tenth  that  is  a  significant  amount.    They  have  noticed  also  in  that 
<br/>programme that in the first months of this year once again I think the amount of money that is coming 
<br/>from remittances if I am not mistaken for the month of March was more than it was the previous 
<br/>year.  So, it is  increasing,  the trend is  increasing  which is  a reflection maybe that there are more 
<br/></span><span>leaving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- $700 million… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So, these are the kinds of things that are happening and that I think is 
<br/>one of the positive effects of labour mobility.  There are some countries in the world who actually 
<br/>target labour mobility.  If you go all over the world you will find people in the Philippines they have 
<br/>a national setup where they get people trained specifically to go and work overseas and I think you 
<br/>have seen that from Kiribati we have our sailors all over the world.  They have these setups. They go 
<br/></span><span>for each; they push for it.  I think maybe one of the reason for that is the level of unemployment they 
<br/></span><span>might be having in their own countries.  That is one way we can look at labour mobility because we 
<br/>can see the actual benefit from it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in Fiji we have not really decided to pursue this kind of overseas labour mobility like 
<br/>they have done in the Philippines, and I think there is going to be a key question for government to 
<br/>ponder about our reaction and our approach to this because we also are aware of the negative impacts 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1933 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of labour mobility.  Of course, the money that comes in has an impact on the families, has an impact 
<br/>on the people that live here but there are also negative impacts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I heard some of our friends talking about this side of the Parliament we are talking about the 
<br/>fact  that  now  it  is  becoming  increasingly  hard  to  get  people  who  are  sales  reps,  merchandisers, 
<br/>customers officers who are customer service officers.  So, when there is shortage of these people we 
<br/>are beginning to see wage inflation in some of these occupations. If you want a certain person with a 
<br/>certain skill you have to increase the amount of money that you pay that can have an impact on our society 
<br/>- wage inflation, shortage of skills so there is a need for us to be able to address the negative impacts of 
<br/>this labour mobility. So,  on the  one  hand  you have the benefits  and on the other hand you  have the 
<br/>negative impacts of it and of course, sometimes you have the social problems that come with it. There is 
<br/>something that we need to ponder in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must have ways (Government and us combined) that we can benefit from the positive impacts 
<br/>and at the same time, minimise the negative impacts - the shortage of skills, the social issues that come 
<br/>with it.  I think the question for us in Fiji is to decide how we are going to work with this labour mobility 
<br/>issue.  Labour mobility is like a river, and you cannot stop it.  We cannot say that we pull out of it because 
<br/>it is peoples’ right - if they want to work somewhere else for them to go but as a country, as a nation and 
<br/>as a Government, we need to be able to manage it so that we can benefit from its benefits and minimise 
<br/>the negative impacts that it has on our country. I look forward to the Government coming forward to 
<br/>suggest ways we can work together to try to answer these questions and address these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker.  I would like to thank the 
<br/>honourable Usamate for answering half of the contribution I was supposed to make  - he has already 
<br/>covered half of it. We all know, there are two sides to a coin - the negatives and the positives. He has 
<br/>described the positive, and he also described the negative, but the thing is planning and doing things 
<br/>better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we say this in any country is very important to have a Human Resources Development 
<br/>Plan  (HRDP).  A  Human Resources Development  Plan is  done by getting the stakeholders together.  
<br/>When the stakeholders come together, the employers’ federation, the education providers, the training 
<br/>providers all come together - we look at our needs, plan our needs and then we train our people.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must say that our problem in past years has been (and I will just look at one sector - education) 
<br/>through the Loan Scheme people got all sorts of qualifications which were already flooded in the job 
<br/>market.  And then there were subject areas where there were no teachers so there was hardly any planning 
<br/></span><span>done, people just went, chose their course, and did it.  What we are doing now through our scholarship 
<br/></span><span>scheme is to make sure that there are categories of people entering the tertiary institutions including the 
<br/>skills, trades and then going up to engineering and the rest of it.  That is the way to go inasfar as planning 
<br/>and preparing your human capital is concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  issue  of  course,  the  positive  side  of  labour  mobility  as  honourable  Usamate  has 
<br/>alluded to, is that it has been there for hundreds of years ever since we can remember, and it will continue 
<br/>to be there.  Some countries have gained a lot through exporting labour, and we are in that business now.  
<br/>Our people are going, we are getting remittances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important for us to make sure that our people who go out there and get jobs especially on 
<br/>work permits, are treated fairly; and are given minimum terms and conditions equal to the people of the 
<br/>country that they are working in - the locals), that is very important. Also, we want to see that when they 
<br/>come back, they come back with some added skills, and they are able to better contribute.  We have seen 
<br/>these examples where our people have gone, work and come back - they have improved their standard of 
<br/>living for their families and that is a very positive move.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those who migrate, of course, they leave those gaps I have alluded to how we must fill those 
<br/>gaps and the honourable Minister for Education has yesterday very aptly described how the Ministry 
<br/>is planning to develop the Education sector to make sure that the tertiary institutions are providing 
<br/>the  right  type  of  education,  right  from  skills  to  professionals.  The  Education  Summit  is  going  to 
<br/>address those issues, so these are the plans we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we will continue with this 
<br/>conversation as we go along.
