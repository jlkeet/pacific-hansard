<h3>HERITAGE BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>HERITAGE BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Heritage Bill 2023 be considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must immediately be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rights; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the November Sitting of Parliament upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presentation of Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament at the November Sitting, and that one 
<br/>hour be given to debate on the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, as you would have observed, I had tabled a motion 
<br/>in this august Parliament on Tuesday, that the Heritage Bill 2023 be debated and voted upon without 
<br/>delay. We heard the views of our colleagues and views from the other side and found merit in their 
<br/>views.  We have the existing Heritage Bill 2023 be referred to the Standing Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we listen and took heed of their views although this Bill has been a subject 
<br/>of many, many discussions over the years since 2016. We considered, we did not ignore and humbly 
<br/>made the decision to withdraw our motion to accommodate request from the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to emphasise the point here because that is how laws in a country 
<br/>are  made.    We  are  not  ignorant  but  we  are  here  to  work  together  for  the  benefit  of  our  people. 
<br/></span><span>Therefore, I rise to add to what I have highlighted on Tuesday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Heritage is something that is treasured to all of us, a country in the Pacific that 
<br/>is both diverse and strategically placed in the South Pacific. Fiji is rich with culture and diversity 
<br/>while at the same time maintain strong links to our traditions and heritage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Convention  concerning  the  Protection  of  World  Council  National 
<br/>Heritage which was adopted at the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization 
<br/>(UNESCO) General Conference in 1972 on the 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 1990. It is one such international 
<br/></span><span>instrument that specifically identifies or recognises the preservation of fiscal structures and sites.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a member State, Fiji is required to adopt the legislative and administrative provisions to 
<br/>give effect to the World Heritage Convention. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/>provides for the domestic application of the World Heritage Convention in Fiji.  No changes have 
<br/>been made to the Bill as tabled on Tuesday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and each honourable Members would 
<br/>have a copy.  It is my prayer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that given my motion this morning, this august
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1935 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will agree to support my motion so there is no further delay in deliberating an important 
<br/>proposed law for us. I, therefore, commend the Bill to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I think there is only just one speaker from this side and I 
<br/>will not be long. Just to assure the Honourable Attorney General that yes, we do support it, I think. 
<br/>We want to thank the government also for listening to what was said the other day with respect to 
<br/>the Heritage Bill. It is important, it is about Fiji, and we understand all the technicalities that actually 
<br/>go on. This is a Bill that was instigated by us in the first place and I think it is important that we do 
<br/>realise that it has to do with Fiji and it has to do with our commitments that we have also made with 
<br/>respect to UNESCO and World Heritage sites, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to give a little background on the two, they were quite a few observations that came out 
<br/>of visits by the previous Standing Committee - Tui Levuka and this is why we intend to take a little 
<br/>bit long nevertheless Sir, as somebody who is also a Member of the Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights. I have spoken to my Chair and we will endeavour to have this back as quickly as 
<br/>possible and do the necessary work that needs to be undertaken before the November Session Sir. 
<br/>So,  you  have  our  support  with  respect  to  getting  it  done  as  quickly  as  possible.  Thank  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the unanimous decision to support the Bill, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have no right of reply but I commend the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Heritage Bill 2023 referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I am sorry, Sir.  Can I just raise a Point of Order? Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, can I just raise a Point of Order under Standing Order 74(1) on the practices of Parliament and I 
<br/>hope I can qualify under 80 as well just to make a personal explanation and perhaps on prohibited 
<br/></span><span>reference as well on 62.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Statement made by the honourable Minister for Finance when making his reply to the 
<br/>End of Week Statement, I will be waiting for the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily Hansard</span><span>, Sir.  He used the term 
<br/>“looted”  - This  is  the government  that looted the workers of this  country by utilising  their FNPF 
<br/>savings.  I am concerned about the use of the word “looted” the workers of this country. I find that 
<br/>as  improper  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  place  it  on  record  before  we  adjourn  this  meeting.    It  is 
<br/>entirely up to you, Sir, on your ruling, so I leave it to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you have anything to say to that, honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- All I said, Mr. Speaker, was in reference to the FNPF Pension 
<br/>Act, that is a fact.  That was a Government that made the decision - the Bainimarama Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adjournment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Did you use the word “looted”?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.  C.  PRASAD.-  Yes,  I  used  the  word  “looted”  it  was  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>government that passed the Decree and terminated the FNPF workers’ contracts and they lost pension 
<br/>and they had no recourse to go back to the court because there was another decree which did not even 
<br/>allow that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was what I said, and I stand by that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  take  note  of  that  concern  raised  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the Opposition,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I am on the floor, see that leads me to what I was about to say as well 
<br/>after the adjournment motion and that is, if it is possible during this break to November.  Honourable 
<br/>Members, please take heed of the difficult task of trying to allow debate to free flow in this august 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, you should be mindful of the decision that we both make here through the 
<br/>Business Committee, that is the “Timing Element” that presents here how we address the timing of 
<br/>each participant to participate effectively in the debate. I will want to put on record the intention that 
<br/>I have in mind, and this will be brought about in the usual manner through the Business Committee 
<br/>and that is, I will give 30 seconds countdown every time we do debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is just like attending an international meeting.  You are still on the floor, the speaker will 
<br/>be giving you 30 seconds countdown, when the countdown finishes at the zero time then you are 
<br/>required to sit down even though you still have a lot on your table to present. I think I have been 
<br/>lenient in allowing people to go over on both sides of the Parliament. But we should be mindful of 
<br/>the effects that that will have on the timing of the sitting of the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
