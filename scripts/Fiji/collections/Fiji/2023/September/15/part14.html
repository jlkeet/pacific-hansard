<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with 
<br/>a  10-minute  response  time  by  the  Minister  or  Ministers  responsible  for  the  subject  matter  of  the 
<br/>Member’s speech.  No seconder is required and there will be no further debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma  to  deliver  his  End  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Week Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase of National Minimum Wage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I start, last night when I left Parliament, my 
<br/>vehicle had an issue. I would like to sincerely thank those Police Officers who approached and helped 
<br/>me out and I safely got home. I would like to sincerely thank them, there were 10 of them who came 
<br/>up last night.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  End  of  Week  Statements  on  the  matter  of 
<br/>increasing of minimum wage rate, this to be reviewed.  The Statement would highlight the increase 
<br/>in cost of living and why there is a need to increase the National Minimum Wage Rate for our people 
<br/>as it is a very pressing issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thousands of Fijians will agree with me, I can keep my hand on my heart 
<br/>and confidently say, that this Coalition Government is like a sinking </span><span>Titanic</span><span> in radioactive waters.  
<br/>The wage  rate in  Fiji,  Fiji’s first  ever National  Minimum Wage Rate was introduced in  2014 for 
<br/>unskilled workers at $2 an hour.  Since then, the rate has been increased twice, first to $2.32 an hour 
<br/>in 2015 and then again at $2.68 an hour in 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following a national wide consultation process, the National Minimum Wage Rate will now 
<br/>be increased to $4 per hour in four trenches.  The subsequent or gradual increase is taking a realistic 
<br/>approach.  Effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2022, the National Minimum Wage Rate increased from $2.68 
<br/>to $3.01 an hour and further increased to $3.34 per hour in July 2022, and then to $3.67 per hour.  
<br/>Finally, $4 per hour by January 2023; subsequent and gradual increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen some honourable Members on the other side, they have said 
<br/>previously about $5 wages immediately as a package that will be done for the people of this country, 
<br/></span><span>but then 15 percent VAT was imposed on our people.  We have a very historic Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring our attention to the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>because we have him on record saying that the cost of living is too high, and VAT is high as well.  
<br/>He also said that businesses are compliant and freight cost is coming down, but our goal is to provide 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>  Editor’s Note:  Reply to Written Question No. 145/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Social Protection under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure II.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1925 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the people and that is our loyalty.  But the businesses’ loyalty is their profits.  Businesses will 
<br/>still, most of them actually will still keep the prices same or even increase their profits, despite the 
<br/>VAT increase, and that is why cost of living is very high. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022, again, the honourable Minister of Finance said that he 
<br/>estimates that 50 percent of the Fijians are struggling to put food on the table.  Coming to this year, 
<br/>the Coalition Government speaks about the importance of public consultations.  Of course, it is very 
<br/>important, but I ask the people of this country if the cost of living is high and an increase in VAT is 
<br/>what you wanted?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  seen  the  outcomes  of  the  National  Economic  Summit,  there  were  various 
<br/>consultations and what was the outcome?  The cost of living is high, because this is a collective issue.   
<br/>Thousands of Fijians are having difficulties to meet basic necessities, and thousands of Fijians are 
<br/>struggling to buy food, water, clothes, health and sanitation items.  The struggle of the Fijian people 
<br/>is real under the Coalition Government, knowing that we have just come out of a pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  farmers  are  struggling.    Some  students  who  were  on  TELS  have 
<br/>messaged me and shared their pressing concerns.  To my surprise, some have left their studies and 
<br/>are working.  Some are studying and working till late at night.  Some said that they can afford only 
<br/>one or two light meals per day.  I encourage academic challenges for the youth of this country, but 
<br/>here, the students are in a survival challenge.  How do we survive and still move on in life and build 
<br/>life?  This is the state that our young people are living in right now.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people are  also  concerned  and worried, they cannot  afford food  and 
<br/>neither can they get food from the ocean. What  do they eat?  Where do they go? And like I said 
<br/>previously, </span><span>na idhar ke, na udhar ke</span><span> - this is where the people are left to be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijian families are being pushed into a pool of poverty with a high cost of 
<br/>living.  Poverty has many dimensions, but its cause include unemployment, social exclusion, high 
<br/>vulnerability of certain population or communities to disasters, diseases which is another phenomena 
<br/>which prevents them from being productive. We are very grateful we have not seen a natural disaster.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many reasons but in short because as human beings, our wellbeing 
<br/>is linked to each other and growing in equality is detrimental to the economic growth and undermine 
<br/>social  cohesion,  increasingly  political  and  social  tension  and  in  some  circumstances  driving 
<br/>instability and conflict.  The high cost of living has obviously and realistically increased the crime 
<br/></span><span>rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the pursuit to steal and feed yourself, people have ended up in a battle with the person they 
<br/>are  trying  to  rob  and  actually  an  act  of  violence  and  some  people  have  lost  their  lives.    If  I  can 
<br/>remember, a senior citizen in Vuda was stabbed by the person trying to rob a house and yesterday I 
<br/>heard in Koronivia that someone has been murdered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the real issues our people are facing.  Sir, EFL and Water Authority have put in 
<br/>submissions to FCCC to review the tariff rate.  This will be an added burden with the VAT increase.  
<br/></span><span>Parents are struggling to feed their children especially their babies.  Sir, SMA milk is $31.50, S26 
<br/></span><span>(Step 1) is $50, S26 (Step 2) is around $52.95; extremely expensive conditions we are living in and 
<br/>not all babies can drink Red Cow Milk because most end up vomiting and get sick. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Fijians are forced to be living on products like tinned tuna, high number 
<br/>of sodium and loaves of bread.  If you go for white bread, that is bleached flour; when you go for 
<br/>white sugar that is bleached sugar.  This contributes to the NCDs which will put pressure on our
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>health system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this raises the question that when our health is in danger and if one cannot 
<br/>feed themselves with the high cost of living under this Coalition Government, in what capacity will 
<br/>the Fijian people be able to afford medication?  A broken heart, an empty stomach and an empty 
<br/>wallet  teaches  you  a  lot  in  life.    It  can  make  one  do  unimaginable  things  but  here  our  Coalition 
<br/>Government has achieved all three.  People said, “change is here” - all right.  Your government, but 
<br/>they have increased the cost of living, and this has broken people’s hearts and hopes. The high cost 
<br/>of living, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has caused people not being able to afford meals, here you end up with 
<br/>an empty stomach and the high cost of living is where Fijians have to drain and empty their wallets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The primary purpose of reviewing the increase of minimum wage as soon as possible is to 
<br/>provide  our  hard-working  Fijian  workers  with  a  level  of  income  that  allows  them  to  meet  their 
<br/>essential needs. It acts as a safeguard against the high cost of living and helps reduce poverty and 
<br/>income inequality within our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is moving forward, but they are moving forward 
<br/>just like a person running on a treadmill.  They are running but they are at the same place.  On behalf 
<br/>of our thousands of struggling Fijians and Fijian families, I sincere ask the Coalition Government to 
<br/>stop focusing on fulfilling the Coalition Agreement and focus on the people of Fiji by reviewing the 
<br/>National Minimum Wages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  concerns  of  our  people  matter,  the  voices  of  our  people  matter,  the 
<br/>livelihoods of our people matter.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government does not move the economy, it 
<br/>is the Fijian people, and this will only happen if they are given the buying power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I would like to urge the Government to review the National 
<br/>Minimum Wage because it is an achievement both sides of Parliament will celebrate because  the 
<br/>people of this country will be the ones winning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>statement.  As I have said during my Budget Response, there is a very well-fitting Hindi saying that 
<br/>describes the Opposition strategy or maybe should I say Opposition hypocrisy in Parliament for the 
<br/>last seven months especially on the issue of minimum wage and the saying, Mr. Speaker, is </span><span>ulta chor 
<br/>kotwal ko daante</span><span> or the thief blaming the Police. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  One  of  the  worst  examples  of  hypocrisy,  coming  from  a 
<br/>Member  of  a  party  that  was  in  Government,  eroded  workers’  rights  and  nullified  collective 
<br/>agreements  between  the  unions  that  represented  them  and  the  employers  which  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government is and will restore, and give true meaning to collective bargaining and not minimum 
<br/>wage but a living wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Sharma  needs  to  be  reminded  that  it  took  the  Bainimarama 
<br/></span><span>government eight years to just even introduce a National Minimum Wage and that of only $2 just 
<br/></span><span>prior  to  the  2014  elections.    Then,  Mr.  Speaker,  it  took  another  eight  long  years  for  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government to gradually raise the minimum wage to $4 per hour.  Again, not surprisingly it was an 
<br/>election year… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- 2012 we started.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1927 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  … and that is where we are right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have an Opposition in Parliament which in government until last December 
<br/>ruled with an iron fist in respect of trampling upon workers’ rights and just wages.  Now, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>they are shedding crocodile tears trying to be the champion of workers.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- One wonders whether an Opposition Member of Parliament 
<br/>who engages workers who are unskilled, work on casual basis and even pays the basic minimum 
<br/>wage rate of $4 an hour.  In fact, we are verifying this information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Speaker, these are the same people who deprived our 
<br/>workers  off  their  fundamental  rights,  the  same  people  who  destroyed  the  successful  tripartite 
<br/>arrangement that we have had in Fiji for many years , the same group who terrorised our workers 
<br/>representatives and leaders and the same people, Mr. Speaker, they looted the workers by forcing 
<br/>them to use their FNPF funds during the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Yet, they now want to come here and lecture us about just 
<br/>and fair minimum wages.  This is hypocrisy of the highest order that I am talking about.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>it is us who have in fact advocated for a just and fair living wage for our people.  In fact, it was our 
<br/>endless pressure on them when they were in government that led to the FijiFirst finally raising the 
<br/>minimum wage rate in 2022 in four tranches to $4.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the 2018 election campaign, the NFP as well as SODEPLA at that time, we advocated 
<br/>for a living wage of $5 and hour. However, Mr. Speaker, this is a truth, we were ridiculed throughout 
<br/>the country by then FijiFirst government with the charge led by the former Attorney-General and 
<br/>Minister for Economy who accused us of trying to bankrupt the economy and forced the closure of 
<br/>large businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meetings were organised in garment factories by the textile and footwear industries where 
<br/>the former Attorney-General campaigned amongst workers and threatened that if they vote for NFP, 
<br/></span><span>if they vote for Biman Prasad or SODELPA, and if the NFP and SODELPA came into government 
<br/></span><span>and implemented the living wage of $5 an hour, everyone will lose their jobs.  We were also accused 
<br/>of playing politics when we stated that the NFP would increase the list of zero-rated items and lower 
<br/>duties on the food products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was always our policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to increase the minimum and to zero rate VAT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on a much larger list of essential items than the six items that they had in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- How about the 15 percent VAT, people are suffering.  Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  You  will  see  that  in  the  NFP  Manifesto  in  2018,  we  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>campaigned for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- People are suffering honourable Biman! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Fear mongering, crusade to scare workers of job losses,

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spreading fear that businesses will close and economy would be destroyed, with hyper inflation and 
<br/>unemployment worked for them in 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Tell them, tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just prior to 2022 election, when they 
<br/>realised that they were about to lose the elections, suddenly they announced an increase in minimum 
<br/>wage to $4 and zero- rated 21 items. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You are there because of SODELPA, do not fly high.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they picked up the whole list that we 
<br/>had provided in our manifesto without even changing it.  We definitely liked that, they copied our 
<br/>policy but we definitely have no time for such hypocrisy that is coming from the other side.  We 
<br/>know that they are on the other side, but in fact, honourable Sharma should realise that he is part of 
<br/>a  party  that  actually  betrayed  the  nation,  our  people  and  workers  in  this  country.    Soon,  we  are 
<br/>systematically since we have come into Government in the last seven months… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Where is the $5 minimum wage, when will you introduce it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …we have restored the workers’ rights,  there is  optimism, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is freedom… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and unions and employers are working together.  We have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>always championed workers’ rights and the tripartite approach to dealing with labour issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  2023-2024  Budget,  the  Coalition  Government  clearly  announced  the  review  of  the 
<br/>current minimum wage of $4, we clearly announced it. We want our workers to receive a fair and 
<br/>just living wage through a proper consultative process.   Let me repeat this, the Coalition Government 
<br/>is  determined  to  ensure  our  workers  receive  a  fair  and  just  living  wage  that  is  agreed  to  by  all 
<br/>stakeholders  through  a  proper  and  genuine  consultative  process,  not  in  an  haphazard  manner  or 
<br/>imposed on the workers or just before the election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have frequently elaborated on our grave economic woes resulting from the recklessness of 
<br/></span><span>the  previous  government.  It  is  because  of  their  gross  economic  mismanagement  that  we  have 
<br/></span><span>inherited a large public debt which had to be dealt with immediately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  A  crippled  infrastructure  requiring  urgent  attention  and  a 
<br/>divided society that has to be reunited.  The Government basically had very limited choice because 
<br/>of the mess we inherited.  We acted quickly and decisively to tackle the debt problem.  We had no 
<br/>choice but to increase taxes.  Otherwise, the consequences of running into a debt crisis would have 
<br/></span><span>collapsed our economy and people would have suffered more badly for a much longer time.  We had 
<br/></span><span>to take the bitter pill to cure the disease, otherwise surgery at a later stage would  have been more 
<br/>difficult than painful.  While we try to address the debt problem, we made sure that our vulnerable 
<br/>are protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me point this out, we increased our social welfare payments by 25 percent for those above 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the age of 70 years and by 15 percent for those between 60 years and 69 years.  The budget for the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1929 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection was increased from $147.7 million to $200.2 
<br/>million; an increase of $52.5 million which benefitted more than 90,000 people who are now getting 
<br/>increased monthly allowances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our first few weeks in Government, the honourable Prime Minister and 
<br/>the Government delivered a $200 Back-to-School payment per child from households with an income 
<br/>of less than $50,000 benefitting over 223,000 children at a cost of $45 million.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>have again provided $45 million to continue with this initiative for the 2024 school year.  We have 
<br/>written $650 million in TELS, thanks to our Coalition partner, SODELPA, in bringing this policy.  
<br/>For over 53,000 students this means their families, the students will have more income, Sir, because 
<br/>it is not going to... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ..that is another measure in the Budget. We gave justice to 
<br/>FNPF workers which had their contracts terminated unilaterally and their pensions reduced.  So what 
<br/>we  have  done  effective  from  August  2023,  these  FNPF  Pensioners  are  now  able  to  access  the 
<br/>Government Social Pension Allowance of $125 if they are above the age of 70... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, would I ask that you pause for a while, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>while we try and address this housekeeping issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with Standing Order with respect to the 
<br/>sitting time and I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move her 
<br/>suspension motion.
