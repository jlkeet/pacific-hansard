<br/>Reply  to  Written  Question  No.  145/2023  tabled  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection (Ref. Page: 1922-1923)  
<br/></span><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to Question No. 145/2023 is as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, we do not have anyone that is regarded as homeless.  For the iTaukei men and women on 
<br/>our streets, they all belong to a family, to a village, to a </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, to a </span><span>yavusa</span><span>, to a province and 
<br/>therefore they cannot say that they are homeless.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot share the number for the last 10 years because this is the first initiative 
<br/>that was taken to actually profile all those that are living on our streets and identify pathways that 
<br/>can give them hope and a new life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please allow me to highlight that as of Friday, 8</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 there has been 178 profiled 
<br/>street dwellers in Suva, Lautoka and Nadi.  From the 178 profiled cases, 39 women were profiled 
<br/></span><span>and 55 children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are currently working together with other government stakeholders and NGOs to get them off 
<br/>the streets, identify shelters in which they can be assisted and empowered on a short term basis 
<br/>before they proceed to other programmes like Seed of Success, APTC short courses, joining the 
<br/>Youth Band or part of training schools like Nadave, Tutu and Navuso.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry assists single parents including single mothers under its household targeted 
<br/>programmes.  Of the Child Protection Allowance and the Family Assistance Scheme, at the 
<br/>moment, we are currently assisting a total of approximately 35,233 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are currently in the first phase of Social Protection Reform through our partnership with 
<br/>World Bank and DFAT where all our data will be digitalised.  Once our system is up and 
<br/>running, information such as gender, age group and other important details will be readily 
<br/>available as and when the need arises.
