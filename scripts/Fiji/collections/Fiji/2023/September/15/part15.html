<h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Standing Order 6 that so much of Standing Orders 23(1) be suspended so as to 
<br/>allow the Parliament to sit beyond 12.30 p.m. today so we can complete the remaining items 
<br/>on todayâ€™s  Order Paper. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  not 
<br/></span><span>anticipate we will be sitting much longer as we have only one more item on the Order Paper and that 
<br/>is the Consideration of Bills which I believe has been supported by both side of Parliament.  I beg 
<br/>the indulgence of honourable Members to stay on a little bit longer, understand there are those that 
<br/>need to leave and travel  back home or to other commitments but I ask Parliament to support this 
<br/>motion so that we can complete the last remaining item on the Order Paper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion, if 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since there is none, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak in reply if any as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing further.  Thank you.
