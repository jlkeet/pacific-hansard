<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to the final sitting for today.  I also welcome all who are 
<br/>joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet.  Thank 
<br/>you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament.

<div><span>International Day of Democracy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, today we celebrate the International Day of Democracy - a momentous 
<br/>occasion  that  invites  us  to  contemplate  the  bedrock  principles  of  democracy  and  their  enduring 
<br/></span><span>significance.  This important day was established through a resolution adopted by the United Nations 
<br/></span><span>General Assembly in 2007 and has been observed annually on 15</span><span>th</span><span> September since 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  year’s  International  Day  of  Democracy  theme,  “Empowering  the  Next  Generation”, 
<br/>focusses on the essential role of children and young people in safeguarding democracy today and in 
<br/>the future.  As we celebrate this day, let us be resolute in our commitment to democracy.  My appeal 
<br/>to all Fijians is to engage with Parliament and take advantage of the opportunities that are available, 
<br/>so as to participate meaningfully in decision-making.

<br/>in interpretation or meaning for the impact that it may have on some, if they want to ask where do 
<br/>we pull this from.  We did not pull it from the rugby field, it is from a similar State Government of 
<br/>Victoria.
