<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on how 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry is addressing the delay in the processing of vacancies for Health Officers?

<div><span>Member for his first Oral Question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Ministry has in place a recruitment plan based on the approved budget and that will ensure 
<br/>timely  filling  of  funded  vacancies.    These  vacancies  include  newly  created  positions,  regularised 
<br/>positions, selected vacant unfunded positions from previous Financial Years and vacant positions due to 
<br/>post-holders’ promotion, retirement, death, resignation, deemed resignation and termination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our HR team had conducted post-Budget awareness consultation sessions with all 13 core centres 
<br/>under  the  Ministry  covering  the  four  Divisional  Health  Services,  three  major  Hospitals,  two 
<br/>Specialized  Hospitals,  Fiji  Pharmaceutical  and  Biomedical  Services,  Public  Health  Programme, 
<br/>Health Protection; and Headquarters, to finalise positions to be filled based on the given budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  processing  of  vacancies,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthening its processes, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Advertisement of open vacancies which will allow for valid merit candidates. 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pool for 12 months to fill positions based on the Ministry’s need.  
<br/>Filling of vacant positions from the available valid merit pool 
<br/>Full  adoption  of  recruitment  online  through  Government’s  recruitment  portal  except  for 
<br/>medical positions 
<br/>Posting  of  medical  officers,  registered  nurses,  pharmacists  and  dental  officers  once  their 
<br/>completion of internship is confirmed. 
<br/>Creation of additional HR and corporate positions in all core centres to assist in the vacancies 
<br/>processing activities whenever required.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>positions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, one of the challenges that the Ministry faced in speeding up the recruitment 
<br/>and appointment of new staff members in the last financial year was the lack of Corporate staff within 
<br/>the Ministry to facilitate the necessary Civil Service-endorsed recruitment processes, because of civil 
<br/>service policies that existed prior to the Coalition Government taking office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  raised  our  concerns  during  the  budget  consultation  process  and  very  grateful  for 
<br/></span><span>Government’s budget approval in the 2023-2024 financial year for the Ministry to recruit essential 
<br/></span><span>corporate staff members who are critical in running the human resources management processes for 
<br/>the  Ministry.    The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  continues  to  align  its  recruitment 
<br/>processes to all relevant legislations and guidelines during this transitions period awaiting finalization 
<br/>of employment policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  a  very 
<br/>comprehensive answer.  Is the honourable Minister aware that there are 24 vacancies in the Radiology 
<br/>Department?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are graduates coming out of the Fiji National University (FNU) but they tend to enter 
<br/>the private sector because of the good salary offered.  Would the honourable Minister consider the 
<br/>plight of X-Ray technicians in the Ministry of Health because of the crucial role that they play?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Ravunawa  for  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supplementary question.  Yes, I agree in terms of graduates coming out from the tertiary institutions.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of work needs, there are always vacancies there.  The challenge with the Ministry 
<br/>right now is the opening of some of the new private facilities and they take most of the staff within 
<br/>the Ministry.  Another challenge within the Ministry is the planning process in terms of requesting 
<br/>tertiary intuitions to increase the number of intakes in terms of those cadre and also on how we can 
<br/>expand ourselves in terms of services for recruitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extension to the Agreement of Cooperation 
<br/>(Question No. 136/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on 
<br/>the Extension to the Agreement of Cooperation with the United Nations Human Settlements 
<br/>Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the question raised before this august Parliament this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Agreement  of  Cooperation  is  a  collaboration  established  in  2018 
<br/>between the Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Local Government and UN Habitat.  The collaboration 
<br/>was made after identifying the need for a programme that addresses the need tackle the frequency 
<br/>and intensity of extreme events, such as flooding, droughts, cyclones and long-term sea-level rise 
<br/>that negatively impact informal settlements around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Habitat and Ministry of Housing had prepared a proposal, increasing 
<br/>the resilience of informal urban settlements in Fiji that were highly vulnerable to climate change and 
<br/>disaster risks - the Adaptation Fund initially provided funding of US $299,000 for one year from 
<br/>2018 to 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2019  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  additional  activities  were  included  to  this  Agreement  of 
<br/>Corporation, that included the engagement of 2 consultants; supported the finalisation of community 
<br/>action  plans  and  identified  community  capacity  needs.    This  resulted  in  the  extension  of  the 
<br/>Agreement of Corporation for another year from 2019 to 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, the Agreement was further extended until 2021 to cover delays in 
<br/>implementation  of  activities  due  to  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic.  With  extension  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Agreement, funding was also increased to US$365,000.  In 2021, the Agreement was extended until 
<br/></span><span>2022 as capital projects were included for 16 targeted settlement-based action plans.  Funding was 
<br/>also increased to US $3.1 million to implement the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of the project was affected again because of 
<br/>the  second  wave  of  COVID-19  in  Fiji.    The  delay  in  capital  works  led  to  the  extension  of  the 
<br/>Agreement until 2023 which was endorsed by Cabinet in January 2023.  The delay in endorsement 
<br/>of the Agreement, Sir, lessened the duration to complete the capital project works, coupled with the 
<br/>recovery from the global pandemic, hence the Agreement has been further extended until 2024 to 
<br/></span><span>complete the planned capital works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will,  firstly,  be  commencing  capital  works  on  three  sites  out  of  the  16 
<br/>settlements that have been initially identified.  These sites are located in the Central Division and 
<br/>situated on State land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had conducted the tender process for consultancy works on the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1907 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had conducted the tender process for consultancy works on the 
<br/>pilot  projects.    However,  due  to  high  tender  bid  amounts  received,  the  Ministry  had  to  seek 
<br/>alternatives  within  Government. The Ministry has, therefore, engaged the services  of Ministry of 
<br/>Public Works, Transport and Metrological Services, for the designing of engineering plans for the 
<br/>three sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The upgrading works have been prioritised according to the needs of the communities, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  This was done through consultation between the sitting tenants and UN Habitat. These 
<br/>upgrading  works  are  expected  to  be  implemented  once  engineering  plans  are  finalised.  Upon 
<br/>completion of the project works, a total 223 households will benefit from improvements made in the 
<br/>settlements to increase the resilience to impacts of climate change and disaster risks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of Sales Data 
<br/>(Question No.137/2023)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament on 
<br/>the reasons for not providing the Sales Data to the Valuers and Financial Institutes since April 
<br/>2023, which is essential to Valuers in determining the Fair Market Value of properties when 
<br/>carrying out valuation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide the answer to honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kirpal’s question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Lands, through the Office of the Chief Valuer, is responsible for 
<br/>the collection and recording of all property data.  That is the Sales Data that we are discussing here, 
<br/>and monthly reports which are disseminated for the purposes of the public and also for those who 
<br/>might want to privately gather that information at a minimum fee.  The data, Sir, is used by those 
<br/>who are experts in interpreting the property market throughout the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, historically, Sales Data is meant for registered Valuers and is critical for 
<br/>them when they undertake valuation work in Fiji.  The data is an integral part of the valuation process, 
<br/>and it is required for valuation reports for mortgages, transfers, property matters, as well as used for 
<br/>sales and purchase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, prior to the repealing of the Stamp Duties Act 1920 that provided the focal point 
<br/></span><span>for the collection of such information, there was at the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS), 
<br/>Stamp Duty’s Office here in Suva.  The Ministry was allowed under an MOU to collect property data 
<br/>or instruments that were bought for stamp duty or transfer of any land to FRCS.  In exchange, the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands would assist FRCS in determining the market value of such properties under the 
<br/>Stamp Duties Act 1920 and carry out valuation of such property at a minimum applicable rate under 
<br/>the Valuation Registration Act 1986. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  repealing  of  the  Stamp  Duties  Act  1920  through  the  repealing 
<br/></span><span>legislation in 2020, as a result, the FRCS no longer collects stamp duties.  So, consequently, from 
<br/></span><span>2020, the Ministry had to collect data from the Capital Gains Tax Section and not from the Stamp 
<br/>Duty’s Section.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> March, 2022, FRCS decided to withhold access to the Sales Data to 
<br/>the Ministry and as at from that date, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources do not have access 
<br/>to the daily Sales Data that we used to have from FRCS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a few months later in September, the then CEO of FRCS terminated the MOU 
<br/>that  we  had  with  FRCS  because  it  appears  to  disclose  information  which  are  confidential  to  the 
<br/>taxpayer.  So, pursuant to Regulation 51(3b) of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (Information 
<br/>Sharing) Regulations 2019, the MOU that we had enjoyed with FRCS for many years that allowed 
<br/>us to have access to information so that we can upgrade our data at the Chief Valuer’s Office was 
<br/>repealed or terminated by FRCS, so we have gone for more than two years now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>without the essential upgrade of that database.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The way forward, Mr. Speaker, is that now, the Ministry of Lands is seeking to access the 
<br/>same data from two agencies and that is through the Registrar of Titles Office via the Ministry of 
<br/>Justice, and also with the Ministry of Information through ITC Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is currently working with the Solicitor General’s Office in finalising the draft 
<br/>MOU with the Ministry of Justice. This MOU, when it is finalised and executed, will allow the daily 
<br/>connection, as well as recording of relevant property sales information or transfer documents that 
<br/>have been lodged by parties at the Registrar of Titles Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering that there will be a lapse in Sales Data from April 2023 to the day in which we 
<br/>ultimately intend to sign this MOU once it clears all the legal hurdles, we have tried to engage with 
<br/>ITC through the Ministry of Information and we have consulted with them just to be ensure that we 
<br/>are being provided with an alternative source of data upgrade that we can access from the Registrar 
<br/>of Titles Office. Now, if that happens, it will allow us to retrieve information that have been lodged 
<br/>with the Registrar of Titles Office as from April 2023 to ultimately the date we soon hope we are 
<br/>going to put signatures on the MOU with the Ministry of Justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, being proactive as of 1</span><span>st</span><span> August this year, the Ministry, through the Office 
<br/>of THE Chief Valuer, has commenced with the collection and the recording of the all the property 
<br/>sales information of transfer documents that have been lodged with the Registrar of Titles Office.  
<br/>We would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Attorney General in facilitating and ensuring 
<br/>that we are able to commence with the collection of this important data whilst the MOU is being 
<br/>finalised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are collecting the information and it will ultimately be available to the public and to the 
<br/>Valuers once we sign off on the MOU. Since the information collected from the Registrar of Titles 
<br/>Office is confidential until the registration of the documents on the different titles, public search, the 
<br/>Ministry  will  be  drafting  individual  agreements  with  registered  Valuers  and  their  respective 
<br/></span><span>companies to safeguard the disseminated sales data information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to conclude that we are currently working towards having the people of Fiji with a 
<br/>relevant and right information on the database for leverage and for their own empowerment including 
<br/>all registered Valuers and I hope that we are going to be putting signature, as I said, top aper in the 
<br/>next month or so, so that we can upgrade all of the information that is needed from 2020 and up until 
<br/>real time and that information will soon be available to the registered valuers as well as to the rest of 
<br/>the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, if memory serves me correct, there is physically 
<br/></span><span>a person that actually goes across from the Ministry of Lands to the Registrar of Titles Office on a 
<br/>daily basis to collect the raw data.  The data is actually given by the Registrar of Titles Office to the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and that should be sufficient to give the actual raw Sales Data to the institutions 
<br/>that require it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just wondering whether that is actually continuing and I think that was still being done 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1909 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because there was a digitisation process that was to take place at the Registrar of Titles Office, which 
<br/>I think is not quite completed but until it is digitised, it would be simple to just have digital access to 
<br/>each department or each government has access to it. But that particular information was being lifted 
<br/>from the Registrar of Titles Office on a daily basis physically to be provided to the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>to update their data, to say that these sales took place. Is that still happening?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure Parliament that the uplifting of 
<br/>daily Sales Data just commenced.  We have picked up on a draft MOU that was sent to the Office of 
<br/>the Attorney-General in the first part of this year.  They are currently looking through the MOU to 
<br/>get through all the legal issues that we need to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, at this moment, we are picking up the information on a daily basis.  We are not 
<br/>making them available because what we wanted to do is to pull all the information that we needed to 
<br/>do to upgrade the database from 2020 up until this time.  So, I am sure that when we sit again in the 
<br/>month of November, I would have a better update for Parliament on where we are.  But certainly, we 
<br/>are working hard to ensure that all the Valuers are made available with the right information on time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, consumers also need Sales Data to make an informed 
<br/>decision when they are buying a property and for that reason, the Real Estate Board has started to 
<br/>create  a  database  online  so  that  people  can  hook  up  and  find  out  if  a  property  is  being  sold  in  a 
<br/>particular area, the price of the property say one year ago or two years ago or three years ago.  My 
<br/>question to you honourable Minister is, how is the Real Estate Board working with the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands to also support the general public who are being often ripped off for not knowing the price in 
<br/>a particular area and end up paying a lot more? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can say that I am not privy to whether the 
<br/>Real Estate Board and the Ministry of Lands worked together on the upgrade of the database.  What 
<br/>I am sure about is, under statute, the Chief Valuer is supposed to be the ‘go to’ person when someone 
<br/>requires information such as valuation of properties.  But I can assure the honourable Member that if 
<br/>there is a database with the Real Estate Board, that is something that we can have.  I can advise the 
<br/>Ministry to try and figure out a way of working with the Real Estate Board so that we can together 
<br/>provide the public with the best platform of information from which they can draw their decisions 
<br/>from. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very thankful to the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>explanation.  However, like in our valuation, we pay a very heavy amount of Professional Indemnity 
<br/></span><span>(PI) cover, so I kindly request the honourable Minister if that can be done quickly so that no liability 
<br/></span><span>comes to us because now we are carrying out our valuation, not only me but all the companies of 
<br/>Fiji.  We are relying on the data that we have.  We do not take the data which the Real Estate tells 
<br/>us, because most of the time their data is  incorrect  because the sale has  not  taken place, the data 
<br/>comes here, I think.  So, I really appreciate the honourable Minister’s explanation that the data is 
<br/>coming, and I will really appreciate if the data can be made available as soon as possible for all the 
<br/>registered Valuers of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply to that honourable Minister, I would like to declare my 
<br/></span><span>interest here as a registered Valuer as well.  He keeps mentioning this every time he speaks on the 
<br/></span><span>issue of valuation, but I think that data is very critical for Valuers so as to get a proper valuation, 
<br/>when we analyse the sales, the members of the public as referred to by honourable Premila Kumar, 
<br/>is protected here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, the Valuer is answerable for his analysis of the sales of similar kind of 
<br/>properties that the client wishes to purchase, so to speak.  The data is quite important for the basis 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>1910 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that they will have the  Valuer deduce whatever value by  whatever method he/she applies so that 
<br/>makes it transparent as well to members of the public.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may have heard, as alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar, there are certain kinds of 
<br/>sales done by dubious means of getting a sale through and there are so many ways.  When we analyse 
<br/>the  sale,  we  can  reduce  that,  it  is  a  ‘for  sale’.    It  is  unrealistic  and  because  you  may  imagine, 
<br/>honourable Members, the sale price of properties that we have in Fiji is almost a million or well over 
<br/>a million dollars now, what makes that happen could be anyone’s guess - a pure sale that has taken 
<br/>through where a willing  buyer and a willing seller concept  applies at the same time, it can be all 
<br/>inflated as well.  How do we take care of that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Data is quite important for us because we no longer pay stamp duties but we still have the 
<br/>Capital Gains Tax.  We used to get data through the Stamp Duties Office but now when it has changed 
<br/>through the change of law, that is quite difficult to get as well, but data is vital for every Valuer’s 
<br/>work  in  this  country.    I  now  give  you  the  opportunity  to  reply  to  that  statement  if  you  want  to, 
<br/>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have provided the answer and more that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was going to reply to honourable Kirpals’ question.  Thank you very much, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exchange of Notes on Japan’s Grant Aid  
<br/>(Question No. 138/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the 
<br/>Exchange  of  Notes  on  Japan’s  Grant  Aid  to  the  Ministry  under  the  Economic  and  Social 
<br/>Development Programme?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  thank  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Bainivalu for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Exchange of Notes on Japan’s Grant Aid to the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical  Services  under  the  Economic  and  Social  Development  Programme  was  undertaken  on 
<br/>Monday,  21</span><span>st</span><span>  August,  2023  at  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  Headquarters.    Sir, 
<br/>Exchange of Notes formalises mechanisms of cooperation between the Government of Japan and the 
<br/></span><span>Government  of  Fiji  to  promote  economic  and  social  development  in  Fiji  through  the  Grand  Aid 
<br/></span><span>Support Project with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In November 2022, the Ministry had approached the Embassy of Japan in Fiji, for them to 
<br/>support  the  strengthening  of  primary  healthcare  in  Fiji  through  an  integrated  model  of  primary 
<br/>healthcare  delivery.    The  Government  of  Japan  responded  through  the  Embassy  of  Japan  in  Fiji, 
<br/>approving a grant of JPY¥150 million which is equivalent to FJ$2.4 million to the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and Medical Services to purchase two medical containers and vital medical equipment and products.  
<br/>The medical containers are fully fitted mobile health clinics that have the appropriate type of bio-
<br/></span><span>medical  equipment  that  will  allow  our  health  staff  to  conduct  primary  healthcare  services  and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Grant  Aid  Project  will  also  facilitate  the  proper  installation  of  biomedical  equipment 
<br/>inside  the  medical  container  clinics  and  once  the  fully  fitted  medical  container  clinics  are  in  the 
<br/>country,  the  project  will  facilitate  the  training  of  local  health  staff  on  the  use  and  upkeep  of  the 
<br/>medical container clinics.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1911 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the endorsement of the Exchange of Note, the parties are progressing 
<br/>to process and to facilitate the release of funds from the Government of Japan and the engaging of 
<br/>the Japan International Co-operation System (JICS) which is the Japan based agents that deal directly 
<br/>with  the  Government  of  Japan  on  Grant  Aid  Projects.    Sir,  JICS  will  facilitate  on  our  behalf  the 
<br/>purchase of the medical container and biomedical equipment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Grant Aid Project has a two years’ timeline from the date of signing of the Agreement 
<br/>and the Ministry looks forward to the full implementation and completion of the project which will 
<br/>add further capacity to our Primary Healthcare approach to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  A  supplementary  question.    Honourable  Minister,  forgive  me, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there will be two parts to my question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We receive a lot of assistance from friends and partners, rotary clubs and a lot of medical 
<br/>equipment are also included. But one thing that I noted, Sir, is particularly having worked in the rural 
<br/>areas is the lack of Biomedical Technicians/Engineers to fix equipment when they have problems 
<br/>with it.    My question is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Ministry of Health in terms of availability of Biomedical Engineers and Technicians, 
<br/>do we have them only at the Divisional Hospitals or Sub-Divisional Hospitals, or how far 
<br/>down do you have them?  
<br/>I know that there is serious shortage of this skill. A cousin of mine is now with Sai Prema 
<br/>Foundation Fiji. He has retired for the last few years, but they are looking for this.  What is 
<br/>the Ministry doing about having more of such skills so that they can add effectiveness to 
<br/>your services, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for his supplementary question and I fully concur and agree with his comments that our Biomedical 
<br/>staff are important in the delivery of quality healthcare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, Sir, the Biomedical cadre on its own is a small group of specialists. They are 
<br/>available at the Divisional level for now but moreso, located in the Fiji Pharmaceutical &amp; Biomedical 
<br/>Services (FPBS).  We are in the process of planning for more capacity building within this cadre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have recognised that in the field of medicine and health, if we move forward in the future, 
<br/>there will be more need for biomedical services. We have discussed with the Ministry that it should 
<br/></span><span>be a cadre on its own within the Ministry.  There is an ongoing plan on building capacity within our 
<br/></span><span>Biomedical  Specialist  people.  I  believe  one  of  our  Biomedical  Heads  right  now  is  honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu’s sister.  They are an important part of the Ministerial of Health, and we will look after them 
<br/>in terms of training, especially to make it a cadre on its own because there is a need for them moving 
<br/>forward into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to hear the assistance that Japan has been 
<br/>providing to the Ministry of Health over the years.  I think in areas like NCD Programme, 5S and 
<br/>this particular programme. And also, I am glad as we are getting these containers, I think they will 
<br/></span><span>complement the service that is provide by </span><span>MV Veivueti</span><span> which gets people around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am interested in the actual services, the kind of services that will be provided from these 
<br/>containers  in  terms  of  primary  health  and  the  importance  also  of  primary  health  in  terms  of 
<br/>preventative health. A lot of time we talk about doing things after the cat has run away already, but 
<br/>the range of services that have been provided from these containers, I assume that there will be people 
<br/>involved with them and whether they are just to be used in Viti Levu or across to other islands; will

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the containers be carried around? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU. A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Usamate for his 
<br/>supplementary question.  Honourable Member, the containers are the mobile clinics, therefore, there 
<br/>are two that I have been briefed on. There will be one in Viti Levu and one in the North for now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is kind of a pilot project for now and for those containers to be moved around, we need 
<br/>proper preparatory work done so that when we move the containers, all the connections are readily 
<br/>available like electricity, water, et cetera.  In terms of the services, the primary healthcare services 
<br/>like the normal GOPD work plus laboratory as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Bainivalu for asking this 
<br/>question.  I know that the comprehensive economic and social development programme had begun 
<br/>operations since 2016.  May I sound it here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that His Excellency our President is 
<br/>now the champion for oral health in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Oral  Health  is  the  state  of  mouth,  teeth  and  our  facial  structure  which  perform  essential 
<br/>functions  such  as  eating,  breathing,  speaking  and  also  our  psychological  dimensions.    My  short 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister, will he consider oral health in this container that is custom-made 
<br/>for the purpose of primary healthcare delivery in our country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ravunawa for the supplementary question.  Yes, I forgot oral health will also be included in it.

<div><span>Increase in Roads Accidents and Deaths 
<br/>(Question No. 139/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform Parliament on the measures being undertaken by the Ministry and the Land Transport 
<br/>Authority to address the dramatic increase on the number of road accidents and deaths which 
<br/>has set a shocking record of 53 fatalities between January to June 2023 compared to 21 deaths 
<br/>for the same period in 2022? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  As I had mentioned earlier this week, road safety is everyone’s responsibility.  It is vital 
<br/>because many lives are at stake and it just takes a couple of seconds looking away for an accident to 
<br/>occur.  Sir, poor driving behaviour on Fiji’s roads has led to a spike in road fatalities as mentioned.  
<br/>To address this alarming spike, Land Transport Authority (LTA) is considering increase in traffic 
<br/>fines as a deterrent moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the figures as mentioned, the current death toll stands at 60 as of 24</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023 
<br/></span><span>compared to 21.  In assessing the alarming trend, there was a spike in Group 2 driving licence holders 
<br/></span><span>involved in accidents or road fatalities from the statistics provided.  From January 2023 to May 2023, 
<br/>the LTA did a driver profiling analysis and noted that 53 percent of fatal crashes involved private 
<br/>Class 2 vehicles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The enforcement by LTA, Police and stakeholders continues to curb illegal activities and also 
<br/>preventative  measures.    From  August  2022  to  the  end  of  July  2023,  98,918  camera  Traffic

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1913 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infringement  Notices  (TINs)  were  issued  by  LTA  and  in  the  same  period  133,664  vehicles  were 
<br/>intercepted and 6,389 defect orders issued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  address  issues  of  driver  behaviour,  LTA  and  relevant  stakeholders  have  enhanced 
<br/>measures, apart from the existing driver knowledge test system and practical driving test in place, 
<br/>there are other measures which have been looked into and currently followed.  We are looking into 
<br/>measures to introduce two categories of Provisional Licence before they qualify for a full licence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also looking at demerit points to be issued by LTA and incentives such as gold cards 
<br/>for complying drivers who will be entitled to privileged services and, of course, mandatory Defensive 
<br/>Driving Courses Training for Group 2 licence holders on a six-yearly basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We continue to conduct show-cause hearings and counselling sessions for drivers in the three 
<br/>regions.    In  2022-2023,  2,508  driver  licence  holders  were  summoned  for  either  show-cause  or 
<br/>counsellling.  At  regional  office,  2,173  warning  letters  and  28  licence  holders  were  issued  with  final 
<br/>warnings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  LTA  is  also  reviving  the  Hands-on  Wheels  Programme  and  Driver  assessment 
<br/>exercise,  participants  are  taken  through  driving  lessons,  undergoing  what  they  have  been  taught  in 
<br/>Mandatory  Defence  Driving  Courses  before  individual  assessments.  We  are  working  closely  with 
<br/>employers  and  agencies  in  conducting  driver-assessments  of  employee  drivers  and  through  public 
<br/>consultations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also working with the Ministry of Education for the introduction of road safety education 
<br/>in the curriculum from an early age right up to secondary school as there is quite an increase in the number 
<br/>of young drivers holding Provisional Licences. There is a need for inclusion of Road Safety Awareness 
<br/>through various stakeholders and we will continue to advocate for that, also working with other relevant 
<br/>agencies in the process of reconvening the technical working group on road safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To end, I believe with all road users; drivers, passengers and pedestrians to observe and adhere 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to road laws and also in terms of road safety which is everyone’s responsibility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, thank very much indeed for that response.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>really agree with you. Sir, road safety is everyone's responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a question to the honourable Minister, about 70 percent of deaths on our roads are caused by 
<br/></span><span>overspeeding.  You are saying that about 15 percent are caused by road condition. Now, 10 percent of 
<br/></span><span>those  are  said  to  be  because  of  poor  road  markings  and  traffic  signs.  I  know  because  I  travel  the 
<br/>Sawani/Colo-i-Suva road everyday, the road has been like that for sometimes now without proper road 
<br/>markings.  There are no centre lines, no centre meridian, not even the side marking lines as that will tell 
<br/>the drivers what to do. On these road sign programmes plus the traffic signage restoration, is there a 
<br/>programme undertaken by FRA to see into these kinds of issues and problems? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, I have already briefed Parliament on the programme of FRA 
<br/>regarding the Princess Road and Sawani, Serea. The roads are currently affected by the Rewa Water 
<br/></span><span>Project because it would be illogical to do the resealing now, but we are nearing completion of that project 
<br/></span><span>and the road resealing is budgeted for and we will be working on that in the current budget to upgrade 
<br/>that road.  But on the other hand, the bad roads also slow down the speeding drivers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank you and the Business

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for allowing this question to be asked in Parliament, an important subject on the carnage on 
<br/>our roads. When we talk about road safety and road fatalities, the bottom line is, it is trying to save lives 
<br/>on our roads.  It is like when we say, “Search and Rescue at Sea”, it is really trying to save lives at sea. I 
<br/>see that there are two sides to it, one is prevention and the other side is for us to be able to save lives when 
<br/>an accident happens on our road.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I ask the question, just as an example, last week a big club of wives and mothers in the 
<br/>RFMF of 800 or almost 1,000 had their sporting event at Black Rock.   They were told that all the buses 
<br/>wherever they are leaving from, must leave between 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock in the morning.  That is 
<br/>to allow the Military to pre-position an ambulance along the way.  So as the buses were going down, 
<br/>you can shift the ambulances so that if there is an accident that happens, the ambulance is quite close-
<br/>by to respond.  So, the response time to an accident is faster and hopefully, saves lives if there is an 
<br/>accident.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully we do not go there for accident. My question to the honourable Minister is, will 
<br/>you consider or are you considering setting up a taskforce with relevant agencies specifically to target 
<br/>the reduction of road fatalities?  We question the police on this issue when we dealt with the  two 
<br/>Annual Reports that we tabled yesterday.  They told us that they have 18 speeding cameras only for 
<br/>the whole of Fiji.  Speaking of speeding cameras, the speeding detection devices, a special task force 
<br/>set up by the relevant agencies and you give them and say, “seek the reduction of this” maybe a better 
<br/>way, rather than just dealing it with business as usual. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Member , that was a lengthy supplementary question or is it a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  The short answer is, yes.  As I had mentioned, the working group 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is currently in place and they are all working together to address those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Forgive me, Sir, I might need a minute extra on my supplementary. It is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not an explanation, it is an offering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are giving an explanation followed by a question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is an offering to the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Offer, that is great.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- In my capacity as Patron of the Fiji Motorcycle Association, Sir, I just 
<br/>received a message from the Association.  We have previously assisted the LTA with road safety 
<br/>awareness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the wild group? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That is in the words of honourable Tikoduadua.  We are a good bunch, 
<br/></span><span>Sir.    We  are  offering  our  assistance  in  any  way  we  can.    We  have  done  so  previously  to  raise 
<br/>awareness for it, please, just contact me, just message me and we will absolutely and greatly help 
<br/>because the carnage is too much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to put it into perspective, Sir, if you travelling on a motorcycle at 80 kilometres an hour 
<br/>and you hit a pothole, you are in for a serious ride.  So, it is quite bad and I am happy to hear that the

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1915 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable  Minister  has  agreed  with  respect  to  what  was  just  mentioned  regarding  a  taskforce.  
<br/>Please, include us in the taskforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question, honourable Minister, is there a specific reason at the moment why we do not 
<br/>have enough going out in the media with respect to road safety?  I ask you to think about what New 
<br/>Zealand does., there are quite some really hard hitting messages that go out at the movies, on TV and 
<br/>even our billboards.  It really does help, is there a specific reason why we are not seeing that at the 
<br/>moment or is there something in the pipeline that will happen shortly, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  the  issue  goes  back  in  terms  of  what 
<br/>happened to the National Road Safety Council (NRSC).  This was established in 1994, however, due 
<br/>to unplanned and cost saving measures, this was merged into LTA and also increased the functions 
<br/>of LTA to incorporate that of the National Road Safety Council.  I believe this has diluted the work 
<br/>of NRSC and this is why we are relooking at that to re-establish it.  There is no point in pointing at 
<br/>each other, but the point is to look at solutions.  That is why we are relooking at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main function of LTA is registration and licensing, so there is a need to re-focus road 
<br/>safety specifically to an institution which is empowered and also funded as mentioned to the specific 
<br/>function of road safety which is very important.  That is another thing we are looking at in terms of 
<br/>NRSC to move us forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to  adjourn Parliament for about 40 
<br/>minutes  to  50  minutes  so  you  may  enjoy  your  tea.    I  have  been  given  to  understand  that  some 
<br/>honourable  Members  have  come  directly  here  without  having  a  proper  breakfast.  We  have  been 
<br/>raising questions about accountability and we worry about what have we done, so the Secretariat and 
<br/>I are worried too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are adjourning Parliament for about 40 minutes to 50 minutes and will resume when the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bell is sounded.

<div><span>Price Control on Items by FCCC 
<br/>(Question No. 140/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  inform  Parliament  on  the  steps  being 
<br/>undertaken by the Fijian competition and Consumer Commission to ensure fair price marking 
<br/>for  basic  food  items  and  other  goods  and  services  as  a  result  of  the  change  of  VAT  as 
<br/>announced in the 2023-2024 National Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I would like to thank the honourable Member for raising the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question on behalf of honourable Qereqeretabua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we, obviously, inherited a very challenging fiscal position and the complicated 
<br/>VAT regime where we had zero percent, nine percent and 15 percent VAT rates.  Of course, we have 
<br/>reduced it to two rates - zero and 15 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we also, Mr. Speaker, ensured that the zero-rated VAT on the existing 21 items, including 
<br/>the addition of prescribed medicine, making it 22 items, despite the advice of the World Bank and 
<br/>Fiscal Review Committee where the suggestion was that we should have a single rate of VAT which 
<br/>would be more efficient and simpler.  But as are Government, we decided that we will have two rates 
<br/>and so all those rates of goods and services at 9 percent were raised to 15 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Compared to the three rates. this change, Mr. Speaker, made the VAT  simpler, eliminated 
<br/>issues of ambiguity around VAT rate application and assisted businesses to better administer and 
<br/>reduce the risk of non-compliance with additional revenues to Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when we introduced these changes, most of the businesses actually complied 
<br/>well in a very honest manner, but there were some unscrupulous ones that tried to take advantage of 
<br/>the situation. Some of it almost appeared that there was deliberate attempt to make the Government 
<br/>look  bad  by  disproportionately  increasing  their  markups  significantly  and  much  more  than  they 
<br/>increase in the VAT rate. When that happened, we responded very quickly with the help of the Fijian 
<br/>Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) and the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) 
<br/></span><span>and immediately got things under control.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the role of FCCC is to ensure that there is a fair price marking for basic food 
<br/>items and other goods and services, and the Act provides for that assessment and determination of 
<br/>prices for controlled goods as well.  Many of the assessments and the determination of prices for 
<br/>controlled goods and services are actually contingent upon procurement procedures, landing cost and 
<br/>there are many other factors that determine this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCCC  will  then  determine  and  announce  the  retail  price  before  the  product  actually 
<br/></span><span>reaches the market.    After  the  prices  are  declared,  Sir,  the  allowable  markup  for  wholesale  and 
<br/></span><span>retail  trade  is  specified  under  the  Price  Control  Order.      Sir,  several  factors  contribute  to  price 
<br/>fluctuations, including but not limited to supplier procurement cost, international freight expenses, 
<br/>duty rates, exchange rates and local clearance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just also point out here that during COVID-19 and even post-COVID, 
<br/>freight costs had gone up significantly, sometimes by three or four times, so a lot of the increases in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1917 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the cost of goods, especially imported goods, were a direct result of the increase in freight cost.  So, 
<br/>in the context of the 2023-2024 Budget, the price review was prompted by the increase in the VAT 
<br/>rate which rose from 9 percent to 15 percent, and based on those changes, Sir, the FCCC reviewed 
<br/>and issued determinations for a total of about 5,496 products, with these changes taking effect from 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  the  implementation  period,  the  FCCC  corroborated  with  the  Fiji 
<br/>Revenue  and  Customs  Services  (FRCS),  Green  Growth  Association  and  businesses  to  ensure  a 
<br/>smooth transition to the new VAT rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to facilitate the replacement of price stickers on retailers’ shelves, a notice 
<br/>was issued on 27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 for businesses and on 28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 for Government Ministries and 
<br/>Departments. This notice allowed businesses until 14</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023 to update their product price 
<br/>levels to reflect the revised VAT rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  importantly,  this  notice  did  not  affect  the  implementation  of  the  VAT 
<br/>amendments as of 1</span><span>st</span><span>, August 2023. All businesses were required to accurately apply the new VAT 
<br/>rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FCCC, under the Act, Mr. Speaker, conducted surveys to ensure that the enforcement 
<br/>was  properly  done  and  that  the  businesses  were  compliant  and  that  they  were  not  making  undue 
<br/>increases in prices.  There were some items or services which already had a VAT rate of 15 percent. 
<br/>We have had complaints that restaurants suddenly increased their prices and they put out notices to 
<br/>say, ‘we are increasing it because the VAT rate is now increased to 15 percent’.  But it was already 
<br/>15 percent, so they were actually increasing it on top of the 15 percent that was already there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The survey that was conducted in the Central Division was 452, Western Division was 595 
<br/>and  Northern  Division  was  38.    There  were  364  inspections  in  the  Central  Division,  297  in  the 
<br/>Western Division and 256 in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, during the inspections (this was a joint, sort of, operation between FRCS and FCCC), it 
<br/>was  found  that  62  traders  were  found  in  breach  of  these  breaches.  The  FCCC  has  proceeded  for 
<br/>prosecution against two traders and, of course, others are under investigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of phase two, Mr. Speaker, Sir, greater scrutiny will be applied to pharmacies as well, 
<br/>the licensing of which already falls under the FCCC’s responsibility because with the addition of 
<br/></span><span>prescribed medication to zero VAT-rated medicine, we want to make sure that it is reflected also in 
<br/></span><span>the price that people get when they take the prescribed medication to the Pharmacies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we noticed from the discussions that we were having, for example, 
<br/>the chicken prices, when we talked to the suppliers, they said, “No, we did not change anything”.  
<br/>The traders who were found to just increasing it in an exorbitant manner were saying, “Oh, somehow, 
<br/>this was directed by the suppliers.”  So, there was contradiction in terms of what we were being told.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I would like to reiterate the fact that all those items, as I have said earlier, 15 percent VAT 
<br/></span><span>was already there.  In fact, as I have said, we have three VAT rates - we had zero VAT, 9 percent 
<br/></span><span>and 15 percent. So, the example of restaurants is something that we also found and think some of the 
<br/>traders in the way they increased the prices was not only unethical, but it was also wrong and it almost 
<br/>amounted to deliberate cheating.  These traders, Mr. Speaker, will be taken to task by the FCCC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Sir, we have formed a price surveillance task force comprising of FCCC, FRCS 
<br/>and the Ministry of Finance, to monitor the prices and what we are noticing is that there are traders 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who have been very honest.  In fact, the FCCC has identified that the prices of almost 230 items have 
<br/>actually down, even after the increase of VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent because  freight costs 
<br/>have come down significantly and some of them have quite honestly reflected that in the prices that 
<br/>they had put out.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is an update on what the Ministry of Finance, FRCS and FCCC are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>doing to ensure that there is proper compliance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Through  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance for that comprehensive answer.  My supplementary question would be, while he has actually 
<br/>mentioned that traders would be taken to task, can he provide some clarity with respect to products 
<br/>that are not under price control and the prices are going high and how can that be actually managed?  
<br/>If the prices are not price-controlled, there is no jurisdiction to indicate the percentage margin that a 
<br/>trader can place on a particular product.  So, how is the Ministry and FCCC dealing with that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question.  In fact, that is 
<br/>a question that we need to address.  The FCCC is looking at its own determinations and what sort of 
<br/>signals they can provide to the traders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I think, Mr. Speaker, there is a need to make sure that there is an appropriate awareness 
<br/>and discussion with the major suppliers to ensure that the price that they put out into the market is 
<br/>reflective, and that they are not making undue profit. For example, in the case of the chicken suppliers 
<br/>-  the  local  producers,  they  get  duty  protection  of  almost  42  percent.    And  we  are  saying  to  the 
<br/>suppliers, “Look, that has been the policy previously as well, so we have not changed any of those”, 
<br/>because we realise the importance of production.  If we put together all three of them, they employ 
<br/>about 2,400 people, but they cannot use that to hold 800,000 people to ransom by increasing the price 
<br/>of chicken in an unscrupulous manner when they do not have to. So, that is the signal that we are 
<br/>providing.  In my discussion with all of them, they actually said that those prices should not have 
<br/>been increased by that much, and since then, Sir, it has all come down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also things happening, for example, powdered milk prices have gone down from 
<br/>between 6 percent to 8 percent, as announced.  There is 6 percent and then the maximum increase is 
<br/>about 8 percent, so it is 6 percent to 8 percent of different products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the FCCC, as I have said, said that the actual price of about 230 items went 
<br/>down  because  post  COVID-19,  freight  costs  were  coming  down.    For  example,  with  chicken 
<br/></span><span>products, even with the protection of 42 percent, some traders who were importing chicken portions, 
<br/></span><span>wings and other products with the payment of 42 percent duty, were able to sell it at a lower price 
<br/>than what was being supplied by the local producers.  So that is the kind of situation that happens 
<br/>every now and then, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, what we have said from the Ministry to FRCS is that the effect of the budget should 
<br/>be closely monitored, and I call upon all the traders and retailers.  I think by and large, Sir, majority 
<br/>of them are honest players.  They do the right thing, and we see that kind of dialogue and campaign 
<br/>in bringing the prices down and making sure that they do it in an ethical manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is in light of 
<br/>the fact on how you have explained it that quite a substantial amount of odd numbers in terms of 
<br/>people who went through this fair price exercise and were in breach of it, are actually going to get 
<br/>prosecuted.  The question relates to the actual penalty that is going to be imposed on them.  Do you 
<br/>intend to have a relook at the penalties imposed?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1919 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  most  businesses  are  compliant.    Those  who  actually  do  that  are  even  more  of  a 
<br/>deterrent with respect to this.  In every budget in every year, we do something or another, and they 
<br/>fall foul of it.  Is there an avenue for you with respect to deterrence to these operators who are actually 
<br/>doing that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say this, Mr. Speaker, because at the end of the day, when you have a serious deterrent, it is 
<br/>like the taxi driver in Singapore where he will not cross an orange light because he knows tomorrow 
<br/>morning, he will lose his taxi licence.  That is true.  So, if the deterrent is there, you will get traders 
<br/>making sure that they are compliant.  This is for the benefit of the consumers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Koya is absolutely right.  
<br/>We probably have to look at the FCCC Act.  I think on the deterrent, there has to be some penalty, 
<br/>and I agree with him.  At the moment, it seems to me that it is not as clear, and some of it is not there 
<br/>- things like prices, as honourable Maharaj had pointed out, which are not under price control, some 
<br/>traders feel that they can just do whatever they want to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  we  are  saying  is,  if  we  find  that  there  are  certain  products  where  the  traders  are 
<br/>deliberately making sure that they make big margins, we will have no option but to bring it under 
<br/>price control.  But the point that honourable Koya has raised about penalties is very important because 
<br/>there are some who distort the market in a big way.  One big supermarket decides to do something 
<br/>funny, then it, sort of, distorts everything else and sometimes people complain that they go to one 
<br/>supermarket, as opposed to another, but there is a big difference.  It is also the timing.  Sometimes, 
<br/>traders  play  their  games  which  is  alright,  but  they  should  not  be  unscrupulous  and  unethical  by 
<br/>increasing the margin in a big way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plight of our people in the rural and outer 
<br/>islands.  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, you have talked about freight 
<br/>costs coming down, but this is one of the areas that, I would say, is a big contributing factor to the 
<br/>predicament and the extra burden on our people in the rural and outer islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two parts to my question, </span><span>and forgive</span><span> me for that, are freight costs and the effectiveness 
<br/>of monitoring.  We do a good job in urban areas - the municipalities, but it is the monitoring in the 
<br/>rural and outer islands.  How are you looking at fixing these issues, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition. I think that is a very important and critical question and as you know and pointed 
<br/></span><span>out quite correctly, in Vanua Levu and some of the maritime islands, it has always been an issue. The 
<br/></span><span>freight costs is something that we can look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we were discussing the budget in Vanua Levu, there were calls about certain amount 
<br/>of rebates on goods that are shipped from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu.  There are also, on the other side, 
<br/>a lot of the producers from Vanua Levu who were complaining about the fact that the freight cost is 
<br/>so high when sending products to Viti Levu, to Suva and to the Western Division where they can 
<br/>fetch better prices.  But freight costs sometimes can be quite prohibitive in terms of what they could 
<br/>do.  So, I think as part of the next Budget, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we can look at some 
<br/></span><span>of the areas or the flashpoints that we can deal  with.    If there is  a requirement for certain  policy 
<br/></span><span>intervention, Sir, then we would be looking at that as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. In 
<br/>fact, our market is so small, there is always the danger of collusion within the business community.  
<br/>We have seen it time and again over the years and it is extremely hard to deal with that matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that countries use different strategies to deal with such 
<br/>situation.  A  good  example  is  India  with  such  a  big  market,  with  a  lot  of  competition,  yet  they 
<br/>introduced four levels of GST. They introduced 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent.  In 
<br/>Fiji’s situation, we had zero percent, 9 percent and 15 percent.  The 15 percent was mainly for luxury 
<br/>items, like alcohol, tobacco, white goods, et cetera; 9 percent was purely for food and services such 
<br/>as  electricity,  water  bill,  Telecom,  so  it  was  9  percent.  That  is  one  way  of  providing  relief  to 
<br/>consumers, particularly when we have such challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister has highlighted, I mean, really every government whether you sit 
<br/>this side or that side or we are on either side, it does not matter because we have to make sure that 
<br/>consumers benefit and they are the ones who are struggling. So, honourable Minister, one way of 
<br/>dealing  with  this issue would  be,  like  as  you  have  mentioned  about  the  marked  prices  which  are 
<br/>displayed in the supermarkets, but if FCCC can also run more programmes or even through their 
<br/>social media just to alert the public what the real price is. That is all, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Thank  you.  I  mean,  I  could  not  agree  more  with  the 
<br/>explanation,  except  that,  in  a  situation  such  as  Fiji,  honourable  Kumar,  is  right,  there  is  a  lot  of 
<br/>collusion that takes place.  It is very hard to deal with it but the fact that when we did the Budget, we 
<br/>assessed the situation.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, some of the prices for some of the items as a result of 
<br/>the decrease in the freight cost have come down by as much as about 40 percent.  I mean, I have a 
<br/>list that has been provided by FCCC on the various traders.  As I have said, for 230 items, some 
<br/>prices have actually gone down and I know people are telling me that the prices have actually come 
<br/>down on basic food products, things like onions, potatoes, tinned fish, and others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are things happening in the market and we are, sort of, studying that 
<br/>carefully and some of the traders have done that. So, in a sense, the measures that we put into the 
<br/>Budget, we have made it simpler, but we made sure that we also get enough revenue and as a result 
<br/>of that, we have been able to provide increases in social welfare and other areas where we have been 
<br/>able to help those who we feel will be most vulnerable and most significantly affected as a result of 
<br/>the rise in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move on and before I give the floor to the next question to be 
<br/>raised,  I  would  like  to  welcome  those  in  the  gallery.  Thank  you  for  taking  an  interest  in  your 
<br/>Parliament and to be here.  We welcome you warmly.

<br/>(Question No. 141/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform  Parliament  how  the  Ministry  intends  to  stop  or  regularise  those  private  vehicles 
<br/>involved in illegal PSV activities in order to make their business legal, lawful and safe to the 
<br/></span><span>public? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question.  Sir,  the

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1921 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- …because the question will also be responded to  with  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question, what were you doing in the last term? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of illegal vehicles has been there 
<br/>for a very long time - 16 years.  I mean, we have gone through various Ministers of Transport, CEOs 
<br/>of LTA, one was paid more than half a million dollars, and that is why we have brought in the Higher 
<br/>Salaries Commission to control that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, you know when I saw the question I am asking myself we cannot answer it because you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the answer. What were you doing?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  I  mean  a  lot  of  us  know  the  story  about  illegal  passenger 
<br/>vehicles and all that. They do satisfy a need. For example, some of the taxis do not run after hours 
<br/>and they are there.  People call them from the communities, neighbourhoods … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Wait, wait!  I am still explaining.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently we are going through and you have also gone through the public consultation on 
<br/>that in which we are continuing and there is definitely a need to regularise but the freeze is still there 
<br/>so we are looking at those regulations relating to that but it needs to be look at holistically. I know it 
<br/>is taking a bit of time but when it is done then it is better to do it holistically rather than in a piecemeal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, just to answer the honourable Member, yes, we definitely need to look at because they 
<br/>are satisfying the certain sector of the public demand but of course we need to put in place measures 
<br/></span><span>such as the standards, state of the vehicles, age and of course the training of the drivers, the standards 
<br/></span><span>which they need to adhere to. So those are issues we are looking into so we will address one of the 
<br/>problems that you passed on to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  said  the  very  right 
<br/>thing here.  These pirate taxis are running because they are serving a market.  There is a need there 
<br/>but there is a new ball game altogether now.  Most of these demands are coming from those that are 
<br/></span><span>operating from villages, so I think in order for the Ministry or LTA to do this, probably this is going 
<br/></span><span>to be a new re-look into the law that covers the PSV areas but based from villages, from rural.  The 
<br/>question now is probably about how we are going to really get the conditions in, just to stop these 
<br/>pirate operators that are coming into town.  I think they are already flooding the market in town but 
<br/>there is a need, of course, in the rural or villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the situations that we will need to look into.  Currently, when we look at the mix system which is 
<br/>the base and the open, we will need to work out whether the base system needs to be adjusted to cater 
<br/>for those who are coming to drop but not to operate near those bases.  Somehow, that needs to be 
<br/>rationalised to have that option and not to crowd out those who are based in the municipal bases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We might need to have two separate areas there but the urban or the town area the priority is 
<br/>those who have the bases there but not to deny the public the service if those who are at the base are 
<br/>not there especially during busy periods, Christmas, even Fridays and paydays.  That is something 
<br/>we are looking into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the original answer of the honourable Minister 
<br/>was giving to the other question, I thought if he wanted to give up on the post, he can give it up.  I 
<br/>appreciate the answer by the honourable Minister that he is looking into regularising people who 
<br/>drive these private taxis provided they meet the requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things I have noticed Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have had on occasion that I have to tell 
<br/>taxi drivers off because sometimes the way they are dressed, sometimes they start playing with their 
<br/>phone while they are driving.  It seems to me that once they get their PSVs, they become formal taxi 
<br/>and they get this sense of entitlement.  I am just wondering, if you are going to regularise people that 
<br/>are privately pirate taxis, once they get the formalisation, how do you make sure that the problem 
<br/>does not perpetuate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For instance, if you can go to Makoi at night and you find these taxis there.  Once they get 
<br/>that taxi permit et cetera, they probably operate during the day, they disappear again at night.  I know 
<br/>it is not a hard problem to solve but I am just thinking maybe there should be some sorts of things 
<br/>that LTA might consider on imposing on current PSV holders.  I have had a case when I had my 
<br/>grandchildren when the bus stopped at a bus stop, he stopped in the road, not in the bus stop.  I had 
<br/>to tell him off, you cannot do that, I have got grandchildren here.  He said, no you just get off, we 
<br/>had a big argument.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this sense of entitlement for people that have PSVs or commercial taxis, I hope you might 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have some idea of how they might try to address this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, thank you.  I acknowledge that it is an ongoing problem 
<br/>and as an institution, that is where the PSV training comes, in terms of public service.  That is  a 
<br/>component which is currently being looked into in terms of the provision of licence, the responsibility 
<br/></span><span>which needs to go within the compliance and the standards of dress and Code of Behaviour in terms 
<br/></span><span>of PSV not only that but also having a framework to monitor that and also have in place measures to 
<br/>pull up those who are not abiding with that Code of Behaviour.
