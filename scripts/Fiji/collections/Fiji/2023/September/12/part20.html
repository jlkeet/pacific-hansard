<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFICECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC  
<br/>ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again in the same vein as the earlier motion, this 
<br/>is  a  very  important  agreement  for  Fiji.    It  sets  the  foundation  but  may  be  historically  extremely 
<br/>important.    There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  Fiji  will  benefit  from  with  respect  to  this  particular 
<br/>agreement.  What must be realised, and as pointed out by the honourable Attorney-General, is that, 
<br/>this particular band or group of countries is about 40 percent of the GDP of the whole world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we, as a country, should put into perspective is that, Fiji is the only small country that 
<br/>is a founder member and to be invited to become the founder member on this particular economic 
<br/>framework is a massive achievement.  We are in a phenomenal company of 14 different countries as 
<br/>mentioned:  Australia,  Brunei,  Fiji,  India,  Indonesia,  Republic  of    Korea,  Japan,  Malaysia,  New 
<br/>Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam.  It just goes to show how powerful 
<br/>we are in international forums to be invited to be at that particular table.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is before us is that we need to get ratification on this also and this is 
<br/>with respect to the prosperity and supply chain as part of the agreement.  There has been finalisation 
<br/>of the legal scrub on Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), for this prosperity 
<br/>and supply chain agreement.  As we all know, this is actually a regional initiative that commenced in 
<br/>2022, as mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the basic things is that it promotes cooperation, stability, prosperity, development and 
<br/>peace within the actual region, but this is going to be the cornerstone for many things to come in 
<br/>many years to come.  It is very important.  This is one of the very reasons why I took the liberty when 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Trade first stepped into the office, I told him and I said, “Please make 
<br/>sure you do not take your foot off the gas on IPEF, it is an important tool for Fiji.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are intensive negotiations and discussions that have taken place with 
<br/>respect to this, and as I have said, now there are four different pillars on this when you are talking 
<br/>about trade, supply chains and clean and fair economy, et cetera.  There are a lot of materials on this 
<br/>that people can read if they want to.  But, once again, it is a hugely important tool.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is this particular Supply Chain Agreement that is actually unprecedented with respect to 
<br/>our  international  effort  and  it  is  there  to  enhance  our  resilience,  efficiency  or  productivity, 
<br/>sustainability,  transparency  and  diversification  all  of  those  things.    It  actually  aims  to  build  a 
<br/>collective understanding of the supply chain risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must remember that we have just come out of COVID and we 
<br/>had a whole lot of things wrong that we were not able to deal with.  So, as a country, we need to deal 
<br/>with that at that particular level and this is why this particular Agreement will aim to ensure that we 
<br/>foster  cooperation,  mobilise  investments  is  another  thing  also  transparency  in  sectors  and  goods 
<br/>crucial for national security and public health.  We may just say these words but when you get down 
<br/></span><span>to the nitty-gritty, especially when it comes to public health, national security these are important 
<br/></span><span>issues and again also the promotion of labour rights, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a whole lot attached to this particular Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.  Also for 
<br/>us, it identifies a lot of opportunities for technical assistance, some of which have already been made 
<br/>available.  I might add, this is not just the assistance that is being offered and proffered to us, it is not 
<br/>just by way of government, it is private institutions.  Some of the large, large companies out of the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United States are actually coming on board offering assistance to our MSMEs, offering assistance to 
<br/>our women.  There is a lot that Fiji can benefit from with respect to this particular Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General, this Agreement will also establish three 
<br/>new bodies and those three bodies are the Supply Chain Council, the Supply Chain Crisis Response 
<br/>Network and, again, I say this because we have just come out of COVID and great minds think alike 
<br/>and we are being considered as one of the great minds around the world by having a front and centre 
<br/>seat at these particular bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  things  that  also  stands  out  is  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic 
<br/>Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Labour Rights Advisory Board which will be formed.  Again, this 
<br/>is important, bearing in mind today’s issues that need to be addressed with respect to levy. So for 
<br/>example they will be addressing labour rights inconsistencies at the facilities that are operated by 
<br/>enterprises that are not  micro-enterprises but  are located in  the territory of one party when it can 
<br/>actually affect the supply chain of another country.  So, you can see that they are leaving no stone 
<br/>unturned and once again Fiji is at the heart of these discussions and I take my hat off to the entire 
<br/>trade crew that has been heavily involved in this with hours and hours of laborious work that actually 
<br/>take place before it comes to us to get these things ratified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With some of the goals Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the proposed Supply Chain Agreement, again, 
<br/>we are on a timeframe, we need to complete this, if I am correct honourable Minister, in November 
<br/>or late October.  There are, as mentioned by honourable Attorney-General, trading symposiums that 
<br/>will be organised by the US and I must add here Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the US is at the forefront and 
<br/>is driving this at breakneck speed. I am sure honourable Minister has had sleepless nights already 
<br/>trying to get these things organised.  They are driving this at breakneck speed to ensure that it comes 
<br/>to fruition and completion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also something else that is of quite importance that is actually called IPEF STEM 
<br/>Exchange Programme. They are launching a science technology, engineering mathematics exchange 
<br/>programme.  This is to be connected to early and mid-career professionals from IPEF countries and 
<br/>these are things that are important to us, it furthers our education, it makes us better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned also by the United States Secretary for Commerce, Mrs Gina Raimondo, a very 
<br/>very high-powered woman who will also be part and parcel of the fact finding missions that need to 
<br/>happen with all around the IPF countries. So, you can see Mr. Speaker, Sir, that with respect to trade 
<br/>missions also, there will be trade missions that are coming in and out of Fiji.  You can see that there 
<br/>is a lot that we will benefit from out of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, we go there not only to push our own position, it is also we are Pacific-minded when 
<br/>we do things, so we ensure that it is done properly so that all our Pacific Island neighbours stand to 
<br/>benefit out of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the conclusion of the negotiations I understand, Mr. Speaker, describing as I said had 
<br/>been completed. The final text of the agreement has been prepared. They are simply waiting for us 
<br/>to ratify what needs to be done as a way forward to complete this agreement and get there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, a very historical moment for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, and once its implemented, we stand to 
<br/>benefit  with  the  numerous  benefits  and  this  historic  international  agreement  that  unites  14  very 
<br/>powerful nations around the world and across the Indo-Pacific region and basically so that we can 
<br/>focus on creating reliable and secure supply chains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, all of these stem from the difficulties that we all faced post-COVID and a lot of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1737 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work is going on and I commend the team that had actually done so much work on it already having 
<br/>been part of this from day one.  We wholeheartedly support this motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thank the honourable Koya for his contributions. The IPEF 
<br/>Agreement is let me say is unusual in a lot of respects and I will try and explain why very quickly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, it has been targeted to be achieved in record type.  Ordinarily economic cooperation 
<br/>or trade agreements can take five years sometimes 10 years.  This has been done at breakneck speed.  
<br/>We signed as founding member in May last year in 2022 and the expectations are that by November, 
<br/>we would have completed all pillars if not substantively all three, with some sections left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second thing about this agreement, Sir, which I have noticed is not only the agreement is 
<br/>just about a government multilateral agreement between governments, it is actually trying to reach 
<br/>into the private sectors of each country and then attempting to connect them up as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, from that perspective, it is a lot more deeper and a lot more powerful and that is why as 
<br/>you have noticed, there is already what we could consider early harvest benefits that were itemised 
<br/>quite in detail by the honourable Attorney-General and of course, spearheaded by the Secretary for 
<br/>Commerce to President Biden’s Cabinet, Her Excellency Gina Raimondo.  She is very committed to 
<br/>work with all parties too IPEF and particularly with Fiji to see how we can harvest the benefits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another point to share with the Members of this august Parliament is the level of assistance 
<br/>that has been already offered to try and put this together. As we know, a small country like ours is 
<br/>always constrained with resources, but we have certainly had assistance from some of our very close 
<br/>partners, New Zealand has assisted us, UN as well has assisted us as well as Australia that has a 
<br/>budget of $20 million that will assist in building the necessary structures but to ensure that the IPEF 
<br/>once signed by the partners is brought into effect and embedded very well into Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If anything, Sir, the successful conclusion of the second pillar or the Supply Chain Agreement 
<br/>as mentioned by honourable Koya is a significant milestone for Fiji.  It represents the strengthening 
<br/>of economic ties across the Indo Pacific Region to no less than 40 percent of global Gross Domestic 
<br/>Product.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement is designed to enable IPEF members to work together 
<br/>collaboratively  to  make  supply  chains  for  resilient,  efficient,  transparent,  diversified,  secure, 
<br/>including through information exchange, sharing of best practices, business matchmaking, collective 
<br/>response to disruptions and supporting labour rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this agreement facilitates co-operation amongst IPEF members and fosters 
<br/>an  environment  that  promotes  competitiveness  while  reducing  costs  for  consumers.    The  Supply 
<br/>Chain  Agreement,  it  goes  without  saying,  holds  tremendous  potential  for  the  IPEF  region  and 
<br/>particularly for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Certainly, our Ministry is motivated to  ensure that  we  extract  maximum  benefit from this 
<br/>transformative arrangement.  A robust and resilient supply chain network will bolster our economy, 
<br/></span><span>help our people and build capacity to respond to unforeseen disruptions and challenges.  The IPEF 
<br/></span><span>supply agreement reflects the spirit of collaboration and shared prosperity amongst IPEF members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  IPEF members have committed to  various initiatives to  enhance the 
<br/>supply  chain  resilience  and  cooperation  amongst  the  IPEF  region  such  as  mentioned  before  - 
<br/>trainings,  symposiums,  trade  missions,  Pacific  Focus  Reverse  Mission  and  STEM  Exchange 
<br/>programme which will be a very great interest to the honourable Minister for Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>1738 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  IPEF parties  also  aim  to  establish a mutual  recognition  arrangements, cooperation on 
<br/>digital  shipping,  feasibility  studies,  and  among  other  endeavours.    The  IPEF  Supply  Chain 
<br/>Agreement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  represents  a  landmark  achievement  in  our  collective  pursuit  for 
<br/>economic  prosperity  and  regional  integration.    In  this  regard,  Fiji  needs  to  demonstrate  its 
<br/>commitment to IPEF members and capitalise on the multifarious benefits that come from being part 
<br/>of IPEF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit down Mr. Speaker, Sir, a normal question has always been there.  There are four 
<br/>pillars  to  the  agreement,  why  are  we  signing  only  one?  That  has  been  collectively  agreed  by  the 
<br/>parties and it is part of this unusual agreement that we are signing pillars individually, but that has 
<br/>been agreed amongst the parties on a multilateral basis.  It is certainly not untoward in that manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  honourable  Koya  also  referred  to  legal  scrubbing.    We  have  been  consulting  the 
<br/>Solicitor-General’s Office all the way, so in terms of the legal wording, rest assured that that has been 
<br/>taken care of as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to the Parliament and with a 
<br/>great  deal  of  enthusiasm,  I  look  forward  to  the  implementation  of  the  IPEF  arrangement  for  the 
<br/>betterment of the Fiji economy and its people.  </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by thanking the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General,  honourable  Koya  and  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications for their contribution and 
<br/>I thank the Opposition for their support to this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Agreement  on  supply  chain  comes  at  a  very  important  time.    Post-
<br/>COVID,  we  have  both  very  strong  and  difficult  challenges  but  also  we  see  a  lot  of  prospects 
<br/>domestically.    We  can  feel  the  sense  of  freedom  and  sense  of  confidence,  and  I  use  the  word 
<br/>“exuberance” at times, in what the people want  to see and the prosperity for our country so, in a 
<br/>sense, this IPEF economic framework for prosperity comes at an opportune time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can see this in the broader geopolitical context, the Indo-Pacific Strategy, we can see this 
<br/>as a geoeconomic strategic interest and the fact that Fiji is part of this group which represents both, 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications and honourable Koya pointed out that the group represents about 
<br/>40 percent of GDP, as well as about 60 percent of the world’s population.  It does provide Fiji with 
<br/>a lot of opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  challenges  we  are  facing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  we  can  see,  we  have  revised  the 
<br/>economic growth forecast from 6 percent to a consecutive 8 percent for 2023 and that is a very, very 
<br/>positive sign.  The tourism recovery, as was pointed out by honourable Gavoka, I think his leadership 
<br/>of the tourism industry right now has boosted that confidence in the post-COVID environment about 
<br/>the prospects of tourism in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we faced a lot of challenges.  In fact, in the last 18 months, we 
<br/></span><span>have lost about 10 percent of our labour force.  This point, mentioned this as honourable Sharma 
<br/></span><span>said, in 2022, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not 2023, we lost 22,302 people from Fiji, of that 16, 967 went for 
<br/>employment and about 5,335 were basically immigrating.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a huge challenge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but on the other side we have some very, very positive 
<br/>signals.  We are looking at our figures for July in terms of revenue collection, very strong, more than 
<br/>pre-COVID levels, forecast, we are looking at our August revenue collection with very, very strong 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1739 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indications.  Remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been holding very strong in the first seven months. 
<br/>We  had  about  $708  million,  the  forecast  for  2023  is  about  $1.2  billion,  it  is  relevant  honourable 
<br/>Kumar I will tell you why it is relevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investment lending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been on a very strong trajectory, same with 
<br/>consumption spending and the labour market recovery, while sometimes you might say it is a good 
<br/>problem  to  have  this  challenge,  the  labour  market  growth  has  been  very  strong  in  terms  of 
<br/>employment, wages, employees, employers and job advertisements.  Any of the indicators that you 
<br/>look at is very strong.  On the financial side, Mr. Speaker, we have healthy foreign reserve, liquidity 
<br/>is very good and as a result, interest rates are low and therefore investment spending is good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why I am saying all these, Mr. Speaker and honourable Kumar was speaking from 
<br/>the other side about relevance is the fact that the IPEF Agreement especially on global trade supply 
<br/>chains are very important because it brings multiple countries. It connects economies in a way that 
<br/>integrates, allows countries to benefit from each other and enhance international trade through better 
<br/>economic  interdependence  because  there  is  an  agreement  to  deal  with  these  countries.    It  also 
<br/>provides some sort of economic power in the sense that if you are part of this group of countries, you 
<br/>are able to negotiate things better.  It also means good diplomacy.   More than that, Mr. Speaker, the 
<br/>timing of the agreement, the timing of this whole geopolitical get together and especially, focusing 
<br/>on trade issues and supply chain issues actually provides confidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The Framework? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Framework provides confidence to the investors and those 
<br/>looking at countries as part of that group.   That is why it is also very important,  she knows about 
<br/>trade but she is still making those side remarks.  The agreement itself provides confidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She  does  not  like  the  good  news,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  good  news  is,  the  timing  of  the 
<br/>Agreement is good and it provides confidence to investors, to those looking at Fiji as a destination 
<br/>where people could come and invest.  Of course, it also forces us as a country to look at our own ease 
<br/>of doing business, our regulations and our laws, and right now, we are engaged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Trade  and  the  whole  Government,  including  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister is involved in making sure that we have a group.  We have various committees now 
<br/>set  up  by  the  Public  Service  Commission,  groups  of  Permanent  Secretaries  and  Investment 
<br/>Committees.  These are groups formed to facilitate, to ensure that we actually benefit from some of 
<br/>these  Agreements.    There  is  no  point  being  part  of  a  group  if  we  do  not  provide  the  enabling 
<br/>environment in the country.  So, in a sense, this allows us to also accelerate and make sure that we 
<br/>remove all the barriers and obstacles for investment.  In that sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very 
<br/>important Agreement, and I am glad that the Opposition is giving us support for this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  speakers  for  the 
<br/>meaningful interaction and debate in terms of moving Fiji to another level.  It is a new Fiji. We are 
<br/>grateful that both parties can come and speak honestly and passionately about the subject that Fiji 
<br/>right now deserves to activate.  I endorse this Agreement, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.
