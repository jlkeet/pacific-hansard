<div><span>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC  
<br/>ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  approves  that  Fiji  signs  and  ratifies  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Framework Supply Chain Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I will provide some background, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is a United States-led initiative 
<br/>that includes Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
<br/>Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.   The IPEF represents 40 percent of the worlds’ GDP 
<br/>and  60  percent  of  the  worlds’  population  and  more  than  a  third  of  the  worlds’  trade.    The  IPEF 
<br/>comprises four pillars namely, Trade, Supply Chain, Clean economy, and Fair economy.  The four 
<br/>IPEF pillars are independent on their own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is the first Pacific Island nation and the 14</span><span>th</span><span> country to join the IPEF on 
<br/>26</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022.   In accepting the invitation to become a founding member, Fiji saw that the US 
<br/>galvanised interest in enhancing sustainable development outcomes, peace and security in the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet Decision 48/2023 had endorsed Fiji’s negotiating machinery at the IPEF negotiations 
<br/>and for the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Micro Enterprises and Communications to 
<br/>be  responsible  for  coordinating  all  four  pillars  of  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  for 
<br/>Prosperity (IPEF) with support from relevant Ministries and agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The United States Trade Representative is leading the negotiation on trade pillar and the rest

<div><span>Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the pillars are being led by the US Department of Commerce.  The IPEF Pillar 2 – Supply Chain 
<br/>Agreement,  builds  on  from  the  ministerial  statements  which  was  agreed  by  the  Ministers  on  9</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2022 at Los Angeles, USA.  The negotiations of Pillar 2 – Supply Chain was concluded 
<br/>after  four  rounds  of  negotiations  and  was  further  endorsed  by  the  IPEF  Ministers  in  Detroit, 
<br/>Michigan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Supply Chain Agreement has a total of 27 Articles and it outlines the 
<br/>objectives and goals that the IPEF partners aim to achieve in strengthening and securing the supply 
<br/>chain.  The Agreement aims to build a collective understanding of significant supply chain risk with 
<br/>each partner identifying and monitoring its own critical sectors and key goods.  It seeks to enhance 
<br/>crisis  coordination  and  response  during  supply  chain  disruptions,  ensuring  the  timely  delivery  of 
<br/>affected goods.  Emphasis is also placed on benefitting workers and businesses, especially micro, 
<br/>small and medium sized enterprises by promptly addressing disruptions and promptly resilient robust 
<br/>and efficient supply chains. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  IPEF  partners  intend  to  prepare  businesses  to  manage  supply  chain 
<br/>bottlenecks effectively, therefore, focusing on strengthening supply chain logistics and infrastructure.  
<br/>Additionally,  the  Agreement  aims  to  foster  cooperation,  mobilise  investment,  promote  regulatory 
<br/>transparency  in  sectors  and  goods,  crucial  for  national  security,  public  health  and  safety  and 
<br/>economic stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Agreement also emphasised the importance of respecting and promoting 
<br/>labour  right  in  supply  chains;  recognising  the  vital  role  of  workers  in  enhancing  supply  chain 
<br/>resilience.  Efforts will be made to ensure that there are sufficient number of skilled workers in critical 
<br/>sectors and production of key goods through upskilling, reskilling, inclusivity and equal access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Agreement  also  identifies  opportunities  for  technical  assistance  and 
<br/>capacity building to strengthen the IPEF member supply chain.  Lastly, the  Agreement highlights 
<br/>adherence  to  market  principles  and  minimising  market  distortions  including  unnecessary  trade 
<br/>restrictions and protection of business confidential information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Agreement aims to strengthen IPEF supply chains to the establishment of 
<br/>three  new  IPEF  supply  chain  bodies  -  the  IPEF  Supply  Chain  Council.    The  Council  will  foster 
<br/>collaborative effort among IPEF partners to develop sector specific action plans for critical sectors 
<br/>and key goods, and with the goal of enhancing supply chain resilience.  The action plan will focus 
<br/>on diversifying sources, infrastructure and workforce development, improving logistics connectivity, 
<br/>facilitating  business  matching  prompting  joint  research  and  development,  and  enhancing  trade 
<br/>facilitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second body is the IPEF Supply Chain Crisis Response Network.  The Network is an 
<br/>emergency  communication  channel  and  will  enable  partners  to  seek  support  during  supply  chain 
<br/>disruptions and facilitate information sharing and collaboration amongst partners during crisis.  The 
<br/>network’s purpose is to enable a faster and more effective response that minimises negative impacts 
<br/>of the economies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The IPEF Labour Rights Advisory Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, comprises of government, worker 
<br/></span><span>and employee representatives, along with the sub-committee of government representatives which 
<br/>will  support  the  IPEF  partners  promotion  of  labour  rights  in  their  supply  chain.    The  Board  will 
<br/>facilitate sustainable trade and investment  and create opportunities for investment  businesses that 
<br/>respect labour rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Labour Rights  Advisory Board also  establishes sub-committees for  addressing labour 
<br/>rights inconsistencies. The facility is operated by enterprises that are not micro-enterprises which are 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1733 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>located in the territory of one party but can affect supply chains in the economy of another party.  A 
<br/>sub-committee will play a role in encouraging resolution efforts in providing technical assistance if 
<br/>needed.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sub-committee will maintain a public list of unresolved 
<br/>allegations which may be removed from the list if a resolution is reached or after being on the list for 
<br/>at least four years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These bodies, Mr. Speaker Sir, as proposed by the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, will play 
<br/>crucial roles in enhancing supply chain resilience, crisis response, and the promotion of labour rights 
<br/>in the IPEF partner economies.  By fostering cooperation joint actions, the Agreement seeks to create 
<br/>a robust and sustainable supply chains that will benefit all participating economies in the Indo-Pacific 
<br/>region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In alignment with the goals of the proposed IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, the United States 
<br/>has committed several initiatives to enhance supply chain, resilience and cooperation amongst the 
<br/>partners.  The first is the training symposium.  The United States will organise a series of trainings 
<br/>or symposiums focussing on supply chain, monitoring and operations. Experts from each market, 
<br/>will  be  invited  to  share  best  practices  in  cargo  risk  assessments  and  incident  response  planning, 
<br/>particularly for industries affected by natural disasters and cyber incidents.  These efforts aim to help 
<br/>industries  recover  faster  and  improve  the  identification  of  supply  chain  bottlenecks  and  import 
<br/>dependencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one, Mr Speaker Sir, is the IPEF STEM Exchange Programme. The United States 
<br/>will launch a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Exchange Programme to 
<br/>connect  early  and  mid-career  professionals  from  IPEF  countries  with  professional  development 
<br/>opportunities in supply chain operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third is a fact-finding mission. The Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, will join 
<br/>the President’s Export Council on a fact-finding mission to select IPEF markets to explore potential 
<br/>collaboration and opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth is the trade missions. The Department of Commerce will also lead up to ten trade 
<br/>missions  to  IPEF  markets  over  the  next  five  years  focused  on  linking  American  exporters  to 
<br/>opportunities in sectors for which IPEF Partners will increase diversification and resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fifth, Mr. Speaker Sir, is  the Mutual  Recognition  Arrangements (MRAs). The United 
<br/>States aims to establish MRAs with IPEF Partners’ Authorized Economic Operator Programmes that 
<br/>currently  lack  MRAs  within  the  United  States  Customs  Trade  Partnership  against  Terrorism 
<br/>Programme (CTPAT). This move will promote similar and secured trade between IPEF partners and 
<br/>the United States.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  sixth,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  is  the  cooperation  on  digital  shipping.  The  United  States  will 
<br/>allow  its  support  for  cooperation  on  digital  shipping,  including  pilot  projects  with  IPEF  partners 
<br/>starting  with  the  Port  of  Singapore.    This  initiative  will  enhance  efficiency  and  modern  shipping 
<br/>practices. A workshop for cyber-capacity building of ports has already been announced and we are 
<br/>obtaining nominations from FPCL and PFTL.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The seventh and the last one, Mr. Speaker, is the feasibility studies and reverse trade missions. 
<br/>The United States will initiate several new feasibility studies and reverse trade missions, which will 
<br/>bring experts from IPEF markets to the United States to meet with leading US exporters.  This will 
<br/>support supply chain modernisation in IPEF markets.  What is the way forward for Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives, SMEs and Communications will coordinate with the
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whole of government to undertake steps to ensure effective implementation and compliance with the 
<br/>Agreement such as to establish mechanisms, agencies, or departments responsible for overseeing the 
<br/>implementation of the Agreement. These entities will facilitate coordination, monitor progress, and 
<br/>address any challenges that may arise during the implementation process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will  also  ensure  domestic  alignment  and  streamlining  of  policies,  laws  and 
<br/>regulations. The Ministry will also engage in efforts to promote awareness and benefits of supply-
<br/>chain agreement among other ministries, businesses, and other stakeholders. The Ministry will also 
<br/>participate in the agreement through institution bodies outlined in section 35 as stated above. The 
<br/>Ministry will also facilitate training and capacity building for relevant government officials, agencies 
<br/>and stakeholders to effectively implement the Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  Cooperatives,  SMEs  and  Communication  have 
<br/>obtained Cabinet endorsement for the tabling of the IPEF Supply-Chain Agreement when Parliament 
<br/>is  in  session.    Given  that,  it  is  recommended  that  Fiji  sign  and  ratify  the  IPEF  Supply-Chain 
<br/>Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor for the debate on the motion, 
<br/>it is 4.00 p.m. and as usual, for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to 
<br/>sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move her 
<br/>motion.
