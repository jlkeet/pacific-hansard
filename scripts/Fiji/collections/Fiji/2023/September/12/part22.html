<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate of the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have here before me a list of speakers that have been identified by the honourable Whips.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Opposition, we have four and for the Government, we have two.  We will begin the 
<br/>first two speakers from the Opposition before we will give the floor to the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span><span>Public Works and Meteorological Services, and Transport and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will round it 
<br/>off for Government.   Honourable Hem Chand, the floor is yours, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to contribute to the Review Report of the Land 
<br/>Transport Authority 2014-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 Annual Report.  The Committee Report 
<br/>provides a very comprehensive overview of the LTA’s performance during this period, including its
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1750 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>achievements and areas for improvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee identified several areas that need to be strengthened by the 
<br/>Authority including the need for a very comprehensive review of the LTA Act, the need for a more 
<br/>robust  regulatory  framework,  the  need  for  better  coordination  between  the  LTA  and  other 
<br/>government agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report notes that the LTA has made significant progress in the areas of 
<br/>road safety, customer service and infrastructure development.  The year in review saw the opening 
<br/>of the new Nausori LTA office, Risk Management Strategies put into place and Go Green Project 
<br/>were successfully implemented.  Nationwide bus and fleet audits were conducted, red light and speed 
<br/>cameras were installed at new sites.  The Japan Vehicle Export Inspection Centre was established for 
<br/>the inspection of secondhand imported vehicles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  furthermore,  e-services  were  introduced  by  LTA.    The  Committee’s 
<br/>recommendations provide a roadmap for the LTA to improve its performance and better serve the 
<br/>people  of  Fiji.    The  Committee  recommends  that  the  LTA  develop  a  comprehensive  stakeholder 
<br/>engagement strategy that includes regular meetings with stakeholders, public consultations and the 
<br/>use of social media and other communication channels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report also highlights the need for LTA to work in collaboration with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mobile service providers, private bus operators and the Ministry of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee’s report is an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to improve the 
<br/>transport  sector  in  Fiji  and  to  ensure  that  it  meets  the  needs  of  the  people.  The  Report  provides 
<br/>valuable insights into the LTA’s performance and identifies areas for improvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  recommendations  provide  a  roadmap  for  the  LTA  to  improves  its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>performance and better serves the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, with the collaboration work and initiatives conducted by LTA members of 
<br/>the public also at this time would like to state their disappointment with the road conditions around 
<br/>Fiji. For example, the Princess Road from Dilkusha to the road that leads to Sawani and ACS is in 
<br/>bad condition which we hope the Minister will look into it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, improve, improve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  those  words,  I  support  the  motion  before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to honourable Tuinaceva because he does a lot of body 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>language as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had signalled to the honourable Whip whether there were four speakers so he could confirm, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and he said, “yes, four,” and then he went like this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Probably to me, that means they will speak very short.  Earlier on, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate was explaining something in the Chamber, and he did this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1751 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is a sign that it was so small.  Yes, very interesting, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution on the motion 
<br/>but firstly, let me thank the Committees, both the new and the old, for the preparation and presentation 
<br/>of this good Report. I realize that they have covered a lot of issues that are very sensitive to the public 
<br/>and also that touches the real core and the function of the Land Transport Authority (LTA).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker  when  you  closely  look  into  the  Land  Transport  Authority’s  core  function  as 
<br/>stipulated under section 8 of the Land Transport Act 1998, which is also mentioned in this Report 
<br/>we will come to the fact that the 6 functions are rooted in one single word which is “Safety”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker Sir,  I noted with  interest the Committee’s emphasis  on the number of  Traffic 
<br/>Infringement Notices (TINs) issued during the period of review. The report shows an increase of 12 
<br/>to 49 percent of TINs given between the year 2014, 2015 to 2016, I think that covers the early part 
<br/>of 2017 as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This TIN issuance is part of being a deterrent also used as indicators on the level of effort 
<br/>taken by enforcement officers to clamp down on the traffic offences on our roads as stated under 
<br/>section 86 and 92 of the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the downside about TIN issuance is a reactive approach, what is disturbing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is when we see an increase in TIN issuance but at the same time …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this year, there is a spike, an example, Mr Speaker, a report released by police on 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>August this year 2023 stated a total of 25,960 TINs were issued for speeding offences only from the 
<br/>period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to June 2023. Now, the distressing part is that during the period of heavy bookings, 
<br/>there were 56 deaths on our roads compared to 21 in the same period last year, which is about 170 
<br/>percent increase.   Mr. Speaker, for the whole of 2021, there were only 25 deaths on our road, in 2022 
<br/>there were about 44 deaths but here we are in the first six months of this year, 56 deaths.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, common sense is telling us something is terribly wrong. Reflecting on these 
<br/>figures, I fully support the Committee’s recommendation in item 4.1 that the institutions responsible 
<br/>for  road  safety  namely  the  Fiji  Police  Force  and  the  Land  Transport  Authority  need  to  be  more 
<br/>proactive, acting beyond words, beyond re-active press conferences, beyond post-accident articles 
<br/>and  beyond  responding  to  questions  from  reporters.  We  need  to  drive  awareness  in  a  consistent 
<br/>manner  targeting  key  stakeholders,  drivers,  public  service  vehicles,  operators,  pedestrians  and 
<br/>passengers with clear measurable outcomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we need to dig deep, invest the funds, commit the manpower, enforce the laws, 
<br/>penalise, criminalise and consistently drive road safety awareness exponentially to critical mass so 
<br/>we are talking about road safety from the community level right up to all echelons of leadership and 
<br/>not sporadic awareness efforts from here and there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  also  noted  from  the  Report,  the  Committee’s  remarks  for  LTA  to  work  in 
<br/></span><span>collaboration with various stakeholders to address challenges associated with e-ticketing.  One of the 
<br/>e-ticketing  objectives  when  the  idea  first  came  in  2011  was  to  save  the  30  percent  bus  operators 
<br/>income that goes straight to the pocket of drivers. The understanding was that this 30 percent savings 
<br/>will enable bus companies to carry out fleeting especially purchasing of good buses to provide best 
<br/>and safe services for the people of Fiji. From 2017 when the system came into being until to-date, 
<br/>many challenges have been identified and I do support the Committee that a review to  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>1752 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>address the challenges to convene immediately.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to give are few suggestions on some solutions LTA can take on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>board to assist in improving the e-ticketing service: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Top up agents accessibility - the lack of agencies in both urban and the rural has become a 
<br/>real problem and is one of the reasons it was hard for the travelling public to get card topped-
<br/>up. They do have the right to travel, and every avenue must be available in a convenient 
<br/>manner  to  assist  in  topping  up  of  e-cards.    Whoever  the  service  provider  that  will  be 
<br/>contracted for this particular role should find solutions that can come in many facets to 
<br/>address this particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  connectivity  -  e-ticketing  is  internet  driven,  the  lack  of  connectivity  in  some  areas 
<br/>totally hinders the system and without internet, both administering the fare through e-card 
<br/>and top-up is impossible. If passengers are determined to travel, then their only option is to 
<br/>give cash to drivers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The enforcement – in any law, without proper enforcement is useless. The LTA will need 
<br/>to  devise  new  methods  of  enforcing  the  e-ticketing  law  in  a  more  stringent,  consistent 
<br/>manner but only after addressing the accessibility and the connectivity problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tap in and the tap out concept - even if full accessibility and connectivity in the e-ticketing 
<br/>system, they still can tamper to benefit both the drivers and passengers illegally. With the 
<br/>current  process,  drivers  can  still  manipulate  the  system  and  undercharge  or  overcharge 
<br/>fares, the motive is nothing else but to steal funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my view on the top-up, will leave the system performance and will be able to 
<br/>correct some errors in the current system but must be put on trial on certain routes like the urban 
<br/>areas  and  the  idea  is  get  a  feel  of  the  system,  correct  the  fails  and  put  into  full  operation  when 
<br/>everyone is happy about the system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Report  also  highlighted  the  increase  in  the  number  of  previously 
<br/>registered vehicles coming into our shores.  The question on the standard and the integrity of those 
<br/>units since most of the vehicles estimated at around 60 percent coming into our shores are from Japan. 
<br/>In  2016  LTA  signed  an  agreement  with  the  Japan  Export  Vehicle  Inspection  Centre  abbreviated 
<br/>(JEVIC) to carry out this offshore inspection to ensure that vehicles coming to our country (Fiji) are 
<br/>well checked and pass the standard accepted by the Land Transport Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to say that the honourable Minister for lands who was Manager Legal at LTA that time 
<br/>was the one who devised all the policies and the regulations that are still being used by the Authority 
<br/>to check on these second-hand or used vehicle. The only sad part about this idea was when we were 
<br/>not  able  or  that  time  to  also  apply  the  same  rule  into  those  vehicle  coming  from  New  Zealand, 
<br/>Australia  and  those  coming  from  Singapore  and  Thailand  which  makes  the  young  40  percent  of 
<br/>secondhand used vehicles that are coming into the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Japan is accredited with the ISO1720 to carry out the structural and undercarriage inspection, 
<br/></span><span>including the automated and stolen vehicle verifications and even the Euro 4 standard compliance 
<br/>check before their shift over to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the objective is protecting our shores and markets from what is being known as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>junk vehicles from Elite that there has been illegally modified and the integrity has been  
<br/>compromised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1753 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report has recommended a close collaboration between LTA and all bus companies to 
<br/>achieve a 100 percent compliance quality assurance maintenance system.  The Quality Management 
<br/>System (QMS) within a set time, I do support the recommendation by the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently,  we  have  watched  and  read  reports  on  bus  crashes,  bus  collision,  bus  fires,  bus 
<br/>breakdowns, et cetera.  Such incidents raises questions on the status of the Certificate of Fitness that 
<br/>are given to these buses. Mr. Speaker, the quality assurance maintenance system for heavy Public 
<br/>Service Vehicles is a rigorous inspection of all documentations related to bus companies, vehicle 
<br/>check and also the maintenance programme. It includes inspection of facilities and ensuring that bus 
<br/>operators maintain a daily check of all buses, a defect reporting register and a maintenance register.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this quality assurance maintenance system inspection is also critical to around 
<br/>60 bus companies operating in our country when renewing their road route licence which is about 
<br/>188 (RL) granted for 10 years and allows a particular bus company to operate on the given route.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation of the QMS means ensuring everyday safety conditions on buses, this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular scheme will give commuters great confidence in using this mode of transport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a lot of criticisms are levelled against the bus condition within the period of 
<br/>their Certificate of Fitness. People are pointing to poor bus conditions, once Certificate of Fitness in 
<br/>a bus is valid, these QMS reflects the visions of the LTA taking the Certificate of Fitness matter to 
<br/>another level whereby the focus is not only for that date of inspection where the Certificate of Fitness 
<br/>is given but maintaining the fitness condition of these buses 365 days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my view, LTA will need to monitor and to consistently carry out bus fleet audit to ensure 
<br/>the  QMS  compliance  is  at  all  time  if  they  want  the  QMS  programme  to  be  more  effective  and 
<br/>meaningful.  It  is  also  noted from  the Report the need for LTA to  work closely with  FRA in  the 
<br/>construction of the road humps, zebra crossings, speed limit signages and other safety mechanisms 
<br/>especially at school zones.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 80 percent of deaths on our roads are caused by over 
<br/>speeding.  It is a behavioral problem that is becoming a huge concern on our roads, and it is getting 
<br/>worse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I mentioned earlier that close to 26,000 bookings for speeding offences only for the first six 
<br/>months of this year.  That is how bad the speeding problem is on our roads.  Speed limit alone will 
<br/>not do the job.  Repeated offenders should be harshly penalised, fines should be severe and license 
<br/>to be suspended or cancelled for those continuing to disrespect the law, otherwise our road continues 
<br/>to be a killing field.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am aware that the LTA is considering putting into full force the merit point system.  I do 
<br/>commend the mover.  We need to stop these drivers from over speeding and the number of deaths on 
<br/>our roads keep on increasing because of this speeding problem.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  conclusion, I thank the Committee for again  bringing up the issue of 
<br/>traffic congestion in their Report.  The negative impact of traffic congestion cannot be overstressed 
<br/>as it generates all sorts of problems, like air pollution, noise pollution, mental and emotional stress 
<br/></span><span>and economical loss.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Traffic congestion is a complex subject and it has to be looked at in a total picture.  I want to 
<br/>say that there was a report prepared by the FRA titled, “Greater Suva Transportation Strategies” some 
<br/>years ago which was headed by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs.  A great report, Sir, it had 
<br/>the views of some great engineers in the region.  They identified great ideas which we can use to 
<br/>solve and address the congestion problems on our roads. The ideas like the dedicated bus lanes, linked

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>traffic signals, improve the bus terminals, intersection upgrades and carpooling as the solution for 
<br/>traffic during peak hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I thank the Committee for their great work, and I support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Opposition Members for their 
<br/>contribution.  Because we are the largest party here in this Parliament, we will have a lot of speakers 
<br/>from this side. Unfortunately, there are three small parties on the other side, so I can imagine the 
<br/>amount of speech they will make.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I stand before you to support the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/>regarding the review of the Land Transport Authority for the years 2014 to 2017.  This Report shed 
<br/>light  on  the  crucial  aspects  of  our  transportation  system  and  provides  invariable  insights  into  the 
<br/>challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.  I must commend the Standing Committee for its diligent 
<br/>work in scrutinising the LTA’s activities during this period.  Their efforts have enabled us to gain a 
<br/>deeper understanding of the issues facing our transportation sector and have laid the foundation for 
<br/>a meaningful change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key findings of this Report that warrants our attention is the significant increase 
<br/>in Traffic Infringement Notices (TINs) issued and vehicles seized between 2014 and 2017.  Whilst 
<br/>some  may  argue  that  this  reflects  a  heavy-handed  approach,  we  must  recognise  that  this  surge  is 
<br/>primarily due to the expanding vehicle population on our roads.  With more vehicles comes with 
<br/>greater responsibility to ensure road safety.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The LTA in collaboration with the Fiji Police Force has been conducting more random checks 
<br/>and enforcement operations to maintain order on our roads.  This is a necessary step to protect the 
<br/>lives of our citizens.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that the road conditions in our country are 
<br/>deteriorating rapidly.  Our infrastructure is crumbling and yet the Land Transport Authority continues 
<br/>to charge vehicle drivers for road levies. This is a matter of grave concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How can we justify collecting these levies when the very roads they are intended to maintain 
<br/>are in such a dire state?  I urge the honourable Minister responsible for transportation and I think the 
<br/>same Minister is responsible for roads as well to take immediate action.  It is not enough to charge 
<br/>our  citizens  for  road  levies  without  ensuring  that  their  hard-earned  money  is  invested  in  road 
<br/>maintenance and improvements.  We must address these issues urgently and allocate the necessary 
<br/>funds to repair and upgrade our road infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  been  distressing  reports  of  misconduct  by  LTA 
<br/>officers during road inspections.  Such behaviour not only tarnishes the reputation of the LTA but 
<br/>also erodes the trust of the public. We need transparency and accountability in the actions of our 
<br/>enforcement officers.  The Minister must step up to ensure that officers are held accountable for their 
<br/>actions and that proper training and oversight are in place to prevent such incidents from occurring 
<br/>in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while  we applaud the  LTA for its effort to improve the road safety  and 
<br/></span><span>transportation services in Fiji, there are pressing issues that demand our attention. We must prioritise 
<br/>the  maintenance  of  our  roads  as  highlighted  by  honourable  Hem  Chand,  the  roads  that  leads  to 
<br/>Sawani, Muaniweni and these areas, I had the opportunity to personally visit these areas and the road 
<br/>condition is pathetic.

<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- If you had listened to me a while ago you would have heard - Muaniweni, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sawani and Viria.  If you want, I can give you a tour, do not worry.

<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must also hold our LTA officers accountable for their conduct and 
<br/>ensure that such implementation  of initiatives  like the  e-ticketing system  as  well.   I call upon all 
<br/>Members of Parliament to support the Report before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion in front of 
<br/>us regarding the LTA Annual Report 2014-2017.  As noted, it is quite dated, there are quite a few 
<br/>issues  raised  there  including  the  improvements.  There  is  emphasis  on  road  safety  which  is 
<br/>acknowledged.  Unfortunately, there used to be a National Road Safety Council, and this had been 
<br/>done away with by the last government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, again this is one of the areas which we need to improve on as we move forward. There 
<br/>are  various  issues  regarding  collaboration.  There  is  a  qualified  audit  opinion  which  has  been 
<br/>mentioned there and LTA is taking the necessary processes.  There have been assurance given, also 
<br/>given the dated Annual Reports, when I came into the Ministry that is one of the big weaknesses in 
<br/>terms of monitoring and evaluation and reporting within the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, this is an inheritance from the last government which we will need to rectify and work 
<br/>on.  That not only includes the reporting from within the Ministry but also the agencies like LTA. 
<br/>So, if we have had efficient, effective monitoring systems from the previous administration then we 
<br/>might not have been in this situation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- </span><span>Vakarorogo mada. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Big issue on potholes, pot holes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  There  is  also  an  issue  on  Japan  Export  Vehicle  Inspection 
<br/>Centre, that is a very significant and good development as explained by honourable Tuinaceva who 
<br/>is very knowledgeable in the industry as a former CEO and also he is a transport engineer, I believe.  
<br/>I acknowledge the assistance and the exchange we always have which is very critical as we move 
<br/>forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>E-ticketing  has  been  mentioned,  and  there  is  a  joint  committee  under  the  Minister  of 
<br/>Communications working on that and we should be working towards a solution. I understand the 
<br/>various challenges faced with e-ticketing.  I mentioned road safety awareness but I do not want to 
<br/>repeat that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are various complex legislations in the LTA Act and the regulations, et cetera.  All this 
<br/>is  currently  being  looked  at,  but  it  cannot  be  looked  at  in  isolation  -  it  needs  to  be  looked  at 
<br/>holistically.  People can still sell their permits and this is one of the major issues that we are looking 
<br/>at reviewing and some permits have been sold for up to nearly $100,000.  It has become an industry 
<br/></span><span>in itself and again that is an issue which continues to breed unethical practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ketan Lal has specifically asked me to step up – yes, we are stepping up.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taxi  lottery  that  was  a  methodology  for  distributing  taxi  permits  which  was  just  a  joke.    That  is 
<br/>something we are working on fixing.  We have the open system and the base system – two systems 
<br/>which are essentially contradictory which we will need to resolve.

<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  other  issues  have  been  raised  by  the  opposition  on  the  infrastructure  -  you  have 
<br/>mentioned the roads et cetera.  Again, as I have already mentioned, this is an issue which we, as a 
<br/>Government, have inherited, and a lot of those issues were because you guys spent the budget and in 
<br/>December it was done, there was no money - that is why the roads you are going on has a lot of 
<br/>potholes. You are twisting it around.  Instead, you should be saying “We are the result of the bad 
<br/>roads, not you.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of the issues raised are symptoms or outcomes of what has been happening in the last 
<br/>few years - it did not just happen now.  It is the results of frameworks and systems which have been 
<br/>there for the last 10 or so years and we are in the process of looking at those issues including the 
<br/>roads - I have mentioned it. The reform within FRA, the reform within PWD - a lot of the roads you 
<br/>mention have been neglected because FRA in the past has said that it is a non-FRA road.  That is the 
<br/>problem, but now we are working at amalgamating those and ensuring that not only the institutions 
<br/>but also the infrastructure, move forward as one. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise in support of the motion and would like to thank 
<br/>the former committee members and the current committee members for the report and also like to 
<br/>thank the LTA Management for the work done during those particular years of the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, my colleagues have already spoken on a lot of points, so once again I support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B. C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr Speaker Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- When will you fix the potholes, honourable Minister?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just try to listen, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- I know the honourable Minister provided the responses very 
<br/>well.  He basically destroyed the myth or the lies that keep coming from the other side, especially 
<br/>some of the new honourable Members. I think the older ones probably understand the legacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just remind them, Mr. Speaker, we are looking at 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 Reports.  
<br/>This itself proves the point that honourable Minister Tuisawau was making about the laxity issues. 
<br/>Honourable Tuinaceva was a Chief Executive Officer in 2015 so I am not sure whether he is also 
<br/>responsible for the delay in getting these Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just give you an example.  We are looking at the Reports and we cannot understand 
<br/>how  an  organisation  does  if  the  Reports  do  not  come  on  a  timely  manner,  and  if  they  are  not 
<br/>scrutinised by the Office of the Auditor-General  or not scrutinised by the Parliament  - this was a 
<br/>consistent problem.  All of us in the Opposition knew about the previous governments inability to 
<br/>bring Annual Reports on time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Levu na vosa, lailai na cakacaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- So, we are looking at 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2017-2018, this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the update. They do not like this, but this is the fact.

<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1757 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the update of the reports: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017-2018 - the Annual Report design has been completed, this has yet to be finalised and 
<br/>printed.   
<br/>2018-2019 - this is in progress, the Report will be designed and printed in the 2023-2024 
<br/>financial year.   
<br/>2019-2020  -  this  is  in  progress.  The  completion  of  the  Report  is  dependent  on  the 
<br/>completion of the audit. 
<br/>2020-2021  -  this  is  in  progress.  The  completion  of  the  Report  is  dependent  on  the 
<br/>completion of the audit. 
<br/>2021-2022  -  this  is  in  progress.  The  completion  of  the  Report  is  dependent  on  the 
<br/>completion of the audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they talk about the problems that we have.  They were the most manipulative 
<br/>government in terms of what was happening in the Land Transport Authority. The whole apparatus 
<br/>and organisation were dysfunctional.  That is why we have not been able to get the Reports on time. 
<br/>Here we are talking about these Reports and trying to tell the new Government what it should have 
<br/>done in the last six months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR - Nine months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Of course, we are doing it.  As the honourable Minister said, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are talking about the road conditions. Yes, we know there are potholes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, fix it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, we know there are potholes during their time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  But  when  we  came  into  power,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spent the whole budget for a year in six months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  There  were  crooks  running  some  of  those  organisations.  
<br/>Crooks sitting on the board. Crooks running the organisation and they were not able to fix and spend 
<br/>money and give value for money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought we were in a fish market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- There is Point of Order under Standing Order 74(1)(a), Parliamentary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>practice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, time and time again the honourable Minister for Finance is labelling accusations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and calling people crooks and liars… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No, no, you are not the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is about time if you are worth your salt in this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, if you are going to label an accusation against anyone, give it with some proof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Prove it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has to  come up with the proof.  He has labelled 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accusations against Board Members, LTA, et cetera - please give us the proof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And bring the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It will come, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let them wait. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Some, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have already been identified.  That is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a fact… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Name them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The new Board is on the dot, they are working on it.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister is working on it… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Excellent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and we are going to make sure that from now onward, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we have value for money.  We have a right environment, right process to follow so that 
<br/>we ensure there is value for money.  But the point that they need to admit, they need to accept is that 
<br/>we were not able to produce annual reports on time.  The Auditor-General was not able to look at the 
<br/>accounts.  How can we in this Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the horse has bolted already - audit 
<br/>reports are pending for years.  How can you run an organisation based on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the point we are making, and we are now as a Government, we are making sure and 
<br/>we will ensure that there is proper monitoring, evaluation of organisations, statutory organisations, 
<br/>government commercial companies where Government puts in taxpayers funds, that we get timely 
<br/>annual reports.  We get timely audits so that we have a proper perspective on how the organisations 
<br/>are running and whether they are performing.  That is the most important aspect of the work of this 
<br/>Parliament, the work of various Committees but if the reports are not there, how can we do that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just conclude by saying that the Government in the last Budget has provided adequate 
<br/>funding to LTA and FRA.  There are new structures, new processes are being put in place, a lot of 
<br/>work has already been done, and roads are being identified. Of course, we understand there are areas 
<br/>where the roads need urgent attention, there are potholes in some of the roads, but that is going to be 
<br/>fixed and I want to assure the people of Fiji and those who are affected in areas where the roads are 
<br/>not as good as it ought to be - the Fiji Roads Authority as the honourable Minister said, is on  
<br/></span><span>track and these issues will be addressed as quickly as possible. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all our honourable 
<br/>Members that contributed to the motion before Parliament.  Again, I would like to urge the agency 
<br/>concerned  through  the  relevant  Ministry  to  work  on  the  submission  of  the  other  pending  annual 
<br/>reports.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
