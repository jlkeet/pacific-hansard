<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I am pleased to present the 
<br/>Report  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  on  the  review  of  the  Levuka  Town  Council 
<br/>Annual  Reports  for  the  Years  2012  and  2013.    This  review  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with 
<br/>Standing  Order  109(2)(b),  which  mandates  the  Committee  to  look  into  issues  related  to  health, 
<br/>education, social services, labour, culture and media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Levuka Town Council 2012 and 2013 Annual Reports were referred to the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  during  the  previous  Parliament  term.  In  this  new  term  of 
<br/>Parliament,  both  the  Annual  Reports  were  re-introduced  and  referred  to  the  current  Standing 
<br/>Committee  through  the  normal  process  for  report  scrutiny.  The  Committee  was  mandated  by 
<br/>Parliament to review the Annual Reports and report back on its findings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the vision of Levuka Town Council is “to uphold the significance of Levuka’s 
<br/>heritage  to  derive  sustainable  livelihoods  for  all”.  The  Mission  is  “to  promote  economic  growth 
<br/>through improved partnerships and efficient service delivery”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, during the years 2012 and 2013, the Council highlighted a few events that made 
<br/>it special, for instance, the courtesy visits from the Special Administrator (Rakiraki) for the Levuka 
<br/>and Rakiraki tourism partnership; the Director of Local Government and Chief Executive Officer 
<br/>Nadi; the Ministry of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment; and the Parliament Standing 
<br/>Committee on Public Accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, further to the above, the Council carried out the following activities, it: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>launched the Nomination Dossier and later Levuka  Town Council  was inscribed in the 
<br/>World Heritage Listing; 
<br/>hosted the arrival of </span><span>Uto ni Yalo</span><span>; and 
<br/>increased human resource capacity to enhance the services provided by the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee acknowledged the work carried out by the Town Council in 2012 
<br/>and 2013, and it also noted the challenges and opportunities that Levuka can build on to boost its 
<br/>economic viability and its status as a Municipal Council. Therefore, I take this time to acknowledge 
<br/>the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament for their 
<br/>effort  and  input,  which  have  assisted  the  current  Standing  Committee  in  the  completion  of  this 
<br/></span><span>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the current Members of the Standing Committee for 
<br/>their valuable input and support.  I extend my gratitude to the Special Administrator and staff of the 
<br/>Levuka Town Council for their timely assistance in this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting date. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present another report of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the review of the Tavua Town Council Report for the 
<br/>Year Ended 2015. This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), which 
<br/>mandates that the Committee look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, 
<br/>culture and media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Tavua Town Council Annual Report was referred to the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Social Affairs during the 2018–2022 Parliament term.  However, in this new term of Parliament, 
<br/>the  Annual  Report  was  reintroduced  and  referred  to  the  current  Standing  Committee  through  the 
<br/>normal  process  for  report  scrutiny.    The  Committee  was  mandated  by  Parliament  to  review  the 
<br/>Annual Report and report back on its findings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was good to note that in 2015, the Tavua Town Council assisted stakeholders in achieving 
<br/>its ultimate objective by recognising its contribution to socio-economic development which uplifts 
<br/>the  standard  of  Tavua  Town.    For  instance,  the  Council  assisted  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in 
<br/>organising the Agriculture Show in Tavua. This was the first of its kind and it was an advantage for 
<br/>the people of Tavua to witness activities and programmes piloted by the Ministry of Agriculture.  
<br/>Also,  the  establishment  of  the  Ex-offenders  Association  and  the  engagement  of  offenders  in  the 
<br/>Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tavua Town Council was awarded the Clean Small Town designation in 2015.  This can 
<br/>be seen as boosting the recognition of the town.  Inter-agency meeting on child abuse, neglect and 
<br/>abandonment with Government Officials and the Tavua Town Council also organised its first ever 
<br/>New Year Street Party.  The Committee commends the work carried out by the Council and would 
<br/>like  to  recommend  that  it  continues  to  promote  community  engagement  to  achieve  a  healthy 
<br/>environment and an efficient infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the current Members of the Standing Committee for 
<br/></span><span>their  valuable  input  and  support.    I  also  extend  my  gratitude  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and 
<br/>Management of the Tavua Town Council for their timely assistance in this review process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this 
<br/>Report to Parliament and request that all honourable Members of this august Parliament take note of 
<br/>the Report.
