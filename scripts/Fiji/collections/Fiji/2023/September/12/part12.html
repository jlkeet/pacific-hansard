<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Sustainable Tourism Framework</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  people  of  Fiji;  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  make  a 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on the National Sustainable Tourism Framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Sustainable  Tourism  Framework  is  a  proposed  10  Year 
<br/>Strategy led by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.   Essentially, what  it  intends to  do is 
<br/>develop a shared vision for the Fiji Tourism Sector over the next decade.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Coalition Government maintains, we believe in regional prosperity. 
<br/>Recently, the Pacific Tourism Leaders collectively committed to our ambition of a regional tourism 
<br/>sector that supports the wellbeing of Pacific peoples, our cultures and our island and ocean resources.  
<br/>Drawing inspiration from the Pacific and adopting global best practices to the Fiji context, Fiji is 
<br/>embracing principles that reinforce shared Pacific values to preserve the future of Pacific destinations 
<br/>for future generations of a Blue Pacific.  Tourism, of course, plays a central role to this prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  taking  a  two-phase  approach  on  the  development  of  Fiji’s 
<br/>Sustainable  Tourism  Framework.    As  I  had  shared  earlier  in  this  Parliament,  a  private  sector  led 
<br/>Steering Committee is  closely  overseeing  and  contributing  to  the development of the  Framework 
<br/>because we do not want this to be just a Government vision.  The Committee consists of key partners, 
<br/>such  as  the  Fiji  Hotel  and  Tourism  Association,  Fiji  Airways,  Tourism  Fiji,  Duavata  Sustainable 
<br/>Collective, Society of Fiji Travel Associates, Savusavu and Suncoast Tourism Associations, as well 
<br/></span><span>as key development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the first phase, over the next 12 months, the Ministry, with the 
<br/>support of the International Finance Corporation, held a series of public private dialogues with over 
<br/>600 people. This was mostly delivered virtually to include stakeholders outside Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We covered topics such as private sector sustainability and greening, respectful and equitable

<div><span>Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>workplaces;  tourism  as  a  preferred  employer;  financial  solutions  for  micro,  small  and  medium 
<br/>enterprises; public infrastructure; sectoral linkages; product and experience development, growth of 
<br/>Airbnb; cruise market; and tourism entrepreneurship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  held  focussed  group  discussions  with  key  Government  agencies  on  the  visitor 
<br/>economy, conservation tourism, agri-tourism, culture, community-based tourism, et cetera, and we 
<br/>have more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also seeking the views of the broader public through an online survey 
<br/>and are inviting written submissions.  Whether you are a Government industry, an NGO, academia, 
<br/>civil society, a student or essentially anyone, we want as many views as possible to call it a national 
<br/>framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these discussions, along with an assessment on the current status of the Fiji 
<br/>Tourism Sector, have resulted in several key priorities to be considered by the National Sustainable 
<br/>Tourism Framework and its accompanying three-year action plan.  We want to ascertain where we 
<br/>are now, determining where we want to be, what the challenges are and where the opportunities lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on consultations in the first phase, what came out strongly was that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tourism stakeholders collectively desire a future in which tourism: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actively contributes to fulfilling career and quality employment;  
<br/>continues to add value to the local economy, including communities and the vulnerable; 
<br/>safeguards and promotes cultural heritage; 
<br/>encourages pro-quality investments; 
<br/>ensures equitable returns to indigenous communities; and 
<br/>plays its part in reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate and disaster risks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the future we want for tourism. Looking at the data from April to 
<br/>December 2022, visitors to Fiji contributed $2.9 billion to the economy.  The average visitor spent 
<br/>$376 per night, compared to  $353 in  2019, and $3,572 per trip up from $3,379 in  2019.  So, the 
<br/>demand for Fiji is high with visitors staying longer, spending and doing more, and we want to build 
<br/>on that.  Because of this strong performance, we are now looking at an 8 percent economic growth 
<br/>this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  order  to  inform  the  next  phase,  which  is  the  development  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Framework,  we  have  synthesized  various  discussions  from  Phase  A  into  a  summary  report.  This 
<br/></span><span>report  provides  an  overview  of  Phase  A  of  the  Framework  development,  including  background 
<br/>research and outcomes from the first set of stakeholder consultations.  It also captures the emerging 
<br/>priorities of the industry to be reflected in the Framework.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 11 key topics that are covered, looking at all the discussions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have had on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving the policy and regulatory environment. 
<br/></span><span>Embedding sustainability across all that we hope to achieve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Visitor economy and its contribution to our national wellbeing. 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Our different markets. 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Our asset and experience - creating more diverse operations. 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Having in place measurable Tourism Standards beyond economic indicators. 
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Financing on investments. 
<br/></span><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Workforce and skills required.

<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Monitoring and evaluation for sustainable tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are all critical areas that we want to build and add on to. The report has 
<br/>been  shared  with  the  Government  Ministries  to  ensure  policy  alignment  as  a  basis  for  further 
<br/>dialogue, because there will be more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I always say that when tourism does well, so does the economy. So, this is an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>important piece of work that we hope to deliver in the coming months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  next  four  weeks,  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  will  be  conducting 
<br/>broader public and private consultations to inform the Framework.  Once again, I urge everyone who 
<br/>is listening to contribute to this national strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank you again for this opportunity to deliver my Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-Mr.  Speaker,  before  I  commence,  I  just  want  to  remind  honourable 
<br/>Bainivalu that the Opposition, my old school Natabua, put up a great fight on that. Please, do not 
<br/>forget that - it means a lot to Natabua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyways,  I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  this  particular  Framework  was  commenced  in  August  2022,  and  I  am  quite  happy  that 
<br/>consultations are actually continuing so that we can come up with  a  Framework proper, which is 
<br/>really post-Tourism 2021 Plan that was there earlier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, this is a 10 Year Framework and it is 
<br/>actually a roadmap to revitalize and enhance our industry. There is a need for all of these, specifically 
<br/>also  because the Gold Coast  has  moved post-COVID  - Gold Coast  because of the environmental 
<br/>concerns.  Now, even more so with what is transpiring with Fukushima, we may need to also start 
<br/>thinking about what needs to be done but, yes, what may happen and what may not happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are quite a number of things that are part and parcel of this particular plan 
<br/>that the honourable Minister has mentioned which we are in total agreement with.  One of the areas 
<br/>that also need to be seriously look at is the challenges that our Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>(MSMEs) face within the industry and how we can always assist them because they form a critical 
<br/>component in the tourism industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The tourism industry, Mr. Speaker, is actually private sector driven. I am very happy to see 
<br/>that the honourable Minister is engaged with all the private sector and they are part and parcel of this 
<br/>particular  plan,  because  that  will  take  us  a  long  way.  He  has  mentioned  about  being  a  preferred 
<br/>employer, I think tourism is a preferred employer in any event in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  One of the things that we also have to look at is the growth of the Airbnb market in Fiji, which 
<br/>is massive. Currently, I think the Airbnb market is completely full, because hotel rooms are full, and 
<br/>this is actually an offshoot from the cruise ship market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  particular  areas  within  the  tourism  industry  that  we  sometimes  forget  and  it  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something that we can grow, and this is the wellness tourism. We offer such a huge wellness 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme at home, even locally and we do it to ourselves and this is an area of tourism that needs 
<br/>to grow and we need to invite investment in it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Organic tourism is also something that is huge and the reason why I say that, Mr. Speaker, is 
<br/>that I happened to be in Madrid at the UNWTO Conference and there were some awards being given.  
<br/>There were two young gentlemen who had started an online booking which actually only deal with 
<br/>organic tourism and carbon neutral tourism, and they won awards for it.  So, people now with the 
<br/>high spin that we are actually always looking at, are thinking, ‘Alright, I want to take my kids to a 
<br/>carbon-neutral resort where I do not leave any carbon footprint’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Honourable Minister of Finance, maybe, that is something that we need to look at with respect 
<br/>to providing incentives, so we invite these incentives to actually come up with these kinds of resorts.  
<br/>People do pay over and above the amount so that they do not, and they teach their children to leave 
<br/>a no carbon behind at the end of the day when they go on holiday and they spend quite a substantial 
<br/>amount of money, so these two guys actually won an award for it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Things like that, we need to pay attention to, and I hope the honourable Minister is (and I am 
<br/>sure  he  is)  regularly  in  touch  with  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural 
<br/>Organization (UNESCO) with respect to guidance on this because they are the pillar of strength for 
<br/>all of us.  The most important part is, this is a public-private dialogue (which is the most important 
<br/>thing) and as I have said, it covers not just the tourism operators, but our MSMEs, et cetera, are part 
<br/>of that as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of our MSMEs have great ideas and one of the most important things is, we must ensure 
<br/>that our tourism industry must continue to be built on the strength of an environmentally sustainable 
<br/>framework so that we leave a good tourism industry behind for our future generations.
