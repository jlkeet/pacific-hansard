<div><span>HERITAGE BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Heritage Bill 2023 be considered by Parliament without delay;
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span> Editor’s Note:</span><span> </span><span>Reply to Written Question No. 113/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and

<div><span>Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, 
<br/>but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the 
<br/>Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji became a party to the Convention concerning 
<br/>the  protection  of  world,  cultural  and  national  heritage  which  was  adopted  in  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference in 1972 on the 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 1990. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, as a State party to the World Heritage Convention, is required under the World Heritage 
<br/>Convention to adopt legislative and administrative provisions to give effect to the World Heritage 
<br/>Convention. Therefore, the Heritage Bill 2023 provides for the domestic application of the World 
<br/>Heritage Convention in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to highlight at this point that in 2016, a Heritage Bill (Bill 
<br/>No. 10 of 2016)  was  introduced in  Parliament  and referred to  the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/>Affairs.  Although the Standing Committee then had begun its deliberations on the Bill, there was 
<br/>ultimately no enactment of any such law.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Bill lapsed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, a Heritage Bill  (Bill No. 3 of 2021) was tabled in Parliament and referred to the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights.  Extensive consultations were held by the 
<br/>Standing Committee at various locations and communities at site level, Levuka World Heritage Site 
<br/>with various stakeholders in Levuka and at the national level with various government agencies and 
<br/>at the community level, with communities both in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>Bill also lapsed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is evident that the intention to bring forth and pass a law specifically dedicated to advance 
<br/>Fiji’s protection of national and world heritage site and places has been too long a journey.  There is 
<br/>no excuse now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  further prolong something that will benefit Fiji, not only for 
<br/>ourselves in this present time and age, but also for our future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji being a state member of the World Heritage Convention is also obliged to conform to and 
<br/>implement the Convention and its operational guidelines.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I therefore recommend 
<br/>that it would be prudent for this august Parliament to urgently consider the Bill that is tabled before 
<br/>Parliament this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been consultations with the Department of Heritage, Ministry of Finance and the 
<br/>Office of the Solicitor-General.  If I may touch on some of the key aspects of the Bill.  The Bill 
<br/>comprises of nine Parts and a Schedule as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part  1  is  the  Preliminary.    Part  2  deals  with  the  Fiji  Heritage  Council.    Part  3  deals  with 
<br/></span><span>Accounts and Finances.  Part 4 deals with the Fiji Register.   Part 5 with the Management of Potential 
<br/>World Heritage Place. Part 6 deals with World Heritage Listing.  Part 7 deals with Funds for Fiji’s 
<br/>Heritage.  Part 8 deals with buffer zones. Part 9 deals with Miscellaneous. The Schedule is the Criteria 
<br/>for the Assessment of Outstanding Universal Value.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023

<br/>for a term of three years and are eligible for reappointment.  The Council may invite a person of 
<br/>expert knowledge to its meetings.   Moreover, the Director responsible for heritage is the secretary 
<br/>to the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 7 of the Bill provides for the principle that will guide the decisions and functions of 
<br/>the Council.  The principles are based on Fiji’s obligations under the World Heritage Convention and 
<br/>the Operation Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 8 of the Bill outlines functions of the Council.  The Council is to advise the Minister 
<br/>on matters regarding the recognition and management of places in Fiji having potential and actual 
<br/>world heritage values and Fiji’s obligations under the World Heritage Convention.  The Council may 
<br/>also,  </span><span>inter  alia</span><span>,  develop  policy  direction  to  support  Fiji’s  obligation  under  the  World  Heritage 
<br/>Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 9 of the Bill outlines the procedures for meetings and the governance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 10 of the Bill provides for the disclosure of any direct or indirect interest by a member 
<br/>of the Council in relation to a matter which may be in conflict with his or her role as a member of the 
<br/>Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 11 of the Bill prescribes the duties of the secretary to the Council.  The Council may 
<br/>require the secretary to administer and facilitate the obligations of the Council under the Bill and to 
<br/>facilitate Fiji’s obligations under the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  12  of  the  Bill  provides  indemnity  for  any  act  done  or  meted  in  good  faith  by  any 
<br/></span><span>member  of  the  Council,  the  Department  or  public  officers  employed  by  the  Council  or  the

<br/>management authority and according to its management plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill also has an Explanatory Note.  I endorse the Bill before Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of this august 
<br/>Parliament, as rightfully said by the honourable Attorney-General, that this Bill was first referred to 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in 2016 and it lapsed and was re-introduced to this august 
<br/>Parliament and then  referred to the Standing Committee on  Justice, Law and Human Rights which 
<br/>I used to Chair.  We had massive consultations around Fiji.  We went to heritage sites, especially 
<br/>Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the reasons why it was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/>Rights because there were a lot of legalities that we had to actually go through before coming back 
<br/>with a report to this august Parliament.   Unfortunately, at that point in time in the last term, due to 
<br/>the time lapse, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was not able to bring 
<br/>back a report to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that we need to recognize with this particular Bill is, we have to go through the 
<br/>process as defined by UNESCO to pass this particular Bill. One of the major issues that we actually 
<br/>faced when we went to Levuka was the buffer zone.  There were buildings that were deteriorating 
<br/>and have been abolished because they were not able to fix it due to some restrictions that were put in 
<br/>place as it is now a World Heritage Site. There are a lot of issues that were faced by the people.  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, when this particular Bill becomes an Act would have one of the biggest Council with 17 
<br/></span><span>members in it.  On top of that, none of the members are taxpayers or ratepayers of Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> These are some of recommendation that we were working on to bring before Parliament that 
<br/>this Bill needs to be amended.  There are four particular departments that are looking after Heritage 
<br/>– the Department of Heritage under the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Fiji National Trust , Fiji Heritage 
<br/>Council and Fiji Museum.  This Bill does not define what are the different roles of these particular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1717 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>four departments and agencies and they were actually overlapping each other. There was no clear cut 
<br/>indication to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that when we are talking about World Heritage Site, all other 
<br/>sites are just on the list, they are not World Heritage Sites, they are National Sites covered by National 
<br/>Trust or Department of Heritage. We are not dealing with humans with those sites, but when it comes 
<br/>to  Levuka,  we  are  dealing  with  humans,  we  are  dealing  with  investments,  we  are  dealing  with 
<br/>businesspeople.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initial building that was there for </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> where the production started, because they 
<br/>were not able to refurbish that particular building, there is no longer a particular building and if this 
<br/>building goes in the form that it is, none of them will be able to renovate their buildings.  I urge the 
<br/>Government to send this Bill to the Committee and complete the work that the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Justice, Law and Human Rights started in 2019. There were issues like COVID when we were 
<br/>not able to consult, there was no interior motive about this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do understand the importance of bringing this Bill to Parliament because there is UNESCO 
<br/>funding.    Unless  and  until  we  domesticate  our  treaties  by  bringing  a  particular  domestic  law, 
<br/>UNESCO will not release that funding. However, what we need to realise, that funding is not much. 
<br/>It  will  not  fix  the  problem  that  people  in  Levuka  are  facing  at  the  moment.  The  ratepayers  are 
<br/>basically crying and they are requesting.  When we were there, they requested us, “please, remove  
<br/>Levuka as a World Heritage Site.”  That is the extent, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  We  went  for  the  consultation,  honourable  Attorney-General.  
<br/>Please, this is the time to listen   because we are saying what the people of Levuka told us.  At that 
<br/>point in time, honourable Bulitavu was also a Member of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law 
<br/>and Human Rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Talking in contempt of the Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- That is what I am saying, it needs to go to the Committee.  Unless 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and until I describe what is in the content, we will not understand why it needs to go to the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The motion is on Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes.  That is what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, it needs to be sent to 
<br/>the  Committee  rather  than  having  it  passed  over  here  because  it  will  have  a  drastic  effect  on  the 
<br/>people of Levuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Send it to the Committee, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- With those words, Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We can discuss that when we address the substantive motion.  That is what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you are referring to now.  The motion before us is on Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am just explaining, Mr. Speaker, why it needs to be sent to.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I remind you, honourable Whip, the Parliament that we are in now is 
<br/>part of heritage. It is difficult for us here in this Parliament to ask for any extension or renovation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1718 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>works to be undertaken because it is already listed. That is why we need a very clear demarcation of 
<br/>the roles of the Committee that you have said, plus the law. That is why we need to have this before 
<br/>the treaty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We have already ratified the treaty, Mr. Speaker.  What I am saying 
<br/>is, all those things that you have just mentioned are not part of this Bill.  As a previous Chairman, 
<br/>that is what I am saying, that this Bill needs to be amended to bring all those amendments before we 
<br/>can actually pass this Bill. That is all I am saying, Mr. Speaker.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine as a Parliament, we face a lot of difficulties trying to do anything to this particular 
<br/>building.  Think of what the people of Levuka are actually facing if they have to do renovation to 
<br/>their buildings.  We have seen the condition of those buildings, Sir, it cannot go in the form that is 
<br/>presented at this point in time.  It needs to be sent to the Committee to be reviewed and brought back 
<br/>to Parliament, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- But we should have discussed this at the Business Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It was not discussed in the Business Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We never discussed it, so let us move on. Any other honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would like to take the floor on Standing Order 51? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I think what we need to do is realise that this is not anything 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to do with politics, it is actually to do with Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Of course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We are being facilitative here, honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Maharaj was the Chairman of that Committee, Sir.  All he is saying is that by the 
<br/>use of Standing Order 51, we are circumventing/circumnavigating some things that are required for 
<br/>the Bill to be full and happy at the end of day. The people of Levuka need to be ensured that we 
<br/>protect them also. I understand also, Mr. Speaker, that there are certain requirements, et cetera that 
<br/>need to be met but it is not about politics here.  We are just saying that the Bill had gone through two 
<br/>readings... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  …  and  fair  is  fair.    It  needed  after  extensive  consultations  by  the 
<br/>Committee and I also stand here as a current Member of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law 
<br/>and Human Rights. We will do our utmost with the consent of my Chairman to try and ensure that it 
<br/>is done really quickly because we also want it done, Sir, but let us do it in a way that we cover all the 
<br/>basis and we do not have to keep coming back for an amendment on the Heritage Bill. That is all that 
<br/>is being asked, Sir, and I urge, please think about Fiji and think about our reputation about getting it 
<br/>right. We must get it legally correct and legally right, so we do so. What is paramount here, this is 
<br/></span><span>Levuka, you should know, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Of course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This is to ensure that Levuka remains a UNESCO World Heritage Site.   
<br/>I am sure my Chair at the Committee will also say this, Sir, that we will do our utmost to try and get 
<br/>this expedited and finished as quickly as possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1719 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a brief contribution to the 
<br/>Bill under Standing Order 51. There is nothing urgent in the Bill. The Bill was about to go to third 
<br/>reading, it was in the Committee and it went back to the Ministry, given the advice by the Solicitor-
<br/>General that the current form of the Bill, given some issues that came up during our discussion with 
<br/>the drafters at that time and one was the composition of the Council where people in Levuka wanted  
<br/>to be part of the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  was  the  penalties  that  came  with  those  who  breached  if  they  wanted  to 
<br/>renovate their buildings in Levuka - the penalties were too high.  Those were some of the issues that 
<br/>came from the residents in Levuka, and that is why we had to go back to protect those in Levuka.  
<br/>But again, I will urge the honourable Attorney-General, given the dissolution of the last Parliament, 
<br/>the Bill lapsed but there is still pending work in the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thought this particular Bill would have been reinstated when Parliament convened so that it 
<br/>could be referred to the Committee, at least for the next sitting. We will have to check the current 
<br/>form of what the honourable Attorney-General had tabled in Parliament today, with whatever work 
<br/>is pending, and bring it back to Parliament with the relevant report.  The work that was done then 
<br/>plus  the  current  changes  that  we  have  not  seen  but  are  in  here  to  be  tabled  in  together,  so  that 
<br/>Parliament would be in a better position to go into the third reading on this particular Bill before we 
<br/>pass.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is nothing urgent here and we submit that this Bill be withdrawn and brought back with 
<br/>the right procedures, because we are just domesticating an international Treaty.  It has a bearing in 
<br/>the next motion too on the International Fisheries one where you will need to do domestication.  It 
<br/>also has bearing on one of the Bills that he had tabled under Standing Order 51, on the removal of 
<br/>the  corruption  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court,  which  is  also  part  of  the  domestication  of  an 
<br/>international Convention that Fiji had ratified.  These are the domestic parts, and I would like to urge 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General to look at this very carefully. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just a request as the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and honourable Attorney-General might consider, that this be referred back to the Committee and 
<br/>brought back in another session, so that we can iron out the issues that have been brought up.  It is 
<br/>just a request. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- They have put forward a request, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yes,  we  are  listening  from  this  side.    For  your 
<br/>information too, I was in Levuka for the last months, but let me correct something, there has been a 
<br/>lot of misinformation on this issue for the people in Levuka by the previous Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first impression is this, that the whole of Ovalau is covered under heritage but no, it is 
<br/>not.  Secondly, you can paint the town, but there is a process.  You can dismantle, but there is  a 
<br/>process.  However, we agree that through ventilation of this Bill through the Committee, we want to 
<br/>see that it comes in a good shape and caters for all the inaccuracies that was there before.  Therefore, 
<br/>we will withdraw the Bill under Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Withdrawal of Heritage Bill 2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Finally,  there  is  bipartisan.    Honourable  Members,  I  intend  to  adjourn 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament now for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.39 p.m.
