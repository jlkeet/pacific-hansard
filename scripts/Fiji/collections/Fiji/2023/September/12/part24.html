<h3>ANNEXURE II</h3>
<div><span>ANNEXURE II 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES 
<br/>(Hon. Ratu A.R. Lalabalavu) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to Question No. 112/2023 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been a total of 417 resignations for doctors, nurses and Allied Health Workers in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the past 16 months.  A summary of the resignations is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>326 Nurses; 
<br/>54 Medical Officers; and 
<br/>37 Allied Heath Workers that include five Dieticians, six Environmental Health Officers, 
<br/>11 Laboratory Technicians, 12 Medical Imaging Technologists and three Physiotherapists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These attrition numbers are due to many pull and push factors that include emigration, the 
<br/>search  for  greener  pastures,  education,  family  welfare,  higher  salaries  and  aggressive  recruitment 
<br/>techniques by overseas recruitment agencies and local private hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have earlier mentioned in one of my parliamentary Statements, these losses impact our 
<br/>ability  to  deliver  quality  services  and  also  increases  the  burden  for  those  who  remain  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  recognising  that  we  are  losing  experienced  personnel,  the  Ministry  has  also  pursued 
<br/>capacity building for its current workforce with the support of central agencies of Government and 
<br/>supplemented by our development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The in-service training for Medical Officers have ensured that our doctors are upskilled and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>updated in knowledge, skills and competencies, while attaining post-graduate qualification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2023 academic year, the Australian Government Pacific Scholarship for Midwifery 
<br/>sponsored 20 registered nurses through its in-service training budget.  As such, a total of 40 registered 
<br/>nurses are expected to graduate as midwives at the end of the 2023 academic year and they will be 
<br/>formally recruited in 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For doctors, a total of 150 Medical Interns were recruited in January of this year, while 80 
<br/>Medical Officers (MOs) have been recruited as of today, with the remaining to be recruited as soon 
<br/>as they complete their internship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Oral Health Practitioners, a total of 205 Oral Health Practitioners with another 25 to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recruited in the last financial year, bringing the total to 230.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Allied  Health  Workers  such  as  Dieticians,  Physiotherapists,  Pharmacists,  Medical 
<br/>Imaging Technologists, Laboratory Assistants and Environmental Health Officers and Biomedical 
<br/></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>
<div><span>Technicians, 558 of the 717 positions have been filled through an ongoing recruitment process and 
<br/>87 more posts were processed during the last financial year.
