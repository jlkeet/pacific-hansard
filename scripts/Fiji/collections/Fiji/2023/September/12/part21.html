<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF RURAL AND MARITIME DEVELOPMENT AND 
<br/>DISASTER MANAGEMENT 2016 -2017 AND 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management for the reporting period 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 
<br/>2018 Annual Report, which was tabled on 29th March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the    Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development  and  Disaster  Management  is  responsible  for  the  effective  coordination  and 
<br/>implementation of the development in Fiji’s rural sector, in line with the national direction of the 
<br/>Government for rural and outer islands development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry aims to promote growth, reduce poverty and address rural to 
<br/></span><span>urban drift through the provision of basic social amenities and incentives for increasing incomes from 
<br/></span><span>farming and marine resources.  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s role is to oversee the 
<br/>overall achievement of its vision which is a better Fiji for all through building the integrated rural 
<br/>development framework for productive, progressive, safe and resilient communities in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  the  2016-2017  and  2017-2018  reporting  periods,  Fiji  was  still 
<br/>recovering from the widespread damage and destruction brought about by </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>which was 
<br/>estimated  at  $2  billion.    Despite  the  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  recovery  programmes  and  the  many  challenges 
<br/>encountered,  the  Ministry  adjusted  positively  and  continued  to  implement  capital  programmes 
<br/>assigned for rural and maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry made a positive improvement in the 2017-2018 performance 
<br/>period with 89 percent budget utilisation compared to 76 percent in the 2016-2017 reporting period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have a list of speakers who have been identified 
<br/>by the honourable Whips and we have three from the Government and three from the Opposition.  
<br/>For  the  Opposition,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  will  lead  the  batting  followed  by 
<br/>honourable  Pillay  and  then  honourable  Usamate.    For  the  Government,  it  is  honourable  Ditoka, 
<br/>honourable  Kiran  and  then  to  be  rounded  off  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Manoa 
<br/>Kamikamica. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I need to acknowledge the Committee for 
<br/>this  Report  and  I  also  wish  to  acknowledge  the  Ministry  for  the  hard  work  that  they  continue  to 
<br/>provide  for  Government  and  particularly  for  our  people  in  the  rural  communities.    This  is  not  a 
<br/>Ministry that is, I can say, easy to work in, simply because of the role of looking after disaster as well 
<br/>as part of the services that it provides as highlighted in the Report - the recovery from </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>
<br/>and of course the so many disasters that do strike the country. I will just go very quickly into the 
<br/>recommendations because there are a lot of speakers as well, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On housing, of course, this is an area that we need to look into, we need to provide the best 
<br/>facility for our people particularly those who live in the rural areas.  I had highlighted yesterday in 
<br/>the meeting between the office of the Divisional Commissioners, this is one of the extra roles that 
<br/>they play in the Ministry but usually this is the responsibility of the Office and Accommodation Unit 
<br/>that used to be with the Public Service but of course was with CIU in the last few years. It is just the 
<br/>strengthening of the coordination and hopefully the allocation of the funding because the
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1741 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissioners do look after the Government quarters and of course Government rented quarters as 
<br/>well to provide for people in the Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Recommendation  4.3,  Sir,  I  think  there  are  two  relocations  that  are  mentioned  in  the 
<br/>Report - in Nabavatu and, of course, in Dreketi, Qamea.  It is very unfortunate, Sir, but I hope that 
<br/>the Government can expedite this so that our people can be provided with the necessary facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry only provides the initial arrangements because the other Ministries particularly 
<br/>in these particular cases, the role of the Ministry of Lands in ensuring the risk assessments are made 
<br/>and it is based on the recommendations that the delays were experienced because the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural Development cannot go ahead with the process of relocation once all the relocation criteria as 
<br/>set out in Fiji’s Relocation Guidelines are met, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 4.5 is very important, the one on water.  I would say and listening to the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Infrastructure yesterday, he did mention about the data but most of these 
<br/>data can be collected from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  development  unit  within  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  and  they  work  very 
<br/></span><span>closely with the Ministry of Rural Development because they do all the village profiles. I know that 
<br/>in the last few years we were quite behind in this, but we are thankful that through the payment of 
<br/>the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> allowance, this is one of the key expectations out of the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> and we 
<br/>hope  that  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  will  update  their  village  profiles  so  that  we  can  do  the 
<br/>necessary intervention particularly on water and sanitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is important because I have read with interest the need to vaccinate the people in Vanua 
<br/>Levu because of typhoid because water projects are related to Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue and 
<br/>Diarrhoea  (LTDD)  and  therefore  the  coordination.    That  is  why  the  role  of  the  Ministry  in  the 
<br/>integrated  Rural  Development  Framework  is  very  critical,  Sir,  and  I  hope  that  all  the  agencies 
<br/>involved can look at their responsibilities within this and see if projects can be implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hotspots  particularly,  the  Ministry  of  Health  knows  it  very  well.  Hotspots  are  very  much 
<br/>related  to  water  and  hygiene  and  therefore  the  close  coordination  between  the  ministries  are  so 
<br/>important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee once again, Sir, and I know that other speakers will highlight are few 
<br/>areas as raised in the Report, but I do commend the Ministry and of course the Committee for the 
<br/>Report before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise this afternoon to contribute to the motion on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Review of the Ministry’s Annual Report for 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, I want to thank the Committee for the wonderful work they have done and for everyone 
<br/>involved.  I also like to give thanks where it is due to my predecessor, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition now for all the work.  The wonderful thing about this Report is that it provides some 
<br/>context to us in that we can look back and see where things started and how things happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my recent travel to Lomaiviti, that has come very true for me as I linked things together 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with what I have read in the reports and what I have seen on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two years that were covered in the Report, witnessed as alluded 
<br/>to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the devastating effects of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>. It caused major 
<br/>destruction and despair but one wonderful thing about these kinds of difficulties that hit out nation, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>1742 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it brings us together. It calls us to unite. I am sure many of us can think back and see how our young 
<br/>people who are going around saying “stronger than </span><span>TC Winston”</span><span>.  That kind of united effort, I believe 
<br/>brings us together as a nation as something that we need to build upon going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, another notable progress during this period was the relocation of 
<br/>Tukuraki Village in the interior of the province of Ba.  Again, something that I have witnessed going 
<br/>around is the effect of deforestation and the unwise farming methods that has been practised in some 
<br/>parts of Fiji.  We have seen, as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, some of the 
<br/>effects around the nation in Qamea as well as in Dreketi and in other areas of Fiji.  We see landslides 
<br/>happening because of the deforested ridge lines which is what the Ministry of Forests is advising us 
<br/>not to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through careful planning and community engagement, the Tukuraki project was completed 
<br/>so we are very thankful to the previous administration for doing that.   I am also delighted to inform 
<br/>this  august  Parliament  that  during  the  same  period,  another  major  achievement  was  the  National 
<br/>Humanitarian  Policy  so  again  we  are  thankful  for  that.    I  wish  to  acknowledge  members  of  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs for receiving senior members of the Ministry to clarify several 
<br/></span><span>issues that arose from the two annual reports before Parliament today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  amongst  these  issues  were  the  maintenance  of  government  quarters,  the 
<br/>relocation of the Dreketi Health Centre and Dreketi Primary School, the upgrade of rural community 
<br/>roads, solutions to water problems faced by rural and maritime communities and the review of the 
<br/>National Disaster Management Act.  In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry is 
<br/>working very hard to help improve the conditions of Government pool quarters in need of repair.  I 
<br/>am pleased to inform Parliament this afternoon Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Quarters Administration 
<br/>Policy has been finalised and will be submitted for Cabinet’s endorsement soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of relocation of the Dreketi Health Centre and Dreketi Primary School in Qamea, 
<br/>Cakaudrove, I can confirm that the Geotech surveys for the new relocation sites for both the school 
<br/>and the health centre have been completed.  We are now awaiting construction of the new primary 
<br/>school and health centre which will be spearheaded by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the upgrade of rural community roads to assist in water cartage 
<br/>to  areas  affected  by  prolonged  dry  spells  in  Western  Division,  the  Ministry  works  closely  in 
<br/>partnership with Fiji Roads Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Sugar Industry, Fiji Sugar 
<br/>Corporation, Ministry of Forestry and Fiji Pine Limited to ensure a collaborative effort to address the 
<br/>challenges faced by these communities and improve accessibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Something that I would like to comment again Sir, and something that I have also observed 
<br/>is that in many of these maritime region, we have these big PWD depots lying idle and also in other 
<br/>rural areas of Fiji.  It is something that we would like to use once again I suppose when the PWD 
<br/>comes  online  to  help  with  the  maintenance.    I  believe,  as  in  the  way  that  governments  go,  we 
<br/>experiment on some things that we think might work and I believe that doing away with those depots 
<br/>and the way that the FRA worked, did not work for us.  That is something that the Ministry will need 
<br/></span><span>to review and work on once again, in collaboration with the Ministry of Works, to try and fix the 
<br/></span><span>rural roads and the dire need for repairs in many of the areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been to Gau; one half of the island has proper roads and one half of it does not have 
<br/>proper roads.  I have heard from those that are on the island that before, those roads used to be well 
<br/>maintained when the PWD depot was in operation. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1743 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry recognises that water is the basic need and it is also very right 
<br/>for every Fijian to have access to this basic necessity.  The Ministry continues to consult with the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Infrastructure,  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  and  the  Mineral  Resources  Department  for 
<br/>permanent  water  solutions.    The  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  has  scoped  areas  where  reliable  water 
<br/>sources  have  been  identified.    Additionally,  the  Ministry  continues  to  cart  to  remote  rural  and 
<br/>maritime areas affected by dry spells. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans are also in place to consult with development partners, NGOs and 
<br/>relevant  stakeholders  to  assist  areas  in  the  Eastern  Division  that  are  usually  affected  by  water 
<br/>shortages.    In the 2019 to 2020  financial year, the Ministry signed an MOU with  Oceania  Water 
<br/>Group  for  the  hiring  of  its  desalination  plant  to  assist  in  emergency  water  cartage.    Further  the 
<br/>Ministry in partnership with UNDP is now assisting in the purchase and installation of desalination 
<br/>plants for maritime communities to assist in prolonged dry spells.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A classic example is the water project that we have in Ekubu Village in Vatulele where a 
<br/>desalination plant will be installed and powered by solar.  This plant can convert about 3,000 litres 
<br/>of  seawater  into  drinkable  water  within  24  hours.    The  project  has  now  been  piloted  in  Yakubu 
<br/></span><span>Village and would be replicated in other maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  in  partnership  with  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  implemented 
<br/>Ecological Purification Systems (EPS) in areas affected by prolonged dry spells and the absence of 
<br/>safe drinking water.  We have installed EPS in the following areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Dawasamu Primary School in Tailevu; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Naqia Village in Tailevu; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Naboutini Village in Serua; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Wainilotulevu Village in Namosi;

<div><span>Beqa Yanuca Secondary School;  
<br/>Lutu Village, Wainibuka in Naitasiri; 
<br/>Naimasimasi Village in Serua; 
<br/>Nacavanadi Village in Gau; and  
<br/>Few others in Koro, Cakaudrove and Macuata. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  National  Disaster  Management  Act,  I  am  pleased  to  inform 
<br/>Parliament that the review process has been completed and the Draft Bill is now before the Office of 
<br/>the Solicitor-General for final vetting before tabling to Cabinet and Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure this august Parliament that the Ministry is 
<br/>committed  to  improving  service  delivery  and  facilitating  economic  growth  through  meaningful 
<br/>development programmes that are aimed at reducing poverty and improving livelihood.

<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to offer my full support on the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you and </span><span>vinaka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to  make a contribution to the Report before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  The Standing Committee on Social Affairs has reviewed the Ministry of Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management’s Annual Reports 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  highlights  the  Ministry’s  role  in  coordinating  Government  efforts  during 
<br/>emergencies and in normal times, particularly in the aftermath of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  Despite challenges, 
<br/>the Ministry showed improvement in budget utilisation and continues to implement programmes for 
<br/>rural and maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reconstruction of the Dreketi Health Centre and Dreketi Primary School has already been 
<br/>alluded to by the honourable Minister and the project is completed.  As for the relocation of the 18 
<br/>homes in the red zone areas, the Ministry has stated that the relocation plan has been developed and 
<br/>is currently being implemented.  The Ministry assured the Committee that all necessary measures 
<br/>have been taken to ensure the safety and well-being of the affected communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  enquired  about  the  progress  of  the  Rural  Electrification 
<br/>Projects in the maritime areas.  The Ministry informed the Committee that significant progress has 
<br/>been  made  in  that  regards  with  a  total  of  32  Rural  Electrification  Projects  completed  during  the 
<br/>reporting  time.    These  projects  have  benefitted  numerous  communities  in  the  maritime  areas, 
<br/>providing them with access to electricity for the first time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry highlighted the challenges faced in implementing these projects including the 
<br/>difficult terrain and the logistical constraints. However, despite these challenges the Ministry remains 
<br/>committed  to  the  electrification  of  rural  and  maritime  areas  and  will  continue  to  work  towards 
<br/>achieving this goal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee raised concerns about the availability and accessibility of 
<br/>clean  drinking  water  in  rural  and  maritime  areas.  The  Ministry  informed  us  that  they  have 
<br/>implemented various water projects including the construction of rainwater harvesting system and 
<br/>the drilling of boreholes, however, there are still challenges in ensuring a sustainable water supply in 
<br/>some areas, particularly those during periods of drought.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends that the Ministry continue to prioritise water supply of projects 
<br/>and explore alternative solutions such as desalination plants to address the issue of water scarcity in 
<br/>rural and maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  also  on  that  note,  I  would  like  to  mention  few  points  in  regards  to  the 
<br/>Balevuto water project.  I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Health and the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Infrastructure for the efforts put in now.  I have been advised that water tanks have been 
<br/>placed  in  the  five  schools,  that  is,  Nukuloa  Primary,  Nukuloa  Secondary,  Nacaci  Hindu  School, 
<br/>Naruku Primary and Balevuto Public, and Water Authority has moved in to fill in water from Waiwai 
<br/>Catchment.  They have also positioned few water tanks in a few communities, but a lot of work is 
<br/></span><span>required in other communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the schools are also providing bottled water or boiling the water to assist the students.  
<br/>Actually,  the  communities  are  afraid  to  drink  the  water  from  the  catchment.    I  would  urge  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Infrastructure together with the honourable Minister for Health to visit that 
<br/>area.

<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1745 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  lot  of  work  has  been done  in  that  catchment  area,  there  is  a  brand  new  treatment  plant 
<br/>constructed and sitting there, but there is a drip treatment that is being done to the water that flows 
<br/>down to the communities - a bit of work is required and then the whole project will be completed.  I 
<br/>look forward to the support from the honourable Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  discussion  on  this  Report.  
<br/>Disasters are a fact of life in Fiji.  This means that there needs to be a lot of preparation.  We all know 
<br/>where the rivers that could flood are, and the slopes that could landslide and we have experienced 
<br/>cyclones from Category 1 to Category 5.  Each village used to plan and develop their own disaster 
<br/>risk  management  where  they  knew  how  many  elders,  people  living  with  disabilities,  exits  and 
<br/>evacuation centres were and how to use them, but unfortunately, this practice lapsed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016 when </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> struck Nayavutoka Village in Nakorotubu Ra, an elderly person 
<br/>and a person living with disability were trapped in their homes and died, as most members of the 
<br/>community ran to save their own lives, once the tidal wave covered the village.  We found many 
<br/></span><span>similar incidents around the area as Category 5 </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> smashed the coastal communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having a school at a distance, the community struggled without an evacuation centre and </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span> showed us the urgent need for planning, evacuation and relief as many families struggled.  
<br/>Around this time of relief from </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, cluster system was introduced.  That was the first time 
<br/>I came across it and we discussed it with the consultant.  This was different from DISMAC, which 
<br/>has now become NDMO.  So former DISMAC was coordinated by the Divisional Commissioners 
<br/>who knew their geographical areas and knew their teams well on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the cluster system, we saw a term of coordination from Suva with cluster leads from 
<br/>UN agencies or co-led by UN agencies.  Their multiple assessment forms developed by different 
<br/>agencies.   In one village I visited at that time in the interior of Ra, a </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> told us he had 
<br/>filled the forms from seven different agencies in one day.  We also saw multiple agencies delivering 
<br/>various kits.  With limited spaces in the tents, many families expressed frustration that through all 
<br/>forms they were filling they were getting the same kind of kits delivered to them and they had no 
<br/>space to keep it.  We realised that this was a painful trial and error being done at a time when remote 
<br/>communities needed urgent assistance.  I am sure we can only learn from it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  saw  when  clusters  were  bidding  for  funds  in  competition,  we  saw  that  the  wash 
<br/>cluster raised more money generated for water and toilet systems than the housing cluster  - when 
<br/>most of the homes in all those villages were completely destroyed.  We visited a village where stand 
<br/>alone flush toilets were built and was not connected to sewerage or water system because this cluster 
<br/>was at work, while families were living in tents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  saw  economic  project  like  gardening  setup  with  no  watering  or  backup  system  when 
<br/>villages set on the coast needed boats and fishing gear to kick start their economic life.  These came 
<br/>through  clusters  and  partners  who  did  not  understand  our  communities  well  enough.    All  these 
<br/>indicated to us that it is important whether there is a cluster coordination or  DISMAC that on the 
<br/></span><span>ground,  relief  efforts  should  be  coordinated  through  existing  mechanisms  that  allow  proper 
<br/></span><span>distribution of resources where need is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assessment should be done with one standardised form through local agencies on the ground 
<br/>and coordinated through DISMAC or with the current NDMO, to disseminate it to each cluster relief 
<br/>agency  instead  of  the  other  way  around.    Government  has  its  own  machinery  through  Divisional 
<br/>Commissioners and they should be empowered to lead relief. Under the leadership of the honourable

<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ditoka,  we  saw  that  has  come  back  and  floods  were  very  well  managed  through  Commissioners 
<br/>without and entourage of Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Various disasters have also shown urgency in positioning of stocks when there is a cyclone 
<br/>warning or flood warning because we know where the impact is expected.  It is prudent to have stocks 
<br/>in place and can be mobilised for instant relief.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  period  of  reporting,  we  saw  after  each  disaster,  there  were  two  weeks  of 
<br/>assessment and then relief but by then, many families started dealing with the shock.  Food, water 
<br/>and dry goods distribution is crucial when people are in need.  Clean water mobilisation takes time 
<br/>and sometimes, the clean water does not come for four to five days and that leads our people to drink 
<br/>dirty water leading to waterborne diseases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during disaster relief it is important that leadership and responders provide 
<br/>care and concern without biases.  We have seen the entire Vitogo District suffer post </span><span>TC Evans </span><span>and 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston. </span><span> Post </span><span>TC Evans, </span><span>relief materials were dropped and picked up again.  There was any 
<br/>instruction  by  the  then  Government  not  to  provide  relief  to  all  communities  under  the  district  of 
<br/></span><span>Vitogo. They were left to suffer because the leadership did not like the opinion of the late </span><span>Momo na 
<br/></span><span>Tui Vitogo. </span><span>We saw similar sentiments when we visited Vatulele Island to deliver roofing iron and 
<br/>other supplies post </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> - we had to use </span><span>Uto ni Yalo</span><span> because the Government does not take relief 
<br/>materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disaster is a time when all hands should be on deck and all partners led by Government should 
<br/>be responding to people most in need.  There have been many lessons we can learn from to ensure 
<br/>that during the next disaster season, we are better prepared and better positioned to serve those in 
<br/>urgent need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank you for your time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity.  Once again, I would 
<br/>like to thank the Committee.  It is a dated report but nevertheless, I was not going to speak but I 
<br/>thought I would share a few things after all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  just  talk  about  a  few  things  that  are  in  this  particular  report,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>recommendations that we have, particularly item 4.4 which recommends that the Ministry work in 
<br/>partnership  with  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  to 
<br/>upgrade rural community roads, this is something that is always needed especially out in the rural 
<br/>and maritime areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Minister was talking about what he saw on the Island of Gau and the roads that goes up 
<br/>from Qarani to Nacavanadi is overgrown and that has been an issue.  Looking at the status of roads 
<br/>– if you look at the roads around Gau and Koro, they are very different.  If you look at the roads in 
<br/>Koro -  theroadthat goes around the island and the road that crosses from Nasau down to Nabuna - 
<br/>these roads are well kept.  But there is a very big difference in the number of vehicles you will see in 
<br/>Koro, compared to Gau.  So, one problem that we have in a lot of outer islands is when you build 
<br/></span><span>roads and there is not enough vehicles, the roads tend to get overgrown very quickly, and that is what 
<br/></span><span>we see in Gau, Matuku and other areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  problem  that  we  also  have  in  a  lot  of  rural  roads  is  the  lack  of  access  to  good 
<br/>aggregates.  If you see the roads that are being built in Kadavu and Ovalau, for a lot of them, the 
<br/>aggregates were coming across from Viti Levu.  But what FRA  has started to do is to look at quarries 
<br/>in each of these areas.  If we go down to Gau close to the village of Vione, they are looking at a good 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1747 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new rock quarry there that will address the needs for Gau.   The same thing has been done in Koro, 
<br/>close to the village of Tuatua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you have these aggregates and you are working in tandem with the suppliers, you are 
<br/>able to fix the roads quickly.  I think it is also important for us that when we are looking at keeping 
<br/>roads, we need to have enough vehicles on these roads.  I think that is one of the major problems we 
<br/>have in Gau, even for the existing roads that you have, that is a particular problem.  This concept of 
<br/>opening up quarries in all of these islands, in  Kadavu we have opened up the Kiobo Quarry and the 
<br/>one in Yawe.  So, having these aggregates around makes sure that you can have a good supply of 
<br/>material that will allow you to look after your roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  one  thing  that  I  would  like  to  highlight,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  relation  to 
<br/>Recommendation  4.5  about  water  and  I  am  glad  to  see  that  the  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs is here.  If you look at what happened  in Dreketi, Qamea  Island where the landslide took 
<br/>place, straight after the village - the village is here, the sea is here, and immediately behind the slope, 
<br/>they have cut down all the trees in that area.  They have began to plant immediately behind the village 
<br/>and this is where the landslide took place.  I think this is something we might need to consider in 
<br/></span><span>terms of looking at landslides, in terms of looking at the quality of the water, to have some sort of 
<br/></span><span>standards around those areas.  That might be something we can look at in iTaukei Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the other aspect is water catchment management.   I think in Taveuni they talk about the 
<br/>blue line, is it?  People are encroaching into these areas where if you cut too much of the trees or you 
<br/>change your agriculture practice, it is going to have an impact on your water, on the quality of water 
<br/>and the volume of water that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with the recommendations that are made here - boreholes, rainwater harvesting, self-
<br/>help projects, water tanks, piped water, but it is also important to manage our water catchment areas 
<br/>well.  Make sure that we have trees there. During afternoon tea, we were talking about when we used 
<br/>to drink water from the stream before, even if there are frogs there.  You chase them and if the water 
<br/>is flowing, you can still drink that water because it is coming from a forest, the water is clean. So, I 
<br/>think this is also an important aspect that we need to manage well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing that I would like to mention, I congratulate the honourable Minister for bringing 
<br/>the National Disaster Management Act.  Work has been going on for a long time and I hope that it 
<br/>gets passed. A lot of the issues that were brought up here by the Assistant Minister and the problems 
<br/>that are faced, I know that the NDMO has been working on that through the cluster system, to try to 
<br/>make sure that there is continuous improvements to the process that they use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, I would like to wish NDMO well as we are moving closer to the cyclone season 
<br/>once again, October/November.  We will be having a lot of rain and we hope that all the  lessons 
<br/>learnt will allow them to manage these disasters when they do happen so that we can look after the 
<br/>people in this country.  Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse the recommendations in this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank  you honourable Usamate and thank you for highlighting to us the 
<br/>problems encountered in Gau.  You have built roads, half of it is not used, so maybe the animals are 
<br/></span><span>using it.  That was the problem with the airport they had in Vadravadra as well.  The late Ratu Penaia 
<br/></span><span>Ganilau went there, and he was fronted by stray animals roaming around the aerodrome there. That 
<br/>became a problem as well but they do eat dogs in Gau so that is no problem there.  I am just kidding 
<br/>in here because we have been sitting for long.

<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to very briefly support the motion at 
<br/>hand  in  terms  of  the  review  of  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  2016–2017  and  2017–2018  Annual  Reports.    I  must  admit  that  the  Report  is  also 
<br/>outdated, Sir, however, firstly, as a key coordinating agency, we look forward to collaborating closely 
<br/>with the Ministry for Rural Development and Maritime as it continues to fulfil its role in leveraging 
<br/>the  resources  and  engaging  multi-stakeholder  partnerships  needed  to  expand  its  efforts  towards 
<br/>building  a  more  sustainable  and  economically  diverse  rural  and  maritime  communities  and 
<br/>economies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that the rural and maritime areas in Fiji constitute a 
<br/>significant  portion  of  the  country’s  total  land  area  of  over  90  percent,  and  over  the  past  decade, 
<br/>important  progress  has  been  made  but  development  gains  have  also  been  fragile,  which  are  now 
<br/>undermined by new and emerging interconnected threats, including but not limited to climate change, 
<br/>economic and financial sustainability, the COVID-19 pandemic, unsustainable resource, to name a 
<br/>few.  Bridging the development gap between rural and urban areas to a greater extent has never been 
<br/>so much of a cross-cutting issue than it is now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In parallel to the table Report, I would like to acknowledge the hardworking efforts of the 
<br/></span><span>ground team and Divisional staff and Executive Management for their relief rehabilitation work that 
<br/>was  aimed  at  the  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  of  2016  and  2017.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  collaborative  effort  on 
<br/>empowering sustainable local livelihoods should be emphasised in this case to address any national 
<br/>key priorities and thematic areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications has benefitted from partnering with the Ministry through the roll out of our MSME 
<br/>and Cooperative Development Programmes. They assist us in the implementation of the programmes 
<br/>whether it is in the form of distribution of application forms, applications we receive from them, and 
<br/>they  are  always  ready  to  assist  us.    We  have  seen  applicants  that  come  through  the  Provincial 
<br/>Administrator or District Officers to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things, Sir, that we have attempted to do as a Ministry this year is try and 
<br/>encourage collaboration amongst all the Ministries, to ensure that we build a more cohesive approach, 
<br/>particularly when we move into the rural and maritime areas.  I am pleased to note that we had our 
<br/>first multi-agency meeting earlier last month, and I look forward to continued collaboration in terms 
<br/>of trying to drive the rural and maritime economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, before I conclude, I just wish to highlight something that is mentioned in the Standing 
<br/>Committee Report about incomplete projects, such as the refurbishment of Government quarters and 
<br/>the relocation of communities in the red zone.  I know that the honourable Minister will fix up all 
<br/>these issues, given that they are legacy issues from the previous Government, to a large extent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hereby support the motion on the review of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and  Disaster  Management  2016-2017  and  2017-2018  Annual  Reports  which  was  tabled  on  29</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  upon  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  I  would  like  to  thank  all  honourable  Members  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributed to the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
