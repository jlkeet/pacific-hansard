<div><span>ANNEXURE I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES 
<br/>(Hon. Ratu A.R. Lalabalavu) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to Question No. 111/2023 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  ambulance  service  is  an  integral  part  of  the  whole  health  service  and  it  connects  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people directly to the healthcare, thereby, enhancing our people’s access to health services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, we have continued to witness the increasing demand for ambulance services and our 
<br/></span><span>ambulance area always on the move to retrieve patients from their homes in the community, or from 
<br/>sites  or  motor  vehicle  accidents  or  other  sites  where  the  injured  or  sick  is  waiting,  or  to  transfer 
<br/>patients between health facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in Fiji, ambulances and ambulance services were in 
<br/>high demand, particularly in regions where the outbreak was happening to not only carry COVID-19 
<br/>patients to and from the isolation facilities, but also attend to patients with other non-COVID medical 
<br/>conditions that also require their transfer to the health facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our ambulances traverse many rugged and rough terrain throughout the country to access our 
<br/>remote communities, such as in the highlands , in the interior of Navosa, Naitasisi and Ra, the rural 
<br/>villages in Tailevu, Macuata and Cakaudrove, and maritime communities with road access such as 
<br/>on the island of Ovalau, and this is critical for our effort to achieve Universal Health Coverage and 
<br/>ensure that no one is left behind in accessing the essential healthcare they need.  This is in line with 
<br/>the Government's intent for health service in Fiji, so the ambulances we have are helping us to achieve 
<br/>this mission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, ambulances are allocated to the eight major Hospitals or cost centres and they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>CWM Hospital; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lautoka Hospital; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Tamavua Twomey Hospital; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>St. Giles Hospital; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Central Health Services; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Eastern Health Services; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Western Health Services; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Northern Health Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  past  six  months  of  the  last  financial  year,  a  total  of  $1.7  million  was  spent  on 
<br/>Ambulance Services.  Ambulance service is also intimately linked to our retrieval services that is 
<br/>conducted primarily by our Emergency Medicine Physicians but also other specialities in our referral 
<br/>hospitals.
<br/></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>To maximise the impact of having ambulance services, we have also invested in improving 
<br/>our  patient  retrieval  capabilities  through  ongoing  training  for  our  doctors  and  nurses  in  the 
<br/>Emergency  Medicine  Departments,  as  well  as  other  clinical  departments  that  provide  critical 
<br/>healthcare,  place  specialists  from  our  referral  hospitals  at  the  peripheral  health  facilities  to  build 
<br/>capacity and improve diagnosis and management of patients, as well as continue to procure medical 
<br/>equipment and supplies that will support their work.
