<div><span>Update on High Turnover of Teachers 
<br/>(Question No. 102/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the number of teachers 
<br/>who  have  resigned  in  the  first  half  of  this  year  and  what  plans  does  the  Ministry  have  to 
<br/>address the high turnover of its teaching staff? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  question  comes  in  two  prongs;  one  is 
<br/>relating to the statistical information that is required which I would like to give the answers to.  The 
<br/>information that is extracted is from the Ministry of Education system which is known as the Fiji 
<br/>Education Management Information System (FEMIS) as of 8</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the number of teachers who have resigned from January to June 2023, 80 percent of them 
<br/></span><span>have migrated for greener pastures and 20 percent have moved around to other job opportunities in 
<br/>the  Pacific  region  and  in  Fiji.    The  total  number  of  teachers  who  have  resigned  is  469,  with  one 
<br/>deemed to have resigned, and the breakdown is outlined in the table below.

<div><span>On the second part of the question, Mr. Speaker Sir, to address the exodus of our teachers and 
<br/>the Ministry of Education in ensuring that teaching and learning environment for our students is not 
<br/>at  any  time  compromised,  the  following  strategies  have  been  implemented  to  address  the  high 
<br/>turnover of teachers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the recruitment of new teachers for 2023:  ECE – 96; Special School – 6; Primary School 
<br/>– 303; and Secondary Schools - 164. We have employed a total of 569 new graduates as of August 
<br/>2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On re-engagement of retirees:  Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of Education has also re-engaged 
<br/>retirees from the age of 55 years as per the Ministry of Civil Service  Guide. Re-engagement was 
<br/>done through expression of interest processes and for 2023, there were 38 Secondary School teachers 
<br/>who have retired in 2022 and 24 were re-engaged due to lack of teachers in specific areas, like Maths, 
<br/>Physics,  Computer  and  Office  Technology  which  honourable  Premila  Kumar  who  had  initially 
<br/>wanted to remove from schools in 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>PEMAC Teachers and Industrial Arts: Retirees were re-engaged as even the new graduates 
<br/>do not meet the demand in this specialized area. The criteria for recruitment is based on merit and I 
<br/>had to ensure there is no nepotism entertained in this recruitment, unlike what the former head of HR 
<br/>at the Ministry, honourable Hem Chand, did last year when he recruited his own wife as the Head of 
<br/>School at Gurukul.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Orders 62(1) on improper motive.  He has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned that I have promoted my wife.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- May I continue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.  He is elaborating on his point of order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker Sir, he has mentioned that I had promoted my wife - that is 
<br/>totally incorrect.  He has to provide evidence, or he has to withdraw. For his information, I was not 
<br/>head of HR when my wife was promoted, she was promoted in 2019.  I became head of HR in 2020.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He has to provide evidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- He has to provide evidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just clarifying that he was the head of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HR.  Were you not the head of HR before you joined politics?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am trying to divulge all that now in the space of time that is being allowed.  
<br/>At the same time, you have your differences. I have now asked the honourable Minister to continue 
<br/>because of the kind of statistics that you wanted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Primary Schools - 80 teachers retired and 
<br/>46 were re-engaged. For the nine ECE teachers who had retired, not one of them have expressed for 
<br/>re-engagement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  strategy  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  used  is  the  re-
<br/>engagement of teachers who suffered termination due to the ‘No Jab No Job policy’. There were 190 
<br/>teachers who were terminated and 119 showed interest and have been re-engaged.  From those 22 
<br/>ECE teachers who were terminated, only five were re-engaged and there were 105 primary school 
<br/>teachers terminated.  Sir, 63 have expressed interest to be re-engaged.  With the secondary school 
<br/>teachers, 63 were terminated and 51 were re-engaged on the relaxation of the ‘No Jab No Job’ policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has implemented the above strategies to address 
<br/>teacher shortage in our schools. We have already executed the plans to ensure that quality education 
<br/>in all our 176 Secondary Schools, 736 Primary Schools and more than 800 ECE Centres are not at 
<br/>any time compromised as we are committed to ‘leaving no child behind’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education is currently working  and discussing with local universities and 
<br/>training institutions on the alignment of subject combination on the intake of education programmes 
<br/>in line with the need in our schools as we are the biggest employers of graduates from universities in 
<br/>regards to the teaching profession.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the high turnover of teachers has created vacancies in 
<br/>ECE Centres, Special Schools, Primary Schools and also Secondary Schools.  The increase in VAT, 
<br/>high cost of living, no increase in teachers’ pay have contributed to the high turnover of teachers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nonsense! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- My question is, the number of secondary trained teachers teaching in 
<br/>primary schools has increased.  What support is the Ministry providing or is planning to provide to 
<br/>secondary  trained  teachers  teaching  in  primary  schools  so  that  teaching  and  learning  is  not 
<br/>compromised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  our  records,  the  number  of 
<br/>secondary school graduates teaching in primary schools have reduced in numbers and we are working 
<br/></span><span>towards reducing the number of secondary school graduates teaching in primary schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Minister for that lengthy answer 
<br/>and I think he has learnt from his predecessor,  Dr… Reddy on giving long and lengthy answers in 
<br/>Parliament.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1695 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, it is almost nine months now when the 
<br/>honourable Minister actually stated in this Parliament that he has actually initiated an investigation 
<br/>into appointments of Heads of Schools in December.  Can the honourable Minister give an update 
<br/>on the outcome of that particular investigation and when is he going to present a report to Parliament? 
<br/>If he has found nothing out of that investigation, when is he going to appoint those Heads of Schools 
<br/>for whom the appointment was withheld by the honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That sounds like a new question to me, honourable Maharaj.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was very interested in the turnover of teachers, in 
<br/>particular the number - 401.  I would just like to get a grip on this, not just in terms of the numbers 
<br/>but I think it will be more compelling for me in terms of the trend.  Is this an increase or is it stagnant 
<br/>or  is  it  is  a  decrease?    If  so,  whatever  the  trend  is  happening,  what  sort  of  mitigation  factors  or 
<br/>mitigatory factors or adaptive factors are you trying to do in the Ministry to address that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know for a fact that the ratio of teachers to school children is quite large.  I am also aware 
<br/>of the fact that when you have young teachers coming out, there are a lot of complaints about them.  
<br/>Some of them cannot even speak proper English when they are teaching English. So, I am interested 
<br/>in the trend and how you are adapting to the findings that you are finding from those trends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Usamate, I do not really follow you on that.  You wanted a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grip on the data?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  trends,  is  it  going  up,  is  it  going  down  and  whatever  you  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>learning from that  and how you are adapting to it over the past few years or so?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Sir, the information that I have is only for the last six months, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but I can come back to the honourable Member if he could put those questions in writing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The trend is inconsistent, it is not increasing.  With the latest number, it has decreased as of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>June. If you want it from July, I can also provide that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am interested in the trend over the past few years.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Past few years, maybe the honourable Member can assist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am asking you as the Minister.

<div><span>Renovation Costs - Prime Minister’s Residence 
<br/>(Question No. 103/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  inform  Parliament  on  the  total  cost  of 
<br/>renovating the Prime Minister’s residence at Muanikau? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>1696 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.  The  former  Prime  Minister  and  the  former  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Mr.  Voreqe 
<br/>Bainimarama, vacated the Government-owned residence at Muanikau Road on 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.  
<br/>He moved to another Government Quarters at Domain where he signed up to pay rent at the market 
<br/>rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  Mr.  Bainimarama  continued  to  occupy  the  Muanikau 
<br/>residence after the new Government was sworn in, in which used to be the official residence of the 
<br/>former Chief Justice.  We were also informed that the former Prime Minister was also using the Ratu 
<br/>Sukuna Road residence for meetings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2017 and 2018, there was major refurbishment works undertaken at the 
<br/>Prime Minister’s residence at Muanikau which was done through the Construction Implementation 
<br/>Unit which used to be in the Ministry of Economy. When we came into Government, it is now under 
<br/>the Public Service Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initial cost approved by the Government Tender Board was $2,472,962. The contractor 
<br/>was Grace Road Food Company Limited.  There were four variations that  were approved by the 
<br/>Government  Tender  Board  which  increased  the  cost  to  $3,053,773,  with  an  increase  of  around 
<br/>$581,000.  In addition to that, the cost of the lead consultant - Maisuria Design Limited was around 
<br/>$417,000.  The total renovation cost comes to about $3.5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the new Government came in, before the honourable Prime Minister moved into the 
<br/>residence, the Public Works Department had checked the residence at Ratu Sukuna Road and upon 
<br/>assessment, they had advised that they would need some renovations to ensure that the residence is 
<br/>fit for the Prime Minister, honourable Sitiveni Rabuka, to move in.  The total cost was $162,865 and 
<br/>the breakdown is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Minor maintenance works - $33,000; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Sliding gate repair works - $8,500; 
<br/>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Procurement of furniture and fixtures - $120,785 (the biggest component of the $162,000). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Intense cleaning and servicing of kitchen and laundry appliances - $580; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were told that before the honourable Prime Minister moved in, the assessment was that 
<br/>there was no furniture.  We were told that there was no register of furniture with the Government for 
<br/>the former Prime Minister.  The assumption was that the furniture that was there was removed and 
<br/>was actually owned by the former Prime Minister.  The cost of the new furniture for our honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister was $120,000 and the total was $162,000.  That is the breakdown of the costs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  know  what  is  the  intention  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.  Are you going to investigate that renovation?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what is his intention.  All I 
<br/>am doing is answering a question by the honourable Member about the cost of renovation.  The public 
<br/>deserves to know, and if there is a need for investigation, it will be done.  In fact, if you look at the 
<br/>cost  incurred  at  the  former  Chief  Justice’s  residence,  I  do  not  think  there  was  any  big  structural 
<br/></span><span>change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Almost half a million dollars was paid to the lead consultant to redesign and if you look at 
<br/>the four variations and the total cost of $3.5 million, it is a bit unusual to know.  The furniture at the 
<br/>former Prime Minister’s residence was not provided by Government, so I do not know what happened 
<br/>there.  If the honourable Leader of the Opposition is interested to know what happened and if there 
<br/>is a need for investigation, it will be done.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1697 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I do not think that the intent of the question by the honourable Assistant 
<br/>Minister was really to see that an investigation be undertaken.  All he was seeking was raised in his 
<br/>question, just for information purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mitigation Plans to Alleviate Mass Resignation of Nurses  
<br/>(Question No. 104/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  inform  Parliament  on 
<br/>mitigation plans to alleviate the mass resignation of nurses, especially the zone nurses who 
<br/>usually provide Primary Healthcare Awareness activities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Ravunawa  for  that  question.    In  terms  of  what  the  Ministry  is  doing  on  our  mitigation  plans  to 
<br/>alleviate  the  mass  resignation  of  nurses,  it  includes  our  retention  strategy,  and  the  strategies  are 
<br/>increase in salary for registered nurses (Band F) according to years of experience.  This results in the 
<br/>payment of scarce skills for those with more than 15 years of experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another point is the introduction of the 8 percent retention allowance for all cadre of nurses 
<br/>and the re-introduction of consolidated allowance  for nurses based at nursing stations. These will 
<br/>attract nurses to take up public health roles, especially for nursing stations in our rural areas and also 
<br/>relieving  appointments  should  the  need  arise  for  zone  nurses.    Relievers  are  remunerated  with 
<br/>subsistence and meal allowance accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the second part of the question, with regards to the zone nurses and serving in rural 
<br/>communities, nursing will revert to the one-year internship for newly graduates to allow availability 
<br/>of fully fledged nurses to fill up the vacant positions in public health. The Ministry is also focusing 
<br/>on the welfare of its officers (nurses) working in nursing stations and health centres.  Some of their 
<br/>stations and quarters have been identified to have renovations done.  Sir, we have seen that some of 
<br/>the facilities have not been renovated for some time, so we have allocated funds for that. Also, the 
<br/>engagement  of  retired  nurses,  especially  nurses  who  are  above  60  years  old,  most  applicants  are 
<br/>willing to do public health nursing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for the mitigation plan that has been read out in Parliament this morning.  A 
<br/>reminder again that healthcare services is not only provided by nurses. Will the honourable Minister 
<br/>consider other cadre in the healthcare sector?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would like to raise that Section 39 of our Constitution states the right to health and for 
<br/>everyone to be cared for with quality and effective health services.  The mitigation strategies read 
<br/>out for nurses is a noble one, will the honourable Minister also consider other cadre of the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>that  supplementary  question.  Yes,  the  Ministry  is  considering  other  cadre  as  well  in  terms  of 
<br/></span><span>adequately remunerating them. That has been brought to Cabinet and also with the Ministry of Civil 
<br/></span><span>Service, that the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is prioritised should any reform be taken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite surprised this morning to know that 80 
<br/>percent out of the 441 teachers have left the country. That shows zero confidence in this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Rubbish!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mitigation plans for the nurses, I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ask the honourable Minister for Health …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think you have disturbed an hornet’s nest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen to the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  with  your  earlier  statement,  you  have  stirred  an  hornet’s  nest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, go straight to your supplementary question, honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, Sir, I will go my question, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the discussions of the Ministry with FNA in terms of the strike that was intending to 
<br/>happen, are there any outcomes of pay rise for the nurses in regards to mitigating the mass resignation 
<br/>of nurses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Member for that question. 
<br/>Yes, indeed, it is an ongoing discussion between the working group represented by the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services, the Ministry of Civil Service and stakeholders such as FNA. The points 
<br/>that I have raised in terms of budgetary allocation for the current one is based on their findings.  It is 
<br/>an ongoing discussion between the working group on how best we can move forward with their needs 
<br/>- we are talking with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  supplementary question to  the honourable 
<br/>Minister, with this massive resignation of nurses, I think the honourable Minister is well aware that 
<br/>in most nursing stations and health centres, the pharmacy is managed by the nurses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you declare your interest here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not in the public sector, so no interest at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Having  said  that,  since  the  pharmacy’s  daily  operations  will  be 
<br/>affected because the nurses are leaving, are there any plans with FNU to introduce pharmacy assistant 
<br/>courses so that these nurses can be replaced by pharmacy assistants graduating from FNU?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question but I will try 
<br/>and answer it.  Whilst going around to most of the facilities, we noted that most public pharmacies 
<br/>are run by pharmacy assistants and there is a need for them in the public sector.  We are talking with 
<br/>tertiary institutions if they can be provide some sort of learning platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That was the third supplementary question.  Honourable Members, I now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Work Programme on Solar Installation 
<br/>(Question No. 105/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on the work programme for the installation of solar around the country in 
<br/>this financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  For the past 15 years, the Ministry has installed approximately 15,000 solar home systems 
<br/>to  rural,  remote  and  maritime  areas  of  Fiji.      These  systems  have  provided  essential  lighting  and 
<br/>support for electrical loads of up to 300 watts in size.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These systems have played a pivotal role in promoting economic and social development, 
<br/>particularly in sectors such as health, education, agriculture and commercial, benefitting the residents 
<br/>of  these  areas  immensely.  These  solar  systems  have  been  strategically  deployed  in  areas  where 
<br/>extending the conventional electrical grid would be too expensive.  There is a lot of demand, and the 
<br/>Department of Energy within the Ministry is working within its allocated budget to achieve as much 
<br/>as possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the current financial year, the Government has allocated $3 million for solar home systems.  
<br/>This  funding  will  cover  the  supply  and  installation  of  approximately  1,000  Units.  Currently,  the 
<br/>necessary materials are undergoing procurement and the installation process will commence within 
<br/>the  next  two  months,  in  addition  to  the  ongoing  installations,  and  will  be  completed  towards  the 
<br/>middle of next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initiative underscores the ongoing commitment of Government to improve the lives of 
<br/>our citizens, even in the most remote areas of Fiji, while also contributing to the sustainable and eco-
<br/>friendly energy solutions.  The distributions are throughout the various Provinces, including Bua, 
<br/>Macuata, Caukadrove, Naitasiri, Serua, Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau, Navosa, Yasawa and Ba.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the honourable Minister.  
<br/>In some areas in Caukaudrove where I had visited a couple of months back, their systems start to 
<br/>break down again and getting bad.   What is the Ministry doing about that in terms of the repair or 
<br/>servicing of these units?  I know that if they are not going to be serviced or if minor repair works are 
<br/>not being done, those units will really get bad quickly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO.F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member, for that question. In terms 
<br/>of the systems, the ones being currently installed are different from the ones which were previously 
<br/>installed.  So, those that were previously installed are now undergoing maintenance and that has been 
<br/>separately budgeted for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand that the solar initiative is  a great 
<br/></span><span>initiative for the nation and it is very critical in terms of when you install it.  Fiji faces unprecedented 
<br/>and adverse weather conditions.  So, for a cyclone of high magnitude, what is the climate resilient 
<br/>and  adaptive  measures  taken  to  cater  for  the  unprecedented  weather?  It  comes  down  to  the  first 
<br/>question.    Are  there  any  climate  resilient  angles  or  measures  to  this  where  the  system  is  climate 
<br/>resilient?  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not just about taking a system, having money for it and installing it.  Is there any climate 
<br/>resilient or adaptative measures or technologies within the solar systems that are being installed in 
<br/>Fiji that can have a sustainability factor in terms of continuity?  We need to be climate resilient with 
<br/>the technologies we implement, so my question is based on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - I now give the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is very much related to the question 
<br/>by honourable Rinesh Sharma. We thank Government for the continuation of the installation of the 
<br/>new ones but the one that I wanted to ask to the honourable Minister is on those that were damaged 
<br/>in the recent cyclones because there was a separate programme for those as well.   I just wanted to 
<br/>know if that has been completed, or is it part of the programme that we are doing for this year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I was about to answer his question. But, anyway, looking at 
<br/>both  questions  on  climate  resilience,  that  is  part  of  the  whole  concept  of  climate  resilient 
<br/>infrastructure.  So, for the solar infrastructure or systems that have been put in place, that is part of 
<br/>it, that when they install it, that it is also able to withstand certain categories of cyclones.  I cannot 
<br/>give the technical details but that is what has been explained to me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On those which were damaged, yes, as I have explained, that is part of the programme of our 
<br/>maintenance and repairs regarding the current solar to also cover those which were damaged because 
<br/>we  had  visited  some  villages  and  they  had  raised  that.    I  have  asked  the  Department  to  also 
<br/>incorporate that in  the  maintenance and  repair  programme  for those  which are needed  as per our 
<br/>budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - That was the third question, but I will allow you to answer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.  –  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  congratulate  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>continuing with the programme of solarisation. I know there have been a number of phases - Solar 
<br/>Phase 1, Solar Phase 2 and Phase 3, Sir, is the one that I am interested in where you have changed 
<br/>the system.  Before, the solar used to belong to Government and you pay $18 per month.  I think we 
<br/>have now implemented a system where that solar is then fixed and handed over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the honourable Minister can just give us an update on how well that is progressing because 
<br/>once it is handed over, then you are liable for the repairs and the parts?  If you can just give us a brief 
<br/>update on how that particular phase of the programme is going on now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU. - Yes, that is the current programme, that we handover to the 
<br/>consumer.    From  the  few  villages  that  we  have  been  to,  we  have  done  that  and  also  signed  the 
<br/>handover and also clearly explain to them their responsibility. That does not mean that the Ministry 
<br/>is just abandoning them, however, we are also closely liaising with the villagers and </span><span>Turaga-ni-Koro</span><span>
<br/>on how we can assist them in that process. It has been well accepted at the village level on the ones 
<br/>which I have been directly engaged with and also with the Department of Energy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  With  that  reply,  honourable  Minister,  I  think  it  would  be  sufficient  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Tuinaceva as well. Does he have to pay the $80?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU. - No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Because now, we have heard from the former Minister that they used to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pay $80.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, $18 per month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You are responsible for it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you content with that?

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I will liaise with him on the specific locations.

<div><span>Guaranteed Protection and Restitution –  
<br/>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Act 2023 
<br/>(Question No. 106/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the enactment of the Media Industry Development (Repeal) Act 2023 which also 
<br/>removed the Code of Conduct, Standards and Advertising Guidelines, can the Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>and  Communications  inform  Parliament  on  the  protection  in  place  and  the  avenue  for 
<br/>restitution? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Bia  for  his 
<br/>question.  I guess the question probably reflects some of the fundamental differences between this 
<br/>side of Parliament and that side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  say  Media  Industry  Development  Act  2010  or  MIDA,  it  conjures  up  images  of 
<br/>concern and repression.  In fact, I would like to think that the removal of MIDA has been the cause 
<br/>of much celebration and exuberance that we currently experience in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, when I initially read the honourable Member’s question, 
<br/>I was worried whether he was wanting to bring MIDA back because from this side of Parliament… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has gone into the dustbin of history 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and that is where it will remain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will now answer honourable  Bia’s question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the repeal of the Media Industry Development Act 2010 on 14</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023, 
<br/>does  not  mean  that  there  is  no  longer  a  code  of  conduct  for  journalists  in  Fiji.    Again,  this  is  a 
<br/>fundamental difference between how we view democracy and how the other side of Parliament views 
<br/></span><span>democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken time to listen to our journalists and the industry, and it is 
<br/>clear that that the journalists and the media organisations understand their role in the society.  The 
<br/>bottom line is, the repeal of the law was necessary to safeguard the media’s independence, while 
<br/>ensuring the public’s right to be informed accurately, fairly and timely.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If they had asked the Media Association at that time, they would have known this.  In fact, a 
<br/>code of ethics was developed by the Fijian Media Association, and they believe it will be adhered to 
<br/>by media organisations and journalists in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Where is the copy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  is  why  the fundamental  difference 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between us and them.  We actually trust people to do the right thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  sets  out  ethical  principles  that  journalists  should  uphold  in  their  work.    There  are  also 
<br/>international best practices and standards which we expect our media organisations and journalists 
<br/>to adhere to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  most  widely  used  code  of  ethics  for  journalists  globally  is  the  Society  of 
<br/>Professional Journalist Code of Ethics.  It sets out ethical principles that journalists uphold in their 
<br/>work, including truthfulness, accuracy and impartiality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be honest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the repeal of the Act so far, you can see the balance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reporting that is going around… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- … and sometimes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …it actually favours the other side of Parliament, so they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be happy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a very long time, Fiji did not have free 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>media, a  media that is essential for our functioning democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- In fact, people say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- ... that free media is the oxygen of democracy.  But in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new Fiji, Sir, we have done it.  That is how you preserve democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- In addition to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have laws in place, 
<br/>including laws on defamation, the right to privacy and the right to protect children.  Alongside this, 
<br/>of course, we have the watchdogs.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1703 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The Consumer Council of Fiji and the Fiji Competition and 
<br/>Consumer Commission which can receive complaints from the public on various matters, inclusive 
<br/>of those mentioned, particularly in terms of false advertising.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section  78  of  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  Act  talks  about  false 
<br/>advertising.    I  urge  you  all  to  look  it  up  -  it  addresses  the  concerns  that  have  been  raised  in  this 
<br/>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, MIDA had to go, the whole of Fiji is happy with the removal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of MIDA and now, we have real democracy arriving in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I do understand and the whole 
<br/>of Fiji knows that the Media Industry Development Act has been repealed and now amended. But 
<br/>simply, the question that I had asked was, what avenues are there, at the moment, to protect or the 
<br/>protection avenues that are in place - avenues for restitution for journalists and reporters that are there 
<br/>because currently it is still in the process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Nine months, it is still in the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What are you doing in nine months? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am at a loss here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, try and go along with the supplementary question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you have raised, especially on the restitution part.  What are you trying to restore? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the previous Media Industry Development Act, 
<br/>journalists  are  protected  in  terms  of  doing  their  work.    This  is  in  regards  to  mistakes,  may  be  in 
<br/>writing or in reporting. There are laws that do protect them if there is a complaint from a third party 
<br/>in terms of stories being broadcasted or stories being written online. The question simply says, it is 
<br/>in the process at the moment, so what avenues are there to project journalists and reporters since the 
<br/>Act is still in the process and finalising is in place?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am, kind of, trying to work out the right answer to say, Sir, 
<br/>but if it is for the protection of journalists, I think the law is there to protect them should there be 
<br/></span><span>concerns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Which law? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The defamation law is there. I read defamation here in my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply.  So, if that is what you are after, there is certainly avenues for journalists to use.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Sir, that I did not put in here is just because it has not been formalised, is that 
<br/>there  is  also  the  Media  Council  that  is  about  to  be  established.    The  holdup  is  really  with  some 
<br/>documentary requirements at the Office of the Registrar of Companies, which I am trying to assist 
<br/>with, but that will mean that the industry as a whole will be self-regulating.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  true democracy,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.   They  have  actually  selected the seven Council 
<br/>members  who  are  very  capable  citizens  of  Fiji,  and  they  are  expected  to  act  independently  and 
<br/>adjudicate  on  issues  of  concern  in  terms  of  media.    To  be  honest,  I  think  there  are  adequate 
<br/>mechanisms in place.  I know the other side of Parliament was obsessed with regulating everything, 
<br/>maybe because of one person who is no longer here.  I can assure Parliament that by the time the 
<br/>Council  is  set  up, there  will  be  adequate  mechanisms  in  place  to  address  concerns  around  media 
<br/>conduct and the like.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Required Standards for Imported Food Items 
<br/>(Question No. 107/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on the measures that 
<br/>are in place to ensure that imported food items meet the required standard so as to avert the 
<br/>rising cases of Non-Communicable Diseases in the country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Food  and  Safety  Act  2003  and  its 
<br/>subsidiary legislation, currently enforced by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, looks into 
<br/>matters  promoting  public  health  and  safety.    Also  the  Codex  Alimentarius  or  Food  Code  is  a 
<br/>collection  of  standards,  guidelines  and  codes  of  practice  adopted  by  the  Codex  Alimentarius 
<br/>Commission, and are referenced in the Food Safety Regulations of 2009.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from this, the Department of National Trade Measurements and Standards, the Trade 
<br/>Standards and Quality Control Act of 2009, creates national standards for goods and services that 
<br/>basically  provide  technical  requirements,  for  example,  making  a  product,  managing  a  process, 
<br/>delivering a service or supplying materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry has created standards in  the areas of building  and construction, 
<br/>communication and technology,  consumer goods and management systems  of trade management.  
<br/>Currently, the only standard related to food is the wheat standard - FS5-2003, fortification of flour, 
<br/>which sets out the requirements for calculation on minimum standards for wheat flour.  This standard 
<br/>is also regulated by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The existing measurement legislation or the National Trade and Management Act 1989 and 
<br/>its  regulations,  like  the  regulations  on  pre-packaged  goods,  deals  with  labelling  requirements  on 
<br/>certain food items.  Under the National Trade Management legislation, importers and sellers of pre-
<br/>packaged goods must ensure their packages are correctly labelled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  continues  to  work  closely  with  other  core  Government 
<br/></span><span>agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, in ensuring that practical and proper 
<br/>measures are in place to protect the food industry and the consumers at large.  We will continue to 
<br/>look at other sector standards, should industries or the Government need to adopt them in future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a way forward, possibly, the Government could consider having a food regulation system 
<br/>of its own but that, of course, will be subject to the Cabinet discussions but that is something that can 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1705 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be done to improve the overall framework in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this system should cover topics ranging from safety, labelling, composition 
<br/>of food and handling requirements, and could be spearheaded by the honourable Minister for Health 
<br/>and Medical  Services.    In  fact,  in  Australia and  New Zealand, they do a have a joint  corporative 
<br/>system that currently handles food regulations.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, listening to the honourable Minister, he is actually 
<br/>lost.  He does not know what he is talking about - we are talking about imported food items, imported 
<br/>food items are actually self-regulated, honourable Minister.  We do not have standards for imported 
<br/>food items.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The standards we have is mainly for the food that we are exporting out.  We are protecting 
<br/>the consumers of other countries rather than the consumers of this country.  Can you tell us how 
<br/>many food standards are there and how are these developed?  Is your Ministry developing it, or is it 
<br/>the Ministry of Health and Medical Services or is Codex developing it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs had a meeting… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, it is an important issue, we are talking about food. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am coming to that.  The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs 
<br/>had a meeting with health, trade and other stakeholders and we realised that there was no one actually 
<br/>controlling the standards of imported food coming into the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Stop grandstanding, what is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, can you specifically tell us which agency is setting the standard 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for imported food and how is that being controlled?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ask consumers, ask yourself when you go to these supermarkets, the kind of rubbish that is 
<br/>being sold in supermarkets.  We are talking about standard, we are talking about quality, so where is 
<br/>the quality, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that is a totally new question and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so let me just put you at ease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Oh! You have missed out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You are the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Let me just put you at ease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What were you doing for four years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Firstly, sometimes when we say things, we need to think

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that it reflects back on us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, that is not it at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, after 16 years, what she is saying is that she has done 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>absolutely nothing about food standards when she was in the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What are you doing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, I will leave it at that Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I think just to 
<br/>allay your concerns, it is a concern on this side of the Parliament and sadly, our Ministry.  I have 
<br/>received a lot of reports on incorrect labelling, on food that is not of the right standard, particularly 
<br/>tinned fish.  So, we are currently undertaking some investigation through the Consumer Council, as 
<br/>you know they do that work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  a  few  reports  with  me  which  most  likely,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  have  to  do 
<br/>something  or  create  an  Act  or  develop  some  regulation  around  but  what  I  would  like  to  say  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is that it is a concern on this side of Parliament and it has been worked on through the 
<br/>Consumer Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No standards that is why.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- You are in government, what are you doing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to remind us of a case of an imported 
<br/>tinned fish that was displayed in this august Parliament by honourable Qereqeretabua.  That is an 
<br/>example of what they were trying to get through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. The question asked was in regards to imported food 
<br/>and standards.  So, my question is around sub-standards and I will formulate my question in this way. 
<br/>What  is  the  regulatory  mechanism  taken  by  honourable  Manoa,  someone  who  has  gone  against 
<br/>fundamental differences and has shown unwavering support for foreign investors like Grace Roads?  
<br/>What safety standards are you taking for Fiji, not being a dumping ground for substandard goods? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ignore the diatribe coming from that 
<br/>side but try and address the substance of their concern.  As I have said, I received a lot of reports.  I 
<br/>have to say that the Consumer Council of Fiji is doing a wonderful job in monitoring consumption 
<br/>in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I receive regular reports and updates on every single issue in the country and one of the ones 
<br/>that is of active concern currently is the standard of food, particularly imported food items.  We are 
<br/></span><span>working together to try and sort out what we need to do, going forward, so that is a concern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Some of the imported goods that are coming in at the moment are in foreign language. No 
<br/>one  knows  what  is  coming  into  the  country.  I  think  this  was  coming  in  before  we  came  into 
<br/>Government. It could not have just miraculously appeared in the last nine months, so let just keep 
<br/>that in mind if we are trying to throw stones at each other.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1707 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rise in Criminal Activities by Teenagers 
<br/>(Question No. 108/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the rise in the number of teenagers found on our streets, loitering, glue sniffing 
<br/>and  involved  in  criminal  activities,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and 
<br/>Immigration  explain  as  to  how  section  8  of  the  Minor  Offences  Act  1971  be  enforced  to 
<br/>address these issues? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his  question  which  is 
<br/>essentially centred around section 8 of the Minor Offences Act 1971 and how we could use that to 
<br/>deal with loitering on our streets by our young street dwellers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This section of the Act is designed to address situations where individuals including teenagers 
<br/>are found loitering in or near premises or in public places under circumstances that suggest illegal 
<br/>activity or prostitution.  While it is essential to enforce this law, Mr. Speaker, we must do so within 
<br/>the framework of the Restore Blue concept which we are now endeavouring to use, which emphasises 
<br/>community oriented, policing accountability and rehabilitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  Mr.  Speaker,  section  8  of  the  Minor  Offences  Act  1971  provides  law  enforcement 
<br/>authorities with the legal means to address these issues. However, approach to enforcing this section 
<br/>is guided by several key principles and I just want to talk through them very briefly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community  Engagement:  Building  strong  ties  between  our  Police  Force  and  the  local 
<br/>communities  is  crucial.    We  encourage  residence  to  report  incidents  and  concerns  if  it 
<br/>allows  the  Police  to  work  collaboratively  with  the  community  to  identify  and  address 
<br/>issued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Youth Centred Approach:  When dealing with teenagers involved in loitering potentially 
<br/>legal activities, we take a youth centred approach this means understanding their unique 
<br/>circumstances offering guidance and exploring alternatives to punitive measures whenever 
<br/>possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Mental  Health  and  Support  Services:  Recognising  that  some  of  these  teenagers  maybe 
<br/>facing underlying mental health challenges.  We are working to ensure that mental health 
<br/>services are available to them and accessible to those in need and early intervention and 
<br/>support are central to this strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rehabilitation  and  Integration:    Our  primary  goal  here  is  not  simply  to  punish  but  to 
<br/>rehabilitate  and  reintegrate  these  teenagers  into  society  as  responsible  and  productive 
<br/>citizens.   We must provide them with educational vocational recreational opportunities to 
<br/>redirect their lives positively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Collaboratory  Efforts:  Collaboration  with  relevant  Government  agencies,  Non-
<br/></span><span>Governmental  Organisations  (NGOs)  and  community  groups  is  fundamental  to  this 
<br/></span><span>approach  by  pooling  resources  and  expertise  we  can  address  the  complex  issues 
<br/>surrounding teenagers involved in such activities more reflectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while enforcing this section as the question suggests over the minor offences in 
<br/>1971, it has been part of our strategy but the focus goes beyond punitive measures.  In the past, what 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force would essentially do is when the boats come around, they send a whole bunch 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>1708 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Police Officers to gather these street kids and take them away until the boat leaves.  Then they, 
<br/>obviously, will find their way back to town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole idea here is to involve the community and that is what we are trying to do.  We 
<br/>are trying to create a society where police officers work closely with the community, so that they can 
<br/>restore safety and hope, to the lives of these troubled teenagers, ultimately, the hope to break in the 
<br/>cycle of negative behaviours and offering them a brighter future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  question  to  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/>regarding the glue sniffing problem.  There was a report given by this Substance Abuse Advisory 
<br/>Council sometimes back about the level of glue sniffing amongst our children and our youth.  I am 
<br/>just wondering if there is a plan to bring some law in place to try and control or regulate those who 
<br/>sell, buy and use glue, just to protect our young ones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  that 
<br/>question.  The short answer to that is, yes.  I know it has been discussed in Cabinet and the Police are 
<br/>not the lead agency in that.  The Ministry of Education with our Women and Children are the lead 
<br/>agencies looking after that with Social Welfare. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  if  I may just elaborate a little  bit here.   Interestingly  enough, I was just 
<br/>talking to the honourable Minister for Education and he was pointing out elements of the question to 
<br/>me.    Whilst  the  issue  is  dealing  with  children  that  are  loitering  on  the  streets,  these  issues  are 
<br/>flourishing in our schools - children who come to school from home and go back home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In teenagers, the age suggests the problem which means they are old enough now in doing 
<br/>things that they are doing.  It is something that they have acquired over time where they are now 
<br/>producing the outcome of how they have been raised.  I have always said, at the end of the day, you 
<br/>can talk about government and laws as much as we can, but when it comes to children and because 
<br/>of our laws and our Constitution, it gives that responsibility to parents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not come here and talk about it because a lot of us do a lot of social 
<br/>work with you, and I am just dealing with the Catholic youth.  This last weekend, there were 50 youth 
<br/>at my home living with me in Tailevu.  These youth talk about these things – their problems and 
<br/>vulnerabilities.  It seems societies are not listening to them.  It seems as if parents are not listening, 
<br/>so they come down to the street and then the Police have to go and look after them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember the issue that honourable Naupoto raised about stray animals.  Our society has 
<br/>evolved down that path.  I suggested this earlier – there needs to be some spiritual conversation, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, because we are dealing with the lives of our children.  We can do as much as raising 
<br/>programmes and supporting it with money, but these are really big fundamental issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think with Government and the community together, this is what we are doing.  I have got 
<br/>data and statistics here given to me by the Police in the West and Suva on the things that they do and 
<br/>putting them in schools, but these are not the solutions.  I was going to read them out today, but they 
<br/>are not.  They need empathy, love, care, understanding - these are the big things to deal with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem is not only in the streets where they end up, but it breeds at homes and in schools.  
<br/>Until we deal with that and become responsible parents, these things will evolve.  They will continue 
<br/>to stay, so I go back to my point earlier - these issues about the problems that we have to do with 
<br/>crime is a solution that needs to evolve from this Parliament, and I would like to initiate that in the 
<br/>future too, Mr. Speaker, Sir, hopefully very soon.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1709 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a comment to make.  Young people are 
<br/>roaming  our  streets  for  various  reasons  –  some  for  various  reasons,  some  for  their  personal 
<br/>satisfaction, some are earning money for their families, some are there for love, for empathy and for 
<br/>good friendship that they do not find in their homes.  I remember a few weeks ago, the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Women  proposed  the  banning  of  pornography  in  Fiji.  If  it  has  to  start  from  this 
<br/>Parliament, then we have to start now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I add to that, honourable Members.  I have come across cases in my 
<br/>village of certain delinquents who have been disowned, not so much by their parents, but by their 
<br/>respective </span><span>mataqalis.</span><span>  So, if anything happens it is not the parent that is answerable, it is the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>
<br/>from which that young child hails from.  The </span><span>mataqali</span><span> has to answer at the village meeting - what 
<br/>are they doing about that because not only it has brought disrepute to the family but more importantly 
<br/>to the extended family.  That is where the </span><span>vanua</span><span> comes in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have suggested, honourable Minister, that it begins from this Parliament.  Yes, I would 
<br/>like to echo that perhaps, this could be taken on board to be discussed by the Great Council of Chiefs 
<br/>(GCC) as they are meeting now.  Whoever is going to take that from Parliament to that particular 
<br/>meeting with the Chiefs, we would like to be rest assured in this Parliament that it will be in their 
<br/>good hands to see that it is properly addressed.  If you leave it only with the parents, then for sure the 
<br/>problem will still be there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yellow Ribbon is good, it is doing well, and I was part of the Yellow Ribbon since I was 
<br/>incarcerated in prison.  Now, when we meet with the people who have been imprisoned, they call me 
<br/>‘Old Boy’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought that should be referred only to people going to boarding schools 
<br/>like Queen Victoria School (QVS), Natabua High School, et cetera.  Now, they tell me too that I am 
<br/>an Old Boy.  But, again, you have rightly challenged Parliament, honourable Minister, actions need 
<br/>to be taken from here just like the Yellow Ribbon. This is for our young children that are roaming 
<br/>the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I almost  ran into some  with  my  driver last  night.  They were sleeping  below the bridge  at 
<br/>Nabukalou.  Probably, they were going across to take their night nap but the way they crossed the 
<br/>street, they do not care whether the vehicle was coming or what.  Then I asked the driver, who are 
<br/>these kids?  He said, “oh, these are the homeless ones that live below the bridge”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I would like to extend what honourable Ravunawa has stated in his comment, that we need 
<br/>to take ownership of this.  Honourable Members, perhaps you may want to discuss this further during 
<br/>your lunch breaks, try and get some things moving in a direction of getting the GCC to discuss this, 
<br/>this is very important.  This is our future generation out on the streets now, not only for the GCC but 
<br/>for other interfaith as well. There are other ethnic groups that are involved as well in Fiji.  Thank 
<br/>you.

<div><span>MOU with YWAM Ships Aotearoa Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No.109/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry and the YWAM Ships Aotearoa 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limited? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Youth  With  A  Mission 
<br/>(YWAM) Ships Aotearoa Limited is a New Zealand-based NGO that undertakes voluntary social 
<br/>services, including free medical services around New Zealand and some of the Pacific region.  With 
<br/>the endorsement of Cabinet, an MOU was signed and activated on Monday, 7</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023.  The 
<br/>term of the MOU is 10 years which will allow the Ministry and the YWAM Ships Aotearoa Limited 
<br/>to work in collaboration in terms of delivering and achieving universal health coverage in hard-to-
<br/>reach places in the maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of the honourable Members, the inaugural trip to Fiji by YWAM Ships 
<br/>was last year, 2022m, and this year, we made it official in terms of the MOU on how they will partner 
<br/>with the Ministry of Health in terms of delivering healthcare to our hard-to-reach places, especially 
<br/>in maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part of the agreement is the annual schedule plan, implement, monitor and evaluate health 
<br/>services  provided  in  the  best  interest  of  the  people  of  Fiji,  and  to  notify  the  chance  of  potential 
<br/>conflicts  of  interest,  which  may  impact  on  implementation  and  the  outcome  of  the  programme 
<br/>activity and equally manage and share information and public’s findings in collaboration regarding 
<br/>the use of data from the projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the make-up of the staff who come on board for this initiative, they are mostly volunteers 
<br/>and medical professionals as well and other professionals that come on board and assist the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and the country as a whole.  Last year, they were in Rabi, this year they were in Kadavu 
<br/>and parts of the maritime areas in the Eastern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me first thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health for the update on the question that I raised yesterday.  He is providing me with the Situation 
<br/>Report (SITREP) from the Ministry of Health, so I wish to acknowledge the honourable Minister. 
<br/>Thank you, Honourable Minister, for the good work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My simple question is, we appreciate the assistance and, of course, the MOU (SDG-17 is on 
<br/>partnerships) and we need to continue to encourage this but a key area, particularly, learning from 
<br/>our past disasters is health assistance.  I just want to ask the Minister, if assistance during disasters 
<br/>as well is part of the MOU or is included in the MOU? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure this Parliament that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is also included in the response to disaster relief situation as and when appropriate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to know from the Minister whether 
<br/>this MOU has the endorsement or the covering of the New Zealand Government in your cooperation 
<br/>or MOU with the Youth With A Mission? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a  New  Zealand-based 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>registered NGO, but so far it is endorsed by the Government in terms of the works they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- My question simply is, some of these arrangements are without 
<br/>the support of the National Government of the particular country and I am wondering whether there 
<br/>are provisions that we are aware of, that have the endorsement of the covering of the New Zealand 
<br/>Government? That is my question to the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Sir, from what I have been told, since it is a New

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1711 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Zealand-based registered NGO, we have met with the New Zealand Embassy and they do not fully 
<br/>need the endorsement for this matter, from what I have been told. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That brings us to the end of the Oral Questions, honourable Members.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will now move on to the Written Questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Standing Order No. 74(1)(a).  If 
<br/>we allow this question to go through, I believe there will be some breach in terms of procedures of 
<br/>the business of the Parliament because the question is nonsensical in nature, especially Question No. 
<br/>110/2023(a).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that Government does not organise any golf tournaments, so if that is factually 
<br/>incorrect, BNC would not make sense to the follow-up question. The question needs to be re-drafted 
<br/>and brought to Parliament at a later stage because Government does not organise golf tournaments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  know  the  intention  and  we  would  like  to  get  the  answers  to  the  questions  as  well, 
<br/>especially to part (b) and (c) of the question, but Government does not organise such tournament. 
<br/>Even this Government would not organise a golf tournament, so how can we ask this question in 
<br/>Parliament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were supporting the option. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.    A.A.  MAHARAJ.-    Once  again,  we  are  just  trying  to  correct  the  mistake  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government in question. Please, rephrase it and bring it to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Business Committee! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Business Committee! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A. MAHARAJ.- We did not see that in the Business Committee.  It is your question, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you should have actually amended it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. I think since we have taken it through the Business Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will have to bear with it and raise the question now.

<div><span>International Golf Tournaments  
<br/>(Question No. 110/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inform Parliament on the following –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>how many International Golf Tournaments have been organised by the Government

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have any ulterior motive for asking this question, it is just for the 
<br/>sake of information for the public and the taxpayers at large who are oblivious, not knowing at all 
<br/>about the background of hosting such tournaments in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are adding to your written question, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the Standing Orders, when you read the written question, you do not have to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>read the question. You just mention the number of the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! You were referring to which Standing Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 45(3): “If the question is a written 
<br/>question, the Member rises and asks the question by referring only to its number on the Order Paper 
<br/>….”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker,  I know it is in the Standing Orders but precedence has 
<br/>been set in the previous Parliament.  It is for the sake of the public.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I shall table 
<br/>my response at a later date as permitted under Standing Order 45(3).
