<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed with the Order Paper before us, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to highlight a few things that have happened in this Sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to commend both sides of Parliament.  It is historical for the Government to allow 
<br/>an urgent motion to be put forward.  I have been sitting on the Opposition side for quite sometimes, 
<br/>even as Leader of the Opposition, and we tried so hard to get an urgent motion put through, but it 
<br/>was so difficult.  The second thing happened before we took the break for lunch and that was when 
<br/>Government was willing to withdraw something put forward to be considered in Parliament, after 
<br/>pleadings from the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is an important week for you, a special day including that of the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration,  but  this  historic  moment  cannot  pass  without  us  making 
<br/>comments.  As highlighted by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism on the issue of 
<br/>an urgent motion, we never saw the light of day on that one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  as  aptly  put  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Commerce  in  this 
<br/>august Parliament during one of the earlier sittings, it is now time for bipartisanship.  That was echoed 
<br/>in the Business Committee last week by the honourable Opposition Whip when he also pleaded for 
<br/>bipartisanship.  That word is quite difficult to try and carry out the true meaning of it because of the 
<br/>laws that exist, the Parliamentary rules that exist.  Yes, in the past it was allowed, you can do cross-
<br/>voting, you can cross the floor but that has all changed.  The rules have changed.  So many things 
<br/>can be done together - we all put our heads together and try and look for the best way out to help the 
<br/>people who have put us here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all I want to say, because I am so proud to be part of these changes that we are seeing.  
<br/>I thank the Government of the day and the Opposition, especially the Leader of the Opposition, for 
<br/>all that has happened.  All we just do is pray some more and harder - the best will always be there 
<br/>when we strive for it.  Thank you, honourable Members for listening. 
<br/></span></div>
