<h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, before I move 
<br/>my motion, I just wish to share some comments and to reciprocate your kind comments about how 
<br/>we  are  carrying  on  in  Parliament.    As  the  saying  goes,  Sir,  “Everything  rises  and  falls  with 
<br/>leadership”, we believe Sir, under your able leadership as the Speaker of Parliament, we are able to 
<br/>foster this new bipartisanship that we are experiencing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That under Standing Order 6, that so much of Standing Order 130(2) to  (4) be 
<br/></span><span>suspended so as to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to 
<br/>move  his  motion  on  the  approval  of  Treaties  without  referring  them  to  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1721 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji 
<br/>played a pivotal role at the 12</span><span>th</span><span> Ministerial Conference last year in getting an Agreement on Fisheries 
<br/>Subsidies  (AFS)  through  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  acting  as  lead  spokesperson  for 
<br/>Pacific Group and the ACP. The Agreement is, however, only the first step in securing meaningful 
<br/>disciplines on fisheries subsidies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  is  accordingly  one  of  the  proponents  of  the  second  wave  of  the  negotiations  that  is 
<br/>currently taking place in the WTO.  In order to maintain its role as a leadership and maximise its 
<br/>ability to influence negotiations, Fiji needs to show commitment to securing strong disciplines on 
<br/>fisheries  subsidies  through  prompting,  notifying  its  acceptance  of  the  Agreement  on  Fisheries 
<br/>Subsidies to the WTO members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far, all the big subsiding nations have ratified the WTOAFS including 
<br/>China, the EU and the US.  Fiji will, however, be the first Pacific WTO member to do so.  In doing 
<br/>so, Fiji will be setting an example to the rest of the Pacific WTO members and to the rest of the WTO 
<br/>membership on the importance of disciplining harmful fisheries subsidies and maintaining healthy 
<br/>fish stocks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been the only Pacific Island country that was invited 
<br/>and  joined  the  14  member  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  (IPEF)  for  prosperity  which  was 
<br/>launched in May 2022.  Negotiations commenced after the Ministers agreed to the scope in November 
<br/>last year and are proceeding with an extremely fast pace.  In May this year, the Indo-Pacific Economic 
<br/>Framework Trade Ministers agreed and concluded one out of four pillars of IPEF called the Supply 
<br/>Chain  Pillar.    This  was  a  remarkable  achievement  and  as  we  will  hear,  the  Agreement  will  be 
<br/>beneficial to Fiji in building resilient international supply chains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the goal for IPEF members is to conclude negotiations on all the pillars by 
<br/>November 2023.  The signing of all the pillars of the IPEF is expected to take place in November.  
<br/>Fiji being the only Pacific Island nation participating in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, needs 
<br/>to demonstrate commitment to the IPEF members to capitalise on the multifarious benefits that come 
<br/>within part of IPEF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that we demonstrate our commitment by ratifying the supply chain agreement 
<br/>to ensure that we remain on the path of concluding the negotiations on the rest of the three pillars and 
<br/>that is Trade, Clean Economy and Fair Economy by November 2023.  Just to put clarity honourable 
<br/>Members, there has been precedence set before when the previous government moved in Parliament 
<br/>for the ratification of the Paris Agreement on 12</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2016 without referring it to the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence because it needed some urgent attention on Fiji’s part. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those pertinent issues and points in perspective, I urge all honourable 
<br/>Members to support this Suspension Motion to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister 
<br/>for Justice to move his motions on the approval of the Treaties without referring them to the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your very wise comments 
<br/></span><span>earlier on.  I think what needs to be said also is that these two particular Treaties before us are not 
<br/></span><span>about politics but about Fiji, and we understand that.  Right at the outset, let me say from our side 
<br/>that we have no objections to the motion before Parliament which is asking that Standing Order 130 
<br/>(2) and (4) is suspended - we do not have a problem with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  would  not  go  into  the  two  particular  Treaties  now  but  when  it  is  taken  up  by  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General we will have a few words to say.  But as I said earlier, Sir, in the spirit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>1722 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of bipartisanship, this is about Fijians and Fiji’s future and our future generations, we do not have a 
<br/>problem.  I wholeheartedly agree with the suspension.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I would like to thank you also for the comments that you made about 
<br/>the way we have conducted ourselves.   I would just like to confirm that we are fully in agreement 
<br/>with this particular motion, but as the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament has said, 
<br/>there  is  a  precedent  because  it  was  related  to  the  Paris  Agreement  which  was  one  of  the  most 
<br/>important ever agreements that we were involved in.  Fiji was at the very heart of all the things that 
<br/>we were pushing for, especially for the Small Island States and the oceans agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For issues like this where there was an urgent need for us to be able to push through things 
<br/>quickly, this side of Parliament  is  prepared to  be able to  use those fast-track options.   There is  a 
<br/>sensible argument that I was using earlier on in terms of the use of Standing Order 51 when there are 
<br/>adequate and important  issues and there are some urgent  things that need to  be done,  we will be 
<br/>prepared to look at and agreed with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular issue that has happened, we will wholeheartedly agree with this motion of 
<br/>fast-tracking the process for getting these two treaties in line because they bring a lot of benefits to 
<br/>our country.  It also keeps our role as well as the pre-eminent countries in other parts of the world.  
<br/>Also on that note, I notice that there is one other Convention that has been pushed through by the 
<br/>Committee - the Budapest Convention.  This was the Convention on Cybercrime and the Committee 
<br/>had  already  gone  through  all  the  stages.    It  was  tabled  in  the  last  Parliament  Sitting  with  the 
<br/>recommendation that Fiji ratifies the Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the honourable Attorney-General was to move a motion in Parliament that Fiji ratifies 
<br/>this,  but  a  few  months  have  passed,  and  we  hope  that  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and 
<br/>Government will look to moving that particular Convention through. So, those are the words that I 
<br/>have, Sir.  We fully support the motion before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  I  think  it  is  just  left  to me  to  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  and  the  Members  on  the  other  side  of  Parliament  for  coming  together  to  agree  as  a 
<br/>Parliament,  and  as  Members  of  Parliament,  on  the  suspension  motion  so  we  can  discuss  the  two 
<br/>Treaties before us, so I thank them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
