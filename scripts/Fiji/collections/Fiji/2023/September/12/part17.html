<div><span>RATIFICATION OF THE WTO AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES SUBSIDIES 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament approves that Fiji ratifies the World Trade Organization Agreement on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fisheries Subsidies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to move that Parliament approves that Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accedes to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (WTOAFS). 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1723 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  WTO which provides the framework for multilateral  trading  system  has 
<br/>faced considerable pressure in providing a stable and predictable trading system in recent years.  It 
<br/>has struggled to deliver tangible initiatives that would enhance international trade and reinvigorate a 
<br/>weak global economy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of agreement at the multilateral level in the WTO has led to a rapid growth in the 
<br/>number of bilateral or Regional Free Trade Agreement across the Globe and rising numbers of non-
<br/>tariff  barriers.  Both  these  developments  affect  the  ability  of  developing  countries  to  integrate 
<br/>smoothly due to the global economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a bright spot in this rather desolate landscape. In 2022, one of the major successes of 
<br/>the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) was that WTO Member States had agreed to conclude the 
<br/>negotiations on the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies after 21 years. This was only the second time 
<br/>the Ministers have agreed to formalize the Agreement since the founding of the WTO in 1995. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (AFS) is the first WTO agreement to environmental 
<br/>sustainability as its objectives and is a significant step towards ensuring the oceans sustainability. It 
<br/>will begin to tackle one of the key drivers of overfishing by curtailing harmful subsidies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fisheries Subsidies are payments made by nations to commercial fishing operators to keep 
<br/>those businesses profitable. According to  the United Nations Food  and Agricultural  Organization 
<br/>2022  State  of  World  Fisheries  and  Aquaculture  Report,  35  percent  of  fish  stocks  worldwide  are 
<br/>exploited beyond sustainable levels and over 90 percent are exploited at or beyond sustainable levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is further noted that larger developing countries are paying USD22 billion a year in harmful 
<br/>subsidies that drive overfishing. These subsidies primarily go to industrial fishing fleets to artificially 
<br/>lower fuel and vessel construction cost while enabling them to catch more fish by fishing further 
<br/>outward sea and for longer periods of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Large  amounts  of  fisheries  subsidies  are  provided  by  large  fishing  nations  such  as  China, 
<br/>Taiwan, Japan and the European Union.  To their fishing industries, this include fuel support, vessel 
<br/>construction  support  and  operational  cost  support.  These  subsidies  enable  the  larger  vessels,  for 
<br/>example the larger purse seiners that are able to extract large amounts of fish out from their exclusive 
<br/>economic zone, the high seas or other countries EEZ.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Pacific,  massive  subsidies  provided  to  distant  water  fishing  fleets  prevent  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of our own fisheries industries and utilization of our own resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, fishing subsidies, if not disciplined, will contribute to over-fishing, including 
<br/>Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in our waters, thus leading to both environmental 
<br/>and economic harm and irreversible depletion of fish stock for the Pacific. The IUU fishing is a real 
<br/>challenge for the Pacific region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2021 Report by the Forum Fisheries Agency, estimated that between the period of 2017 
<br/>and 2019, the estimated value of catching volume IUU fishing amounted to USD330 million. It is 
<br/></span><span>noteworthy that the Western and Central Pacific region have healthy tuna stocks and accounts for 54 
<br/></span><span>percent of the global tuna catch. Therefore, it is vitally important that the region protects its resources 
<br/>for the current and future generations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the  AFS prohibits three types of subsidies, the first  is  the  IUU fishing  – 
<br/>Article  3.  When  a  coastal  State  such  as  Fiji  or  Regional  Fisheries  Management  Organisation  or 
<br/>arrangement such as the Western and Central Fisheries Commission fight vessels guilty of IUU, this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>article will require the subsidizing members to temporarily withdraw the subsidy from the vessel or 
<br/>operator.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second type is the fishing of overfished stocks under Article 4. The Article prohibits all 
<br/>subsidies for fishing and fishing-related activities in the fishing zones recognises overfished. This is 
<br/>until measures are implemented to review the relevant fish stock. Overfish stock means a population 
<br/>of fish that is too low and cannot support a large amount of fishing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The prohibition of granting or maintaining subsidies applies equally to domestic and foreign 
<br/>vessels fishing and overfish stock.  It will also apply in all fisheries within Fiji’s Exclusive Economic 
<br/>Zone (EEZ) including small local fisheries, provide the area is deemed overfish.  It is important to 
<br/>note that the Pacific has well-managed fish stock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third type of subsidy is fishing in high regulated high seas (Article 5).  
<br/>This article prohibits subsidies for unregulated fishing and fishing-related activities on the high seas 
<br/>which are not under the jurisdiction of any coastal nation.  This is fishing outside of the EEZ and 
<br/>outside the competence of any Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RMFO) such as the 
<br/>Western  and  Central  Pacific  Fisheries  Commission.    The  implementation  of  Articles  3  to  5  may 
<br/>require small legislative changes and modification of some existing subsidies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The establishment of the WTO Fisheries Funding Mechanism under Article 7 is an initiative 
<br/>that was announced at the conclusion of the agreement on fisheries subsidies offer some support to 
<br/>WTO members’ efforts in implementing the Economic Framework Supply (EFS).  More importantly, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  members  have  a  broad  set  of  notification  and  transparency  requirements  under 
<br/>Article  8.    The  WTO  recognises  that  the  implementation  of  the  partial  agreement  including  its 
<br/>notification will post challenges for some developing countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Article 9 of the EFS contains provision that established a permanent committee on fisheries 
<br/>subsidies  of  the  WTO  and  will  oversee  the  overall  implementation  of  the  agreement.    Article  10 
<br/>further outlines that the EFS is subject to dispute settlement provisions of the WTO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Article  12  contains  the  termination  clause  for  the  agreement.    The  EFS  will 
<br/>become null and void after entering into force if no progress is made in the second wave negotiations 
<br/>within four years.  What is the way forward for Fiji?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the EFS only partially delivers the mandate of SDG 14.6, that is, prohibit 
<br/>certain  forms  of  fisheries  subsidies  and  MC12.   It  will  nevertheless  have  a  positive  effect  on  the 
<br/>sustainability of marine fish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years,  Fiji  has  been  a  strong  advocate  for  international  disciplines  on  fisheries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subsidies in multiple international forum.  The primary reasons for these position are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure that Fiji Fisheries Resources are sustainably fished and protect the oceans and its 
<br/>resources for future generations in the Pacific; 
<br/>Fiji will be able to develop a domestic fishing industry rather than giving licence to foreign 
<br/></span><span>vessels to operate in our waters; 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  and  the  Pacific  have  not  been  able  to  compete  with  operators  that  receive  massive 
<br/>subsidies from their home countries; and finally 
<br/>Fiji will be able to get a better price of fish in the export market whilst the subsidies are 
<br/>removed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the price of fish in export market is suppressed because of global subsidised fishing

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji played a pivotal role in steering the WTO members to reach agreement 
<br/>in June 2023 by galvanising the support not only from the Pacific but also leading the ACP bloc.  
<br/>Following the success of MC12, the WTO Secretariat members have pursued two separate but related 
<br/>workstreams.  The first workstream relates to entry into force and implementation of the new partial 
<br/>agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the partial agreement to enter into force, two-thirds of the members must complete their 
<br/>internal processes such as ratification and deposit the  Instruments of Acceptance with WTO.  On 
<br/>entry into force, all WTO members  who have ratified EFS will be under legal obligation to limit 
<br/>certain subsidies for fishing activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023, 14 members have ratified.  The majority of the distant water fishing 
<br/>nations and bigger subsidisers of fishing activity have ratified.  These include Belize, Canada, China, 
<br/>European  Union,  Gabon,  Iceland,  Japan,  Nigeria,  Seychelles,  Singapore,  United  Arab  Emirates, 
<br/>Ukraine and the United States.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second workstream relates to the second wave of negotiations to which members agree 
<br/>to commence at the time the partial agreement was concluded. It was agreed that if partial agreements 
<br/>entered into force, the negotiations or the comprehensive agreement must be completed within four 
<br/>years.  The  WTO  Secretariat  and  members  have  the  aim  to  conclude  that  the  second  wave  of 
<br/>negotiation by the 13th Ministerial Conference which will be held in February of next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communication has obtained Cabinet endorsement for the tabling of the WTO AFS when Parliament 
<br/>is  in  session.  The  Ministry  will  continue  to  undertake  a  multi-sectoral  approach  in  the  follow  up 
<br/>negotiation of the second wave and the implementation of the AFS.  Even this, Mr. Speaker Sir, it is 
<br/>recommended  that  Fiji  Parliament  agree  to  the  ratification  of  the  WTO  AFS  and  the  deposit  of 
<br/>Instrument of Acceptance to WTO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  offer  the  floor  since  it  is  now  open  for 
<br/>debate on the motion, I would like to inform this august Parliament that I have a list here and for the 
<br/>Government side, we have the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  while  speakers  form  the 
<br/>Opposition are honourable Koroilavesau and honourable Koya. So, we shall begin as usual with the 
<br/>Opposition.  Therefore, I offer the floor to honourable Koroilavesau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief in my contribution but 
<br/>at the outset, I would ask all Members of Parliament to support this motion. This is quite significant 
<br/>and very important for Fiji, in its role as the leading Pacific Island nation that all the Pacific Islands 
<br/>look towards to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you would remember, Mr. Speaker Sir, Fiji led the negotiation with the United States last 
<br/></span><span>year on the US Tuna Treaty.   Fiji was able to negotiate the term of the funds that the US will give to 
<br/></span><span>the Pacific from $21 million to $60 million in a year. Also, we were able to achieve $600 million for 
<br/>the next  10 years  and this  was  seen as  Fiji’s leading  role to  master a strategy and negotiate with 
<br/>international communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, this motion is very delicate and very important for the Pacific, not only for 
<br/>Fiji but if you look at other Pacific Island nations who are very tiny coral islands lying in the middle 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the ocean, their dependence on tuna and fisheries is huge. If you look at Tuvalu, their fisheries 
<br/>accommodate about 80 percent of the whole annual budget. If you look at Kiribati, about 80 percent 
<br/>of the annual budget is derived from fisheries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For far too long, overseas companies all over the world have come to the Pacific and taken 
<br/>all the fish that belong to our nations without carrying out the normal process of giving them a fair 
<br/>return. The Treaty basically is a lifeline for smaller islands. Fiji is not very critical because it has 
<br/>other avenues it collects its revenue from and provides budget supplementary for its budget year. But 
<br/>for other island nations who look towards Fiji to be the mentor and the leader in spearheading the 
<br/>issues that are important to the island nations, I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to support 
<br/>the  motion.  The  technical  aspects,  I  think  the  honourable  Attorney-General  has  highlighted  the 
<br/>details.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Koya will contribute towards the negotiations he led at the WTO during his term 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when we negotiated the terms and conditions of this Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, before I take this opportunity to contribute to the motion 
<br/>before Parliament, I would like to thank my predecessor for his hard work in taking the Ministry of 
<br/>Fisheries to a level before I took Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to contribute to the motion that is before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this august Chamber and I wish to extend my sincere gratitude. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Minister, could you just clarify that sentence that you have just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said, you just began taking office this afternoon?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Sorry, Sir, yes, before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. SPEAKER.-  I am sorry to be raising these kinds of issues because I will take every word 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that comes from you.  Carry on now, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Sir, I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>the Permanent Secretary for Trade and Senior Government Officials who have been involved in the 
<br/>ongoing negotiations in this space.  The current negotiation on this is vital for further developing our 
<br/>nation’s fisheries and ensuring sustainable practices are upheld.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make the Ministry’s position clear, that it does not encourage 
<br/>distant water fishing nations that are heavily subsidised and provide heavy presence fish stocks in 
<br/>the  areas  beyond  the  national  jurisdiction.  Distant  water  fishing  nations  are  those  engaged  in 
<br/>overfishing, crowding out the market and as such, there is a drop in the market prices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry seeks the consideration of the following in the second wave 
<br/>of negotiations.  A Small Island Developing State with development aspirations, our domestic fleet 
<br/>that  are  flagged  in  Fiji  and  fishing  in  our  EEZ  should  be  allowed  to  fish  in  the BBNJ  high  seas, 
<br/>provided we set precursor measures and practice, such as implementing a licence cap and limit on 
<br/></span><span>the total boats deployed.  This removes the notion that we are a country that have first flown our flags 
<br/></span><span>of convince.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  domestic  fleet  is  challenged  with  high  operational  costs  and  more  importantly,  aged 
<br/>vessels,  which  is  limiting  them  from  accessing  fish  in  high  seas.    It  is,  therefore,  crucial  that 
<br/>Parliament supports the ensuing finance facilities, subsidised at national level are provided to cushion 
<br/>this cost.  As we are progressing in meeting our development aspirations in small island developing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1727 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>States concept in the Pacific, it is different from what is adopted in the Caribbean and others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry  recognises  the  need  to  stand  together  during  the 
<br/>negotiation process, but our desire must always be centred on developing our domestic fleet, noting 
<br/>there is only a small number of fleet and the national sourcing of subsidies is the variance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry will continue to render its support to 
<br/>the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Micro Enterprises and Communications for the 
<br/>remaining negotiation. We, therefore, fully support the motion but for the ratification process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to provide some input on the motion at hand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, what everyone in Parliament must realise is how important 
<br/>this is to Fiji.  As has been mentioned earlier on that in the history of the Word Trade Organization 
<br/>(WTO) and I think its inception was in 1995, this is only a second occasion in which agreement has 
<br/>been reached.   This is after day and night negotiations and so many things have happened over so 
<br/>many  ministerial  conferences,  it  was  virtually  destined  for  the  dustheap  again.    We  have  been  at 
<br/>loggerheads for many years to try and get this done, but we got it done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What to me, Sir, as a Fijian is an extremely proud moment is that these negotiations and this 
<br/>Agreement  at  the  forefront  of  it  was  led  by  Fiji  and  we  managed  to  convince  some  of  the  other 
<br/>developing nations to do it. This is why it has actually been done in twofold.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular Agreement and I think it is good to hear it - the rest of Fiji, it will prohibit the 
<br/>subsidies that are given by the larger nations and those subsidies basically enables Illegal, Unreported 
<br/>and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, fishing of overhead stocks and fishing of unmanaged stocks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just to put it into perspective, developed countries are actually paying about $22 
<br/>billion  a  year  on  subsidies  that  actually  drive  this  overfishing.    Please,  remember  something  we 
<br/>actually spoke about before - we control some of the largest oceans, but  we have always had the 
<br/>smallest voice. But we use that at the negotiations to say, “no more, it is not going to happen, we 
<br/>must have a say”.  We led a delegation, and we were asked to lead the talks in the Green Room on 
<br/>behalf of the Africans, the Caribbeans and us, as a Pacific, and we, as a nation, won this over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  subsidies  primarily  go  towards  industrial  fishing  fleets  that  larger 
<br/>nations have, and it artificially lowers the fuel and other costs of these fleets to enable them to catch 
<br/>more fish further out to sea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  if  these  subsidies  are  not  disciplined,  they  will  obviously  contribute  to  this 
<br/>overfishing, and it is a huge problem including IUU fishing in our waters.   Because we played such 
<br/>a pivotal role in this WTO to get this particular Agreement, we made sure that there was a hook left 
<br/>in, Sir, and there are two things that must happen.  First of all, for this partial Agreement to enter into 
<br/>force, two-thirds of the members of the WTO must complete their internal processes, exactly what 
<br/>we are doing now.  They must complete their internal processes, such as ratification. That is why it 
<br/>is imperative that we do it, this is about Fiji, Sir, and then we must deposit it into the Instrument of 
<br/></span><span>Acceptance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On the entry into force of that particular Agreement, Sir, of which 41 members have actually 
<br/>ratified already, the other part kicks in - the clock starts ticking because we put a proviso in there.  
<br/>Remember this, Sir, we were being bullied by some of the larger nations.  We put a clock in there 
<br/>that says the minute this thing is ratified, you have got the one-third, you have got four years within 
<br/>which to complete the rest of the Agreement, otherwise everything falls apart.  That was the only

<div><span>Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way we could actually get them to agree. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is a positive stand.  As I have said, this is only the second time since the 
<br/>founding  of  WTO  in  1995  that  they  have  managed  to  come  to  some  agreement.  Fiji’s  fishing 
<br/>resources are sustainably fished, that is what we were after, so that the oceans and our resources are 
<br/>there for our future generations.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also, Mr. Speaker, be able to get a better price for our fish in the export market once 
<br/>the subsidies have been removed.  Currently, the price with respect to fish in the export market is 
<br/>suppressed because of global subsidised fishing activities.  This particular Agreement prohibits three 
<br/>things: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>IUU fishing; 
<br/>fishing of overfished stocks; and  
<br/>fishing on unregulated high seas.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of negotiations have gone on and there has been tremendous  amount of negotiations 
<br/>with the Ministry of Fisheries and our former Minister actually knows that too.  A lot of hard work 
<br/>has gone into that and we have a fantastic team at both Ministries that we should take our hats off to 
<br/>for having done such a wonderful job.  Those civil servants worked day and night to get this done 
<br/>without any sleep or any food, might I add, to continue and finish those negotiations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, briefly again, there are no financial implications on this particular Treaty 
<br/>but, on the good side of it, we will get targeted assistance for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and 
<br/>also  for  developing  nations  in  implementing  the  disciplines  under  the  Agreement.    We  do  get 
<br/>assistance for it.  There is actually a WTO fisheries funding mechanism which will exist, and this 
<br/>was announced at the conclusion of the Agreement initially.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The way forward, Mr. Speaker, as mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General is that we 
<br/>must do this as quickly as possible because we only have four years to negotiate.  I am not sure if all 
<br/>of  you  know  this,  but  the  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises  and  Communications  will  know  that  trade  negotiators  take  a  long  time  to  get  any 
<br/>agreement done.  So, four years also, we purposefully put that four years in so that the bigger nations 
<br/>could not drag it along.  Those that are giving subsidies could not drag it along for the next 20 years.  
<br/>It is very important that we start and get the clock ticking already on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been very strongly involved in it, as a matter of fact, we have led the Pacific on it.  
<br/></span><span>Pacific  Island  Countries  are  completely  in  support  of  what  we  have  done,  they  appreciate  all  the 
<br/>assistance given by Fiji and the Pacific Island Forum also, with all of these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from what I understand also from honourable Minister, the intention is to 
<br/>deposit this particular Acceptance in October 2023, again, this is another reason why we are in total 
<br/>agreement with getting it done as quickly as possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I say, please, to all the honourable Members, this is something very historical 
<br/></span><span>for Fiji, it has never been done and I very proudly say this, that we were right in the leadership triangle 
<br/></span><span>with respect to getting this done at the helm of it and it is important that we complete it because I can 
<br/>tell you right now and I am sure the honourable Minister will tell you, Fiji’s name at the WTO stands 
<br/>tall because of all of these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am going to be very brief.  I know the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members on the other side have contributed very well in terms of laying out the reasons 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1729 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>behind the urgency for this Treaty to be ratified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my previous roles as the Professor of Economics and Advisor to trade negotiators in the 
<br/>Pacific, I have attended many long hours of WTO Ministerial Meetings, and the two most contentious 
<br/>issues on the table most of the time were fisheries subsidies and agricultural subsidies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Friends of Fish (FoFs), a group of countries which included Argentina, Australia, New 
<br/>Zealand, Chile, Columbia, Iceland, Ecuador, Norway, Pakistan and USA, there have had these very 
<br/>strong arguments about the harmful impacts of subsidies on issues such as overfishing and depletion 
<br/>of fish stocks.  Overfishing now leads to other negative externalities such as disruption in biodiversity 
<br/>and food chains.  There  are issues about  economic efficiency, how large  countries and those with 
<br/>large shipping fleets and better economies of scale were able to benefit more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Koroilavesau said, it is absolutely important for Fiji and the Pacific, especially 
<br/>small island countries which rely on fisheries revenue, tuna revenue but also for countries like Fiji, 
<br/>our  emphasis on small scale fisheries operators, particularly coastal fisheries and the need to protect 
<br/>our  fisheries  stock  is  always  at  the  back  of  our  minds  and  those  who  are  concerned  about 
<br/>sustainability  of these resources over a longer period of time - the Concept  of Global  Commons, 
<br/>when we talk about fisheries subsidies because it sort of transcends beyond a particular region and a 
<br/>country. So, what happens in one part of the ocean or world can have an impact on other regions as 
<br/>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me just say that this is not a complete removal of subsidies generally, I think 
<br/>it is a partial agreement.  As honourable Koya said, it goes a long way.  In in fact, it is historical - 
<br/>that there is some agreement for a long time, it looks like there was never going to be an agreement 
<br/>on removing these subsidies, like the agriculture subsidy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, once this is ratified, again, it is a long process.  We require two-thirds of the 
<br/>countries around the world to actually ratify this before it comes into effect. So, it is a long way and 
<br/>I think for Fiji, as has been said very clearly, it is very important that we, as a country, ratify this.  
<br/>Parliament and the bipartisan support that  we  are giving to this Treaty is  significant because it is 
<br/>going to send a very, very clear message not only to the world, not only to WTO members, but also 
<br/>to our Pacific neighbours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  as  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  honourable  Koya  said,  when  you  are 
<br/>looking at US$22 billion in subsidies, those subsidies are actually used or they lead to illegal fishing, 
<br/>overfishing and depletion of stocks, which is very significant.  It is not a small amount in the bigger 
<br/>scheme of things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are doing this, it is important for us, as a Government and as a 
<br/>Parliament, to look at our own national fisheries policies and regulations.  I think it is an opportunity 
<br/>for us, as a country, to re-look at that and see where we are in terms of our coastal fisheries, the way 
<br/>in which coastal fisheries are exploited, whether we are getting the appropriate returns and how we 
<br/>can deal with it.  These are important discussions that one or two have, going forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as has been said, this is very important, and I lend my full support to the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the contributors to the debate on 
<br/>the motion in front of us, which is the ratification of  the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin, let me also thank you for your kind words when we began this afternoon.  If 
<br/>you will recall in my Maiden Speech, I had specifically asked for the wisdom of Solomon in this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>1730 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>august Parliament and perhaps, the wisdom of Solomon is starting to move around in this Chamber 
<br/>in a big way, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the debate today or the motion in front of us in terms of the subsidies, I think we 
<br/>should give credit where credit is due and I would like, on behalf of this side of Parliament, to thank 
<br/>in particularly my predecessor to this post, the honourable Koya, and also honourable Koroilavesau 
<br/>for the tremendous work they did in Geneva last year in bringing about the historic Agreement.  On 
<br/>behalf  of  this  side  of  the  Chamber,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  their  hard  work  and  also  the 
<br/>Government in actually bringing this forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I went to Geneva this year and worked out that we had to ratify WTO 
<br/>Instrument very quickly, as soon as I came back, I called the honourable Koya and said, “Hey, we 
<br/>need to get this sorted, can we do it on a bipartisan basis?”  And so here we are, Sir, in this august 
<br/>Parliament,  together  as  a  people  who  are  concerned  about  this  country,  ratifying  this  historic 
<br/>Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will try and be brief, Sir, because I think honourable Koya has covered most of the pertinent 
<br/>issues to do with the Agreement but as we all agree, fisheries is something that permeates not only 
<br/>the Fiji society but the Pacific as a region.  It is intertwined with our culture, our day to day living, 
<br/>our livelihood and our survival. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific, the Western and Central Pacific, accounts for more than half of the tuna stocks 
<br/>harvested in the world.  Approximately, 60 percent of the stock is harvested from the EEZ of the 
<br/>Pacific countries.  As custodians of the vast ocean, it is our job to ensure that we maintain the long-
<br/>term sustainability of our resources, food security and the livelihoods of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  has  been  a  strong  advocate  for  international  disciplines  on  fisheries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subsidies in the multiple international fora.  The primary reasons for this position are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> to ensure that Fiji’s fisheries resources are sustainably fished and protect the oceans and its 
<br/>resources, as the honourable Koya said, for future generations in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji will be able to develop a domestic fishing industry, correctly alluded to by honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rather than giving licences to foreign vessels to operate in our waters, Fiji and the Pacific 
<br/></span><span>have not been able to compete with the operators that are subsidised by their countries to 
<br/></span><span>operate at low operating costs in our waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji will be able to get a better price for fish in the export market once the subsidies are 
<br/>removed.  Currently, the price of fish in export markets is suppressed because of the global 
<br/>subsidised fishing activity.  In this regard, we need multilateral rules to support regional 
<br/>fisheries management efforts and contribute to the 2050 strategy for the Blue Continent 
<br/>which has been endorsed by the Pacific Leaders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement agreed to at the 12</span><span>th</span><span> WTO Ministerial 
<br/>Conference or as we would like to call it MC12 as part of the Ministerial Outcomes was a historic 
<br/>achievement after 20 years of all talk and no agreement.  It was an Agreement that Fiji had a major 
<br/>influence in, in delivering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  current  Agreement  focuses  on  two  disciplines,  that  is,  subsidies  to  IUU  Fishing  and 
<br/>subsidies to overfished stock.  It does not limit, at this stage, subsidies that contribute to overcapacity
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1731 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and overfishing and does not provide special and differential treatment for developing countries such 
<br/>as  Fiji.    That  is  the  purpose  of  the  second  wave  of  this  Agreement  that  has  been  mentioned  by 
<br/>honourable  Koya.    We  also  have  within  the  Agreement  a  water-tight  mandate  to  negotiate  a 
<br/>comprehensive agreement or else the whole Agreement terminates in four years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijis  ratification,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  demonstrate  a  strong  commitment  to  the  WTO 
<br/>membership  and  would  provide  the  best  pathway  of  leveraging  the  negotiations  on  delivery, 
<br/>comprehensive disciplines on subsidies, contributing to overfishing and overcapacity in the manner 
<br/>that meets the UN Sustainable Goals 14.6 or SDG 14.6. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that I personally support the motion before us in this 
<br/>august Parliament and this is truly a historic day for our country.  We should all remember this day 
<br/>in the history of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I, at this juncture, because of the commitment, 
<br/>dedication  and  passion  of  those  who  bid  for  us,  acknowledge  honourable  Koya,  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau and, of course, the previous Government.  It is, indeed, a historic day for Fiji and for 
<br/>the Pacific Region and, I, therefore, endorse the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
