<h3>DRAINAGE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>DRAINAGE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 22/2023), be debated and voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Drainage 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill  2023 which was tabled in  Parliament  on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.  The 
<br/>Drainage Act 1961 was enacted and provides for the execution of the drainage work amongst other 
<br/>things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Act  is  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  which  was  established  in  2017  to 
<br/>address the threats of flooding to Fijian communities.  In 2018, the Act was amended to allow the 
<br/>Ministry to assume the responsibility of drainage systems and functions of Drainage Board under the 
<br/>Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regrettably, adequate consultation and planning had not been undertaken prior to the removal 
<br/>of the Drainage Boards.  This morning Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Agriculture spoke at length 
<br/>on the need for drainage board and this has also been discussed in previous discussions.  There has 
<br/>been  noticeable  decline  in  the  overall  production  of  sugar  cane  as  well  as  non-sugar  cane 
<br/>commodities produced from the drainage scheme areas attributed to the transfer of responsibilities 
<br/>of drainage systems to the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  does  not  make  sense,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  this  responsibility  is  vested  with  an 
<br/>independent body of individuals in the specific divisions.  Four divisions in Fiji than we amend that 
<br/>to be directed by the Ministry which is based in Suva. It is anticipated that the re-establishment of 
<br/>the Drainage Boards will improve the service and maintenance of the drainage scheme areas whilst 
<br/>contributing towards the increase in the production of sugar and of course non-sugar commodities 
<br/>produced in these areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Drainage  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  accordingly  seeks  to  amend  the  Act  to  revert  the 
<br/></span><span>responsibility of drainage systems to the Drainage Boards.  The Bill is urgent for the government, 
<br/>given that the Ministry of Waterways has put in place plans for the financial year, for the Drainage 
<br/>Boards to undertake this responsibility and shift the burden from the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  has  been  widespread  consultation  with  the  Office  of  Solicitor  General,  Ministry  of 
<br/>Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and statistics, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1871 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resources,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Municipal  councils,  Ministry  of  Sugar  and  the 
<br/>Sugarcane Growers Council.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have outlined in detail the 30 provisions of the Bill, 
<br/>and I cordially commend this Bill to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Mr. Speaker.- honourable members the floor is now open for debate on the 
<br/>motion.    Just  before  I  offer  the  floor,  three  speakers  that  have  been  identified  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Whips. The debate will be led by honourable Maharaj and then should be followed by honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau and later on by honourable Tunabuna.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  Mr. Speaker, we supported the second motion  that came to  this 
<br/>floor but then we were asked to repent on our decisions to support the motion. So unfortunately, after 
<br/>repenting for a while I need to tell the government a little bit of background on how the Ministry of 
<br/>Waterways  came  into  the  picture  and  why  the  Fiji  First  government  back  then,  had  to  repeal  the 
<br/>Drainage Act of 1961.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  2017  a  new  Ministry  of  Waterways  was  formed  and  was  responsible  for 
<br/>dredging Waterways, realigning drainage system, managing river banks, mitigating floodings and 
<br/>managing  storms  and  rain  water.  The  new  Ministry  was  responsible  for  co-ordinating  smart 
<br/>agriculture irrigation system as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of our waterways flood frequently, not just the river mouth but up-stream and beyond.  
<br/>This flooding reaches towns and makes roads and our highways impassable.  We see floods as an act 
<br/>of God but often they are direct results of human activity and human negligence.  Heavy silting is a 
<br/>result of decades of neglect, illegal development, land degradation and changed weather patterns. 
<br/>And  we  are  experiencing  heavy  flooding  because  these  waterways  have  not  been  dredged  or 
<br/>maintained for years. The Land and Water Resource Management Division within the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture was transferred to a new Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was done back than to go away from the bureaucratic process imposed by the Drainage 
<br/>Board.  Government back then allocated $24.2 million in the budget for functioning of the Ministry 
<br/>and the Green Climate Fund was providing funds as well.  However, Mr. Speaker, we needed more 
<br/>than funding to fix our waterways.  We also needed technical expertise and in this context, there were 
<br/>discussions with Global Green Growth Institute.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this Ministry government tackled head-on, issues of flooding in Nadi. Nadi is Fiji’s 
<br/>gateway to the world and the fastest growing urban centre. After a framework was developed by the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways, the Japanese Government committed $385 million to fix the flooding issues 
<br/>in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, furthermore, the repealed Drainage Act in1961 provided for the declaration of 
<br/>drainage areas authorised in the execution of drain works and provided for the establishment of the 
<br/>Drainage Board for the maintenance and improvement of certain drainage areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017, the Ministry of Waterways was established by the Fijian Government to address the 
<br/>growing threat that flooding posed to Fijian communities – a threat that is projected to worsen as a 
<br/></span><span>result of the effects of climate change and of course, to have a holistic approach to water management 
<br/></span><span>issues in Fiji.   Mr. Speaker, since its establishment the responsibility of maintenance and drainage 
<br/>system and management of waterways has been handled by Ministry of Waterways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry and the Drainage Board shared the same function of maintaining 
<br/>the drainage system. The Drainage (Budget Amendment) Bill 2023 amended the Act to facilitate the 
<br/>transfer  of  the  roles  of  Drainage  Board  to  the  Ministry.    What  it  did  was,  essentially  all  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>1872 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibilities of the Drainage Board went to Ministry of Waterways and Environment.  The Bill 
<br/>was actually quite explicit in the responsibilities that actually got transferred across the ministries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Furthermore, the Drainage Board through the experience lacked expertise.  It was confined 
<br/>to drains only, hence the reason we actually developed a Ministry of Waterways so that not just drains 
<br/>but other aspects of water and drains were also captured.  I will give a common example.  If you look 
<br/>at USA in the State of California, there is North California and there is South California. There is 
<br/>very low amount of rain in South California. What the Californian State Government has done is to 
<br/>capture any rainfall that goes into the sea.  It only goes if it is allowed by the State Government. 
<br/>Otherwise, they have catchments to capture the rainfall.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, as I said the Drainage Board did not actually have the expertise and looking 
<br/>at Fiji, with the amount of rainfall that we have, it is still a very bad scenario for us that we still have 
<br/>issues around Fiji whereby people they do not have clean drinking water.  It was a holistic approach 
<br/>back then not just look after the drain but to actually come up with the Ministry which can look after 
<br/>all these aspects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  fact  we  upgraded  the  Board  to  a  Ministry.    There  was  not  any  Ministry 
<br/>previously for Waterways, it was just a Board because expertise was lacking in the Drainage Board 
<br/>and that is why we came up with the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Clean water? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- So that expertise can come and help the Ministry of Waterways to 
<br/>see what the problem is?  That does not mean, Mr. Speaker, if it come up with an institute we need 
<br/>to give it time. If it is not working we need to look at the mechanism, it does not mean we dismantle 
<br/>the institute itself.  That is what the current Government is doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Ministry is still there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Listen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What is the use of being a Board when it will have the same ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- ... function as to what the Ministry is doing. It does not make sense, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.  The issue is, these people want to start operating where from where they left back in 
<br/>1997 or 1998... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We are looking at the modern world, we are looking at the modern 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nation, Mr. Speaker, we are looking at modern ways of doing things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Blocked drains. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- ...that is how we want things to be done.  However, Mr. Speaker... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- We received complaints everywhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Dismantling all the institute will not help, Mr. Speaker. What kind 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1873 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of urgency is there to bring this Bill under Standing Order 51?  It can be sent to the Committee for 
<br/>further consultation and be brought back to Parliament... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- To the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, what was happening when the Drainage Board was 
<br/>there it was full of corruption, nepotism and favouritism. Drain was done without a mouth to the 
<br/>drain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- On both sides there used to be a dead end. If I am in the Drainage 
<br/>Board if you go to places and you talk to farmers the people who are actually sitting in the Board 
<br/>they were the ones they were the farms... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Drainage what kind of Board? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.A.A. MAHARAJ.- Drains used to be done first, Mr. Speaker,. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Speak to the farmers... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- ...that is why we actually had to go away from the Drainage Board.  
<br/>We brought a consolidated team together, form the Ministry with the Permanent Secretary to ensure 
<br/>that this system does operate, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we do not see there is a reason that we need a Drainage Board back, all we need 
<br/>to do if the mechanism is not working to improve the mechanism, so that farmers and all those people 
<br/>who are affected by floods are helped.   With that contribution, Mr. Speaker, I do not support the 
<br/>motion    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I rise to contribute to the motion, to amend the Drainage Act 
<br/>1961.  What  the  Honourable  Members  has  mentioned  is  not  really  the  purpose  of  this  Bill.    It  is 
<br/>basically to rejuvenate the Drainage Board, in addition to the functions of Waterways - it is not really 
<br/>replacing one for the other. It is basically to enhance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thought at the beginning you said you were supporting the Bill.  If you look at the provisions 
<br/>of the Bill, it is very clear.  There are some critical elements of the Bill, for example, if you look at 
<br/>3(2)(a) on survey, that is very important in terms of baseline data.   I mentioned earlier that baseline 
<br/>data is always critical in planning, as alluded to by our former Ministers.  That is something we will 
<br/>continue to improve on. Not only that but when we are looking at this, we are also looking at the 
<br/>ecologically vulnerable areas, taking into account climate change so that is important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What drainage measures are desirable?  That again, is a critical area. and there are elements 
<br/>of compensation there.  In my province the contractors just came and dug up everything including 
<br/>the mangroves, the plantations and everything, so that is an example of what we are talking about.  
<br/></span><span>In some cases, there has not been proper supervision in some cases of the work done in Waterways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Rewa, some of the work which was done resulted in river blockage. For example, there is 
<br/>the  Naqio  River  towards  the  bank  of  the  Rewa  River.  They  buried  it  and  replaced  it  with  small 
<br/>culverts, so that resulted in worse flooding that is just an example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one is near Waivou Village - the work resulted in more flooding in that village, so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>1874 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people are questioning the work of waterways - is it resulting in improvement or deterioration.  So 
<br/>that is why it is very important to bring it back to complement the Waterways, not only that but in 
<br/>some areas such as Rewa, Tailevu South if you look at the roads, some of the roads there have been 
<br/>affected by the raising seawater or climate change, but it has been made worse by the neglect of the 
<br/>drains near those roads the irrigation and all that. I refer in particular year to Cautata, Nadali and 
<br/>Dreketi in Rewa.  Again, this would be really specific - it is not general Ministry-wide but specific 
<br/>areas which the Drainage Board will be focused on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You mentioned that the Board was plagued by corruption – where is the evidence, you do not 
<br/>have any evidence.  You cannot just make general accusations my friend.  The Board needs to include 
<br/>those at the ground level like the </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> who know the waterways, drains and the movement 
<br/>of the tides, etc.  I saw some of the works the result is just the total opposite.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at clause 7 on drainage funds, that again is very important – you have to do the 
<br/>assessment, survey plan, consult scope, implementation plan, programming and budgeting.  That is 
<br/>what this is about, which is very critical in moving forward so that there is a systematic rational plan 
<br/>to do the work.  Right now, it is a very urgent issue because there is a lot of blocked drains there, 
<br/>Bro, if you come, I will show you.  If you look at the explanatory note, regrettably, let me quote that: 
<br/>“Adequate consultation and planning had not been undertaken.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Did you say, Bro? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sorry, I did not mean to insult anyone.  Honourable Maharaj, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my apologies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, there is a need, as explained, you have mentioned Green Government Fund, yes, that 
<br/>is an area where we need to utilise opportunities for climate financing, incorporating lowlands, rivers, 
<br/>climate resilient infrastructure, and as I have mentioned, blocked drains and poor roads, it has impacts 
<br/>the roads.  We all need to work together in close collaboration with the PM’s Climate Change Office, 
<br/>Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture and Public Works Department in planning that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of my comments and I commend the Bill to Parliament and thank the other 
<br/>side for the support.  I have to admit something, today, there is a change in the whole atmosphere of 
<br/>this environment in Parliament.  I know a lot of us know that and I acknowledge that.  Some of us 
<br/>were in the last Parliament. Honourable Veena Bhatnagar was in our Committee and she asked me, 
<br/>“Why you always oppose everything, even the good things?”  I told her, “No, I just oppose for the 
<br/>sake of opposing because I am in the Opposition.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thanks for saying that publicly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Wait, I have not finished.  But that was the reaction, I suppose 
<br/></span><span>the dialogue from this side. It was negative and negative reaction, but now, it is positive and you 
<br/></span><span>people are responding positively, and I am so happy about that.  Sorry, I called you Bro, because of 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So we look forward to further dialogue and working together.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, very much for some of the Bills that you have supported, and I believe that we have a 
<br/>very positive future for Parliament going forward, even though we will be wining the next Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to honourable Tunabuna, I 
<br/>would like to acknowledge at this time those who are in the gallery - a gentleman by the name of Mr. 
<br/>Rami Sherman, who is a retired Israeli Defence Officer who took part in the rescue mission of the 
<br/>hostages  at  a  terminal  in  Uganda,  sitting  there  with  Ana  Rokomokoti,  who  is  a  lawyer  and  her 
<br/>husband and others, especially Tarai from Sydney.   Thank you so much for listening to the debate 
<br/>in Parliament and for your presence here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to honourable Tunabuna, our lone ranger sitting on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  before 
<br/>Parliament this afternoon on the Drainage (Amendment) Act.  The part that I am going to speak on 
<br/>is on the establishment of the Drainage Board.  Before I proceed, I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture for the Ministerial Statement given this morning, which had covered a lot 
<br/>of technical areas of the work that is done in the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways.  That also 
<br/>covered the part that I wanted to contribute to in today’s session.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also  wish to  thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition  for the support given to  the 
<br/>Statement that was given this morning by the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  I will be very 
<br/>short and brief and also will only focus on the experiences that I faced when I served at the Ministry 
<br/>of  Agriculture  for  close  to  35  years  as  a  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  I  have  had  a  lot  of 
<br/>experience not only in the livestock sector, but we had close collaboration with the Land and Water 
<br/>Resources  Management  (LAWRM)  Division  which  was  then  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Waterways. I thank honourable Maharaj for some of the developments that he has mentioned but I 
<br/>believe he can get a fair bit of what had happened at the Ministry of Waterways Office so that we 
<br/>can brief him more on why we had wanted the change that we have in the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  close  to  35  years  that  I  worked  with  the  Ministry,  I  had  a  lot  of 
<br/>experiences with damages that we normally experience in terms of natural disaster.  One in particular, 
<br/>the floods that we have had in the last 30 years.  We assessed a lot of damages and the losses; it was 
<br/>so high that some people had thought of relocated and moved away from agricultural areas.  We had 
<br/>a lot of losses in the agriculture production, both for crops and for livestock and livestock feed. We 
<br/>had a lot of infrastructural damages, roads, waterways which include culverts, floodgates and we also 
<br/>had damages to homes, their belongings, farmhouse and farm sheds and as I mentioned, farmland 
<br/>who are normally badly affected with the floods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  then  we  had  the  Drainage  Board,  now  when  the  Drainage  Board  was  removed 
<br/>unfortunately, we had seen an increase in saltwater intrusion into agricultural lands and this included 
<br/></span><span>lands under sugarcane, lands under rice, those that were used commercially for other root crops and 
<br/></span><span>those that were also used for home consumptions.  We had an increase in water logging condition 
<br/>for low-lying areas, this was not from salt water but from fresh water down from rain side areas due 
<br/>to clogging rains.  We had a lot of risks to losses, and we had an increase in unavailability of lands 
<br/>suitable for agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have a very bad experience when I was in Labasa two and three years back when we had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>1876 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hurricanes when Labasa Town was under water, and this was mainly due to flooding water that could 
<br/>not  go  through  the  bypass  drainage  system  that  we  have  in  Labasa  due  to  non-existence  of  the 
<br/>Drainage Board and the support that is normally given to the Drainage Board.  The same would have 
<br/>happened to few of the towns and cities here in Viti Levu.  Currently, we received a lot of complaints 
<br/>with damages due to increase in high water level due to clogging drains that are not maintained, and 
<br/>they used to be maintained under the Drainage Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill before the Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, affects farming families.  It affects people 
<br/>who live out in the rural and also affect those who live in towns and cities that are situated in flats.  I 
<br/>respect  the  Statement  given  this  morning  and  the  support  given  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  that climate change is  here to  stay. All  we need to  do is  to mitigate the risks that are 
<br/>associated with  climate  change  and as mentioned by the honourable Minister and the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, we need to address sustainable land management systems.  We will need 
<br/>to work together, and we will need to formulate policies that best address our current situation. I, 
<br/>therefore, support the Bill before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I think the gist of the speakers, Mr. Speaker, is basically the cause an 
<br/>effect. The cause when the Drainage Board was taken away and what is the result. And that is being 
<br/>articulated very well by, honourable Tunabuna, from a technical point of view.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>with this respect, honourable Tunabuna started his career in the Ministry of Agriculture and finished 
<br/>off in the Ministry of Agriculture probably more than 30 years. So, he is speaking from experienced 
<br/>likewise from the honourable Minister for Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- And the Pacific too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Very well, Sir, I fail to acknowledge that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The more important point, Mr. Speaker, is the issue of independence. Agriculture is a very 
<br/>big Ministry with a lot of responsibilities. Now the Government thinks that it is best that we vest this 
<br/>authority  to  people  we  are  going  to  empower  but  we  have  expertise  and  also  have  a  good 
<br/>understanding of the localities and they are based throughout the four Divisions of Fiji.  We need to 
<br/>address the issue of flooding in drainage. This Coalition Government has taken aboard listening to 
<br/>our supporters and true to all our promise we have delivered this.  This is not only for our people but 
<br/>for the people of Fiji.  I commend this Bill before Parliament.
