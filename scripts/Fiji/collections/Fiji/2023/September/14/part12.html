<div><span>Clarification on Deferment of Parliamentary Business  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, before we move on to the next Agenda item for today, I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>make a clarification only. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1831 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been some rumblings in the corridors of Government as to the agreement that was 
<br/>reached yesterday, which saw the deferment of the outstanding issues in our Agenda of yesterday to 
<br/>the November Sitting.  However, it seems that the communication that was brought to me yesterday 
<br/>was not probably taken down to the level of the Chairperson of the Standing Committee.  This has 
<br/>nothing to do with the Opposition but more so to do with the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in Parliament may have 
<br/>taken  that  initiative  on  her  own  without  consulting  the  Chairpersons  of  the  two  respective 
<br/>Committees yesterday on the deferment.  In that respect, I apologise to the Chairs of the respective 
<br/>Committees, and hopefully you can iron that out amongst yourselves in Government as to what really 
<br/>is the role of the Leader of the Government in Parliament and that of the Whip.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope this has been well clarified in your attending that attachment to the State Government 
<br/>of Victoria where the Whips were invited to attend so that they can better understand their role.  There 
<br/>are  two  roles  -  one  as  Government  Whip  and  the  other  one  as  Leader  of  the  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament, quite distinct and quite separate.   I hope that clarifies the issue and we shall now move 
<br/>on.
