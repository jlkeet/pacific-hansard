<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- FSC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You should be ashamed of yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  And  they  cannot  stomach  the  fact  that  this  Government  is 
<br/>doing the right thing.  This Government is getting rid of all the stupidity in laws that we saw then.  
<br/>This is just one example, where they removed good laws and replaced them with what I call, “stupid 
<br/></span><span>laws”.  This Government will systematically, one by one, with consultation and dialogue, change the 
<br/></span><span>laws and we will make sure that we do not rule by law.  We follow the rule of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We know the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  do  not  understand  the  difference 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between “rule by law” and “rule of law”.

<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Tell them, tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are enjoying their role in the Opposition because we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following the law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are enjoying the Opposition because we are transparent 
<br/>and capable.   They are enjoying the Opposition because we allow Parliament and we do not dictate 
<br/>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yeah! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the appointment of an independent body such as 
<br/>the Higher Salaries Commission is one example of what we are doing and the people of this country 
<br/>know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, Mr. Speaker.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- That is nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Before I finish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER..- Hey, do not point at the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Before I finish, in fact many of them,  those who were there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the previous Parliament they did not feel free.  They had to crawl. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They had to go like this (illustrates) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- They had to do this. We are different, Mr. Speaker, we have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the freedom. We have the Ministers who are capable, who are able to stand up and say things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Levu na vosa</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, the change of Government has freed them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They have the freedom.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Freedom after them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We can have the debate, we can go and enjoy ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)

<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1899 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He cannot stomach the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Once again, Sir, I rise on Standing Order 74(1)(a).  The man is becoming 
<br/>so irrelevant with his irrelevance that is ridiculous, Mr. Speaker. He has gone beyond his time, now 
<br/>he is attacking us. Let me tell you something there is a difference between discipline and what you 
<br/>are saying. We are a disciplined party, thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let the people judge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I will finish now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- ...I have allowed honourable Members going beyond the time that we have 
<br/>agreed to  and stick by. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister has been given that as well because I 
<br/>provided that allowance to the Opposition as well.  Please continue and if you feel that you can round 
<br/>off … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will finish now. I know honourable Koya 
<br/>cannot stomach the truth. He just gets up, makes an irrelevant Point of Order and then you know the 
<br/>things he is doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sit down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He talked about FijFirst being a disciplined Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- FijiFirst, Mr. Speaker, ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have said this and now that he talked about FijiFirst, let me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tell you - FijiFirst is almost like a Chinese Communist Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I understand you, Standing Order 74 (1)(a) again. We understand you

<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have given a bit of leeway, we give as good as we get but, Sir, ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- But he is really now going overboard and beyond the fact that he should 
<br/>be speaking on what is before him, he has completely forgotten it.  Sir, some decorum, honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- He should resign. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We have had our afternoon session, Sir.  I think, Mr. Speaker has given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us a lot of leeway - ask him to be relevant, please, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you rounding it off, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- Yes I am rounding it off Mr. Speaker, Sir.  If they had some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decorum, if they give me the respect, if they allowed me to speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And f they stopped yelling, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I could have 
<br/>finished earlier but the way they are behaving in a disrespectful manner they deserve that kind of 
<br/>response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- You are Minister now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I understand that but we have to... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reestablishment of the Higher Salaries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Finally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...is the right thing to do and I urge the honourable Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members, as part of their strategy to repent, support this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  I  thank  the  diverse  discussion  and 
<br/>conversation on this topic.  It is very important.  It is sad that honourable Maharaj was able to make 
<br/>some comments into some of the provisions of the Bill, not knowing this is exactly what a replica of 
<br/>the previous Bill, it is nothing new.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in terms of drafting, honourable Usamate commented, it is the same drafting that served 
<br/>your  Party,  and  it  is  the  same  that  they  were  working  on.    There  were  some  comments  on  the 
<br/></span><span>Schedule, why some entities are not scheduled.  It is basic, you do not put Schedule if there is no 
<br/></span><span>confirmed agreement into the existence and formation.  Once that has been done through the formal 
<br/>process of Public Enterprises, then they will be…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Well, as I said, they will be further added to the Schedule. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1901 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Normally, that is why they are listed in the Schedule, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  because the Schedule can be increased.  That is the whole purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  just  want  to  respond  to  honourable  Usamate’s  comment  regarding  the  right  people,  but 
<br/>relativity how do you justify someone who was paid $1 million to work here, it was supposed to be 
<br/>for three years, and before the tenure, they go, then we get another one and another one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Who, who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That is the whole purpose of getting the Higher Salaries Commission.  
<br/>There were some reference made as to the powers of the Minister.  The honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>is the Minister for Public Enterprises and covers Public Service Commission.  So, we have someone 
<br/>who has gone through life, mature enough who is going to look at the setup as to the membership 
<br/>and how Higher Salaries Commission is administered.  It is not someone who has just graduated from 
<br/>high school or college.  It is for a good purpose, it was there, it served the nation well.  Our supporters, 
<br/>the  policy  of  this  Government  to  make  it  right  and  that  is  why  we  are  here.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I 
<br/>commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.

<br/>passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.  (Act No. …. of 2023)]. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that was quite a lively exchange.  I did not want to 
<br/>interrupt nor stop the momentum that was going on, but somewhere or rather you are bound to sit 
<br/>and listen once more.   
<br/></span></div>
