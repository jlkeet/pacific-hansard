<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please take note of the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am allowing honourable Maharaj to ask Oral Question No. 126/2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Oral Question No. 130/2023 for the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection will 
<br/>be  the  last  Oral  Question  to  be  asked  today,  since  she  is  attending  another  Government 
<br/>engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Oral Question No. 131/2023 will be omitted from the Order Paper, given that the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture and Waterways has delivered a Ministerial Statement on the same 
<br/>subject matter.

<div><span>Plans for Resolving Breakdowns at Rarawai Sugar Mill 
<br/>(Question No. 126/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/></span><span>Parliament if there are plans in place, along with a proper timeline, to solve the numerous 
<br/></span><span>breakdowns at the Rarawai Sugar Mill, which is affecting farmers, lorry drivers and national 
<br/>productivity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have an eight-page reply.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Bala for raising his concerns regarding the Rarawai 
<br/>Mill.    Unfortunately,  he  has  not  been  here  yesterday  and  today,  and  I  am  not  sure  whether  he  is 
<br/>seriously questioning me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is not your concern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Frivolous answer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure honourable Bala knows the very answer, it 
<br/>is  more  of  a  heritage  and  an  inherent  issue  that  this  Coalition  Government  has  to  resolve, 
<br/>unfortunately, due to many decades of neglect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rarawai Mill is some 137 years old, older than all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of us here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- We all know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Unfortunately,  this  old  icon  did  not  have  a  comprehensive  or 
<br/>preventative maintenance plan.  All maintenance was more of a responsive one and on a piecemeal 
<br/>basis. Apart from that, the Mill has been hit by a number of natural disasters over the past many 
<br/>years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is no secret, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Mill’s frequent breakdowns are causing significant 
<br/>disruption to our farmers, lorry drivers and ultimately, our national productivity.  I want to state that 
<br/>these issues are not only with Rarawai Mill, the other two Mills as well - Lautoka and Labasa Mills 
<br/>are no exception.  Both are similarly aged. Let me repeat, the issues are longstanding and have not 
<br/>just appeared now since we are in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previous Governments did not take any feasible measures to address these issues effectively 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and here we are with the legacy issues of the past to deal with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- During the prime days of the sugar industry with the preferential price 
<br/>from the European Union, new modern mills should have been built decades ago.  However, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, since we are in Government, we will clean up the mess and build this industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Hear, hear!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- To address some of these issues and ensure uninterrupted operations of 
<br/>the Rarawai Sugar Mill, we are working on a plan that incorporates both, short-term and long-term 
<br/>measures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pressing issue at hand revolves around the two boilers that are dubbed as the heart of the 
<br/>sugar mill. These two boilers were originally installed way back in 1958 and 1976 respectively. Given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1837 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the advanced age of these boilers, they are in urgent need of replacement. Currently, we just cannot 
<br/>push these boilers to their optimum operating capacity but to run well below its intended capacity.  
<br/>As a result, the Mill’s efficiency gets affected and so is its productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our challenges are impaired by the failed Sugar Technology Mission (STM) project, which 
<br/>was aimed at modernising the Rarawai Mill.  The installation of a new cane-carrier equipment as part 
<br/>of this project has created more issues than modernising the increasing and overall efficiency of the 
<br/>Mill.    The  flaw  in  the  design  has  led  to  inconsistent  cane  feeding,  especially  with  the  billet 
<br/>(mechanical harvested cane).  As such, the Mill cannot run to its full potential as the input (raw cane) 
<br/>load has to be limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to promptly address some of these ongoing issues, the FSC is implementing 
<br/>a regular furnace cleaning procedure and maintenance programme. This proactive measure is aimed 
<br/>at  maintaining  stable  boiler  pressure  during  each  shift,  ultimately  reducing  the  frequency  of 
<br/>breakdowns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To reduce the hours of repairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, scheduled work such as fixing air heater, 
<br/>tubing  leaks  and  replacement  of  air  heater  tubes  are  carried  out  during  Mill  cleaning  days.    The 
<br/>complete replacement of air heater tubes is scheduled for the 2024 maintenance season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regrettably, we must anticipate the persistence of some of these issues in 
<br/>the short to medium term. Despite our efforts to implement strategies aimed at reducing breakdowns, 
<br/>it  is  inevitable  to  install  a  new  boiler  to  replace  both  existing  boilers  at  the  Rarawai  Mill.    This 
<br/>decisive need should address ongoing breakdown problems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to understand that a substantial investment is required for the 
<br/>success of this project. We cannot ignore the fact that all these three Mills are more than 100 years 
<br/>old,  highlighting  the  pressing  need  for  the  modernisation  and  upgrading  of  the  century-old 
<br/>technology  to  improve  performance,  increase  the  production  rate  and  energy  efficiency.  
<br/>Additionally, we intend to have more environmentally friendly systems and processes in the Mills to 
<br/>reduce our carbon footprint as well.  Moreover,  Sir, FSC is actively exploring various avenues to 
<br/>secure  necessary  funding  and  technology  for  the  comprehensive  upgrade  and  refurbishment  of 
<br/>critical Mill components.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  in  consistent  and  continuous  consultations  with  our  sugarcane 
<br/>farmers, truck drivers and other stakeholders to fully understand their concerns and incorporate their 
<br/>valuable feedback.  While I cannot provide an exact timeline for the resolution of these challenges 
<br/>or legacy issues, I want to emphasise our unwavering commitment to finding a lasting solution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Who wrote it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be a complete review of the 
<br/>sugar  industry  as  per  the  provisions  made  in  the  2023-2024  Budget.    We  fully  comprehend  the 
<br/>immense significance of the sugar industry to our nation’s economy, and we remain steadfast in our 
<br/>dedication to safeguarding the livelihoods of our farmers and those associated with the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had explained on Monday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry still brings in more than 
<br/>$200 million of foreign dollars to the country.  Rest assured, we will continue to work tirelessly to 
<br/>overcome the challenges of these Mills and we are deeply grateful for the support and understanding 
<br/>of all stakeholders, more importantly our hardworking farmers.  I thank them for their contribution 
<br/>to the economy.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  sit,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  interesting  -  I  had  a  fortunate  conversation  with  a 
<br/>Singaporean  Consortium,  a  multi-billionaire  Consortium,  that  is  willing  to  come  in  to  assist  our 
<br/>sugarcane industry.  So, wait for some good news in time to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- One at a time.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, we have not heard anything new from the honourable Minister.  
<br/>When  he  talked  about  the  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs,  there  was  no  plan.  Now,  when  he  is 
<br/>talking about the sugar industry and Rarawai Mill, again, there is no plan. We all know that you do 
<br/>not have a plan, honourable Minister. My question to you is this, we have talked about the magnetite 
<br/>this morning in Ba River.  Rarawai Mill is also a big polluter to the Rarawai River.  Are you aware 
<br/>of that, and if so, what are you going to do to fix it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Take your seat,  honourable Minister. I think this is the second time I am 
<br/>saying this to your good self, Sir, so as to allow us to go over the question that has been raised.  Now, 
<br/>you can stand up and give your reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the supplementary question is a new one.   The plans 
<br/>that we have for Rarawai Mill is something that you have made a blunder of. We are trying to correct 
<br/>that, and it will take some time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years and nothing done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I will allow one more before I ask the honourable Members if we could 
<br/>adjourn soon after this supplementary question, so as to allow the honourable Prime Minister to join 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs from Australia in having tea together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Do not worry, honourable Minister, I am not going to derail your train.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, in  light of the fact that you acknowledged that there are issues with 
<br/>Rarawai  Sugar  Mill,  do  you  anticipate  in  this  particular  season  that  we  are  in  now,  what  is  the 
<br/>percentage that you anticipate in terms of productivity out of that particular Mill, bearing in mind 
<br/>that there are considerable breakdowns at the moment?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I will probably get that answer to him later because I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to get back to the Mill and the Management for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You should have done it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you may have noted how he makes his reply.  He 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has it written down, very detailed, so as to try and provide more information to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- But it is not relevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Come again?

<div><span>Housing Assistance to Fire Victims Grant 
<br/>(Question No. 127/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the approved changes to the Policy for Housing Assistance to Fire Victims Grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to response to the question posed by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member before this august Parliament this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all aware, accidental fires can have devastating consequences for 
<br/>homeowners, leaving them without a place to call home and struggling with the financial burden of 
<br/>rebuilding.  I believe that it is  the responsibility of any government to  assist  homeowners in  such 
<br/>difficult times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2015, a programme was established to provide housing grant assistance 
<br/>on first come first served basis to low or middle income earners or families to rebuild their homes 
<br/>destroyed  by  accidental  fires.    Sir,  under  this  assistance,  households  with  an  annual  income  of 
<br/>$50,000  or  below  can  access  the  payable  grant  of  $5,000  per  applicant.  The  programme  initially 
<br/>assisted affected families in urban areas until the 2020-2021 financial year when it was extended to 
<br/>rural and maritime areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the inception of the programme, a total of 260 families have been assisted with a total 
<br/>payment of $1.3 million. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a need to further extend this assistance 
<br/>as  families  who  had  their  homes  destroyed  by  accidental  fires  were  declined  because  they  had 
<br/>agricultural lease titles. The criteria then was for residential lease title holders only. Additionally, 
<br/>following Cabinet’s decision in 2020, housing assistance to fire victims was extended to rural and 
<br/>maritime areas but only for households within registered village boundaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very pleasing to note that just recently in July 2023, there was a fire 
<br/>that happened in one of the villages in the district of Dreketi in Rewa – Nadoria Village, where five 
<br/>houses were accidentally destroyed.  With this assistance, the Ministry was able to assist the families 
<br/>whose homes had been destroyed by fire.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  also  households  that  belong  to  landowning  units 
<br/>registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) and residing on their respective land that are not within 
<br/>the village boundary.  These families were not considered eligible for assistance due to the current 
<br/>eligibility criteria for rural and maritime areas, hence the need to extend the assistance to include 
<br/>them. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a review was undertaken on the existing policy and assistance 
<br/>have  been  extended  to  applicants  with  agricultural  lease  titles  and  households  residing  on  their 
<br/></span><span>mataqali </span><span>land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the grant assistance will continue to be on a first come first served basis.  
<br/></span><span>Further extension of this assistance is within the  Ministry’s intended number to be assisted in the 
<br/>financial year with a total allocated budget of $150,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister, can he inform Parliament of the requirements in place for those five victims who can been 
<br/>assisted under this policy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1841 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I will just outline some of the major criteria on 
<br/>the reason that was made to those who wanted to apply if their houses got accidentally burnt by fire.  
<br/>These  are homes that  are within the urban,  as  well as  now extended to  maritime and rural  areas.  
<br/>There are about eight criteria altogether: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>The applicant must be above the age of 18 years. 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Household must earn an income of at least below $50,000. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Those  that  have  agricultural  lease  titles,  make  sure  that  you  provide  ownership  that  the 
<br/>property belongs to you and that the applicant occupies the property.  There must be evidence 
<br/>to support the ownership of the damaged property and the applicant occupying the property.   
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>For those on </span><span>mataqali </span><span>land, the applicant is a member of the landowning unit, whose land 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has a damaged property located on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>The property must not be insured. 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>A property search will be done to confirm that the applicant does not own any other property 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within Fiji and this is normally done through the Registrar of Titles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Very important, the cause of the fire must be unintentional, accident fire not through arson 
<br/>and there should be a report lodged with the Police and also from the National Fire Authority.  
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>For  those  houses  that  are  affected  in  rural  and  maritime  areas,  they  must  have  these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confirmations: 
<br/>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Provincial  Administrator  and  Office  of  the  Roko  Tui  must  confirm  the  house 
<br/>ownership rightfully belongs to the landowning unit on which the damaged property is 
<br/>located and on its </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>the Provincial Administrator (PA) as well as the Office of the Roko Tui to confirm the 
<br/>cause fire in consultation with the National Fire Authority for incidents reported in the 
<br/>maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  a  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  pm, 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> land. I think you said only those who are members of that </span><span>mataqali</span><span> will be eligible or qualify 
<br/>to apply for that assistance. What about those living on the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land in the VKB but from somewhere 
<br/>else? There is a case in Sawani where this particular family is from Gau but living in a </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land 
<br/>given to them by the landowners. The house was completely destroyed and until now they are still waiting 
<br/>for  assistance  maybe  because  of  this  policy.  How  can  we  deal  with  those  kind  of  cases,  honourable 
<br/>Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Through you, Mr. Speaker, that is a very valid question and I thank 
<br/>the  honourable  Member  for  raising  this  question.  That  is  a  very  practical  example  because  there  are 
<br/>instances of settlements where some even their </span><span>vasu</span><span>, the village where their mother is from had given 
<br/>them that piece of land.  The most important thing here is, there must be a confirmation or consent from 
<br/>the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> owner that they have given consent to whoever that resides on that  </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land.  The 
<br/>confirmation must come from the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or the head of the </span><span>mataqali </span><span>to confirm that they have given 
<br/>consent or permission for those who want to reside on their </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, my question is on Fire Education Awareness.  Can 
<br/>you describe some measures currently being undertaken with households and members of the public in 
<br/>terms of awareness and safety? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  there  are  five  cases  from  Nadoria,  Rewa,  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister is seeking explanation again on how to ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, this is something that my Ministry has been liaising 
<br/>very closely with the National Fire Authority to provide a strategy that is going to help, not only property 
<br/>owners but people at large or the public on how we can prevent fires.  Just recently, there was a fire that 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>took place in Labasa that really damaged few spaces there, which was really catastrophic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While talking to the Fire Officers who were actually there to assist to douse off the fire, I was told 
<br/>that it started from the kitchen and if only the Kitchenhand had applied the basic training skills that they 
<br/>were taught, the fire would have been contained.  It was in a spur of the moment, they started running 
<br/>out and they forgot to apply the basic firefighting skills.  These are some of the areas that we have 
<br/>also discussed with the Director of National Fire Authority, to do more educational awareness on 
<br/>how best we can prevent fires.  It is not only that we wait for the fire to happen and then we start 
<br/>fighting fires.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  came  this  morning,  I  even  asked  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  National  Fire 
<br/>Authority for us to come up with a national strategy on how best we can prevent fires from happening.  
<br/>They have been invited by schools and they have been conducting consultation and awareness on 
<br/>some of the fire prevention techniques.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, in the future, they are also going to conduct more awareness and training and also 
<br/>in terms of those who live in the rural and maritime areas, they need to liaise with the Roko Tui and 
<br/>the Provincial Administration Office on how best they can reach out to all the villages and settlements 
<br/>in Fiji so that if fire happens, at least, those who live around those surrounding areas are able to assist 
<br/>in fighting against the fire.

<div><span>Extramarital Affairs and Family Breakdown  
<br/>(Question No. 128/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extramarital  affairs  and  marriage/family  breakdown  have  been  an  issue  affecting 
<br/>Fijians contracted under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) and the Recognised 
<br/>Seasonal  Employer  (RSE)  Schemes.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment, 
<br/>Productivity and Industrial Relations inform Parliament on the Ministry’s plan to address the 
<br/>problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  asking  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  extramarital  affairs  and  marriage/family  breakdown  is  a  two-way 
<br/>occurrence, in our case.  It can either happen on the location where the worker is involved abroad at 
<br/>work or with the spouse back at home but for us, our information is that most of them have happened 
<br/>abroad where the workers are based. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, research shows that marriage breakdown or extra-marital affairs stem from 
<br/>poor communication, lack of intimacy, money issues and growing apart, as life takes different twists 
<br/>and turns.  Sir, issues such as this, dealing with human values and behaviour, are beyond our control.  
<br/>However, the concerns raised require an understanding of such human behaviour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing  this  issue  also  requires  multi-disciplinary  approaches  and  multi-stakeholder 
<br/></span><span>collaboration.  No government can resolve this alone but together, Sir, we can take preventive and 
<br/>corrective measures to improve and minimise such painful incidents.  I will outline some preventive 
<br/>measures that our Ministry is now taking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of the PALM Scheme in 2019, 1.5 percent or 65 out 
<br/>of4,351 Fijian workers engaged under the Scheme have been involved in extramarital affairs. While 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1843 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the percentage is insignificant, even one family abandoned by the breadwinner or the head of the 
<br/>family should be a matter of deep concern to all of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of reported cases received on welfare issues around this, Sir, under the Scheme 
<br/>began in 2021.  It is a major social impact faced by workers’ families here in Fiji, including related 
<br/>issues such as non-communication and no remittance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  vast  majority  of  them,  when  they  get  involved  in  such  affairs,  they 
<br/>abscond. They are not at their work site where they were, they run away from the employers and hide 
<br/>somewhere else, so we lose contact with them and our High Commission Officials - our counterparts 
<br/>in Australia and DFAT Officials tried to locate them, but it becomes  very, very difficult.  So far, 
<br/>through intervention by the employers and through intervention by our diaspora there, we have been 
<br/>able to resolve three cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  we  came  into  Government,  my  Ministry  and  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government have achieved a lot in ensuring that the wellbeing and welfare of the workers under the 
<br/>Scheme comes first. We visited our workers in both, Australia and New Zealand, within three months 
<br/>of  coming  into  Office,  to  assure  them  of  our  commitment,  to  hear  their  concerns,  to  talk  to  our 
<br/>bilateral partners, to talk to their employers and their Unions, and to make them feel that they are 
<br/>cared for, Sir, to make them feel important.  They were, indeed, thrilled to see us, Sir, and many got 
<br/>emotional because it was the first time in four years that any Government Official had ever visited 
<br/>them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now strengthening our collaborative efforts, we have established a 
<br/>Senior Officials Working Group between the Fiji Government and the Australian Government, which 
<br/>is  shared  by  my  Permanent  Secretary  and  collectively,  discussing  and  continuously  exploring 
<br/>solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in improving collaboration with our local community, we have signed a Memorandum of 
<br/>Understanding  (MOU)  with  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  to  support  my  Ministry  in  sharing 
<br/>information and also in preparation of potential Fijian workers through their community connections 
<br/>for communal support and identification of potential leaders of the groups that go out and work there. 
<br/>We feel that connection of our workers with the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> through the Chiefs, the Turaga-ni-Koro and 
<br/>the community and Church leaders could help minimise the concerns raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for extensive understanding about work in Australia, including managing 
<br/>the culture shock, we will be expanding our Pre-Departure Training Programme from four days to 
<br/>two weeks, and we will also take this out now to the communities, to districts where families and 
<br/>spouses can also come together for the better understanding of the whole programme and what to 
<br/>expect  out  there,  as  well  as  the  expectations  of  their  families  here.  We  will  also  involve  other 
<br/>stakeholders when we are conducting this Pre-Departure Training Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes there is over-expectation from the family back home and workers get frustrated 
<br/>when all they earn has to be sent home and they save nothing.  I have met some of them and they 
<br/>have shared this with me, and that is why we impress upon families to make sure that the culture of 
<br/></span><span>saving is observed. The workers know that they are going to benefit from their savings at the end of 
<br/></span><span>the period they are working there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pastoral care and welfare support is the key to addressing vulnerability, and 
<br/>this is being done through the appointment of our first ever Country Liaison Officer.  I wish to thank 
<br/>the  Australian  Government  for  allocating  funds  for  a  Country  Liaison  Officer  in  2021.  
<br/>Unfortunately, it took us more than two years and a change in Government to appoint a Country 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liaison Officer.  We have just appointed one and he is on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the honourable Minister of Finance for allocating 
<br/>funds  for  a  second  Liaison  Officer  in  Australia  because  it  is  a  vast  country,  and  our  workers  are 
<br/>spread all over.  We are now in the process of advertising and appointing the second Liaison Officer.  
<br/>We are now in conversation with the Australian Government to provide funding for one more.  If 
<br/>they do not, then I will come back to the honourable Minister of Finance because we need three in 
<br/>Australia and one in New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with our new Country Liaison Officer now on the ground, he will be the 
<br/>key contact person.  He will be visiting workers, workplaces, talking to employers, solving problems 
<br/>and ensuring that any communication from families coming here to us will be forwarded to him to 
<br/>make sure that our workers out there are not behaving in a manner that is undesirable.  So, that is one 
<br/>major step that we have taken, Sir, and we also have our High Commission Officials who are now 
<br/>continuously assisting us as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other avenues that the Ministry is embarking on is ensuring transmission of 
<br/>funds directly. We are now in the process of discussion with the employers to get a Deed of Consent 
<br/>between the employer and the worker done, so that the employer can deduct a certain amount and 
<br/>send it directly to the spouse at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happens now, Sir, is that the fare is paid by the employer, and they deduct that slowly 
<br/>from the wages. So, what we want to do now is to ask them to deduct a little more so that the return 
<br/>fare is also available. If any worker who gets involved or misbehaves, all we will need to do is to get 
<br/>their ticket, put them on the plane and send them back home. Of course, they will not be able to go 
<br/>back again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  family  accompaniment  and  Pacific  Engagement  Visa,  the  Australian 
<br/>Government has committed to piloting a visa arrangement, allowing PALM workers on long-term 
<br/>placements to bring their families to Australia.  This is aimed at addressing the social impact of long 
<br/>periods of family separation.  We hope that this will work well, it is a scheme that is being piloted 
<br/>now with a limited number from the entire Pacific and hopefully, the numbers will increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  also  to  acknowledge  the  work  and  dedication  of  our  Church 
<br/>leaders through the Pacific Council of Churches, including our very own Fiji Council of Churches.  
<br/>These stakeholders play a very crucial role in enhancing the spiritual aspect of our workers to remain 
<br/>faithful, committed to their colleagues and families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last month, I participated in their </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session here in Suva on pastoral and practical care 
<br/>of our migrant workers, to have a better understanding of how we could collaborate more closely to 
<br/>support our workers and their families. And, Sir, they have now got a plan on how our Churches are 
<br/>going to assist our workers out there in Australia and New Zealand with pastoral care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the other developments as part of the way forward, the strengthening of 
<br/>our people to people links to review the Vuvale Partnership Agreement was held last week between 
<br/></span><span>Fiji and Australia Senior Officials here in Suva. Now, this will lead, Sir, to the review of the Labour 
<br/></span><span>Mobility Agreement and will address a number of the current issues and concerns that now have 
<br/>emerged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted earlier on the Coalition Government’s commitment to 
<br/>address emerging issues, during our Ministerial visit to both, Australia and New Zealand, we also 
<br/>had  several  community  engagements  organised  by  our  Fijian  communities.    And  these  </span><span>talanoa</span><span>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1845 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sessions  were  very  fruitful,  Sir,  because  we  were  able  to  extract  a  lot  of  information  from  them 
<br/>regarding how our workers are faring there. At the same time, they are assisting us in making sure 
<br/>that our workers, in connection with them, are having church service together with the communities 
<br/>and they are able to see that they do not fall on the wayside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in acknowledging the concerns raised by some of the key stakeholders, as 
<br/>alluded to earlier that we need a multi-stakeholder approach to address welfare concerns holistically, 
<br/>my Ministry is currently discussing on the establishment of an inter-agency committee to tackle these 
<br/>concerns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there have been issues of performance and welfare concerns for some 
<br/>of our workers and their families, I would like to also acknowledge that most of the workers who 
<br/>have remained focussed have been able to benefit immensely from the Scheme. We know about the 
<br/>remittances that have been coming, we know of the success stories that have come through the social 
<br/>media, d through the mainstream media and from the workers themselves who have come back, that 
<br/>they have either started their own businesses, they have improved their living standards and improved 
<br/>their homes, and they have also improved their villages, and the like.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, enhanced labour mobility is a shared priority of the economic relationship. We commit 
<br/>to  working  together  with  the  Australian  Government  and  their  representatives,  to  ensure  that  the 
<br/>Scheme is mutually beneficial and also to ensure that our workers get fair treatment and are in good 
<br/>spirits and even connected to their families back home so that we are able to reduce and eradicate the 
<br/>problem on hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given a list of all those preventive and corrective measures that we 
<br/>are taking, and we are hopeful that we will be able to resolve this problem, going forward.  Thank 
<br/>you very much, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for his response and I 
<br/>would also like to commend the Ministry and all its staff for the facilitation work they are currently 
<br/>doing for our youth and fellow Fijians. My supplementary question is, apart from those community 
<br/>pre-departure programme and pastoral care that the honourable Minister has spoken about, are there 
<br/>plans to introduce some form of predeparture couples therapy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I must apologise, Sir, I missed the last part of the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think the honourable Tuicolo is asking therapy for couples before they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>depart. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier, we are now expanding the 
<br/>period from four days to two weeks and we are getting other stakeholders to come in and one of them 
<br/>will be that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Minister  you  have  mentioned 
<br/>something on country liaison officers.  I think that is a great idea, but who are these people and which 
<br/></span><span>side of the ocean do you recruit them from?  Are they our locals whom you take to the other side, or 
<br/></span><span>these are the people from the other side, who are experienced and know about the country and all the 
<br/>problems that are engaged in this?  I know there is a lot of talk going on the social media regarding 
<br/>those who are doing the job right now, saying that they lack capacity to do the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the country liaison officers whom we are appointing 
<br/>would be those former Fijians now living in Australia who have the correct qualifications, experience

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when growing up, we heard in schools that on the 
<br/>other side the pasture is always greener, but the pasture is greener where we water it.  I think that is 
<br/>the message to the youth to the possibilities in Fiji that we can invest in.  Thank you, honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  your  quantitative  assessment  and  the  multi-disciplinary  approach  in  prioritising  and 
<br/>characterising the degree of issues that we have.  But ever since this has been in the media, some 
<br/>family members are a bit worried.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What if they have a family member engaged in these kinds of matters, and somehow some of 
<br/>the family members, who were intending to take up this scheme to go on this Pacific Australia Labour 
<br/>Mobility  Scheme  are  sort  of  being  discouraged  not  to  do  so.    How  is  your  Ministry  working  to 
<br/>mitigate  this  aspect  of  social  stigma  and  demoralisation  factor  amongst  the  Fijian  people  and 
<br/>families? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me share this information through you, that we 
<br/>have  some  20,000  plus  applications  pending,  and  right  now  we  are  actually  processing  those 
<br/>applications from mid-2021.  I am not aware of the lack of interest in people wishing to go and work 
<br/>abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, these workers are granted Visa 403, in which, there is no 
<br/>provision for the workers to take their partners with them.  We know as married men and married 
<br/>women, when we do not have our partners, it is highly likely that people get involved in these kinds 
<br/>of activities.  As alluded to by the honourable Minister, how long will it take for the talks so that 
<br/>there is a provision for the workers to take their partners with them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now six months into these discussions.  If we 
<br/>had started these discussions two years earlier, by now we probably would have had it already.  So, 
<br/>we hope to have it in place as soon as possible.  We are discussing with our Australian counterparts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The question has generated a lot of interest from the honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is 
<br/>very  simple.    During  my  term  in  the  Ministry,  I  carried  out  two  visits  around  New  Zealand  and 
<br/>Australia.  One of the issues that had been realised at that time was the Fijian communities in these 
<br/>areas were quite a very bad influence on the workers were coming from Fiji - being raw from the 
<br/>rural areas and they were very easily influenced by our Fijians living around the area.  At that time, 
<br/>I had decided to create half-way houses which basically means that there is a community within the 
<br/>town  closest  to  them  that  will  advise  them  if  they  do  fall  off  the  line.    I  just  wanted  to  ask  the 
<br/>honourable Minister if that problem of interference from our local communities that now reside in 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand have much influence on our workers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that there are those that do  influence our 
<br/>people negatively, they encourage them to abscond, encourage them to get away, encourage them to 
<br/>hide and they probably later on will be able to obtain a visa to stay back, but the vast majority I must 
<br/></span><span>say that we have met are great people and they are there to assist us. This is my experience in our last 
<br/></span><span>visit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is actually quite simple but I just want to 
<br/>remind the honourable Minister that discussion with respect to partners travelling with them began 
<br/>with us many moons ago.  Sir, the question really is that we have to tread very carefully with respect 
<br/>to how we deal with the situation especially with respect to extramarital matters, et cetera, that is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being spoken about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why  I  say  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  because  within  the  Constitution  we  have  a  particular 
<br/>provision that guarantees your right to privacy and that also guarantees respect for your private and 
<br/>your family life.  My question is that in all that you do with respect to this specific matter Sir, please 
<br/>let us know whether you are consulting with the Solicitor-General’s Office and the necessary legal 
<br/>authorities.    Be  mindful  because  our  intentions  are  good  (it  does  not  matter  which  side  of  the 
<br/>Parliament we are) but we cannot tread and interfere in people’s personal lives.  So, have you made 
<br/>arrangements whether it is overseas or whether it is our own Solicitor-General’s Office? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question.  Of course, we have our own legal officers, our legal team in the ministry and we have the 
<br/>Solicitor-General’s office to advise us on any matter of legality in any anything at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Have you done it though? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Black Spot Areas in Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 129/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  inform  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>workplan to address the Black Spot areas in the country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  would  like  to  thank  honourable 
<br/>Vocea for his question.  Before I respond, Sir, I think the honourable Minister for Labour was actually 
<br/>very polite. Before we became Government, I actually spent some time moving around Australia and 
<br/>worked in New South Wales and Victoria, and one of the things that was unprompted from all those 
<br/>workers was “we have not had a visit from Government”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad that honourable Koroilavesau mentioned that he did visit four times apparently and 
<br/>so when honourable Koya was touting the Scheme as an initiative of the Government, I think I would 
<br/>urge them to just reflect on how they executed the Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question – you are just wasting time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  did  not  actually  have  the 
<br/>infrastructure to support the whole thing.  The initiatives that the honourable Minister for Labour 
<br/>mentioned - he did it in six months so he should be praised and credited for taking care of that matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by the honourable Member of the 
<br/>Ministry’s work to address blackspot areas in the country.  Before I begin and for the benefit of all 
<br/></span><span>members of the public, please, let me explain what blackspots are. These are areas where there is 
<br/></span><span>essentially no internet activity, and the other common technology is grey areas, and this is where 
<br/>internet connectivity is somewhat intermittent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Internet  connectivity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  agreed  is  now  the  backbone  of  the  modern 
<br/>world and has becoming separable part of our daily lives. Reliable and stable internet to connectivity 
<br/>provides a gateway to access for information, education, economic opportunities and connecting our 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>loved ones in a way that was unimaginable a few years ago.  Access to good quality affordable secure 
<br/>internet connectivity is crucial and the Government Ministries are fully commitment to bridging the 
<br/>digital divide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are already 240 declared sites which have been identified as having 
<br/>poor or no connectivity.  I just seek the indulgence of both sides of Parliament. When I saw that list, 
<br/>I  was  not  happy  with  it  because  I  felt  it  did  not  address  the  whole  needs  of  the  country.  It  was 
<br/>selective. It only picked on certain Provinces, and it did not look in an all-encompassing way across 
<br/>the provinces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have put the programme on hold or slowed it down just to 
<br/>make sure that we consult a bit more broadly and make sure when we roll out (I am hoping to start 
<br/>seriously rolling out at the very latest in the first quarter next year) that we are able to actually start 
<br/>genuinely addressing connectivity needs across the community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart  from  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  also  been  receiving  feedback  from 
<br/>Provincial Councils just to ensure again that when connectivity is rolled out that we address everyone.  
<br/>So, essentially, I am hoping what we will do is actually publicly announce provinces where internet 
<br/>is  going  to  be rolled out and then start  systematic covering the provinces. I will keep this august 
<br/>Parliament informed particularly as I know both sides of Parliament have elected Members in there 
<br/>whereas electors are important that this is done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do have a trust account, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has funds in it, and what I am hoping to do 
<br/>once  we  start  spending  the  money,  I  will  be  reaching  out  to  the  stakeholders  namely  Vodafone, 
<br/>Telecom and Digicel whether to see where they can start addressing the grey spots as part of the 
<br/>overall exercise, because one of their contentions has been that the money that has been sitting in the 
<br/>Trust Account has not been used and so they are holding off on addressing the grey spots.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of other things that we are doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are maintaining a programme 
<br/>from the previous Government which is maintaining telecentre programmes for 26 schools partnering 
<br/>with the Ministry of Education. We will see whether we can continue to expand that initiative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of connectivity issues, it is not only an issue for Fiji, but also an issue around the 
<br/>world.  In fact, the International Communications Union (ICU) which is the arm of the UN, estimates 
<br/>that over 2.7 billion are not connected to the online world.  On a regional level, we recognise the 
<br/>need to connect all our people to good quality and affordable secure internet and to this effect, the 
<br/>ICT Ministers of the Pacific met in Port Moresby on 27</span><span>th</span><span> and 28</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023 where we endorsed 
<br/>the </span><span>Lagatoi Declaration</span><span> which focuses on digital transformation across the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a global level, we are working very closely with the UN Technologies Specialist Agencies 
<br/>such  as  International  Telecommunications  Union  (ITU),  the  World  Bank  and  Asia-Pacific 
<br/>Telecommunity (APT) and other multilateral partners on the need to improve internet connectivity 
<br/>in Fiji.  We are actively participating in discussions on emerging standards and regulations in the 
<br/>connectivity space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The emergence of Low Earth Orbiting Satellites has come as a blessing for geographically 
<br/></span><span>sparse countries like Fiji as they do not require upfront investment by the Government and service 
<br/>providers to provide connectivity.  Our service providers currently utilise these types of technologies 
<br/>to provide connectivity to the remote areas and there are more opportunities to connect communities 
<br/>directly using these technologies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point I would like to make Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that improving internet connectivity

<div><span>is not just a matter of convenience anymore.  It is essential for the livelihoods of our people.  It is a 
<br/>matter of national development and progress.  It is about creating a level playing field for all our 
<br/>citizens regardless of their background or location.  It is about harnessing the power of technology to 
<br/>propel our nation forward into a brighter and more prosperous future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got confused.  Honourable Vocea asked the 
<br/>question about blackspots, but the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has talked about grey spots.  
<br/>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister explain to me what is the difference between the black 
<br/>spots and the grey spots? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had already explained that a black spot 
<br/>is where there is no connectivity and a grey spot is where there is intermittent connectivity.  In terms 
<br/>of what we are endeavouring to do, the honourable Leader of the Opposition is to ensure when we 
<br/>roll out the programme, it is equitable and fair.  The previous programme was like moving around 
<br/>Fiji in an inefficient way.  We need to have a structured programme that moves through provinces 
<br/>and then actually executes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once we go through a province, the province actually experiences the benefit of the internet 
<br/>connectivity.  That is really it has been slowed down and I take responsibility for that, but from where 
<br/>I  sit,  we  need  to  do  this  properly.    The  list  that  was  compiled  before,  I  am  not  sure  honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side had a good look at it, parts of Ra were not included in it, so that is why I 
<br/>am re-looking at it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I remember correctly, I think this has something to 
<br/>do with the 2021-2022 Budget and there were about 317 sites that were poorly connected.  Within 
<br/>that budget, there was an allocation of about $570,000 and also the Universal Service Fund was going 
<br/>to be used.  My question really is, all of that have been identified under the tower sharing idea that 
<br/>was happening.   Honourable Minister, would you not say that that particular programme has actually 
<br/>alleviated the problem somewhat that most of it has gone?  I am not sure if you are saying that you 
<br/>have slowed down this particular programme or is it some other programme?  Just a clarification on 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Koya for your question.  It is really 
<br/>slowing down the current programme just to make sure that we have wider penetration when we roll 
<br/>it out.  I am not too familiar with the previous programme, but I will certainly check up on it as well.  
<br/>If there is any omission from there, we will include it in this rollout.  Telecom is very keen to move 
<br/>so as soon as we finalise the list, we will share it widely with everyone because it is in the interest of 
<br/>the country on both sides of Parliament.

<div><span>Vunisei Kavala Road – Completion of 
<br/>(Question No. 132/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the people of Naceva and Nakasaleka in Kadavu anticipating the completion of 
<br/>the  Vunisei  upto  Vacalea  and  on  to  Kavala  Road,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public 
<br/>Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on those roads’ progress 
<br/>and when they are likely to be completed and commissioned? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The question is on a very specific road.  It is a bit different from now what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>1850 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we used to face in the past.  You cannot ask about this, so we are allowing this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  The Vunisei to Vacalea Access Road takes construction of about 32 kilometres of unsealed 
<br/>road from Vunisei  Village to  Vacalea within the  Districts of  Kadavu and Nakasaleka on Kadavu 
<br/>Island.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The scope of road works consists of 7.8 kilometres design and build section from Vunisei 
<br/>Village Junction to Vukavu Village Junction, which includes construction of nine rural level crossing 
<br/>and pilot cut section of 24.2 kilometres of road, alignment from Vukavu Junction to Vacalea Village 
<br/>which includes the culvert crossing as mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  pilot  cut  section,  access  road  has  been  constructed  for  Vukavu  Village,  Niudua 
<br/>Village,  Jioma  Village,  Nacomoto  Village,  Kadavu  Village,  Namajiu  Village,  Lavidi  Village  and 
<br/>Vacalea  Village.  However,  all  these  road  constructions  are  only  currently  accessible  during 
<br/>favourable  weather  as  pilot  sections  are  yet  to  be  gravelled.  This  project  has  experienced 
<br/>comprehensive challenges such as adverse weather, COVID-19 delays, physical site conditions and 
<br/>land issues that has vastly contributed to the challenging progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  overall  progress  is  77  percent  complete,  whereby  the  design  and  build  section  is 
<br/>completed  including  the  low  level  crossings.    Hence  road  is  fully  accessible  for  Vunisea  School, 
<br/>Dravuwalu Village, Dravuwalu District School, Yavitu Government Youth School, Yavitu Village, 
<br/>Soso Village and Naceva District School. The programme is envisaged to be completed in January 
<br/>2024  with  the  provision  of  basic  all  weather  road  access  for  the  mentioned  villages,  schools  and 
<br/>health centres hence reducing rural transport cost for Naceva and Nakasaleka.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, honourable Minister for the answer. You did mention 
<br/>about the need for gravel on these roads.  One of the challenges is the crusher output is insufficient 
<br/>to provide for the volume that is needed. The honourable Minister has started with this was the carting 
<br/>of materials from Viti Levu to Kadavu.  What is the current situation now, is that going to continue, 
<br/>or have you got sufficient materials on the two crusher sites that are available in Kadavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition on that. The 
<br/>situation regarding crushers is also under current consideration by the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) 
<br/>regarding the availability of aggregates as you mentioned, that is the challenge.  But one of the major 
<br/>costs in terms of maritime road construction is the cartage from Viti Levu.  So, we are now engaging 
<br/>with some landowners to expand the cartage operations and assist them to set up, working closely 
<br/>with  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  through  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  in  terms  of  their  programme  to 
<br/>enhance indigenous businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just in  relation to that issue, there are currently two 
<br/>crushers in Kadavu, one in Yawe, it is the softer rock and the other one is in Kiobo in Namara and 
<br/>that is the rock that is  being used for the road up from Vunisei to go up to Kavala.  I think if you are 
<br/>going to look for another source of rock, it would be at the North end of Kadavu, around Nakasaleka, 
<br/>to bring the rock down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  question,  Sir,  is  in  relation  to  the  roads  that  we  have  in  Kadavu  now  and  with  the 
<br/>completion  of  this  road,  you  will  be  able  to  travel  from  the  Jetty  in  Kavala  all  the  way  down  to 
<br/>Nabukelevu-i-Ra.  But from Nabukelevu-i-Ra there is another road that comes from Vunisea down 
<br/>to Naqalotu.  There is also the idea of making that road a loop road.  Are there any plans now to join 
<br/>up the roads from Naqalotu to the one that comes from Nabukelevu so that to the South end of Kadavu 
<br/>where we can have a loop?  After that there will be just two or three more of this.  That is the question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1851 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about completing that loop around South end of Kadavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You probably have to go around Ului Nabukelevu to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will need to check on that information, but 
<br/>definitely, when we look at the planning, that is one of the emphasis where the loop roads could be 
<br/>joined, or enhanced that is what we will be focusing on too.  If not in this budget, then in the upcoming 
<br/>budget.    Also,  after  the  next  election,  when  we  come  in,  we  can  continue  expanding  it  really 
<br/>intensively in terms of the rural roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know in Kadavu there is no bus operating or 
<br/>running, but in places like Vanua Levu we have some roads where we are forcing buses to run, but 
<br/>they are not PSV accredited, which is supposed to be done by the FRA.  Does the Ministry look into 
<br/>that kind of case or situation because, you need to build the road if you are going to introduce heavy 
<br/>PSVs, then it needs  to be done to  that standard?  I know a couple of roads  like in Wailevu West, 
<br/>Natuvu and Vunidamoni, we are just running the buses there because people are demanding for that, 
<br/>but it is not accredited.  The problem is, if there is going to be  an accident then it is going to be 
<br/>something against the bus company for doing that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note that and we are also with the FRA 
<br/>Team in the North, currently working on the programme regarding the North roads.  I have seen the 
<br/>bus companies, yes, there definitely is a lot of work that needs to be done and that is something we 
<br/>will be focusing on as we move forward, especially, for road conditions where in terms of the small 
<br/>inclement weather, the vehicles cannot move.  So that is what I have asked the FRA Team in the 
<br/>North to focus on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please note that I have been allowing questions to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>run like this from Kadavu to the North, and the roads are not accredited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They never allowed it, Sir, before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Never.

<div><span>Enhancing Quality and Accessible TVET Programmes 
<br/>(Question No. 133/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the measures being 
<br/>undertaken to enhance the quality and accessibility of Technical and Vocational Education 
<br/>and Training (TVET) programmes in the country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question 
<br/>and  I  think  we  can  all  acknowledge  and  appreciate  the  role  that  the  Technical  and  Vocational 
<br/>Education Training (TVET) has provided for Fiji to fill the skills gap in the Fijian job market. Trade-
<br/>related skills that have been provided through TVET has also provided workforce that has also been 
<br/>recognised in Fiji, in the region and also in the international arena.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that over the years, special category of learning has been 
<br/>affected by the various competing interests in terms of the policy changes due to political directions 
<br/>and  through  changes  in  government  and  this  has  also  led  to  institutional  braindrain,  as  has  been 
<br/>experienced in our tertiary institutions.  At one stage, we had the Fiji National Training Centre and 
<br/>the  former  Director  is  the  honourable  Member  sitting  on  the  other  side,  the  Fiji  Institute  of 
<br/>Technology that led the training of our vocational studies and also supported by various secondary 
<br/>schools, such as Ratu Kadavulevu School, Queen Victoria School and other schools around Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is working with relevant stakeholders to enhance 
<br/>the  quality  of  technical  and  vocational  education  training  by  revising  curriculums  of  all  the 
<br/>programmes under this umbrella and the TVET Section under the Ministry of Education is working 
<br/>with the Fiji Higher Education Commission, and other necessary training institutions to conduct skills 
<br/>survey to assess the current needs of all industries in Fiji and also identify where our strengths and 
<br/>weaknesses lie. The findings of this survey will be used to  address the various educational needs 
<br/>which will be discussed with implementing tertiary institutions to be able to focus the subjects and 
<br/>ensure sufficient students are attracted to take up training in this skill sets for the job markets in Fiji 
<br/>and abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The education curriculum over the years has undergone various changes and it continues to 
<br/>evolve to allow for areas of need that are identified, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I also would like to inform 
<br/>Parliament  that  this  is  also  part  of  the  thematic  areas  that  will  be  discussed  at  the  Fiji  National 
<br/>Education Summit which will be convening next week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  done  various  outreach  programmes  and 
<br/>incentives to attract students for TVET and educate communities on the important role of the sector 
<br/>and we are working not only to furnish our domestic markets with professional workers, but we are 
<br/>also fast becoming a country that provides workers for the international job markets.  The outreach 
<br/>programmes undertaken addresses the socio-economic wellbeing of the Fijian communities and the 
<br/>scholarships  and  loan  scheme  play  its  part  by  publishing  and  launching  its  booklet  on  the 
<br/>scholarships, grants and the loan schemes that Government is providing for TVET. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  also  pleased  to  state  that  to  promote  TVET  learners  of  all  income 
<br/>categories and locations, the Ministry of Education continues to provide Vocational Tuition Grants 
<br/>of $610 per vocational students across its 32 Vocational Centres. We are also exploring ways to also 
<br/>restore 31 of the 66 Vocational Centres that were attached to our own secondary schools in all the 
<br/>four Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament how the Ministry is using 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>GPE Technical Financial Assistance to enhance TVET Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO. - I think we have covered that in the Ministerial Statement that I 
<br/>did on Monday. It is also part of the discussions that will be undertaken in the Fiji National Education 
<br/>Summit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is paramount to eradicate poverty. While 
<br/></span><span>I highly encourage the participation at this Technical and Vocational Education in schools, the youths 
<br/></span><span>of today have a range of options where they want to get education.  To stay in competition, you need 
<br/>a  competitive  edge.  So,  what  would  a  young  person  want  after  school  is  get  a  scholarship,  get 
<br/>educated and enter the workforce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have spoken about the quality and access to being educated.  Can you inform us and the 
<br/>people especially the youths if there are direct and indirect collaborations to the workforce or work 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1853 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector so that students feel more encouraged that if I get educated this is the path I can take, and I 
<br/>will be able to get a job?  Those are some of the indirect and direct collaborations for the students to 
<br/>graduate and get a job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO. - That is a very good question from the honourable Member. This 
<br/>is something that will be part of the Fiji National Education Summit to consider because that is all 
<br/>covered in the thematic areas that has already identified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I really thank the honourable Minister for his responses and, of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>course, the focus that the Government has now on TVET Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, my simple question to the honourable Minister is, you have 
<br/>talked about the 31 out of 66 schools that used to have TVET Programmes but currently I know that 
<br/>some of this work have been outsourced.  What proportion of the whole training is under the current 
<br/>arrangement that is, sort of, outsourced as opposed to those currently run by the Ministry and, of 
<br/>course, most importantly is the consistency in the assessment criteria?  I hope those from the schools 
<br/>will be in terms of their achievements and can be cross credited as well, perhaps something I think 
<br/>that other institutions are providing for the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The Ministry has already undertaken steps to sign Memorandum 
<br/>of Understanding (MOU) with the Fiji National University to ensure that all the courses that have 
<br/>been undertaken will be accredited by the Fiji National University and private providers like Pacific 
<br/>Polytech, Monfort Boys Town, Montfort Institute and Vivekananda Technical College.  These are 
<br/>some  of  the  private  institutions  that  has  also  been  recognised  through  the  Fiji  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission to be providing technical vocational education training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  we  have  allowed  more.    Sorry  about  that,  honourable  Usamate.  
<br/>Now, we will move on to the last question since the honourable Minister for Women, Children and 
<br/>Social Protection was busy in the morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Care Centres  
<br/>(Question No. 130/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  inform 
<br/>Parliament if the Ministry has any plans to establish Child Care Centres for three to five year-
<br/>olds? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>The question is asking if the Ministry has any plans to open any Child Care Centres for three to five 
<br/>years old and the short answer to that is, no.  The Ministry is not in the business of operating Child 
<br/>Care Centres.  However, the Ministry’s current focus is looking at regulating the standards of Child 
<br/>Care Centres that open around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you all recall, the Early Childhood Care Policy and Regulatory Framework Guidance Note 
<br/></span><span>received  unanimous  approval  of  this  Parliament  in  May  2023.    This  Regulatory  Framework  is 
<br/>designed to set forth the norms and standards that will govern both existing and new Early Childhood 
<br/>Care (ECC) services within the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consequently, all Child Care Centres both existing and those yet to be established will be 
<br/>required to adhere to the standards outlined in this Guidance Note.  Once again, I thank the Gender

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  Social  Inclusion  Division  of  IFC  who  has  worked  with  the  Ministry  to  come  up  with  this 
<br/>Guidance Note. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the setting up of the Department for Children, one of its core functions is to 
<br/>become the central regulatory authority to ensure that Child Care Centres meet the standards.  As I 
<br/>had mentioned in an answer earlier this week, we have some employers who have opened Child Care 
<br/>Centres in their locations as well as other Child Care Centres that are around the country.  This will 
<br/>ensure that there is one central regulatory authority under the Director for Children to ensure that 
<br/>they have to check up on them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also policies in other ministries as you are aware of, honourable Members.  We 
<br/>have got the Early Childhood Development Policy in the Ministry for Health that looks at the health 
<br/>of children from one to thirteen years old, but it does include the age you have mentioned.    We have 
<br/>the  Early  Childhood  Education  Policy  that  is  existing  within  the  Ministry  for  Education.    These 
<br/>policies currently complement each other. Again, the opening of the Child Care Centres are currently 
<br/>done privately but are guided by these policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the Ministry is not in the business of opening 
<br/>Child Care Services and there are some privately owned Child Care Services in Fiji.  How are their 
<br/>operations monitored and how do you ensure quality childcare services? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had mentioned about the Department for Children 
<br/>and  one  of  their  core  functions  is  to  become  the  central  regulatory  authority  which  includes 
<br/>monitoring and ensuring that there are certain standards that are met.  That will be the role of that.  
<br/>As you know, we have established it and have the budget for it, so we hope to roll that out as soon 
<br/>as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that you are not in the business of it, but 
<br/>they are established centres.  So, there is the establishment and let us say for parents to access it, is 
<br/>another  question.    Yesterday,  in  Parliament,  we  had  spoken  about  single  mothers.    My  question 
<br/>honourable Minister, in your policy framework, do you have any support subsidies in terms of single 
<br/>mothers, let us say working parents who are below the income bracket, who want to go and work but 
<br/>they have a responsibility to take care of a child because if they are not able to get assistance, they 
<br/>are trapped in the cycle of poverty?  With your policy framework, do you have any subsidies for 
<br/>them to get their child at the centres or to even get to the centre, the logistics of it? Do you have 
<br/>something or initiative of this sort to support these families?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  before  you  issue  your  reply  to  that,  another 
<br/>interesting question was raised yesterday to also include single fathers.  Whenever we address single 
<br/>mothers now, we have to address single fathers as well.  That was raised by the Opposition yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Single parents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Single parents, that includes both father and mother? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Gender neutral. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We are being educated here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, single parents who need assistance 
<br/>from the Ministry are receiving Social Welfare Allowance, not just for Family Assistance Scheme 
<br/>but  also  for  their  children.    There  are  certain  categories  in  terms  of  what  is  given  out  with  the

<div><span>allowance with  their  age group.   Of  course, the  expenses  are incurred more as the kids  get  older 
<br/>because when they are in high school, they need more. There is a whole certain amounts that apply 
<br/>to a child that is under Child Protection Allowance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What you are asking in terms of assisting single parents, we are currently really appealing to 
<br/>employers to provide this as part of a worker’s compensation package, and we find employers who 
<br/>are coming forward that are willing to do this. This Guidance Note that will help us to regulate these 
<br/>places will assist us to ensure that we still meet the standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are willing partners from the community. As you know, our Voluntary Grants from 
<br/>any Ministry is really for voluntary organisations, it is not for private institutions like running a Child 
<br/>Care Centre. There are no plans here to subsidise a private institution because at the end of day, it is 
<br/>still  for  profit  and  that  is  something  this  Government  we  do  not  do.  But  there  are  voluntary 
<br/>organisations who assist women with young children, like HART community who, as I mentioned 
<br/>yesterday, have come forward to help those mothers who are attending APTC courses. So, we can 
<br/>help them out with things like groceries as they look after those children. Again, it is not for profit, 
<br/>it is a community service that we can offer.
