<h3>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- LTA CEO.</h3>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- LTA CEO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Our locals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- These Boards of these statutory bodies give professional scrutiny and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>due diligence in everything that they do. They have the accounting companies that help them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, maybe my time is going up, but what I want to say, I am sitting here, listening 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and thinking that the problem with the Government is that you are caught in a time warp. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You keep thinking that whatever worked in the past is best for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>always used to tell us... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Righting wrongs.

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1893 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  …  Boeing  is  better  than  Airbus;  always.  Now,  we  are  happy  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airbus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Do you really know him?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Now, I am sure that he is  happy with Airbus. All the time you are 
<br/>talking to us about looking back, but one of the other things that I find funny, there is a contradiction 
<br/>to what they are saying, Sir.  They are saying we should apply this to all of these organisations but 
<br/>then there are some organisations that they do not include. Why are they not included? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- They will be included. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Does  that  mean  they  will  have  a  different  set  of  rules?    The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>organisation that is not included here is Fiji Roads Authority. Where is Fiji Roads Authority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I also want to know if No. 2, the Agricultural Marketing Authority is 
<br/>different from No. 27 the Fiji Agro Marketing Authority. Are these two different entities or they are 
<br/>the same?  This thing is full of errors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Full of errors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Full of errors, it is a sign of incompetent drafting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Blunder after blunder.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Blunder after blunder after blunder.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government also needs to get over this ever-driving need that they that 
<br/>bites them inside to get rid of everything that FijiFirst has done.  Get over it!  At the beginning of the 
<br/>year they talked about scraping FICAC, now eight months or nine months into the job they realised 
<br/>FICAC is good for this country.  They used to talk about, and my very good friend, the honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau was always asking about </span><span>waqavuka, waqavuka, waqavuka</span><span>!  Who is the shareholder?  Now, 
<br/>they buy an aeroplane through exact the same mechanism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Always talking about Walesi, no good, Walesi no good, Walesi, no good!  Now, they praise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Walesi and want to use Walesi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Watch the rugby on Walesi.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Filipe Tuisawau commented about the change in the way 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Opposition is carrying out its role, the much more enlightened Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>1894 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The reason for this is clear.  When we were in government, I always 
<br/>called the Opposition to  come into the light, be enlightened, do things in the best interest of Fiji, 
<br/>rather than opposing, opposing, opposing, opposing.  Every single thing - oppose, oppose, oppose! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is what you people are doing.  Now we are doing it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- To be an enlightened Opposition, we are now showing you how an 
<br/>Opposition that is in the light acts.  When there are things that we believe that we need to agree with, 
<br/>we will agree.  We do not disagree for the sake of disagreeing.  You have just shown, you are so 
<br/>enlightened that in this State Land Bill that you have passed, you have taken away the hope from the 
<br/>dispossessed people.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People who are living on no other land, you have taken their hope away from them.  Even 
<br/>though they got into the land in an illegal fashion, you have taken that away from them.  That is your 
<br/>enlightenment, to let such people, what you are basically saying to them, “sink or swim, I do not care 
<br/>about  you.”    This is  the freedom  that you are talking  about  that you bring to  this  country.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I do not support this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, he has not even started. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are fearful, they are fearful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Please, do not bomb them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … earlier this morning, the honourable Minister for Employment 
<br/>and Industrial Relations talked about the fact that they need to repent.  I was wondering if you look 
<br/>at  the  military  government,  the  Bainimarama  Government  and  the  FijiFirst  Government,  you  are 
<br/>looking at 15 years to 16 years.  Some of them with the Bainimarama Government, some of them 
<br/>were the FijiFirst Government, so essentially, they need to repent for 14 years to 15 years or at least 
<br/>a minimum of eight years, but we will give them a discount, they should repent for four years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is why honourable Usamate, he has got a favourite word, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“hogwash”.  What he said just a while ago is an example of real hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- </span><span>Isa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, usually my friend honourable Usamate makes 
<br/>sense,  but  today  he  was  full  of  contradiction.    He  talked  about  Airports  Fiji.    Airports  Fiji,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, if you increase the departure tax to $200, even honourable Kumar would have probably 
<br/>made better profit than the CEO who was there.  There is no comparison to what he was saying and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1895 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>both, honourable Maharaj and honourable Usamate, were totally confused.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They went on and talked about the Higher Salaries Commission, a very good example of the 
<br/>contradiction. He actually did not understand what the Higher Salaries Commission was.  He should 
<br/>have gone and did some research on what it used to do.  He said, “Higher Salaries Commission did 
<br/>not have people who have the commercial acumen or who are not going to be able to understand 
<br/>what happens.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Go and check the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is not saying, that is, the people who appoint the Higher 
<br/>Education Commission. The things that they did, Mr. Speaker, and I tell you what happened. There 
<br/>are  two  things  that  happened  with  the  FijiFirst  and  the  Bainimarama  Government.    There  is  a 
<br/>fundamental  difference  between Rule of Law and Rule  by Law. They did not  follow the Rule of 
<br/>Law… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Really.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … right from 2006, their Decrees, even  when they got into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government, they did not follow the Rule of Law but they Ruled by Law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every time something did not work, they will come with the law because the former Attorney-
<br/>General, the former Prime Minister and some of them who were there they were so used to Rule by 
<br/>Decree.  So, when they  did  the 2013 Constitution under Section 174, they made sure that all the 
<br/>Decrees  that  they  made  during  the  military  government  was  actually  preserved  in  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution  and  they  got  so  used  to  it.    So,  when  they  came  as  a  democratic  government,  they 
<br/>continued to Rule by Law.  I will tell you the fundamental difference between Rule of Law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following the Rule of Law, Mr. Speaker, means fairness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Quote the Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  stand  under  Standing  Order  60,  the  speech  must  be 
<br/>relevant  and  Standing  Order  61  basically  says,  “…  when  speaking  Members  must  confine  their 
<br/>observations to the subject under consideration.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think it has been about four minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Two minutes left.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Please ask him to be relevant. The diatribe we have heard over and over 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>again, Sir. It is like a broken record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>1896 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, ask him to be relevant. We have heard what he wants to say. His already said it a 
<br/>million times.  Stick to the topic.  Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 61 is what we are objecting under, 
<br/>please ask him to be relevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just explain why what I am saying is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very relevant because that is what the Higher Salaries Commission is going to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Preach it out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When you have arbitrary and discretionary powers, removal 
<br/>of the Higher Salaries Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allowed the Ministers, honourable Kumar said 
<br/>that someone gave her a reference honourable Maharaj that honourable Kumar used to hire.  Some 
<br/>Ministers, even when they discretionary powers, even if they can be arbitrary about who they appoint, 
<br/>they used independent people to do that, but the power without the Higher Salaries Commission that 
<br/>Ministers  and  boards  had  was  arbitrary  and  discretionary.    Any  situation  where  there  is  arbitrary 
<br/>discretionary power, it is bound to be misused at some point in time, Mr. Speaker. That is exactly 
<br/>what happened.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What are you saying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The boards were ruled by the Ministers …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The boards were appointed by the Ministers. The boards were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dictated by the Ministers because the power was arbitrary about the salaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, the Higher Salaries Commission… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Point  of  Order,  Standing  Order  62  –  Improper  Motives.    When 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister is trying to say that the Boards 
<br/>appoints the Minister.  He is trying to say that as if there is something wrong.  The Boards are always 
<br/>appointed by Ministers, what is wrong with that?   This is improper motive, trying to say that there 
<br/>is something sinister in a Board appointed by the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, you may continue honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am actually flabbergasted and surprised 
<br/>with the level of intervention, I mean, Point of Order.  They are actually misusing the Parliamentary 
<br/>time.  They sound so irrelevant because they know that what I am saying is correct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1897 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  is  how  they  did  that  and  we  were  on  record  in  this 
<br/>Parliament pointing out to them. Whenever they found that things were not working, if a Board that 
<br/>they appointed was not working, then they bring a law and change it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Your Board at Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are saying, “Oh, because the system is not working”, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just like the Land Transport Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Lands Department is not working and if it is not working, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you do not look at why it is not working.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when something does not work, their approach was, bring a law, change it.  
<br/>That was ruled by law because they were so used to rule by law and rule by law is unfair, it is not 
<br/>accountable and not transparent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The re-instatement of the Higher Salaries Commission will bring about that accountability 
<br/>and transparency and allow the Higher Salaries Commission to do its own.  It does not mean that 
<br/>they cannot hire experts or independent bodies to determine the market, this is the kind of logic that 
<br/>they used. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  point,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  I  want  to  make  is  when  the  Higher  Salaries 
<br/>Commission was there, they were able to look at the market.  Honourable Usamate suddenly said 
<br/>that  we  need  to  hire  good  people.    He  is  assuming  that  the  members  of  the  Higher  Salaries 
<br/>Commission that this Government is going to appoint will not have that kind of experience.  That is 
<br/>the assumption he is making. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- How do you know? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because they were practising cronyism and nepotism.  They 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were appointing people who were not qualified . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Fiji Airways Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were so used to discretionary powers. 
<br/></span></div>
