<h3>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on  11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 20/2023) be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the High Court 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill, 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.  The 
<br/>High Court Act 1875 provides for the establishment of the High Court of Justice for Fiji.  In 2021, 
<br/>the High Court (Amendment) Act 2021, amended the Act and the Magistrate Court Act of 1944 to 
<br/>establish the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Anti-Corruption Division of the 
<br/>Magistrate Court respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  way  of  background,  Fiji  had  ratified  the  United  Nations  Convention 
<br/>Against Corruption in 2008.  Consequently, we all set up the Fiji Independent Commission Against 
<br/>Corruption (FICAC) committed to effectively combat corruption in order to promote transparency 
<br/>and  accountability  for  the  attainment  of  zero  tolerance  of  corruption,  set  the  foundation  for  good 
<br/>governance and create sustainable development for the benefit of all citizens of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned by my predecessor in this august Parliament when the 2021 amendment was 
<br/>being updated upon, the 2021 amendment was to allow the consistent application of anti-corruption 
<br/>Jurisprudence in relation to corruption cases, the specialisation of Judges and Magistrates in anti-
<br/>corruption law and the adherence to international norms and standards to anti-corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the consistent application of anti-corruption jurisprudence 
<br/>in relation to corruption cases, what is to say that it would not be developed if the anti-corruption 
<br/>matters were not presided over in the normal courts.  If anything, by allowing all normal courts to 
<br/>consider anti-corruption matters, this would allow for Judges and Magistrates to further learn and 
<br/>develop the jurisprudence and learning on any anti-corruption matter, as the current case as it be.  For 
<br/>example, all Magistrates hear family, civil matters and they also hear criminal matters.  There is no 
<br/>distinction in the type of criminal matters whether it is anti-corruption or any other offences that is 
<br/>covered under the Crimes Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  2021  amendment  was  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of  the 
<br/></span><span>specialised Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and Magistrate Court in Fiji, in practice, this 
<br/></span><span>has not been the case.  There are currently two specialised anti-corruption courts, and both of these 
<br/>are in Suva.  This has meant that for the jurisdictions where there are no specialised courts, such as 
<br/>the outer jurisdictions, the same Judges and Magistrates who hear general, criminal or civil matters 
<br/>will also preside over anti-corruption matters.  This essentially defeats the whole purpose of having 
<br/>specialised and anti-corruption courts. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1857 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned during the debate in the 2021 amendment, 17 countries had established specific 
<br/>anti-corruption  courts.    While  we,  as  a  country  should  always  strive  for  the  development  and 
<br/>betterment  of  our  legal  system  and  its  jurisprudence,  it  is  also  important  to  contextualise  the 
<br/>application of international legal norms and the standards of our national legal systems noting its 
<br/>peculiarity to a country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we do not have specialised courts in Fiji, such as, Family Courts, Tax 
<br/>Tribunal and Employment Relation Courts, these courts were established by reason of necessity, and 
<br/>more so, the volume of matters that had to be specifically considered within these specialised courts.  
<br/>The same cannot be said for the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court 
<br/>Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 1</span><span>st</span><span> May to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July this year, during the fourth quarter, the Investigation Department of 
<br/>FICAC recorded a total of 280 matters.  Of these 280 matters, 265 matters were carried forward from 
<br/>previous quarters, the Legal and Prosecution Department of FICAC had also provided that as of 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>July this year, there are 180 cases pending before the courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially it is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is less corruption-related cases being filed on a 
<br/>day-to-day  basis.  With  180  pending  cases  before  the  courts,  this  is  not  a  great  number  that  it 
<br/>warranted the establishment of a specialised court.  If anything, there should have been consideration 
<br/>for the establishment of specialised courts for serious sexual offences.  For instance, as per the rape 
<br/>and sexual offences statistics released by the Office of the Director Public Prosecution in 2020, 246 
<br/>people were charged with a total of 531 counts of sexual offences.  In 2021, 203 people were charged 
<br/>with a total of 461 counts of sexual offences. In 2022, 302 people were charged with a total of 768 
<br/>counts of serious sexual offences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if anything, this alarming statistics should have warranted the establishment 
<br/>of a specialised sexual offences court.  While the 2021 Amendment was purportedly to address issues 
<br/>of  inefficiencies,  lengthy  litigation  and  backlog  of  cases  clearly  as  per  the  statistics  provided  by 
<br/>FICAC, unfortunately, this has not been the case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another point to  note is that while the 2021 Amendment established the 
<br/>Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court, with the matters appealed to 
<br/>the  Court  of  Appeal  and  Supreme  Court,  it  would  still  be  heard  with  other  matters  by  the  same 
<br/>appellate Judges, as other Appellate Judges have not been specialised to reflect the Anti-Corruption 
<br/>Division  as  established  for  the  lower  courts.  There  is  also  the  argument  that  the  Anti-Corruption 
<br/>Courts duplicate the already existing courts that have potentially led to a wastage of what is already 
<br/>much needed resources in our courts system. Corruption matters can be handled within our existing 
<br/>court framework without the need of specialised courts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The resources that had been used for the maintenance of the anti-corruption court could be 
<br/>and  should  be  used  to  strengthen  the  justice  system  as  a  whole,  including  the  training  of  judges, 
<br/>prosecutors as the case may be.  Accordingly, the Bill seeks to amend the High Court Act 1875 to 
<br/>disestablish the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court respectively. 
<br/>As already stated on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been consultations 
<br/></span><span>with the Office of the Chief Registrar, Office of the Solicitor-General and also public consultations 
<br/></span><span>were held in Suva, Nadi and Labasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, noting the intention of the 2021 Amendment, it has not provided specific 
<br/>improvement.  May I say again, it has not provided specific improvement to the administration for 
<br/>dealing  with  anti-corruption  matters.    For  this  reason,  it  is  imperative  that  the  Anti-Corruption 
<br/>Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court should be disestablished. Accordingly, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>
<div><span>1858 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and the debate will 
<br/>be limited to one hour only.  The Secretary-General of Parliament will be doing the timing, as usual, 
<br/>and I think we each will be provided seven minutes at least, six minutes first bell sounds and then the 
<br/>balance will be sounded on the second bell.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have one speaker from Government and three from the Opposition.  Honourable Bulitavu 
<br/>will lead the batting followed by honourable Ratu Niudamu before the honourable Minister for Lands 
<br/>will be making his contribution and then the honourable Leader of the Opposition could be rounding 
<br/>it off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  provide  a  brief  contribution  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion that is before Parliament and that is the High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Sir, FICAC has been subject to plenty political debates in the past and in the present.  
<br/>We have heard and I have quoted the honourable Attorney-General from a few months ago after he 
<br/>had labelled FICAC as being weaponised by the previous government.  But again, FICAC has got a 
<br/>purpose and as he had rightly stated, it was part of the 2008 United Nations Convention Against 
<br/>Corruption when we ratified that.  It was part of the 2013 Constitution and also moving forward like 
<br/>other  jurisdictions,  there  are  17  jurisdictions  around  the  world  that  have  special  Anti-Corruption 
<br/>Courts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> We followed suit in 2021 with the idea that has been alluded to by the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and as stated by the mover of the motion then the former Attorney-General, which was to 
<br/>improve  consistency  in  the  jurisprudence  of  the  Court  and  also  the  backlog.    But  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has stated that administratively, from what they have seen after implementation, 
<br/>there is no problem.  But again, from this side of Parliament, I would suggest we give it a time again 
<br/>given that we could see other jurisdictions - how they move forward after taking that second step we 
<br/>did in 2021 after domestication, and our commitment to those international treaties. Now we can put 
<br/>more resources into a court system so as to improve the deliverables of a FICAC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, as part of the functions of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law, and Human Rights, 
<br/>we deal with the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Annual Reports. We have also 
<br/>heard from the former Commissioner for FICAC and the various developments that is happening in 
<br/>FICAC, and how to achieve its vision and mission and that is to provide an anti-corruption society.   
<br/>We have various programmes like the Good Kiddo Programmes and other awareness programs that 
<br/>is done in public with members of the public.  Various Government Ministries have also developed 
<br/>their own Anti-Corruption Policies and Booklets.  These are all measures in place that have helped 
<br/>awareness on how to reduce corruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Attorney-General  said  that the number of  cases  that is gone before the 
<br/>Court has really gone down.  It also shows the hard work that is being done by FICAC.  And how to 
<br/>take  FICAC  to  another  level  is  the  duty  that  the  honourable  Minister  is  tasked  to  do  given  this 
<br/>independent body reports under him.   But again, more resources can be put there and we can develop 
<br/></span><span>jurisprudence  in  this  particular  Division  of  the  Court  where  we  can  get  more  specialist  Judges, 
<br/></span><span>Magistrates and other technical aspects of that. Look at how other jurisdictions have developed after 
<br/>they have established this specialised Division of their Courts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that analysis can be done and assessment, then we will be in a better position after you have 
<br/>taken this bold step.  Again, he has mentioned there could be other areas we can move into like the 
<br/>Sexual Offences Court and other special Courts but those are things that should improve our Court 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1859 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>system, that the honourable Attorney-General after this consultation will know that there is much 
<br/>needed resources in the Court system in order for cases to be dealt with much more quicker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are a few things that I would like to share but this side of Parliament is of the view that 
<br/>is  to  give  more  time  to  this  independent  institution  given  our  commitment  to  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Concession for Corruption. Also, we can resource this more but one of the reasons is stated in the 
<br/>background of the Bill - the difficulties that they have in this particular Anti-Corruption Division and 
<br/>proceedings  in  outer  islands  -  that  could  be  improved  by  putting  more  budget  in  this  particular 
<br/>institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill No. 20 of 2023 regarding an amendment to the High Court Act 1875.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the honourable Attorney-General’s submission to this august 
<br/>Parliament this afternoon regarding the background of this Bill, I have some reservations.  As alluded to 
<br/>earlier by honourable Bulitavu it is not only the first time for a specialised court to be established in Fiji.  
<br/>We  understand  that  there  is  a  Family  Division  of  the  High  Court,  the  Court  of  Review  which  was 
<br/>established under the Customs Act, the Tax Court which was established under the Tax Administration 
<br/>Act  of  2009  and  most  recently,  the  Employment  Relations  Court  which  is  under  the  Employment 
<br/>Relations Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it is not only about the specialisation of Judges and Magistrates, but I believe it is the 
<br/>workload of Judges and Magistrates. To date, we have seen that pending cases are still in Court backdated 
<br/>to 2019 and some to 2016. With this Bill being enacted, all these cases will be transferred back to the 
<br/>normal courts, and it will create more workload for the Judges and Magistrates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  read  the  Background  of  this  Bill  and  one  of  the  main  issues  which  came  up  in  the 
<br/>background  which  I  have  read,  is  the  instances  which  were  dealt  with  outside  the  respective  Anti-
<br/>Corruption Division, such as proceedings in the outer islands.   I believe there are not many FICAC cases 
<br/>because offenders of this nature are white collar crimes, mostly in our towns and cities.  Therefore, for 
<br/>example, someone staying in Rakiraki would have to travel from Rakiraki to Lautoka High Court which 
<br/>is the only High Court in the Western Division, just for his anti-corruption case to be heard in the normal 
<br/>courts.    There  are  already  pending  criminal  cases.    Magistrates  already  have  pending  family,  civil, 
<br/>criminal cases and on top of that, these anti-corruption cases will come up again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with honourable Bulitavu that the honourable Attorney-General should review this Bill 
<br/>again or, if he can, give some more time for this Bill to be considered, particularly if the views of the 
<br/>Judges and Magistrates can be heard.  From my experience in going to Court nowadays, accused persons 
<br/>are also complaining.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a legal maxim that "justice delayed is justice denied".  If 
<br/>the Government comes up with this Bill to be enacted, I ask the honourable Attorney-General to consider 
<br/>the backlog which is currently in our normal courts so that the accused or the suspects are not affected by 
<br/>these changes.  That is my contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers and honourable 
<br/></span><span>Members of Parliament and people of Fiji; we started off with a very serious Bill this afternoon, so 
<br/></span><span>before I participate on that Bill, I have been told that I have about seven minutes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, let me take some time, Mr. Speaker, with your leave.   I know we have had some 
<br/>special mentions this week at Parliament, with birthdays of two of our Members of Parliament - the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; not to 
<br/>mention  the  acknowledgement  and  congratulatory  remarks  made  by  honourable  Bainivalu  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1860 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>winning QVS Deans team and acknowledging Natabua.  For the first time and historically, Natabua 
<br/>reached the Deans final, which is an achievement on its own, so we congratulate them, and I think 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister also congratulated the Natabua Team and its management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr Speaker, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate Suva Grammar School for 
<br/>their feat in winning the four netball titles that was available in the girl’s grade under 14, under 15, 
<br/>under 17 and under 19, which is a clean sweep for Suva Grammar in 2023.  I do not know whether 
<br/>it has happened in the past and I do declare my interest because my daughter plays in one of those 
<br/>teams.  I take this time to acknowledge both the players, the support of the Principal and the staff, 
<br/>master  Navi  specifically  and  not  forgetting  the  SGS  rise  up  and  the  old  scholars.    In  my  next 
<br/>contribution I will mention Suva Grammar again so I think I will leave that for then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, on the 3</span><span>rd</span><span> of March 2021, I wrote an opinion soon after I think, this amendment 
<br/>took its passage through Parliament in February, if I am not wrong, of that year.  I mentioned that the 
<br/>Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrates Court was not warranted in 2021, 
<br/>and I did not see any significant reason why it is even warranted now.  I will explain, Mr Speaker, to 
<br/>the benefit of this Parliament, the reason why I say those comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly Mr Speaker, when that Bill went into Parliament or came through Parliament in 2021, 
<br/>I suspected that no one who really practiced in the criminal corridors, was ever consulted.  Fiji Law 
<br/>Society (FLS) was not consulted which was at that time, the only body that a lot of lawyers were a 
<br/>part of, not to mention that there was a separate criminal bar that was not formerly an association, 
<br/>but we would meet quite often - normally across the coffee house at the FBC building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because  it  didn’t  have,  Mr  Speaker,  the  wide  consultation  that  this  Bill  has  had  in  this 
<br/>Parliament  today,  as  explained  by  the  honourable  Attorney  General,  at  that  time  (in  my  view)  it 
<br/>lacked the energy it needed for that Bill to take its course through Parliament in 2021. As I mentioned, 
<br/>and as alluded to by the honourable Attorney General this Bill has had consultation.  The Fiji Law 
<br/>Society has been consulted, practitioners have been consulted and various stakeholders had also been 
<br/>consulted before Government decided to bring this into Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC was also established as a Decree No. 11 in 2007 and it commenced 
<br/>on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2007.  So contrary to the belief that was held by the two previous speakers we did that 
<br/>because we ratified the anti-corruption convention by the UN.   The UN Anti-Corruption ratification 
<br/>came in 2008, we started FICACA in 2007.   What was really the reason for the establishment of 
<br/>FICAC as an anti-rot body?  It was seen to be a flagship of the Bainimarama Government at that 
<br/>time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you remember Mr. Speaker, Sir, at that time, it seemed to have been one of the things they 
<br/>had to check off, that they had now satisfied one of the reasons why the overthrow of a properly 
<br/>elected government was done in the previous year in the month of December.  Two years later in 
<br/>2009, they threw away a properly consulted Constitution of 1997. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Mr. Speaker, even way, way back then in 2007, they did not see it fit, even at that time, 
<br/>to establish the accompanying specialised courts.  It took the FijiFirst Government almost 14 years 
<br/></span><span>later to finally decide (wait hold on a minute, we have got an anti-rot body) we need anti-rot courts.  
<br/></span><span>That  is  what  happened in  2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, fourteen years later, it is  flabbergasting for the 
<br/>government in 2021 to cook up an anti-corruption court to supplement the work of the anti-corruption 
<br/>body that they established 14 years previously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why do we need specialised courts?  What usually triggers a country to set 
<br/>up these specialised courts?  We have specialised courts and the two previous speakers have alluded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1861 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to that - the Family Court and the Employment Court.  We also have the Juvenile Court, but what is 
<br/>peculiar about these courts is when the enabling issue legislation is enacted, it brings the courts with 
<br/>it.  That is what happened and that is what did not happen in these anti-corruption regime that we are 
<br/>talking about today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the reasons why specialised courts are usually established is because there has to be a 
<br/></span><span>bona fide</span><span> reason, not just reason.  A </span><span>bona fide</span><span> reason why it should be established.  For example, one 
<br/>of the reasons why specialised courts are established is because a government might find if there is 
<br/>an increase in offending of a type of offence or similar offences of similar nature.  For example, when 
<br/>a Bill  to  introduce the  Anti-Corruption Division  of the  High Court  at  that  time in  2021,  Fiji  was 
<br/>facing horrendous statistics on sexual offences, rapes, indecent assault and even minor acts, domestic 
<br/>violence against women, young girls and the vulnerable of our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second reason I want to express here today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is when there is a need for 
<br/>specialised courts, there has to be trainings that has to accompany the setting up of those courts and 
<br/>respective judges, staff, prosecutors and all the players that are involved.  Again, for example, when 
<br/>a child complainant in a sexual offence is giving evidence, there has to be special mechanism built 
<br/>around the courts to ensure that a degree of sensitivity is afforded to those who are participating in 
<br/>the trial.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special playrooms, for example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here in Suva have to be set up so that young 
<br/>victims are able to be accommodated next to their best environment when they are giving evidence.  
<br/>Other issues like recordings and camera or proceedings in camera, and separators to stop the line of 
<br/>3.09:31 from victims to see the perpetrators.  These are all things that specialised courts have to go 
<br/>through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you round off, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.-  The long  and short answer to  this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  that 
<br/>there is no justification for the establishment of anti-corruption division of courts.  And I say this out 
<br/>of experience Mr. Speaker, Sir.  When someone, for example,  from  Rakiraki  is  charged fresh by 
<br/>FICAC, that person has to be taken to Ba or if the Ba Magistrates Court is not sitting, all the way to 
<br/>Lautoka just for a five-minute appeal. Who does it cost? It cost taxpayers because they have to be 
<br/>transported all the way to Ba.  If Ba Magistrates Court is not sitting all the way to Lautoka. Nadi for 
<br/>example Mr. Speaker, if someone is charged in Nadi all the way to Lautoka Magistrates Court who 
<br/>is authorised to sit at Anti-Corruption magistrate, not there but all the way to Ba. It costs to set-up 
<br/>these specialised courts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For that reason, Mr. Speaker, these offences are not new, they have always been there in the 
<br/>penal code, in the prevention of bribery offences, always been there nothing special about these cases. 
<br/>They can be prosecuted like every other offence and so there is no reason why Mr. Speaker, the Anti-
<br/>Corruption division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court should be maintained, it should be 
<br/>returned back as normal. All the Magistrates and the judges can deal with them and also will be able 
<br/>to accumulate the experience that is needed in their own personal development as judicial officers. I 
<br/>support the Bill Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Three lawyers have spoken and thank you  for  allowing a bush 
<br/>lawyer to also contribute to the motion in the Parliament. My simple question is, is it a problem of 
<br/>the law itself, the act itself or is it the process that enables this law to operate effectively? I ask that 
<br/>question again, is it a question about the law itself or is it a question about the effectiveness of the 
<br/>administrative system that is to support this law so that it can be effective.

<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  assure  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands  that  this  is  not  something  that  was  just 
<br/>cooked up by the Fiji First Government in 2021 and I will refer to this consultation document that 
<br/>was done in 2007 before the establishment of FICAC and of course it talks about the effectiveness 
<br/>of Fiji’s legal system as well. So, it is nothing that was cooked up by the Fiji First Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Consultation was cooked up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This consultation is more reliable than the last economic summit 
<br/>where you only have one, two, sometimes no attendance at all Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is more than a 
<br/>thousand consultations throughout Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- False participation. Justify the coup. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  The  effectiveness  of  Fiji’s  legal  system,  I  will  not  go  into  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>details.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Why did it take14 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  hope  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands  is 
<br/>aware of the BT 1994 report, the Commission of enquiry report by justice John Corners. This are 
<br/>some of the reference materials used in this document that led to the formation of the Anti-Corruption 
<br/>Court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Anti-Corruption Community, what did they recommend?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  You  have  talked  about  the  rectification,  I  will  not  go  into  the 
<br/>rectification  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but  this  is  what  I  want  to  read  to  the  honourable  Minister  and  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney General, page 121 of this document, if you are interested, I suggest you read 
<br/>this document. It talks about specialised courts. this is what it says, the issue of creating specialised 
<br/>courts  has  also  been  raised  as  one  way  of  assisting  the  people  of  Fiji  by  giving  particular  and 
<br/>specialised attention to specific sorts of legal cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 14  years took too long. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- But nothing cooked up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Domestic violence cause.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You focus on environmental issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is already a specialised division of the Courts to deal with family and juvenile matters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This gave birth to the Charter ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Charter did not ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  The  recent  Employment  Promulgation  establishes  a  separate 
<br/>division for employment matters. This is it, Sir, FICAC supports the creation of a corruption division 
<br/>of the High Court. In relation to specialisation in the High Court Beattie concluded that administrative 
<br/>divisions in the High Court stating that the better approach” this is, why I asked is it about the law or 
<br/>is it about the processes and systems and the resources that have to support it in order for it to be 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1863 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>effective?  This  is  what  Beattie said, ‘that it was not  desirable to  create  a separate civil,  criminal, 
<br/>commercial, family and administrative division in the High Court stating that the better approach 
<br/>was  that  a  reasonable  degree  of  specialisation  should  be  encouraged  whenever  practicable  on  an 
<br/>administrative basis.  On an administrative basis whenever it is practicable, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My simple question is, again, is it about the law or is it about the processes and the resources 
<br/>as already alluded to by honourable Bulitavu.  Because it was just during FijiFirst days that we are 
<br/>dismantling it.  We are here for the future of Fiji. We need that effective court systems to support 
<br/>investment in the country and these are avenues that bring investor confidence into the country, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Let us not be short-sighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Cut out the politics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Carry on, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us look at the national interest. Let us look at 
<br/>how this will benefit every Fijian at most particularly creating that environment that investor friendly 
<br/>environment so that we can grow the economy, so that we can employ more people, so that we can 
<br/>do  more  development  and  most  importantly  create  that  better  Fiji  that  we  want.  Thank  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may first reply to the issue of delay. Yes, the 
<br/>issue of delay in our court system is systematic, it is chronic because it is based on the resources, it 
<br/>is based on the system and processes. As for the Western Division there is a new Court in Ba which 
<br/>will be opened this year and honourable Niudamu is fully aware that there will be a High Court sitting 
<br/>in Ba for the first time, that will be addressed in terms of the issue of delay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Chief Justice is putting in place processes into improving the disposition of 
<br/>matters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may address this, this is the first time ever for a Chief Justice in his 
<br/>Acting capacity has personally audited the files of all judicial officers in this nation.  He is fully aware 
<br/>how many pending matters Justice A has, the length of those matters and some of these processes 
<br/>have been put in place. Some of them have been directed to finish those pending matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, we all know at the Summit it was clearly outlined that it can only have confidence in a 
<br/>judicial system if there is a rule of law, if people can see that the matters are concluded. Government 
<br/>is trying its best, of course, you have seen there is a new Justice of Court of Appeal and Supreme 
<br/>Judges who have been sworn in and there will be more. But what I can tell you is this, this side of 
<br/>Parliament  have  localised  emergency.    That  is  the  achievement  we  have  made  because  I  firmly 
<br/>believe and we also believe that we cannot allow to pay exorbitant salaries to people who are not 
<br/></span><span>residents when we have oversupply of lawyers and experienced lawyers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a fact, and if you ask about poverty that is one simple reason and I can tell you, I really 
<br/>do not want to divulge the details but it is so unfair.  I say this because I am the one who was affected, 
<br/>we found out that the local Judges, Magistrates terms and conditions of employment are not as the 
<br/>same as those who are from overseas. Yes, data Mr. Speaker, Sir, specialize court is only warranted 
<br/>if there is data it is simple, if there is not data to justify a special court, Mr. Vosarogo has outlined

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clearly the issue of people traveling from one end of the town to the other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I actually had a personal experience, first I was told I have a client in Nadi to be produced in 
<br/>Nadi, as I was getting ready I was told ‘you have to go to Lautoka’ then in 10 minutes’ time I was 
<br/>told ‘go to Ba’, and I had to rush from Nadi to Ba and I have had to go and wait for the FICAC 
<br/>Officers to arrive, about two vehicles and it did not last than five minutes for that matter, so these are 
<br/>the problems.   And mind you, my colleagues from the other side, there has been a consultation within 
<br/>the Judiciary, support from the Judges and also from the Chief Justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bill before this Parliament.
