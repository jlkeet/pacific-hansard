<h3>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 23/2023), be debated and voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the State Lands 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill  2023 which was tabled in  Parliament  on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.  The 
<br/>State Lands Act 1945 provides for the administration of State land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 13 of the Act deals with protection leases.  At the outset, this should 
<br/>be a clear indication of the sensitivities surrounding leases under the Act.  What was done through 
<br/>the State Land (Budget Amendment) Act 2021 was to remove the requirement of obtaining consent 
<br/>from the Director of Lands for any mortgage, charge, pledge, caveat or for any such lease to be dealt 
<br/>with by any court of law or under the process of any court of law with the least amount of consultation 
<br/>ought not to have been done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2021 Amendment Act also amended section 13 of the Act to provide 
<br/>the consent of the Director can only be refused where there is a breach of any lease condition or 
<br/>where such application to deal with the land is not in accordance with the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in 2022, section 16 of the Act was amended.  It deals with who may now be 
<br/>lessee or lessors. The State Lands (Amendment) Act 2022 amended the Act to empower the Director 
<br/>to re-enter land and cancel any lease, licence or approval notice of lease in instances where occupants 
<br/>of the land have as a result of dispossession of land or due to political upheaval or cancellation or 
<br/>non-renewal of their leases or licenses resorted to seek refuge on the land for which they were not 
<br/>lessees under the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In these instances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lessees permitted such persons to use the land it did 
<br/>not obtain the consent of the Director, making the arrangement unlawful under the Act. In effect, this 
<br/>amendment in a way regularises what in fact were illegal arrangements by allowing the Director to 
<br/>re-enter land and cancel the lease license or approve the notice of lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be remiss of me not to state this fact outright.  A Committee then 
<br/>was set up to confirm the contravention of section 16 when in fact the Act provides for the process 
<br/>to  be  followed.  Let  me  repeat  again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  Committee  was  setup  to  confirm  the 
<br/>contravention of section 16 when in fact the Act already has a process to be followed. This Committee 
<br/>has not sat nor heard any such application to-date and therefore have no added value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, therefore, seeks to ensure that the amendment made in 2021 and 2022 are removed 
<br/></span><span>to respect the status quo that existed prior to these amendments.  Sir, from the Government’s end, 
<br/>there were wider consultations on the Bill and based on the outcome of these consultations, this Bill 
<br/>is  now being  introduced in  Parliament.  On Monday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  had highlighted the key 
<br/>provisions or salient provisions of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  As 
<br/>usual, just take note of the one hour and the seven minutes allocated for each speaker as well.  I have 
<br/>in front of me a list of speakers who have been identified by the Whips. There are two speakers from 
<br/>the Government side – honourable Vosarogo and honourable Kamikamica.  From the Opposition is 
<br/>honourable Kirpal and honourable Koya.  We will try and alternate the speakers before the Right of 
<br/>Reply is given.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to Bill 23 of 2023 for an Act to 
<br/>amend the State Lands Act which was introduced to this august Parliament.  In fact, the two Bills 
<br/>which were introduced, one was Bill No. 26 of 2022 and the was Bill No.16 of 2021.   Firstly, I will 
<br/>be  speaking  on  Bill  No.  16  of  2021  which  is  introduced  by  Bill  No.  23  of  2023.    This  Bill  was 
<br/>supposed to help the poor Fijian in a proactive manner to secure mortgage from financial institutions 
<br/>and caveat without any hindrance or running around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lessee secures the lease from the Ministry of Lands that is the custodian 
<br/>of all State lands in Fiji.  Once the registered lease is given to an individual, the leasehold title is an 
<br/>interest in land entitles the lessee an indefeasible right to use and hold the property; right to use or 
<br/>occupy the property for a specific period and the lessees of the said property has all the right to enjoy 
<br/>the term of lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the lessees of State land wishes to get a loan from financial institutes or 
<br/>banks, Bill No. 16 of 2022 made it easier as the lessee can mortgage their lease to the lending institute 
<br/>and get the loan in the short period of time, without running around to the solicitors to act for them, 
<br/>and  also  save  money  in  the  form  of  fees  from  the  Ministry  of  Lands.    For  the  poor  State  land 
<br/>agricultural farmers like sugarcane farmers who take a few thousand dollars of loan for a short period 
<br/>of time due to some urgent need were given relief of not paying unnecessary consent fee of $115.  It 
<br/>was a burden on the poor lessees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just have learnt that even though this Bill has not been enacted or passed, 
<br/>there has been a fee schedule already with the Ministry of Lands which was sent to me.  It seems that 
<br/>the Government is more of getting revenue than helping the poor farmers or the poor people.    This 
<br/>is between the lessee and the lending institute, nothing to do with the lessors of the land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lessees take the loan as per lessee’s interest in the remaining term of the lease.  If the lessee 
<br/>fails  to  repay,  the  onus  will  be  on  the  lending  institute  to  recover,  but  it  does  not  affect  the 
<br/>Government being the lessor, as they will get the rental, premium as per in the lease condition and 
<br/>reassessment of rental will take place normally.  It does not affect or decrease the value of the land, 
<br/>if you do not take consent for mortgage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know very well being a Minister for Lands, I was a junior staff in 
<br/>the Ministry, both of us are valuers by profession and not forgetting politician too.  Is the Coalition 
<br/>Government  giving  extra  burden  to  our  Fijian  people  by  amending  the  State  Lands  Act  to  make 
<br/>money in the form of fees when the price of goods have increased and the increase in VAT is already 
<br/>affecting the poor people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- The Bill also boosts investor confidence level in State lands since no 
<br/>investor wants to waste time.  They want to get on with the investment project.  The consent takes 
<br/>weeks and  months, and  it is  a waste of time.  The other consents  are still intact  such as transfer, 
<br/>rezoning, subletting, sale, subleasing, building, et cetera, as these have a direct impact on the Director 
<br/>of Lands being the lessor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1879 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other Bill which is the amendment where the Committee was formed to regularise the 
<br/>informal settlements on State land.  Regarding informal tenants and houses, majority of the houses 
<br/>are on agricultural land, and we have seen that they have been living there for ages.  They have water 
<br/>metre and EFL connections.  To regularise them and give them a title which will benefit them, they 
<br/>can take a loan to have a good house, and with a good title means they will be living healthy lives 
<br/>because they will have a house which they can build in accordance with the building plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was the reason for having the Committee to regularise the informal settlements.  If you 
<br/>go anywhere in the Western Division, you will see that in the agricultural holdings there are more 
<br/>than two houses where one house is for the owner.  The lessees have sold the land illegally.  So, it 
<br/>was  to  regularise  the  tenants  who  were  sitting  there  to  give  them  good  tenants.    In  that  way,  the 
<br/>Government will get revenue in the form of rental when it is regularised and subdivided, and a good 
<br/>title is given to them.  This was a wise thing which the government was doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to reconsider the Bill No. 23 of 2023 as it does not 
<br/>have any adverse effect to any stakeholders, but in fact it encourages other Fijians to lease land.  It 
<br/>increases the value of the land and in return, the State benefits in land rental which is a Government 
<br/>revenue.    The  current  Act  reduces  unnecessary  running  around  for  any  Fijian  lessee  and  for  the 
<br/>betterment of all stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you want the real truth and reconciliation, it should start from this Bill if 
<br/>the Government wants to serve the people of Fiji.  With those views, I oppose the motion before this 
<br/>Chamber. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Again,  thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to 
<br/>address Parliament on the Bill that is presently being debated.  I mentioned that my acknowledgment 
<br/>for this afternoon has finished, I was just remined Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I apologise by honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau, I am sure that I am going to be supported by honourable Naivalurua to acknowledge again 
<br/>in basketball, Suva Grammar School wining the three girls’ titles that was fought over the school 
<br/>break.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  Ministers  in  Cabinet  and  Members  of  Parliament,  I  rise  to 
<br/>present my contribution to the State Lands (Amendment) Bill tabled before Parliament.  This Bill is 
<br/>fundamental  to  the effective and efficient  administration of State Land in Fiji  whereby the safety 
<br/>mechanism is reinstated to safeguard not only the State Land leases but also to ensure that financial 
<br/>institutions have given money or lent money for investments are protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendment made by Act No. 21 of 2021 have lessen the authority of the Director of 
<br/>Lands  as  provided  for  under  section  13(1)  and  that  section  essentially  prohibits  any  lessees  from 
<br/>dealing  with  any  leases  without  the  consent  of  the  Director  of  Lands  first  being  obtained.    By 
<br/>background Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the other side of Act No. 22 which we have appealed on the 
<br/>previous sitting of Parliament, so this cousin of that Act needs to go out as well because you cannot 
<br/>have two land tenure and management system at the same time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment made by Act No. 21 of 2021 allows for lessees to go directly 
<br/></span><span>to the banks, lending institutions without the Director’s consent to use lease as a collateral for their 
<br/>borrowing.  Therefore, that Amendment brought about by section 21 has impeded or affected the 
<br/>Director of Lands’ powers under the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the commencement of Act No. 21 of 2021, revenue generated from 
<br/>fees that are paid for application of consent have really taken a drastic turn.  For example, if I can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>1880 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>take two years of each, post the introduction of the Act and two years up until now.  In 2019 and 
<br/>2020, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources was able to receipt $48,087 from 109 consent 
<br/>applications received from lessees.  In the two years post the 2021 Act coming into force, just below 
<br/>$8,000 was recorded as revenue.  So, a total loss to Government coffers of $40,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also important Mr. Speaker, Sir, to note that lending institutions have now assumed risks 
<br/>of verifying companies and individuals who have come to them for mortgages.  Furthermore, after 
<br/>the implementation of Act No. 21 of 2021 lending institutions raised their concerns with the Office 
<br/>of the Director of Lands in relation to the security in their investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry in consultation with Association of Banks in Fiji then agreed 
<br/>to formulate a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate data sharing through an online portal daily 
<br/>so that they could both understand the dealings that are taking place between those who lease and the 
<br/>banks who provide the funds over the lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is justification, Mr. Speaker, for repealing the State Lands (Amendment) Act 2022, in 
<br/>particular, the insertion of section 16(4) by Act No. 26 of 2022 effectively meant that the Director 
<br/>can re-enter land and or cancel lease provided there are no encumbrances on the land.  This was in 
<br/>contradiction to the previous process of the Ministry whereby if there is even encumbrance on the 
<br/>land, the Director of Lands could still re-enter the land and recover what is owed to the State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Committee to this date, Mr. Speaker, has not resolved any issues or cleared any case 
<br/>presented for its consideration.  This august House needs to be informed that even after being tabled 
<br/>before the Committee, applications still need and require the Director of Lands’ endorsement and 
<br/>following through with the relevant process. So, it is just an addition to bureaucratic processes that 
<br/>are not good for good governance.  Sir, it does not really streamline the processes but indirectly add 
<br/>another layer of bureaucracy to the existing process that was there before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we often say this, “when it is not bad, do not fix it”. There was nothing wrong 
<br/>with the processes that were there before.  The Director of Lands was capable and indeed carried out 
<br/>the job.  When there, he or she finds that there are illegal occupation of land and if there needs to be 
<br/>rectification or regularisation, that was processed before because it was within the Director of Lands’ 
<br/>powers to decide what to do in order to regularise them.  So, we say, Sir, that because it was totally 
<br/>unnecessary  to  begin  with,  it  is  not  necessary  to  maintain  it.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully  and 
<br/>wholeheartedly support the Bill that is before Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, just a little comment in response to the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Lands, he said there were some $40,000 that was being collected with respect to consent fees and 
<br/>then when this amendment came about, it was reduced to $8,000.  It is a small price to pay with 
<br/>respect to facilitation in terms of investment and in terms of those that were dispossessed off their 
<br/>land.  I think that is a small price to pay if you really, really look at it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  you  will  be  well  aware  of  this  Bill  because  you  made  a  very  historical 
<br/>contribution on this when it was on the floor.  For those who were not here in Parliament when that 
<br/>took place, this was borne out of the proposition that a lot of people were dispossessed off their land 
<br/></span><span>whose leases were not renewed and, essentially, they became refugees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of farmers who own State Land had made arrangements with these people and said, 
<br/>“look give me $1,000 or so and you can put your house in the corner of that land.”  There are a lot of 
<br/>these cases especially in Nadi, as you are well aware, Sir, being a former Minister and also being 
<br/>quite aware of that particular circumstance, but you did make some references which I will refer to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1881 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what this amendment had done or sort to do was, for example, give the Director 
<br/>of Lands the ability to cancel the head lease or the lease itself to be able to issue separate leases for 
<br/>those people who had been living there </span><span>bona fide</span><span> since the land was given to them.  Again, obviously 
<br/>there was a particular system put in place that everyone is referred to with respect to a Committee 
<br/>that  was  chaired  by  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Housing  and  Community  Development  and 
<br/>consisted of the Permanent Secretary for Lands, Office of the Solicitor-General and anyone else, for 
<br/>example, who they wished to include in that Committee, maybe the Director of Town and Country 
<br/>Planning, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once they established this in a particular area and sold off the land to these people, albeit illegally 
<br/>under the law as technically speaking, they had been occupying this particular piece of land for maybe 
<br/>30 or 40 years, they will then be able to cancel the original lease and be able to issue these leases with the 
<br/>Director of Lands.  He or she will be able to do that, so it is being facilitated to those that were actually 
<br/>living on the land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is essentially what this did, Mr. Speaker.  Obviously, we cannot cancel the lease if there is 
<br/>an encumbrance on it.  If there is a mortgage on it, or a caveat on it, then those legal issues need to be 
<br/>taken care of before any new leases were issued.  Consultations did take place at that time when the 
<br/>amendment was done, with many groups and various people made submissions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a lot of frustration on the ground with respect to this particular situation that is being 
<br/>referred to but what transpired was at that time the Director of Lands hands were tied.  She could not do 
<br/>anything, she could not move because the current law would not allow her to do it. A lot of people who 
<br/>actually just sold the land on that basis are nowhere to be found.  They had moved on or migrated so what 
<br/>are you supposed to do as they had allowed these people to build these houses on a particular piece of 
<br/>land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, let me just refer this Parliament to a lot of wisdom, we all know that.  He contributed at that 
<br/>time and said that in the introduction of the motion that is to do with this particular motion, we are trying 
<br/>to amend and provide areas of redress for people that are already there or to check out how they have 
<br/>come upon that particular piece of land. Specific reference was made to Malolo and other places that the 
<br/>honourable Speaker was actually quite aware of.  I think in the end, there was stark realisation as this 
<br/>needed to be done, it was facilitative and it is facilitative for those that become landers because of the law 
<br/>having also being out of pocket because they paid the person who actually had the lease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, the honourable Speaker showed a lot of wisdom at that particular time by saying 
<br/>that the Committee would need to do a lot of investigation - he supported the idea. As you can see, it was 
<br/>very bipartisan in terms of what was being done at that time.  You cannot portray that they did something 
<br/>wrong.  You have to look at the reasoning by which it was done.  There are also supposed to be regulations 
<br/>-  these  things  take  time  the  former  Minister  for  Lands  is  here.  Little  bit  more  consultations  and 
<br/>conversations and he would have been able to tell you how far things could have gone. There are a lot of 
<br/>findings that needed to come before everything was complete and hunky dory, so to speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in fact, what the amendment did then was give the Director of Lands the ability to 
<br/>issue another lease to these people lawfully whereas before, the hands of the female Director of Lands 
<br/></span><span>hands were tied.  She would get a lease done on that reject piece of land which they were occupied. Under 
<br/></span><span>the law because a person who owns his parcel of land, owns his lease under the law, they have to cancel 
<br/>the lease so no one can actually occupy that piece of land so literally they would be thrown out of that 
<br/>piece of land before anything could be done, you have to issue another lease over that whole land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for this, the Director for Lands can actually cancel the lease and these people would 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>still be protective because it does say so in the Bill itself.  I will actually quote what it says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>1882 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For the avoidance of any doubt, any occupant of the land referred to under this 
<br/>section  including  the  lessee  shall  remain  on  the  land,  subject  to  any  terms  and 
<br/>conditions  of  any  lease,  license  or  approval  notice  of  a  lease  granted  after  the 
<br/>enactment of the State Land Act.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no sinister move behind it, honourable Attorney General - nothing at all.  It was just 
<br/>being facilitative.  I think that is what the honourable Speaker, who was an MP then in the Opposition, 
<br/>caught on too - that it was being facilitative.  It was being of assistance to those who were basically 
<br/>lead up the garden path. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, just to qualify it also, this was not to do with squatters. This was actually to do 
<br/>with people who had gone to occupy the land because the original lessee allowed them to do so.  It 
<br/>was not that situation and that committee is useful.  We have to be very independent when we think 
<br/>about this. What was it for? there’s nothing sinister about it no power taken away from the Director 
<br/>of Lands like you might want to see it as.  It was not but in fact, it was empowering her more to do 
<br/>the right thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, with those few words, I do not support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  three  words  come  to  mind  when  I  am 
<br/>listening to the other side - grasping at straws.  The reason why I say that is very simple. As alluded 
<br/>to by honorable Vosarogo, the truth is this change was brought in on the back of the will go out at 
<br/>the back of Bill 17.  It was hidden in the Consequential Bill.  It was never discussed and all of a 
<br/>sudden, the change happened.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, true! True! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- As the honourable Vosarogo mentioned, this is the cousin 
<br/>or the brother or the sister of the other Bill and so in some respects Mr Speaker, Sir, the destination  
<br/>of this Bill or this Act that we have, would follow the same way as Bill No. 17.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to read to them what His Excellency the President said in his maiden speech, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  views  of  all  communities  must  be  heard  and  I  urge  the  people’s  coalition 
<br/>Government  to  ensure all  initiatives,  draft legislations, must go thorough consultation, 
<br/>process  for  better  outcomes,  to  ensure  inclusiveness,  foster  greater  ownership.  
<br/>Government  must  ensure  that  draft  laws  are  deliberated  in  consultation  with  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders  particularly  through  the  standing  committee  process,  petitions  must  be 
<br/>accommodated so that the views of the people must be heard in Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker Sir, we on this side of Parliament are doing our best to try and consult unlike that 
<br/>side of Parliament.  It is reflected in the statistics in terms of Standing Order 51.  As an example of 
<br/>our desire to consult, we heard the honourable Members on the other side about the need to look at 
<br/>the Heritage bill in a bipartisan manner, so we withdrew it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And so, Mr Speaker, before we talk about the detail of the Bill, the very fact that they did not 
<br/>consult is actually something we will need to bring out in this type of debate.  I can assure those on 
<br/>that side, for those of us, that might have Bills are coming through, we will endeavour to consult 
<br/>properly.  Apart from being the new Fiji, this is a new democracy that we are trying to promote in 
<br/>Fiji.

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1883 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is strange what they have done in the first amendment in section 13, and for the life of 
<br/>me, I am still trying to wonder why this was brought in.  I hope, in this term of Government, we 
<br/>will find out the real reason why this thing happened.  They were talking about poverty, but the 
<br/>irony is that the ITLTB process was a lot faster than this process.  I hope that they disclose the real 
<br/>reason before this side of the Parliament finds out the real reason.  We have some inkling…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- No consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  But  I  am  encouraging  them  to  self-disclose  before  we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disclose to the people of Fiji of what actually happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  the  Director  of  Lands  as  alluded  to  as  well  by 
<br/>honourable Vosarogo, perhaps we had given too much power to the Director of Lands through this 
<br/>amendment, and we are regularising that as well.  As we know Sir, too much power in one person’s 
<br/>hand can be very risky. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  ease  of  doing  business,  like  I  said  this  is  a  classic 
<br/>example of what they try and talk about, but they do not follow through.  This amendment created 
<br/>an  extra  process  or  additional  process  for  the  banks  to  follow  through  a  Memorandum  of 
<br/>Understanding (MOU), so this nonsense about being efficient, they are overlaying it with additional 
<br/>process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this Act came into being, it was full of contradictions.  There was no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparency, no consultation so like Bill 17 – it is gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  knows  about  it.    He  was  the  former  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  forgot  to  highlight  but  I  will  do  so  now.  
<br/>During the discussion of this Bill on 30</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2021, this august Parliament actually congratulated 
<br/>our seven gladiators winning the Olympics in Japan.  I also note there was a reference made by the 
<br/>other side that it was not part of the budget.  This is what I read about what the former Attorney-
<br/>General said: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament of the Friday 6</span><span>th</span><span> of July, 2022,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I move that the following Consequential Bills be debated, voted upon and passed … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Land (Budget Amendment) Bill 2021” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- …Who said that - a Point of Order, Sir… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one said that it was not part of the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is the Point of Order honourable Koya? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- SO 74(1)(a) – there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices 
<br/>of Parliament.  He is trying to mislead Parliament, because no one on this side said that it was not in 
<br/>the Budget.  I think either you misheard it…

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am still looking at this Standing Order, honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He is reading what is in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Practice of Parliament, I may raise a Point of Order?  There is a breach 
<br/>of  Standing  Order  or  practice  of  Parliament  and  that  is  a  breach  of  Parliament  practice  that  you 
<br/>mislead the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Sir,  the  point  here  is  that,  I  think  maybe  the  Attorney-General  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>misguided here, no one on this side of Parliament said that it was not part… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …he is reading the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I am reading the </span><span>Daily Hansard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, the statement before that, Sir, you said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- </span><span>Are yaar</span><span>, not a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Not </span><span>Are yaar, suno re…thora suno bhai… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not  a Point of Order, you are making a mountain out of a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>molehill.  All he did was pointing out a fact that it was part of the Consequential Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You made your point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I love the mountain out of a molehill - for eight years we sat here and he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>made so many mountains, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this  - because it came as part of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consequential Bill for Budget purposes, there was no consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The point is this, because it came as part of the consequential 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the Budget, there was no consultation, simple as that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, there was. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- If you look through my brief there was wider consultation, and may 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I refer to the honourable Usamate’s comment. Give me the opportunity and I will do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is this?  What did I say? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  The  </span><span>Daily  Hansard</span><span>  of  30</span><span>th</span><span>  July,  2021,  if  we  take  a  moment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Usamate said, and I quote:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1885 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I  fully  support  this  Bill  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  it  does  two  things.  First  it 
<br/>benefits the government and it benefits lessees in a short of time for them to process 
<br/>their dealings and also reduce backlog. Two, at the same time it does not compromise 
<br/>the status of government of the state as a landowner.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We just listened to honourable Vosarogo, we lost income, we created a committee, we did 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not deliberate, it did not work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is ridiculous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Fiji being a small island State cannot have two jurisprudence or two 
<br/>types of land dealings.  When you have </span><span>i Taukei</span><span> and land, it is too small - this Act has to be amended. 
<br/>This is what we campaigned for, and we are doing it today.  I commend this Bill to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
