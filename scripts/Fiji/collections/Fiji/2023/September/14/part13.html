<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  The  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  has  given  notice  to  make 
<br/>Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40.  The Minister may speak up to 20 minutes and after 
<br/>the Minister, I will invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement 
<br/>for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways to deliver his Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dredging and Engineering Works 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  make  a  Ministerial  Statement  on 
<br/>Dredging and Engineering Works on major rivers and creeks in Fiji, to control flooding and obtain 
<br/>low value minerals and/or for construction works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and 
<br/>gentlemen; our waterways are a major source of livelihood for our people.  However, they also often 
<br/>cause  hazards  to  our  people  during  periods  of  extreme  weather  conditions.    In  particular,  during 
<br/>increased rainfall periods, sediments and silt are washed into rivers and creeks which lead to flooding 
<br/>in low lying areas.  Our communities are exposed to these flooding events on an annual basis, and it 
<br/>is a challenge that requires addressing most effectively and efficiently at all times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The irony of it all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we, as a nation, have to prepare ourselves for 
<br/>nature’s  onslaught  in  the  form  of  natural  disasters  like  floods,  et  cetera,  every  year  regardless  of 
<br/>whether we like it or not.  The Department of Waterways is committed to providing a safe and secure 
<br/>environment from  flooding, through the desilting, dredging and river engineering works of major 
<br/></span><span>river systems in Fiji.  The Department has already undertaken many activities to address these crucial 
<br/></span><span>issues and will continue to do so in this financial year.  We have many rivers and creeks to be looked 
<br/>after and these become important prior to the rainy season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of the 2021 to 2022 financial year, a total of 41,870 metres of 
<br/>drains were desilted; 15,911 metres of creeks were desilted in the Central, Western and Northern 
<br/>Divisions, while 400 metres of new drains were excavated in the Western Division with an estimated 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment of close to half a million dollars. For non-municipal area drainage, a total of 95 drainage 
<br/>schemes have benefitted from this initiative with a total cost of more than $180,000.  Further to the 
<br/>2021 to 2022 financial year, a total of 165,828 metres of farm drains were desilted, while 270,197 
<br/>metres  of  creek  were  desilted,  benefitting  a  total  of  72  communities  in  the  Central,  Western  and 
<br/>Northern Divisions with an investment close to half a million dollars.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the current financial year, the Department of Waterways has committed 
<br/>$3 million for the dredging of the Ba River mouth channel, the Labasa River mouth channel and the 
<br/>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Nadi River Diversion near Yavusania Village in the 
<br/>Province  of  Ba.  From  the  dredging  works,  a  large  number  of  communities  in  the  greater  Ba  and 
<br/>Labasa areas are expected to benefit from this project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the Department has allocated $200,000 for the National Waterways Programme 
<br/>which involves survey and flood mapping exercise of five major river systems, including the Rewa, 
<br/>Ba, Sigatoka, Nadi and Navua Rivers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Waterways has committed $3.8 million for contractors 
<br/>to  carry  out  riverbank  protection  of  the  following  Villages  -  Matainoco  Village  in  Tailevu,  Bua 
<br/>Lomanikoro Village in the Province of Bua, Matanisivaro Settlement near Qauia River, Wainimakutu 
<br/>Village in Namosi, Waciwaci Village in Lakeba, the upper Sigatoka River and Naivilaca Village in 
<br/>Noco, Rewa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Waterways is currently in the process of formulating a 
<br/>Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Government stakeholders to be tabled to Cabinet 
<br/>for approval, and the stakeholders include the Department of Environment, the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and  Mineral  Resources,  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  and  iTaukei|  Lands  Trust  Board  on  a 
<br/>programme called ‘Public Private Partnership (PPP) - Emergency Desilting of Rivers and Creeks’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme will look after the desilting and dredging works of more 
<br/>than  130  identified  rivers  and  creeks  around  Fiji.  Government  stakeholders  will  facilitate  all 
<br/>necessary approvals and permits on behalf of the private contractors who will be carrying out the 
<br/>flood mitigation work on the ground. To recover costs, the private contractors will sell the dredge 
<br/>spoils to construction companies and authorities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the desilting of rivers and creeks will benefit our communities in many ways.  
<br/>It will reduce flooding events, as well as ensuring the protection of livelihoods and infrastructure 
<br/>since  the  rivers  and  creeks  are  an  integral  part  of  our  ecosystems,  they  need  to  be  restored  and 
<br/>maintained. The risk of flooding is predicted to be high in the future due to the modification of the 
<br/>environment from development activities.  Therefore, the Department is monitoring these activities 
<br/>and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce those risks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  assist  with  the  current  waterways’  programmes  and  to  further  assist 
<br/>stakeholders as the sugar and now the non-sugar areas, we need to re-establish the Drainage Board. 
<br/>I had alluded to this during my Maiden Speech in this august Parliament and to enable this to happen, 
<br/>we  will  need  to  review  the  current  Drainage  Act  1961.    To-date,  we  have  made  a  submission  to 
<br/></span><span>Cabinet and that submission has been approved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Drainage Act for Fiji was enacted in 1961 which is quite archaic and does not meet our 
<br/>current needs for the development of the agriculture sector.  The Act provides for the declaration of 
<br/>drainage  areas,  authorise  the  execution  of  drainage  works  and  provides  for  the  establishment  of 
<br/>drainage boards for the maintenance and improvement of certain drainage areas. However, due to 
<br/>certain amendments, some of those powers have changed.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1833 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past, three Drainage Boards was set up in three Divisions namely; the 
<br/>Central,  Northern  and  Western  Divisions.    The  Central  Division  Drainage  Board  comprise  of  40 
<br/>drainage  schemes,  covering  an  area  of  10,428  hectares;  the  Western  Division  Drainage  Board 
<br/>comprise of 40 drainage schemes, covering an area of 247,000 hectares; and the Northern Division 
<br/>Drainage Board comprise of 20 drainage schemes, covering an area of 211,000 hectares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past, Drainage Subsidy Funds, through the grant, were budgeted for 
<br/>and provided to the three Drainage Boards through the then Land and Water Resource Management 
<br/>Division to administer and undertake the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Drainage  improvement  works  of  the  existing  drainage  schemes  and  waterlogged 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Drainage  infrastructure  development  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  within  our 
<br/>drainage scheme programmes, these include the establishment of seawalls and outfall 
<br/>structures such as floodgates to reduce saltwater intrusion into farming areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, the main purpose of drainage improvement works within the 
<br/>drainage schemes was to clear waterlogged areas and reduce the impacts of flooding.  Our situation 
<br/>now, in addition to drainage, is to look at irrigation to improve farming areas, as well as the use of 
<br/>nature-based interventions for the restoration and maintenance of watershed areas in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the current Drainage Act 1961 will enable us to re-establish 
<br/>the  Drainage  Boards  and  ease  the  workload  for  the  Waterways  Division  under  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture. This will also outline the scope of work to be covered by the Drainage Board and other 
<br/>stakeholders and it will provide the necessary legal powers for the Drainage Board and Waterways 
<br/>Division to carry out their work effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to deliver this Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  or  his  designate  for  their  response,  honourable  Minister,  for  clarification’s  sake,  is 
<br/>Matainoco Village part of Rewa or Tailevu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Matainoco Village is part of Tailevu but it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>called Matainoco and is directly opposite Noco. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank  you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the Ministerial Statement, I 
<br/>again convey my apology through you, for leaving Parliament early yesterday on an urgent and rather 
<br/>serious matter that I need to attend to.  I did receive the call during dinner and consulted the Caucus 
<br/>so no disrespect of Parliament and to Government as well, given the importance of the motion that 
<br/>was before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I hope that this will 
<br/></span><span>be the last Ministerial Statement from the honourable Minister that I will respond to.  I am asking my 
<br/></span><span>members of the Caucus if they can also stand up and talk about agriculture and waterways issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  has  correctly  highlighted  the  importance  of 
<br/>maintenance  of  our  drains  in  Fiji.  I  know  for  a  fact  that  as  the  former  Minister  for  Disaster 
<br/>Management,  I  remembered  the  2018  Easter  flooding  in  Ba  that  caught  everyone  by  surprise.  
<br/>Changing weather patterns in Fiji, particularly the pattern of rainfall, what we are experiencing in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>1834 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji now as a result of climate change, we can easily be bombarded with three months of rainfall in 
<br/>five to six hours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can say that this overwhelms the capacity because most of our infrastructure and let us 
<br/>except the fact that most of the infrastructure that we have now was designed for that period but what 
<br/>we are experiencing  now will take time and it is going  to  cost  money as well.   We need to  start 
<br/>working on improving these infrastructure because of the change in weather patterns as a result of 
<br/>climate change, particularly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has justified the reasons behind these dredging works but, perhaps 
<br/>what is, sort of, missing, honourable Minister, from your Statement is about the iron ore that will be 
<br/>used for the construction or probably I have missed it, but it is an opportunity as well.  He has talked 
<br/>about the private contractors that are given the spoils - I think this is under the current arrangement.  
<br/>In fact, those spoils are owned by the Ministry of Lands, but I think under the current arrangement 
<br/>because of the lack of capability, I will talk about that as well and maybe if the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance can help the honourable Minister for Agriculture on this, that is why they have the current 
<br/>arrangement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at it in two ways.  Firstly, we need the investment 
<br/>and the opportunities out of the iron ore.  I will use Ba River, for example, it is rich in magnetite 
<br/>which is an element for iron, and we negotiated with the Land and Water Resource Management 
<br/>LAWRM  back  then  to  hold  dredging,  although  we  were  experiencing  flooding  in  the  Ba  River, 
<br/>particularly  the  first  few  kilometres  from  the  Ba  River  Mouth  because  it  is  rich  in  magnetite.  
<br/>Although they were asking for the mining licence, but the difficulty in that ore is because it needs to 
<br/>be separated - sand that has the component of magnetite and the normal sand. The easiest way to 
<br/>separate them is when it is still wet and that is why there was a bit delay.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also present in the Sigatoka River, Sir, but you will recall that we had a bit of argument 
<br/>about the Sigatoka River a few years back. So, it is about mitigating and adaptation that we need to 
<br/>take up.  We are aware of the environmental implications but there are opportunities in there that the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance needs to look into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While still with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated that the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  needs  support.    He  does  not  have  a  dredger  on  his  own 
<br/>Ministry now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- First time, increase the budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.-  The budget is only $3 million for this year, it is insufficient, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but get him a dredging equipment. The </span><span>Dauqeuqeu</span><span> has done its time, it is gone.  We 
<br/>used to have two. We did the Qawa River and the Labasa River in 2008 and that is why Labasa was 
<br/>safe for the last few years.  If you delay the dredging, Labasa will come under water again.   Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that is why he needs the support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another thing we need in order to support dredging is a reactive measure, but we need to be 
<br/></span><span>proactive as well. I am going to talk about Sustainable Land Management Practices, particularly to 
<br/></span><span>our farmers.  That is something that we need. We have talked about environmental issues, I remind 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister again, do not bring environmental issues and then run away 
<br/>as well under cover.  This is an environmental issue, it is also a husbandry practice issue, but for us 
<br/>to avoid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are reports of soil erosion in Fiji which most people are not aware of.  We are losing a
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1835 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lot of our good soils because of unsustainable land management practices.  I will continue to support 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture in its efforts on sustainable land management practices because this is a 
<br/>proactive measure to reduce soil erosion so that we can also minimise drainage works.  Therefore, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to provide all the support for deforestation and reforestation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Forestry needs to look into this.  The honourable Minister for 
<br/>Rural Development, on the other day, talked about Tukuraki.  If you go back to the study on Tukuraki, 
<br/>it is when we change the forestry practice, when we brought in pine, pine has needle leaves whereas 
<br/>native  Fijian  trees  have  canopies,  and  that  is  one  of  the  contributing  factors  to  the  landslide  in 
<br/>Tukuraki way back in 2012.  That is why we need to minimise reforestation and deforestation and, 
<br/>of  course,  sustainable  land  practices.    These  are  proactive  measures  that  will  help  us  minimise 
<br/>drainage works and save cost for the Government, which we can use for other benefits. I thank you 
<br/>for the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we proceed, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the 
<br/>Australian delegation visiting us today, especially, when it is led by the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
<br/>honourable Senator Paddy Wong, and Australia’s High Commissioner to Fiji and Special Envoy to 
<br/>the Pacific, Mr. Ewen McDonald.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We warmly welcome you to the Parliament of Fiji and hope you will enjoy your visit to the 
<br/>Fiji Islands during your visit here.  May God bless the cordial relationship (a cordial one) that the 
<br/>great Government of Australia has with our Fiji Government.  Thank you, Madam.   
<br/></span></div>
