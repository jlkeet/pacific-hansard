<h3>HIGHER SALARIES COMMISSION BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>HIGHER SALARIES COMMISSION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday 11</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2023, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 (Bill No. 24/2023), be debated, voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the  Higher 
<br/>Salaries Commission Bill 2023, which was tabled in Parliament on Monday 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.  
<br/>Before  I  begin,  I  would  like  to  highlight  that  since  tabling  the  Bill  a  minor  anomaly  has  been 
<br/>identified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- In Clause 16(4) was wrongly referred to as subsection 3.  I would 
<br/>like to bring this to the attention of Parliament to clarify the reference that is to delete 3 and substitute 
<br/>4.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- How come? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a precedent has already been set in this Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the 29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are just doing what you people did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The former Attorney-General was speaking on the 11</span><span>th</span><span> Bill said, and
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In respect of the first Budget amendment (Bill No. 28/2022) before I do speak 
<br/>on the Bill itself, Sir, I would like to point out a typesetting error” which is similar in 
<br/>this case. “If honourable Members could look at Clause 5 of the Bill and the heading 
<br/>is “</span><span>Sections 115A and 115B</span><span>” inserted.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you read Clause 5 it says, and I quote: “The principal Act is amended after section 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>115 by inserting the following new sections”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  further  said  and  I  quote:  “You  will  see  the  next  heading,  “</span><span>Investigation  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>complaint by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service</span><span>”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the heading above suggests, you have ‘15A’ but it should be ‘115A’, so I dropped 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>off by typesetting - apologies for the typesetting error”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a precedent has been said it is only referenced to ‘3’ supposed to be ‘4’ and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I asked for the leave of this Parliament before we move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that amendment has been put forward as well and 
<br/>what we will do is that by virtue of the precedent case we will continue and we will take both the 
<br/>amendments when the approval has been finalised and given.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may continue, as mentioned on Monday, the 
<br/>Higher Salaries Commission Act together with subsidiary legislations was repealed by the Higher 
<br/>Salaries Act 2011.  As a result, the Higher Salaries Commission was abolished.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pursuant to the Act of 2011, the salaries which used to be considered and determined by the 
<br/>Commission is determined as the case maybe by a Minister, authority or body prescribed under any 
<br/>written law which appoints or has authority over any such Board, corporation, government-controlled 
<br/>company, authority or body following the approval of the Minister responsible for Public Enterprise 
<br/>and the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to establish the Higher Salaries Commission to ensure that the 
<br/>salaries of Chief Executive Officers or any other similar titled position of any Board, corporation, 
<br/>authority or board of any government-controlled company is not so excessive and lavish that it shocks 
<br/>the ordinary people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  quote  one  good  example.    I  will  not  name  the  officer  but 
<br/>someone who is actually paid more than the honourable Prime Minister.  We also have to the shock 
<br/>of this side of Parliament that some people are being paid $350,000 a year, some are half a million, 
<br/>someone a million dollars … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- unheard of in the history of this nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, establishing the Higher Salaries Commission does not mean we want to 
<br/>reduce everyone’s salary. The intention is to ensure that taxpayers’ money is not being wasted that 
<br/>is  the  bottom  line.  Establishing  the  Higher  Salaries  Commission,  we  have  to  consider  the  pay 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1887 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disparities caused by the current practice by the former administration of Government in the last 16 
<br/>years  between  Chief  Executives  and  other  Staff  Members,  which  is  not  a  good  practice  for  any 
<br/>workplace. We will not deprive anyone of their rightful pay and the Higher Salaries Commission will 
<br/>conduct all necessary consultation needed to make the best decision, not only for top executives but 
<br/>also for the people who pay for their salaries, the taxpayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  the  intention  of  High  Salaries  Commission  Bill  is  to  re-establish  the  Higher 
<br/>Salaries Commission and guide the determination of salaries of top executive positions of prescribed 
<br/>bodies.  There  have  been  a  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service,  Ministry  of  Public 
<br/>Enterprise, and the Office of Solicitor-General. I have touched all the salient provisions of the Bill 
<br/>and I will not repeat it again. I commend this Bill before the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, ever since we received this particular Bill on Monday 
<br/>we have been trying to figure out the intent of bringing this Higher Salaries Commission back into 
<br/>play and as Attorney General has elaborated just a while ago it seems like when they got to know 
<br/>that some of the CEOs who are best fitted for a particular job are getting more than what Ministers 
<br/>and  Prime  Ministers  are  getting  led  to  actually  coming  up  with  this  particular  Bill  which  will  be 
<br/>enacted by the Parliament because they have the numbers so that they can actually reduce the salaries 
<br/>of the CEOs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill has been done in haste and I will be explaining why some of the things are still 
<br/>missing from the particular Bill that is before us. Mr. Speaker, as alluded to by the Attorney General 
<br/>there is no such laws in place that actually states that the Prime Minister’s salary should be the highest 
<br/>compared to others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We heard what he said honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  There was a reason back in 2011 
<br/>as  to  why  the  Higher  Salaries  Commission  was  removed.    The  Higher  Salaries  Commission  was 
<br/>empowered to consider and determine the remuneration of every senior officer, holder in any public 
<br/>office, including statutory entities, public corporations and Government commercial companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, the Higher Salaries Commission which had been in existence since 1983, led 
<br/>economical understanding and sufficient knowledge of the market force and used to apply public 
<br/>service  approach  and  comparison  in  determining  the  renumeration  of  these  entities.    The  lack  of 
<br/>commercial knowledge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is forcing this Government to actually come up with this 
<br/>Bill to get the Commission back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the establishment and the process of the Higher Salaries Commission was very 
<br/>cumbersome,  bureaucratic  and  time  insensitive.    In  addition,  the  process  followed  by  the  Higher 
<br/>Salaries Commission in determining the renumeration of the senior positions, failed to obtain a proper 
<br/>independent assessment of these salaries by professionals who had the necessary expertise in making 
<br/>such analysis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  removing  Higher  Salaries  Commission  by  Decree  2011,  the  salaries  of  the  Chief 
<br/></span><span>Executive Officers of any board, corporation, authority or body and the salaries of the holders of such 
<br/></span><span>other offices in those board, corporation, authorities, or bodies, would have been determined by the 
<br/>members or Directors of the board, corporation, authority or body, appointed under any written law 
<br/>establishing any such board, corporation, authority or body, following approval of the honourable 
<br/>Minister responsible for Public Enterprise and the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It further went on to say, the salaries of the Executive Officers of every government controlled 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>1888 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>companies and salaries of the holders of such other office in those companies, as prescribed back 
<br/>then in Schedule 2, would have been determined by the Board of Directors of any such company 
<br/>following the approval of the Minister responsible for Public Enterprises and the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  salaries  of  every  Permanent  Secretary  or  other  officer  who  manages  a  Ministry  or 
<br/>department  for  which  a  Minister  responsibility,  and  such  other  person,  again  as  prescribed  in 
<br/>Schedule  3  back  then,  would  have  been  determined  by  Public  Service  Commission  following 
<br/>approval of the Prime Minister.  The salaries of the Executive Officer of every city, town and district 
<br/>council constituted under Local  Government  Act and salaries of holders  of such office and those 
<br/>council would have been determined by the Minister responsible for Local Government following 
<br/>approval of the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When honourable Premila Kumar used to be the Minister for Local Government, she used to 
<br/>actually  engage  PWC  as  an  independent  analyst  to  determine  which  particular  CEO  of  which 
<br/>particular  town  council  should  be  getting  what  amount.    What  was  required  by  the  members  or 
<br/>Directors of any board, corporation, company, commission or authority to conduct an independent 
<br/>assessment  of  renumeration  sought  to  be  reviewed  before  submitting  any  recommendation.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  such  an  independent  assessment  would  have  brought  necessary  transparency  and 
<br/>impartiality  in  the  determination  of  renumeration  of  senior  officers  of  these  commercial  entities.  
<br/>These were the reasons why the Higher Salaries Commission was removed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Now going on to the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we see that the Commission is going to consist 
<br/>of a chairperson appointed by the Minister, again something that the Opposition, for the past eight 
<br/>years have been harping on that Ministers should not be appointing members of the board.  And now, 
<br/>in this particular Bill, they are doing the same thing they had been advocating against.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Listen, listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, a nominee from the Minister responsible for Finance, a nominee of the Minister, and 
<br/>only two out of five, only two to be the experts in economics, financial, industrial or commercial 
<br/>matters appointed by the Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Moving  further  on,  “Powers  of  the  Commission”,  I  have  been  the  Chair  of  the  previous 
<br/>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, never did we actually see, under section 
<br/>8(1), for the purpose of this Act, the Commission has the same powers and authority to summon, 
<br/>witness and to admit and receive evidence as are conferred on Commissioners of the Commission of 
<br/>enquiry under section 9 of the Commission of Enquiry Act 1946.  Why  are such powers actually 
<br/>given to  this  Commission?   No other Commission  receives this kind  of powers  - Commission  of 
<br/>Inquiries initiated by President. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- So that these people can call all the Chief Executive Officers and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inquire about their salaries, reduce it and there will be a big question mark, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, if we go back and see - Functions of the Commission 7(1)(b): Conduct 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consult with the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span> </span><span>Board of Government; 
<br/>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>Commercial Companies; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1889 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>Commercial Statutory Authorities; 
<br/>(iv)</span><span> </span><span>Statutory Organisations; and  
<br/>(v)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any other body when reviewing and determining salaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> If  you  go  to  Schedule  No.  1,  there  are  lists  of  prescribed  bodies  from  1-27.    Now,  what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happens to Head 9 of the Budget Estimates - Independent bodies?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 13 - Independent Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Office of the Auditor-General, Fijian Elections Office, Judiciary, Office of the 
<br/>Director of Public Prosecutions, and Media Industry Development Authority, Fijian Competition and 
<br/>Consumer  Commission,  Electricity  Fiji  Limited,  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited,  Fiji  Teachers 
<br/>Registration Authority, Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Board and Public Rental Board - these are not 
<br/>even in the list.  Why the rush to bring this kind of Bill under 51 that these entities are missing?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ. - As I said it just rang the bell in the ears after hearing what the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chief Executive Officer of FCCC is getting, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, the last one is Annual Report No. 25. Without limiting the 
<br/>Right of the Commission to report at any time the Commission must as soon as practicable after the 
<br/>end of each financial year publish an Annual Report on the Performance of the Commission functions 
<br/>under  this  Act  during  the  year  and  must  submit  a  copy  to  the  Minister  who  must  table  it  in  the 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  seen  in  the  past  we  have  been  recommending  that  all  the  Annual 
<br/>Reports should be tabled and presented within three months once the financial year comes to an end. 
<br/>So why is this Commission being given a privilege that they can prevent an Annual Report whenever 
<br/>they like or has it been overlooked not to give a timeframe of three months?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, I do not think we support the Bill that is presented to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very short, and I speak in support of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion. Obviously, it is a Government Bill moved by the honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a long time we  have  had the Higher Salaries Commission.   The last 
<br/>Chairman died a few months ago, the late Taufa Vakatale, who was the last Chair of that Commission. 
<br/>It is important in a developing country like ours surrounded by many developing countries and also 
<br/>watched by developed countries that we maintain some rationale in the way we deal with our Senior 
<br/>Executives and also recruit and correctly remunerate them when they come and do the work that we 
<br/>advertise for them to come to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very important then that we get the right calibre of people and get from them what we 
<br/>expect of them as we recruit them.  So, I feel that having a Higher Salaries Commission that has the 
<br/></span><span>freedom to survey and research what people in those similar positions are getting other jurisdictions 
<br/></span><span>in other economies and try and scale that to the economy of the country. That is all it is. It is not 
<br/>giving  all  CEOs  in  this  sort  of  industry  in  the  same  level  of  salaries  applicable  to  the  other 
<br/>jurisdictions around us. That is simply what this is for, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.    J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>contribution to this motion and also to the Attorney-General for the motion itself in looking at the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>1890 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Higher  Salaries  Commission.    One  of  the  most  fundamental  things  about  the  success  of  any 
<br/>organisation, of any country or of any entity is the capacity of its leadership and this is true for any 
<br/>ministry, country and community and it is also true for a lot of the organisations that we have that 
<br/>come under the banner of what we wanted to come under the Higher Salaries Commission.  Here, I 
<br/>am  talking  about  statutory  bodies,  I  do  not  know  whether  it  covers  the  Government  Commercial 
<br/>Companies but I think from the list, it is about the statutory bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we had problems in the past, especially before we came into election 
<br/>was the difficulty of getting people to take up these appointments that had the right calibre that is 
<br/>required to innovate and transform these organisations that we have.  We had a lot of these problems, 
<br/>I think, in the aftermath of 2006 where many people were reluctant to take up the jobs because of 
<br/>travel bans that affected not only themselves and their families.  Of course, if you are not able to get 
<br/>the right people into the jobs, it is going to have an impact on how well that organisation does.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was one of the problems that we had, the difficulty of getting the best people with the 
<br/>right competencies, experiences and capabilities to be able to run the organisation that we have.  All 
<br/>the statutory bodies that we have in the schedule listing on page 11, it is very important that we get 
<br/>the right people.  I think one of the adages that we have in talking about managing organisations and 
<br/>running organisations that the most important job, the most important thing is to get the right people 
<br/>into the bus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you get the right person on the bus, the bus will go in the right direction.  If you have the 
<br/>wrong person in the bus, no matter what you do, the bus will go in the wrong direction; that is an 
<br/>adage that people have.  If you want to move in the right direction, you have to do that, so it is always 
<br/>important that we get fit for purpose executives - the right set of competencies, the right abilities and 
<br/>very important, the right experience in a variety of situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you want to move an entity that is working in a country where other people in that sector 
<br/>are only used to certain levels of performance to what they have seen around them, and if you want 
<br/>to transform that to a levelled performance that you see in other countries, you need people that have 
<br/>experience in those kinds of settings because they have that understanding of what it means to take 
<br/>an entity from this level to that level.  If you have people that ever only work in this level of entity, 
<br/>they have never had the experience of moving an entity from this level to that one, you need that sort 
<br/>of experience.  You need the ability to innovate.  We need people to have the opportunity to work in 
<br/>modern competitive environments to take these organisations forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  problems  that  we  have  when  we  do  this,  even  under  the  old  Higher  Salaries 
<br/>Commission was the kind of barriers that were inbuilt in the people who lived in these Commissions.  
<br/>A  lot  of  the  people  who  were  working  in  the  old  Higher  Salaries,  they  lacked  that  commercial 
<br/>knowledge and sufficient understanding of market forces and how competitive it is to get the kind of 
<br/>people that we can look for the right kind of person because as I said, you must be able to get the 
<br/>right kind of person for the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  a  tendency  to  apply  a  public  service  approach  in  determining  salaries.  
<br/>Traditionally, we based remuneration on inputs rather than outputs.  We really need to base it on 
<br/></span><span>outputs rather than just inputs.  Today we have heard the commentaries about the high pays of CEOs 
<br/></span><span>and we have heard the comment from the Attorney-General which I think demonstrates that archaic 
<br/>way of thinking.  The archaic way of thinking that a Prime Minister in a country should earn the 
<br/>highest salary – that is very archaic thinking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have worked in organisations where the CEO gets less than someone in that organisation.  
<br/>That is very archaic thinking.  If you are thinking about where you want to take the organisation, then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1891 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all of those archaic ways of thinking need to go out the backdoor.  You need to come up with new 
<br/>ways of thinking to be able to move this organisation to deliver the kind of performance that we want; 
<br/>it happens everywhere.  In Fiji, we have the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, specialist expertise 
<br/>is required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specialist expertise must be compensated, you can keep that person.  If you are going to get 
<br/>a group of people then to determine salaries who are not able to take these sorts of forces and needs 
<br/>into understanding, then they will be archaic in the way that they are to apply that salary. If you apply 
<br/>the wrong salary, you will get the wrong person and they say, if you pay peanuts, you will get .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Monkeys.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Of course, this is it!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the issue that we always face.  We have seen the success of this approach that we have 
<br/>used here without the Higher Salaries Commission.  We have seen the phenomenal performance of 
<br/>Airports Fiji Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  improvement  in  Airports  Fiji  Limited.  The low  dividends  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they used to get to Government and the phenomenal explosion when you get the right people in ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- ...they build in new ways of doing things.  That is what happens when 
<br/>you get the right person on the bus and you have the right way of appointing salaries for these people. 
<br/>We have seen what happened in Fiji Pine.  People are talking about FBC. Yes, you have seen what 
<br/>happened in FBC.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Can you remember the FBC of the past?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Look at the FBC of today.  That is an example of what I am talking 
<br/>about.  When you have the right way of allocating salaries, you attract the right person, you get the 
<br/>right performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Traditionally  in  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  low  level  jobs  in  the  Civil 
<br/>Service are always paid higher than the private sector, low level jobs always presented higher.  But 
<br/>the higher-level jobs, it is a complete difference, complete reversal.  So, what do you have?  You 
<br/></span><span>have a lot of people who work in the Civil Service, when they move up they want the higher salaries, 
<br/></span><span>where do they go?  They jump outside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here, a trend around the world, we want governments to be smaller so that they maintain the 
<br/>policy  and  the  regulatory  component  of  their  jobs,  you  move  your  direct  operations  outside  of 
<br/>government and you want them to be nimble, agile and move fast.  When you do that, you need CEOs 
<br/>who can make things grow and if you are hampered by a system which limits the amount of money

<div><span>that you can pay to these people, you will get what you pay for.  The system that we have had so far 
<br/>... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- … how are salaries determined now?  We have Boards... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Look at Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-...whose  job,  they  have  a  fiduciary  duty  to  do  their  best  for  their 
<br/>organisation. In these Boards you always have a human resource subcommittee, you have experts 
<br/>that are there, lawyers, HR people and they will then bring in the PriceWaterHouseCoopers of this 
<br/>land to look at the salary things that you are talking about, the relativity of salaries and looking at 
<br/>salaries here and offshore.  So if a company like Water Authority of Fiji had decided, we want to 
<br/>move  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  from  here  to  become  something  like  a  company  that  you  find  in 
<br/>Singapore, you need to find the right kind of person.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Why Singapore? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, why not?  Why not? What is wrong with you people?  Why not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We are locals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Then you need to attract the kind of person, they will come up with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the salary package and then under the current system offer that to the Ministry of Public Enterprises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir,….
