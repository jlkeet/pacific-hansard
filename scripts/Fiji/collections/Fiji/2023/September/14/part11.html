<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Police Force 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the  Consolidated Review Report 
<br/>of the Fiji Police Force 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports. These were tabled on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, 
<br/>and it was referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to review and report back 
<br/>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  conducted  a  joint  submission  and  consultation  with  the  Fiji 
<br/>Police Force and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Defence when we were dealing with these Reports.  
<br/>You will notice that a year is missing from those two Reports (2018-2019), but that was the Report that 
<br/>we had debated earlier in the week, and these are the two Annual Reports in between.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In these deliberations, we also tracked the live comments that were coming in on the </span><span>Facebook 
<br/></span><span>page as they were watching the deliberation and we put forward to the Committee two of those very good 
<br/></span><span>points that were raised during the discussion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report is written in a way for ease of reading.  If you just go straight to the 
<br/>recommendations,  we  referenced  a paragraph in the  recommendation, and you can go straight to the 
<br/>paragraph, and we have provided an explanation as to why the recommendation is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>(Report handed over to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5) I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that the debate of the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.

<div><span>Review Report – OAG Performance Audit on the Monitoring of Implementation  
<br/>of the Sugar Development and Farmers Assistance Programme from 2016-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to present 
<br/>the Review Report on the Performance Audit of the Office of the Auditor-General on the Monitoring of 
<br/>Implementation of the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance Programme from 2016-2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  audit  was  limited  to  evaluation  and  checking  of  the  Grant  Policy  and 
<br/>Management Framework, administration of the Grant, monitoring and reporting and evaluation.  From 
<br/>2016 to 2019, there were around 22 Grant programmes and the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) alone, 
<br/>received the second highest funding of around $39.8 million after the fertilizer subsidies component of 
<br/>$46 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  the  Committee  recommended  the  audit  work  carried  out  by  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General  in  examining  whether  the  SDF  from  2016  to  2019  was  efficiently  and  effectively 
<br/>administered, and if the objectives of the Grant were met.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee reviewed this Performance Audit Report and conducted a round 
<br/>of  consultations  with  all  the  relevant  stakeholders,  including  the  Ministry  of  Sugar,  the  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation (FSC), Sugarcane Growers Council, Sugarcane Growers Fund, Fiji Sugar Research Institute, 
<br/>South Pacific Fertilizers Limited and selected sector farms. The Committee noted and agreed with the 
<br/>audit findings of the Office of the Auditor-General during the implementation of the SDF Grant from 
<br/>2016 to 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Grant Policy and Management Framework Administration, it was found that there was no 
<br/>formal written one during the audit and the Ministry was in the drafting process, the audit was carried out 
<br/>in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the administration of the grant, accountability and transparency in grant management was 
<br/>generally weak, grant allotment lacked a transparent system, grant agreements and payment vouchers 
<br/>were found missing in some cases, and some conflicts of interest were not being declared by FSC, and 
<br/>farmers do not always receive funds on time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On monitoring, it was not performed to the requirements in an Annual Work Plan at farm level, 
<br/>there was absence of proper system, processes and resources for effective monitoring, plus independent 
<br/>checks were not carried out by the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Reporting and evaluation, the programme has yet to be evaluated and reported against its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objectives when the audit was conducted.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Communication from the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, in its review, agreed with the recommendations of the Auditor-General, that the 
<br/>findings were bad and appalling, and we were surprised.  However, the wording was timely, considering 
<br/>the funds of around $39.8 that was disbursed at the time the SDF Grant had been in place from 2016 to 
<br/>2019.  There were instances of cheating or defaulted farmers, fraud and misuse of funds.  It brought 
<br/>memories of the agriculture scam that happened in the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, it is pleasing to note that most of the audit recommendations are currently 
<br/>put in place and being implemented by the Ministry and in FSC, however, there is still a hurdle of 
<br/>having the appropriate number of human and technical resources to carry out the administration of 
<br/>the Grants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, there were 22 programmes then, and now it has increased.  In addition, the 
<br/>Committee  found  that  there  is  lack  of  close  and  full  collaboration  and  assistance  and  sharing  of 
<br/>information between the main stakeholders in the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to state that the current honourable Minister for Sugar has taken necessary and 
<br/>positive steps, not only to improve back-office functions in the sugar industry, but to improve sugar 
<br/>production  and  provide  tangible  returns  including  profitability,  to  all  the  stakeholders  including 
<br/>Government. Overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Sugar and 
<br/>the CEO of those stakeholders, who were consulted during the interview, as well as providing written 
<br/>response at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Committee who were 
<br/>part  of  the  successful  compilation  of  this  bipartisan  Report  namely,  honourable  Sakiusa  Tubuna, 
<br/>honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand.  I also wish to 
<br/>thank  the  Alternate  Members  of  the  Committee  who  took  part  in  the  consultations  namely, 
<br/>honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure and honourable Naisa Tuinaceva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  importantly,  in  view  of  the  Committee’s  findings,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Public Accounts recommends that Parliament takes note of its recommendations in this Report.  With 
<br/>those few words, I commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed over to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(5),  I  hereby 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
