<h3>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023  (Bill No. 21/2023), be debated, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  of  the  Local 
<br/>Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> September, 
<br/>2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned on Monday, Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1972, to 
<br/>increase the retirement age of officers appointed to municipal councils from 55 years to 60 years.  
<br/>Simply put, this is to align to Government policy and to the retirement age of civil servants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to remove the requirement of the calculating 
<br/>interest on overdue rates using the Compound Interest Method.  It also removes the interest rates as 
<br/></span><span>this would be prescribed by regulation moving forward.  The amendment will enable the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Local Government to enact regulations in relation to overdue rates.  The Ministry intents to change 
<br/>the  method  of  calculating  interest  to  simple  interest  methods  as  this  will  reduce  the  burden  of 
<br/>taxpayers.  Furthermore, the current interest rate of 11 percent will also be reduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  assure  this  Parliament,  there  has  been  wider  consultation  on  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>matter between the Ministry of Local Government and the Office of the Solicitor-General.  There
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1865 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were also public consultations in Suva, Nadi, Nausori, Lami, Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu.  I have 
<br/>explained the clauses of the Bill on Monday and I do not intend to do so.  If you may recall this under 
<br/>Stading  Order  41,  there  were  enormous  support  from  the  other  side  for  this  to  be  tabled  under 
<br/>Standing Order 51, and I hope that the Opposition will support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just a reminder honourable Members, the debate is limited to one hour, and 
<br/>please abide by that ruling and timing when the bell is sounded by the Madam Secretary-General.  
<br/>Just before I offer the floor, there are three speakers from the Government side and one from the 
<br/>Opposition.  As such, I offer the floor to the honourable Premila Kumar to lead the batting before the 
<br/>three others from the Government that have asked to make their contributions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on Bill No. 21 of 
<br/>2023.  The law of any country cannot be static.  There is a need to capture the realities on the ground, 
<br/>which is driven by the ever-changing nature of our world after post-pandemic period.  It is imperative 
<br/>to respond effectively to new challenges emerging post COVID-19.  What may have worked in the 
<br/>past may not be effective or appropriate for the current situation after COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, policy flexibility and adaptability are essential to ensure that policies remain 
<br/>relevant and impactful.  We understand there is a shortage of skilled and unskilled workers in Fiji.  
<br/>The municipal councils are also facing this issue and as a Government, one has to respond to such 
<br/>challenges.  One way to do that is by increasing the retirement age.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many governments globally have increased the retirement age to address the challenges in 
<br/>the labour market, including upskilling and reskilling.  The FijiFirst policy on retirement age then 
<br/>was to give jobs to youth.  Our youth are migrating in big numbers for greener pastures.  Many have 
<br/>moved on, on student visas.  So, looking at the current labour shortages in Fiji, there is a need to 
<br/>increase  the  retirement  age  even  beyond  60,  provided  the  workers  are  in  good  health.    We  need 
<br/>workers to keep the business and the economy going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular Bill has two components as the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>has mentioned.  One is the retirement age, and the other component is the compound interest. Let me 
<br/>just give the reasons why these changes were brought in, in regards to the Local Government Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2009,  an  amendment  was  made  to  the  Local  Government  Act  to  establish  compulsory 
<br/>retirement age for municipal council staff.  This  was introduced based on a High Court ruling in 
<br/>favour of a council employee, because the Local Government Act did not specify the retirement age.  
<br/>Hence,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  decided  to  introduce  60  years  to  be  the  compulsory 
<br/>retirement  age  across  the  board.    Later,  it  was  changed  to  55  years  to  bring  uniformity  with  the 
<br/>national government policy, and that was mainly the reason.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, moving on to the compound interest, this was initiated by me when I was the Minister 
<br/>for  Local  Government.    The  Ministry  had  prepared  the  Cabinet  Paper  but  we  needed  more 
<br/>information from town and city councils, that is what is the principal amount owed by the ratepayers 
<br/>and what is the interest amount.  This information was very important because the idea was to write-
<br/>off the interest amount and recover just the principal amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This exercise was done and we also noticed that most Councils had aged debt that needed to 
<br/>be written-off, taken care of and we had to clean up all their books as we had done previously with 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji because it does not give a good impression to an organisation when you go 
<br/>through  the  financial  statement  that  shows  that  a  lot  of  money  is  being  owed.    Besides  that,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, as you know if that is not reflected well in the financial statement then there is a problem 
<br/>in making decisions. Business decisions cannot be made with such accounts, so the accounts had to  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>1866 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be cleaned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  above  all,  in  my  view  then  and  still  is,  we  had  to  look  at  the  consumer 
<br/>protection fee.  Compound interest is not fair to consumers and in this case, not fair to the ratepayers.  
<br/>Over the years we have seen financial institutions, for example, banks and hire purchase companies, 
<br/>they moved away from applying compound interest and they moved to simple interest.  We saw the 
<br/>need to move in that direction as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, compound interest can be highly beneficial when you are saving or investing 
<br/>money but definitely not beneficial when you owe money because at the end of the day, one will 
<br/>accumulate more debt. So, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with compound interest, the amount you 
<br/>owe will simply grow faster and it becomes extremely difficult then to pay if off and that was the 
<br/>situation with the ratepayers then. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratepayers who owed rates made arrangements with town council, they went on the payment 
<br/>plan with the hope that they will be able to clear their  arrears, but they found that the compound 
<br/>interest rate of 11 percent on overdue rates did not reduce their arrears, so they were more frustrated, 
<br/>that here I am trying to make some payments but yet at the end of the day, nothing is moving.  I had 
<br/>consultations with ratepayers and they simply discussed then that they were facing financial stress 
<br/>caused by compound interest, and compound interest of 11 percent, that is extremely high. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had to consider moving away from compound interest to simple 
<br/>interest  simply  because  of  the  plea  made  by  the  ratepayers  then  and  it  was  the  right  thing  to  do.  
<br/>Above  all,  the  idea  was  as  I  mentioned,  to  clean  up  the  accounts  and  provide  this  relief  that  the 
<br/>ratepayers really needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the write-off debt we knew can never be recovered. Some debts were as old 
<br/>as 15 years, 20 years, 30 years while some ratepayers had passed on and there was no chance of 
<br/>recovering any of these debts.  One of the critical components when we considered this policy of 
<br/>writing-off debt, we had to develop other policies to make sure that we do not have similar issues in 
<br/>the  future,  and  that  was  to  improve  the  collection  policy  and  the  credit  policy  of  each  and  every 
<br/>municipality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the exercises that the CEOs of municipal councils and the Special Administrators had 
<br/>to carryout was rate profiling. They had to understand who the ratepayers were, how much money 
<br/>they owed, why they owed that money, can they pay that money or not, do they live in Fiji or do they 
<br/>live abroad?  That was a massive exercise to get the details and to create a database for all  those 
<br/>information.  The Municipal Council managed to complete all that and that is when the decision was 
<br/>made to  move on to  the next  step  which  was the writing-off of the debt  as well as moving  from 
<br/>compound interest to simple interest.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution on the Bill before 
<br/>Parliament. I sincerely thank the honourable Kumar for supporting the Bill this afternoon.  It is a very 
<br/>important Bill, not only important for the municipal councils, it is going to benefit everyone that lives 
<br/>within the 13 municipalities around our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  say  a  few  issues,  Mr.  Speaker,  just  to  support  the  Bill  before  Parliament.  
<br/>The Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2003 represented not just a change in law but a 
<br/>transformation in the lives of our people driven by unwavering commitment, empathy and the desire 
<br/>to progress.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us be clear about the essence of these amendments.  They are not 
<br/>just about words on paper, they are about the hopes and dreams of our fellow citizens, hardworking 
<br/>1,184  municipal  council  employees  and  44,749  diligent  ratepayers  who  keep  our  communities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1867 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thriving.  As alluded earlier by honourable Attorney-General, the Ministry in consultation with his 
<br/>office as well as the Supervisor of Elections travelled around to all the 13 municipalities around our 
<br/>country from 24</span><span>th</span><span> April to 10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023.  We embarked on a journey to listen, engage and truly 
<br/>understand the needs to desires of our people.  What we found was nothing short of inspiration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  feedback  received  from  these  consultations  resounded  with  positivity  and  hope,  our 
<br/>people the backbone of our nation stand united in support of raising the retirement age for municipal 
<br/>council employees from 55 years to 60 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  unison,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  also  champion  the  transition  from  compound  to  simple 
<br/>interest calculations for overdue town rates and city rates applauding the reduction of the interest rate 
<br/>from 11 percent to 5 percent.  It is a relief.  Harmony of financial freedom that will ease the burden 
<br/>carried out by our ratepayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  amendment  to  the  retirement  age  is  not  just  a  mere  adjustment  of 
<br/>numbers.  It is about fairness.  It harmonises the retirement age ensuring that every public officer 
<br/>regardless  of  their  role  is  granted  the  dignity  of  the  retirement  age  of  60  years.    It  is  unity  that 
<br/>transcends disparities and enforce the sense of togetherness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  amendment  to  change  the  interest  rate,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  seeks  to  transition  from  the 
<br/>complex web of compound interest as alluded to earlier by honourable Kumar to the simplicity of 
<br/>straight forward calculation.  It does not just reduce the interest rate. It liberates the ratepayers from 
<br/>the  shackles  of  excessive  financial  burdens.    It  simplifies  their  lives,  allowing  them  to  plan  with 
<br/>clarity and ease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Behind the amendment lies the rational. It is very important to know that in increasing the 
<br/>retirement age, it is about fairness, erasing disparities and about ensuring that every public officer is 
<br/>treated with respect that they truly deserve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  change  of  interest  rate,  it  is  about  financial  predictability  for  our  Municipal  Councils 
<br/>about  fostering  compliance,  lightening  the  administrative  load  and  above  all,  about  relieving  our 
<br/>ratepayers.  For our ratepayers, it is about lessening their financial burden given the clarity they need to 
<br/>ensuring that their debts do not become insurmountable mountains. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I stand before you, not just a Minister but as a fellow citizen, someone who believes 
<br/>in a brighter future for all. These amendments underscore our unwavering commitment to harmonious 
<br/>policies,  operational  efficiency  and  a  symbiotic  relationship  with  our  people.  I  urge  all  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament to support this Bill with all your heart.  Let us rally behind the course of transparency, fairness 
<br/>and progress within our local governance framework.  With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I fully 
<br/>support the Bill before Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute briefly in support of the motion and I 
<br/>just want to reflect a little bit on the retirement age.  First of all, I wish to thank the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and my Cabinet colleagues that as soon as we came into Government, extending the retirement 
<br/>age of the civil servants to 60 and at the same time taking away the contractual appointments and replacing 
<br/></span><span>them with tenure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The contractual appointments and the reduction of the retirement age were imposed unilaterally, 
<br/>there was no consultation with the representatives of the workers and the trade unions were completely 
<br/>ignored.  The whole motive was union busting because once you have contractual appointments, there is 
<br/>no collective bargaining.  They never entered into collective bargaining anyway and at the same time 
<br/>instil fear in the workers because you do not know whether your contract will be renewed or not, you just 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have to keep quiet and do what you are told. So, it was a bullying tactic, Sir.  That is how people were 
<br/>treated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the civil servants are now a very happy lot of workers and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as the saying goes, a happy worker is a productive worker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K LAL.- No back door! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- It is hurting, I know, it is hurting them, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- No back door! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have to repent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They need repentance. Unfortunately, municipal workers had to wait because the Act had to be 
<br/>amended and I am so thankful to honourable Nalumisa for bringing this Bill to Parliament together with 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General for introducing the Bill. Now the municipal workers who have been 
<br/>eagerly waiting for the retirement age to be extended to 60 and also being put on tenure, will be happy as 
<br/>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My only request to the honourable Minister is to please include all those who have turned 55 after 
<br/>we effected the civil servants’ retirement age to 60.  I am hoping that they will be included, Sir.  I know 
<br/>for  fact,  as  a  former  trade  unionist  that  all  the  Ministries  and  most  of  the  other  employers  are  now 
<br/>negotiating with the unions, talking to the unions, collective bargaining and the like.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Minimum wage! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Democracy! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Some municipalities have already received their salary pay increases, so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thank you very much to the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  The  honourable  Minister  sounded  a  very  humble  advice  and  that  is  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>repent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Bill that is before 
<br/></span><span>Parliament. As I mentioned in my last participation, one more acknowledgement of Suva Grammar 
<br/>School, we talked about Julius Caesar yesterday and yesterday afternoon there was mention of the 
<br/>plays.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently  over  the  break,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Suva  Grammar  School  Language  Department 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>successfully exhibited Julius Caesar, the play after a very long time. Our time at Queen Victoria 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1869 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>School, they played Julius Caesar and Hamlet but no more.  Suva Grammar has started a good thing! 
<br/>We encourage the good thing and so it is something that now occupies students who are not into 
<br/>sports and not into other extra-curricular activities that we traditionally know schools for.  So it is a 
<br/>good  thing  that  they  have  started  that  this  year  and  I  congratulate  Suva  Grammar  School  for  a 
<br/>wonderful exhibition of Julius Caesar over this school break.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My contribution, Mr. Speaker, to the Bill is going to be very short and it will only relate to a 
<br/>case that I handled a year ago for and on behalf of a handful of former Suva City Council workers 
<br/>who obviously had to be retired off at the age of 55.  They had issues, they had outstanding loans, 
<br/>they  had  outstanding  hire  purchases  that  they  needed  to  pay  simply  because  the  date  of  their 
<br/>retirement was changed as alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar.  We are happy, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>that  we  have  obtained  support  from  the  honourable  Premila  Kumar  on  the  Bill  that  is  before  
<br/>Parliament and hopefully that is going to be same attitude that we will receive from the Opposition 
<br/>this afternoon.  I support the Bill that is before Parliament, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable  Attorney-General to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D.  TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is really a historic day.  It is the first Bill that 
<br/>is fully supported by both sides.  This week must be so special, we had the honourable Tikoduadua’s 
<br/>birthday and yesterday, happy belated birthday, honourable Prime Minister. We thank the Opposition 
<br/>that hopefully …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- And honourable Bulitavu as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D.  TURAGA.- Oh, honourable Bulitavu!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hope, Mr. Speaker, that in  the future we will see wisdom in  terms  of the law  that we 
<br/>reform because it just to ease everything;, ease of business, ease of administration, of course, in this 
<br/>case, as  articulated by honourable Vosarogo, there was a substantial  number of people who were 
<br/>affected by the retirement at 55. They had commitments, bank commitments and this Bill will address 
<br/>that.  I commend the Bill, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 21/2023), moved under Standing Order 
<br/>51 passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.  (Act No. ……. of 2023)] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  we  continue  with  the  other  Bills  that  are  before  us,  just  for  the 
<br/>purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times,  I now call upon the Leader 
<br/>of the Government in Parliament to move her Suspension Motion.
