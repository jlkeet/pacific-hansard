<h3>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>High  Court  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  20/2023),  be  considered  by  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, but 
<br/>that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  will  only  speak  as  to  why 
<br/></span><span>Parliament  must  consider  the  High  Court  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  without  delay  under  Standing 
<br/>Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  hoped  that  honourable  Members  of  this  august  Parliament  will  also  limit  their 
<br/>contributions, if any, to the motion, and any substantive contributions to the merits of the Bill shall 
<br/>be made during the debate of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the High Court Act 1875 provides for the establishment of the High Court 
<br/></span><span>of Justice for Fiji.  In 2021, the Act and the Magistrates Court Act 1944 were amended to establish 
<br/></span><span>the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Anti-Corruption Division of the Magistrates 
<br/>Court respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  amendments  in  2021  did  not  provide  any  specific  improvement  to  the 
<br/>administration for dealing with  anti-corruption matters which, in  some instances, were dealt with 
<br/>outside the respective Anti-Corruption Divisions, such as proceedings in the outer islands.  The Bill,
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1639 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>therefore, seeks to amend the Act to disestablish the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and 
<br/>the Anti-Corruption Division of the Magistrates Court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consultations were held with the Office of the Chief-Registrar, the Office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Solicitor-General and public consultations were also held in Suva, Nadi and Labasa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in the 
<br/>Gazette.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Act by deleting Part 6B in relation to the establishment of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anti-Corruption of the High Court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill, consequently, amends the Magistrates Court Act 1944 by deleting Part 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8B in relation to the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Division of the Magistrates Court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  4  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  transitional  provisions  for  any  pending  proceedings 
<br/>instituted by the Commissioner of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption in the Anti-
<br/>Corruption Divisions of the Magistrates Court, as well as the High Court, prior to the commencement 
<br/>of the amending legislation to be transferred to the Magistrates Court or High Court, as the case may 
<br/>be.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the important implications of our legal system, it is submitted that 
<br/>this  warrants  the  urgent  consideration  of  the  Bill  by  Parliament  and,  therefore,  the  Bill  must  be 
<br/>considered without delay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we still have the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, issues that are taken up under Standing Order 51 are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>normally done if it is something that is quite simple to change, or if there is something urgent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the address that was done by the honourable Attorney-General, there is no message that 
<br/>was made that makes that clear.  There does not seem to be anything urgent about this to make this 
<br/>come under Standing Order 51 and over and above that, of course, we always object.  There are so 
<br/>many on that side of Parliament who always objected to the use of Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had said at the beginning of this session, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was flabbergasted when they 
<br/>did  that  with  the  very  first  Bill  they  brought  into  this  Chamber.  And  that  I  had  said  right  at  the 
<br/>beginning is the definition of hypocrisy, when you condemn something continually and at the very 
<br/>first  thing  that  you  do  you  do  exactly  the  thing  that  you  condemn.    On  that  basis,  we  are  not 
<br/>concurrence with this idea that this Bill should be brought through Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Usamate, for your comments and concern. As you 
<br/>had  rightly  said,  most  Members  on  this  side  of  Parliament  on  the  Government  side,  had  always 
<br/></span><span>questioned the motives behind Standing Order 51 – every time a Bill that came before the House was 
<br/></span><span>introduced under Standing Order 51 then. So, it is just the change of sides here, but the processes are 
<br/>still the same, honourable Usamate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Order, order!

<div><span>Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  one  line.    Honourable  Minister  of  Finance, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>imitation is the highest form of flattering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would be repeating what I have said earlier.   We 
<br/>are here to correct some of the injustices, the same process that was used, by now the other side.  The 
<br/>fact is, we are taking away what was created in 2021, for the interest of justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Change the Attorney-General.  Honourable Vosarogo is better, he should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be the Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- For the better administration of justice, it is urgent that this is debated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in this session of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
