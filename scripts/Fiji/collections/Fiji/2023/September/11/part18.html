<div><span>Government Plans - Supply, Harvest and Use of Clean Water 
<br/>(Question No. 94/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport, please, inform Parliament on Government plans to ensure supply, harvest and use 
<br/>of clean water in rural and remote areas where regular piped water supply is not available? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. The Ministry, through the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), plans to review, improve on and 
<br/>continue existing rural schemes for the 2023-2024 Financial Year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government,  through  WAF,  plans  to  continue  existing  rural  schemes  -  a  budget  of 
<br/>$4.2million is allocated for 34 rural projects planned for the year, which will ensure improved access 
<br/>to  affordable  drinking  water  for  36  villages  benefiting  rural  population  of  4,150  people  across  7 
<br/>provinces nationwide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  project  also  includes some Ecological  Purification System (EPS) projects  that ensure 
<br/>clean drinking water is provided for these communities. The projects are currently under preliminary 
<br/></span><span>works and construction will commence by December 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Authority of Fiji will also continue with their Rainwater Harvesting Program with a 
<br/>budget of $0.5million. These services include free delivery of over 200 x 2,500 litre water tanks to 
<br/>these remote and rural communities with arrangements to also build the base for water tanks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  an  allocation  of  $3.1  million  to  continue  to  provide  water  carting  services  to 
<br/>communities in non-metred areas on a fortnightly basis, and also emergency situations such as we 
<br/>have discussed this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, we have had budgetary constraints and we are also in serious 
<br/>discussion with development partners and CSOs such as Rotary Water to work closely in expanding 
<br/>and hastening rural water services, given the urgent need and high-risk situations we face.  This will 
<br/>also come in the sphere of climate financing and that is an area I am focusing on too, the reform 
<br/>within the Ministry in order for us to closely work with our development partners, and to meet their 
<br/>compliance in formatting in terms of proposals and concept notes which will need to be done in order 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1627 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to meet their requirements as we move forward because at the moment, the need is there but there 
<br/>are budgetary constraints and we need to supplement the national budget with our own efforts to 
<br/>engage development partners, especially in the area of water services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not just now with the rural and remote areas, 
<br/>ever since the honourable Minister has taken his portfolio, even Suva and Nausori corridor is facing 
<br/>disruptions.  Can the honourable Minister actually enlighten when the Viria Water Treatment Plant 
<br/>will be fully operational so that these issues can be resolved? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It sounds like a new question.  It is an ongoing issue from your 
<br/>time up to now.  We do acknowledge the work of the previous government in the Viria project, and 
<br/>it is our responsibility to continue it in the most responsible and rational way and that is what we are 
<br/>doing.  For Viria, currently they are all going through all the tests and the systems and the pumps and 
<br/>everything is on schedule to October.  We will make an announcement on that soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are ongoing projects, as you know.  These projects 
<br/>had been kicked on for the past eight years and we are continuing with this project, and thank you 
<br/>for that.  Can the honourable Minister tell this august Parliament what is your plan to see the old 
<br/>projects, which you have already implemented?  What are you doing with that?  It is okay you are 
<br/>continuing with the new one, but what is your plan for the old projects which we have done, such as 
<br/>the water tanks being given, and the catchment being opened, what are you doing there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is a new question, but as you all know I am very 
<br/>reasonable to do my best in answering your questions.  Since I started, one of the big issues regarding, 
<br/>especially, the rural water, is the lack of data.  So, when I asked, “Do you have a database of all the 
<br/>villages and the state of their water catchment and that kind of details”, there is none.  Currently there 
<br/>is a project under UNICEF, which is compiling that information.  That is a consistent way of doing 
<br/>it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Once we have that, then you could prioritise that according to the needs and the risks in terms 
<br/>of health and all that.  Once you prioritise that you can put it in the annual programme and budget 
<br/>for it.  Right now, no one handed that over to me.  That is the problem and that is the situation with 
<br/>the  rural  water.    There  is  a  whole  lot  of  issues  and  the  way  I  see  it,  it  boils  down  to  the  lack  of 
<br/>consistent plan and moving forward in terms of our implementation plan and proper budgeting.  We 
<br/>need millions and we do not have that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why I am saying, we need to see what budget we have and complement that with our 
<br/></span><span>development partners, and that is what we are currently chasing right now and there have been a lot 
<br/>of good responses.  I am looking forward to getting that needs analysis and then matching it with 
<br/>what budget we have, plugging the gap with our funding from our development partners. So, it should 
<br/>look good after 12 months and we should be moving forward on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Too much of a charity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That will be the last supplementary question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a short statement to the honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Maybe you ask for his plans, not the government’s plans.  You asked for 
<br/>his plan and he has made a reply to that and continuing from where you left off honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can only have one supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, I will allow it but this will be the last one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You did not have a plan when you were there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Probably, the Minister is not aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he was invited also 
<br/>to the launching of the Household Survey which was done at the Novotel Hotel.  You look at this 
<br/>Household Survey and you will get all the data from there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Negative Impacts of Tax Hikes on Sugarcane Farmers 
<br/>(Question No. 95/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament if an assessment has been conducted to gauge the potential negative impact  of 
<br/>these tax hikes on sugarcane farmers with the recent increase in VAT and other taxes that 
<br/>have raised concerns among sugarcane farmers who are already facing numerous challenges?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got a 13-page answer to this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Read it out! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Just listen to me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Just listen to me, if I read it out.  I would actually hand it over and he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>could go through it but anyway if you want to listen then listen, shut up!  Listen to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you want to table that reply or what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Sir, I can do that but they like my voice. They want me to, if I do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You listen to the Speaker so he can direct you … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Anyway Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry is something that is very 
<br/>dear to our hearts, honourable Leader of the Opposition. I always meet him during some cocktails, 
<br/>parties, after a few drinks he would say, ‘make sure you get me a better price for sugar’.  So, I keep 
<br/>on saying to him, ‘please support me’.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1629 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- (Laughs) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- So, there you go, the Leader of the Opposition now we are friends so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you people should also be friends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reply to honourable Pillay is this, I extend my gratitude to honourable 
<br/>Pillay for the question and honourable Members for the unwavering commitment to addressing the 
<br/>concerns  of  our  esteemed  sugarcane  farming  communities.    In  response,  I  am  pleased  to  offer  a 
<br/>comprehensive account of the government’s proactive measures to mitigate the impact of the recent 
<br/>tax increases and inflation on our sugarcane farmers.  The foremost is the imperative to the State that 
<br/>the Coalition Government remains steadfast and the commitment to shielding our sugarcane farmers 
<br/>from the adverse effects of prevailing challenges including the impact of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  recently  conducted  Mill  Area  Committee  meetings  in  Lautoka  and 
<br/>Rarawai Mills.  This was after a lapse of a decade engaging in a face to face discussion regarding the 
<br/>actual challenges of the farmers on how we can collectively address these.  These meetings were 
<br/>attended  by  growers’  representatives,  Growers  Council  representatives,  along  with  the  millers 
<br/>representatives, the extension team, Sugar Industry Tribunal and the Ministry of the Sugar Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly, the concerns expressed by these farmers have not centred around VAT or tax 
<br/>increases. While it is undeniable that there has been a rise in the cost of goods for the general public 
<br/>including  farmers,  it  is  noteworthy  that  sugarcane  farmers  have  not  experienced  any  substantial 
<br/>increase in the production cost meaning that the unit cost and the gross margins remain within the 
<br/>thresholds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform this august House that enduring challenges faced by the 
<br/>farmers  are  rooted  in  the  long-standing  issues  which  have  not  changed  in  relation  to  the  recent 
<br/>taxation amendments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  issues  include  the  manual  and  the  operation  of  century-old  mills,  inadequate  cane 
<br/>access roads, the absence of functional rail network, a labour shortage and fundamentally the lack of 
<br/>visionary approach by the previous government over the past two decades.  These factors collectively 
<br/>exert a significant impact on the wellbeing of today’s growers. It is not a similar factor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the contrary, the VAT increase has allowed the Government to boost its revenue enabling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an increase of support for the sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a significant response we have expanded our capital programmes from six in the year 2022-
<br/>2023  financial  year  to  13  in  this  current  year  for  the  sugarcane  farmers.    This  proactive  and 
<br/>comprehensive  approach  demonstrates  our  commitment  to  addressing  the  long-standing  issues 
<br/>inherited from the previous administration. Be rest-assured this represents only the initial phase of 
<br/>our effort with many more initiatives to be seen in the horizon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now talk on some of the measures for the 2023-2024 fiscal year that has been enacted to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bolster our sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen, you will be here for only two weeks after that you will be gone.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major input.  Look, this guy, come on …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, he is an honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am pleased to announce that there has been no substantial rise in the 
<br/>primary input costs for the sugarcane farmers.  The Government has maintained subsidies for the 
<br/>vital inputs like fertilisers and weedicides.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notably,  despite  the  increase  in  VAT  there  has  been  no  impact  on  the  cost  of  fertiliser.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you do not do a running commentary with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. C.J. Singh interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, you listen. That is for the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Alright, Sir, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- After all despite the increase in VAT there has been low impact on the 
<br/>cost of fertiliser. Previously, the price at $20 per bag the farmers will continue to access them at the 
<br/>same rate. This steadfast commitment ensures that our farmers can secure this crucial resources at a 
<br/>consistent  price  effectively  shielding  them  from  the  inflationary  pressures  of  the  production 
<br/>expenditures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sugar  Industry  Tribunal  (SIT)  plays  a  crucial  role  in  overseeing  the  harvesting  and 
<br/>transportation costs, ensuring that our farmers are protected from unwarranted financial battles in 
<br/>this  critical  aspects  of  the  sugarcane  farming.    This  regulatory  measure  promotes  fairness  and 
<br/>transparency in pricing, offering unequivocal benefits to our farming community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is worth noting that while the rate of mechanical harvesting has increased from $20.61 to 
<br/>$21.74 resulting in a $1.13 per tonne increase, it is essential to emphasise that the cost remains below 
<br/>the expenses associated with the hiring of manual labour for harvesting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Manual labour harvesting typically charges around $20 to $25 per tonne.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Well, I will pay $25 guaranteed price.  This is very interesting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government,  in  its  unwavering  commitment,  has  ensured  that  our  farmers  receive  a 
<br/>minimum of $85.  Allow me to emphasise this point, at the very minimum of $85 in the pockets of 
<br/>farmers, unlike the previous government - they failed to uphold their promises, … 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1631 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen, we pledge that our farmers will indeed receive the full $85 now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they will receive more than $85 in the next payment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- When, how much? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Let me sell the sugar first.  We are selling the sugar first, but it will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>worth $85 … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … this is not your supermarket … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- It will be a record under the Prime Ministership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen, do you have a farm? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the $85 minimum … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Hey, you are not the Speaker, sit down … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, our dedicated team at FSC has tirelessly negotiated to secure the most advantaged 
<br/>sugar price and I am glad to announce that the 2023 crop, farmers can expect to receive more than 
<br/>$85 per tonne. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- How much? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Wait, you will get the answer in the next parliamentary session.  Farmers 
<br/>can expect to receive more than $85, reaffirming and reassuring our commitment that the prosperity 
<br/>and the well-being of farmers will be there.  This is based on the world market price of sugar and 
<br/>sugar shows good indication.  Now that the major sugar producer, India has banned its export and 
<br/>kept the export for only 6.1 million tonnes compared to 11.1 million tonnes in the previous years so 
<br/></span><span>that gives an advantage to us as a small producer, that we can sell our sugar at a better price in the 
<br/></span><span>world market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Who wrote your speech? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  I  wrote  my  own  speech.    You  have  not  completed  your  degree,  you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bloody small kid …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning our attention to the budgetary support and direct assessment measures.  Sugar Cane 
<br/>Development and Farmers Assistance support sugarcane farm owners with the cane planting grant to 
<br/>promote cane planting.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- If you want to listen, listen, otherwise I’ll sit down.  When I am speaking, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then you keep quiet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To promote cane planting and innovate the financial institutions a stage of the first planting, 
<br/>the  People’s  Coalition  Government  has  increased  the  cane  planting  grant  to  $5  million.    The 
<br/>Government has increased the cane planting grant. For a hectare from $1,500 to $1,875; a 25 percent 
<br/>increase.  This  is  deemed as the highest cane planting  grant  of all the years in  the history of this 
<br/>sugarcane industry.  We have listened to the farmers … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Really… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Yes,  and  increase  this  grant  to  mitigate  the  rising  cost  because  the 
<br/>deteriorating condition of the soil, it has been acidic.  We have also introduced the application of 
<br/>lime with the introduction of 425 hectare on the top of increasing of the grant for the land preparation 
<br/>and cane planting.  Therefore, the overall rate per hectare now is 2,300 per hectare inclusive of lime 
<br/>application with  slight  increase of price of weedicides.  We have also  increased subsidy from  20 
<br/>percent for the last year to 30 percent this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  in-field  drainage,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  an  allocation  of  $5.5  million  has  been 
<br/>specifically earmarked for the enhancement of the drainage system with full funding source from 
<br/>grants.  It is discouraging that our farmers appeals have been unanswered for far too long, however 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have acted swiftly precisely to introduce a link programme aimed at supporting 
<br/>our  sugarcane  farmers.    This  initiative  guarantees  heightened  production  and  productivity  while 
<br/>minimising the adverse effects of natural disasters and associated mitigation expenses. There is also 
<br/>work in progress to reinstate the drainage board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cane Access Roads, Mr. Speaker, an additional $2 million has been earmarked to enhance 
<br/>the cane access roads and crossings, ensuring the cane excess roads remain in accessible conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Manual  Harvesting  Subsidy,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  introduction  of  a  subsidy  for  manual 
<br/>harvesting  represents  a  strategic  and  targeted  approach  by  the  Government  to  incentivise  labour-
<br/>intensive  harvesting  methods  within  the  sugarcane  industry.  This  subsidy  is  a  proactive  measure 
<br/>designed to address specific challenges faced by the farmers and the sector as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Production  based  incentive,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  establishment  of  a  $1  million  incentive 
<br/>programme  for  higher  production  represents  a  significant  commitment  by  the  Government  to 
<br/></span><span>encourage  and  reward  increased  sugar  cane  yields.  This  programme  is  designed  to  benefit  both 
<br/></span><span>individual farmers and the sugar industry as whole by addressing various aspects of cane production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also draw attention to the fact that the sugar industry is not there 
<br/>alone.  Out of 10,800 active cane growers, 85 percent to 90 percent of them practise polyculture (not 
<br/>only sugarcane).  They manage and live in and around farming enterprises (rice, dairy, horticulture, 
<br/>aquaculture,  et  cetera) that has overspills, positive externalities and spina rounds  from  these non-
<br/>sugar agricultural enterprises including fisheries and forestry.  For example, most sugarcane farmers 
<br/>would  be  milking  cows  and  having  chicken  which  is  called  “</span><span>junglee  murgi</span><span>”  running  around  the 
<br/></span><span>compound, small plot with pulses and vegetables. Non sugar agriculture, forestry and fisheries have 
<br/></span><span>also received budgetary support that spills over sugar sector as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revisiting the effect of VAT and tax increases, it is essential to emphasize that our sugarcane 
<br/>farmers currently face minimal impacts, thanks the comprehensive support safety net and subsidies 
<br/>outlined in the 2023 -2024 National Budget.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1633 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the current taxation policy framework, income up to $30,000 is exempted from tax, 
<br/>and most of the farmers are below that threshold.  The inflation as per the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s 
<br/>August 2023 Economic Reports states an average annual inflation rate in the first seven months of 
<br/>2023 stands at 1.3 percent.  It is also to be added that zero VAT is on basic food items (21 of them) 
<br/>and prescribed medicine have zero VAT, so again that is no direct negative impact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, senior  citizens  in  farming communities got social welfare  allowances increased too.  
<br/>However, Mr. Speaker, there are always positive and negative factors to the changes in the tax rates 
<br/>– the increase in the whole landscape of taxation has increased the prices of other items.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there may be inevitable gradual increases in production costs due to general inflation 
<br/>in  the  coming  days  ahead,  the  Coalition  Government  has  diligently  taken  steps  to  mitigate  the 
<br/>immediate pressure to the sugarcane farmers in most of the areas as I have just outlined, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C. J. SINGH.- </span><span>Kon bole</span><span>. </span><span>Suno Suno chhota ladka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rest assured, the Government remains unwavering in its commitment to the well-being and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperity of our sugarcane farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, we have implemented a wide array of initiatives and subsidies to ensure that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they do not bear the full brunt of recent economic challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Last page. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH .- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Finally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Do you want to read it or shall  I read it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to assure this august House that as a result, there has been no immediate adverse impact 
<br/>on  cane  production,  and  our  sugarcane  farmers  continues  to  be  indispensable  contributors  to  our 
<br/>nation’s economic sector and overall economy that brings in $200 million revenue to our economy 
<br/>per year on average.  Again, honourable Pillay, your question was very valuable, and I have given 
<br/>full information about our sugar industry and where we stand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  cost  of  production,  the  cost  of  harvesting  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased, apart from the tax hike, duty and other things. There is a huge cost that has increased.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- And also during times when the mills are not performing, there is also 
<br/></span><span>extra  cost  to  farmers  to  assist  the  labourers  in  terms  of  their  food  and  other  things.    Maybe  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister is very lucky, he has a team... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- …who harvested his burnt cane for $25 a tonne. But the price, the cost 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has gone up to $30 and above and all the hidden costs. My question is, when will the Ministry of

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar, through the Government, increase the guaranteed price? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I think this is the problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- I asked about the guaranteed price.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- The problem with the Member who was asking the question, I said, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are getting a better price of sugar this year and I will inform Parliament in the next sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- In the next sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- There is a calendar of Parliament sittings, read that. The point is this, I 
<br/>will announce the price. It will be much better, you will be happy and I will be happy. As a farmer 
<br/>you will be happy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a question to the honourable Minister, I 
<br/>was with the Standing Committee on Public Accounts are few weeks ago down in the West.  I noted 
<br/>a couple of ways in which they run their farming schemes, we have cooperatives, there is a group of 
<br/>ladies (widows) somewhere in Lautoka, headed by a widow.  I think there is another group of retirees.  
<br/>My question is, I think you are talking about the well-being of these farmers. How do you treat these 
<br/>groups in terms of assistance and also looking after their welfare? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Honourable Member, as much as it is a new question but I will try to 
<br/>answer that. We are talking through the Growers Council. The  Grower’s  Council is there now to 
<br/>assist  any new owner that want  to  come into the farms that will assist  the current  position of the 
<br/>current farmers. If they need assistance, they can directly come to Ministry of Sugar, and we will 
<br/>facilitate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, whoever wrote the speech did a wonderful job, so thank you 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister.  The question was quite clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were talking about VAT 
<br/>and the impact it had on farmers.  Farmers are the backbone of our nation’s economy, unfortunately, 
<br/>it seems the Minister or the Ministry’s lost, but ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- … the VAT increase has impacted everyone including our farmers. Those 
<br/>who have contacted us have said that VAT has really affected them, the cost of goods has gone up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  supplementary  question  that  I  have  is,  has  the 
<br/>Ministry  considered  any  measures  to  alleviate  the  financial  burden  imposed  by  the  tax  hike  on 
<br/>sugarcane farmers such as subsidies and other exemptions?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  some  of  them  were  not  listening  to  my  speech.  
<br/>Everything is here, I will give you a copy, then you can read it.    I actually answered you, everything 
<br/>is here.  You are just trying to waste the time of this Parliament.

<div><span>Religious Education Teachers 
<br/>(Question No. 96/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the plans to include 
<br/>specialised  religious  education  teachers  in  its  remuneration  and  recognition  programmes, 
<br/>considering the important role they play in promoting religious and moral education in our 
<br/>school? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question 
<br/>given  the  important  role  that  the  School  Chaplains  play  in  the  education  of  our  children.  The 
<br/>Chaplaincy Policy was ideally hoped to be reinstated in the third term of 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the Ministry recognised the need to consult widely, and the Ministry is doing this 
<br/>with all faith-based organisations, school management, et cetera, and other stakeholders, given that 
<br/>the  majority  of  the  schools  in  Fiji  are  managed  and  owned  by  faith-based  organisations  and 
<br/>community management. Given the cost sharing arrangement that we will have to have in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work is still work in progress which we hope to complete and have this policy in place 
<br/>very soon, hopefully before the end of the school term. Some of the concerns and issues that have 
<br/>been  identified  regarding  the  reinstatement  of  School  Chaplains,  that  they  will  be  subject  to 
<br/>compliance to all relevant legislations such as the Fiji Teachers Registration Authority and also the 
<br/>2020 Financial Handbook exempts payment of chaplains for non-Government schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some of the Government schools, only eight out of the eleven Government schools have 
<br/>been paid in previous arrangements for school chaplaincy. In short, the work is still in progress, we 
<br/>are trying to formalise the work to ensure that it goes through the proper authority and then to Cabinet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 9</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023, the honourable Minister said 
<br/>that farmers have gone from bad to worse and they are lazy.  So, I would just like to correct him. 
<br/>That is what you have said about the farmers of Fiji, it is in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Coalition Government came to power, there were rumours that in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government offices people would sprinkle holy water, salt and even powder. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Now, in a strategic or operational context, how will the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Education, I know it is  in the process, establish frameworks and monitor and assess the risks like 
<br/></span><span>schools  promoting  a  particular  religion  over  others  for  those  children  or  other  children  may  be 
<br/>pressured to confirm to a particular belief? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just mentioned that the consultation is 
<br/>in progress, taking into consideration the views of the other faith-based organisations that manage 
<br/>the schools.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, I am sure the Ministry will ensure that all the students are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offered religious education, no one is left behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- You cannot force it.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  My  question  is,  how  many  religious  education  teachers  are  there  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>primary and secondary and what is the budget for this programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I think the honourable Member is asking statistics 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which can be provided if its put in as a written question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Minister the Government 
<br/>will take charge of the religious teachers.   Is the Government  going  to  fund the training of these 
<br/>religious teachers, because as you know, most of the schools are run by faith-based organisations?  
<br/>These organisations are not that well off, so is the Government going to assist in funding for the 
<br/>training of these teachers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification, religious chaplaincy have 
<br/>always  been  funded  by  the  Government  right  up  to  2014  to  2017  and  in  the  2020  Financial 
<br/>Management  Handbook,  that  had  been  taken  away.    This  is  something  that  we  are  trying  to 
<br/>reintroduce and is part of the consultation process.
