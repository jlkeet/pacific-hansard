<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Local  Government  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  21/2023),  be  considered  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday 14</span><span>th</span><span> of September, 2023, but

<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Local  Government  (Amendment)  Bill  2023 
<br/></span><span>seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1972, to increase the retirement age of officers appointed 
<br/></span><span>to Municipal Councils from 55 years to 60 years.  Increasing the retirement age of officers appointed 
<br/>to Municipal Councils aligns with the Governmentâ€™s policy on retirement and the retirement age of 
<br/>civil servants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to remove the requirement of calculating interest 
<br/>on overdue rates using the compound interest method.  It also removes the interest rate as this would

<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1641 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be prescribed by regulations, moving forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is urgent for Government and must be considered without delay as 
<br/>Cabinet endorsed the change in retirement age to officers and servants of Local Government in March 
<br/>and consultations of the same has been concluded.  There have been extensive consultations with the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government and the Office of the Solicitor-General.  The Ministry assisted the 
<br/>Office  of  the  Solicitor-General  to  carry  out  public  consultations  in  Suva,  Nasinu,  Nausori,  Lami, 
<br/>Nadi, Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the amending the legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in the 
<br/>Gazette.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 35 of the Act to increase the retirement age of officers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appointed to Municipal Councils from 55 years to 60 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill deletes section 35 of the Act which is obsolete, given that the amendment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in section 35 of the Act to the retirement age.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill clarifies the amendment made to section 35 of the Act and provides that 
<br/>the change in  retirement age from  55 years to  60 years will not  apply to those who have already 
<br/>turned 55 years old before the commencement of the amending legislation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 78 of the Act to remove that interest rate of 11 percent 
<br/>charged on overdue rates and provides that such rates of interest will be prescribed by regulations.  
<br/>The amendment also removes the requirement for overdue rates to be calculated using the compound 
<br/>interest method.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as usual, at the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, there being no interest shown from the Opposition to take the floor on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the debate, I now call on the Attorney-General to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Sir, it is very important that this motion is moved forward and the 
<br/>Bill  is  debated  to  synchronise  the  policy  of  Government  in  terms  of  the  retirement  age  so  that 
<br/></span><span>members or employees of the Local Government are not prejudiced by this law being delayed any 
<br/></span><span>further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament  will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
