<div><span>Urgent Oral Question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diarrhoea Disease Outbreak at Balevuto, Ba 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to allow this question under Standing Order 43, 
<br/>the question is directed to the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I make a correction there, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  It

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be directed at the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services because they have 
<br/>made statements as well, not to the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  I  am  directing  the  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Services.  The question is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few, as reported, have fallen sick and seven, unfortunately, have died in the general 
<br/>areas of Balevuto, Nukuloa, Nacaci and Toge in Ba due to waterborne infections.  Can the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  explain  the  immediate  response  the 
<br/>Government has carried out and future plans to address the plight of these communities in 
<br/>their water project?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to update Parliament on 
<br/>the recent diarrhoea disease outbreak at the Balevuto medical area and the Ba Health Subdivision.  
<br/>Sir, the Ministry of Health’s team in the Western Division, in particular, Ba Command Centre and 
<br/>Ba Subdivisional Outbreak Response Team have been tracking the reported outbreak of diarrhoeal 
<br/>illness in the Balevuto medical area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 4</span><span>th</span><span> September to 8</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 there have been 31 cases reported with another 
<br/>30  reported  in  the  previous  week.    The  cases  are  from  the  communities  as  mentioned  by  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition with signs and symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
<br/>joint pains and body pains, Sir.  So, far 12 cases have required admission to hospital with relatively 
<br/>short hospital stay of two to three days where they responded well to antibiotics, recovered and have 
<br/>been discharged back to their homes.  It has been noted that the young and the elderly populations 
<br/>are mostly likely to develop severe illness requiring hospitalisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, initial laboratory investigations for the patients conducted at the Lautoka 
<br/>Aspen Laboratory indicated that the illness is likely caused by bacteria specifically shigella bacteria, 
<br/>and  the  Ministry  is  still  awaiting  confirmatory  results  on  the  specific  bacteria.    On  what  the 
<br/>Government and the involved Ministry are doing, Sir, we have carried out environmental and water 
<br/>source  investigations  which  include  inspectors  collecting  water  samples  which  have  been  sent  to 
<br/>CDC Laboratory in Suva for further testing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The results of the water test show that Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) supplied water from 
<br/></span><span>the taps of the household sample is free of bacterial contaminants.  The current findings indicate that 
<br/></span><span>the WAF water supply is not the cause of the increase in diarrhoeal disease.   The Ministry is still 
<br/>awaiting  chemical  analysis  conducted  at  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture’s  Koronivia  Laboratory  for 
<br/>water samples collected by WAF teams. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Ba Subdivisional Outbreak Response Team is continuing with the distribution of WASH 
<br/>kits,  purification  tablets  and  conducting  public  health  awareness.    The  Commissioner  Western’s 
<br/>Office is also working with WAF in the flushing and refilling of tanks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am from the same community.  The community is 
<br/></span><span>currently using the water from Naruku, Vatusui, Nacaci, Toge, Balevuto, Nukuloa Backroad, part of 
<br/>Moto, part of Tabataba and the villages of Toge, Balevuto and the settlement of Derelali.  They are 
<br/>close to 700 water meters and it is supplied from the Balevuto Water Catchment.  The real source is 
<br/>through the terrain of the stream some four kilometres above the catchment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1617 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had been liaising with the honourable Minister from last week. What I have observed from 
<br/>my  recent  visitation  to  the  community,  the  residents  are  drinking  water  from  outside,  especially 
<br/>coming  towards  Moto,  Nadrau,  China  Koti,  Kumkum  and  the  nearby  settlements  where  water  is 
<br/>supplied from Waiwai Catchment. Buying bottled water, still not feeling safe. This also happened in 
<br/>2012, there was an outbreak of Hepatitis A and lot of families and residents were sick.  There is close 
<br/>to seven deaths in the community and some people are admitted in Lautoka and also visiting Balevuto 
<br/>Health Centre and the medical doctors around Ba.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What measures are being put in place by the Ministry of Health or in collaboration with the 
<br/>Ministry of Rural Development and Water Authority of Fiji to cart water into these areas and supply 
<br/>safe drinking water until they found out what is the cause because residents are saying, those who 
<br/>have died have died because of diarrhoea? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- In the case of the four or seven as some of the 
<br/>media have stated who have died from this outbreak, I can assure the Members of this august House 
<br/>that we found out that there are underlying causes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the question raised by honourable Pillay, at the moment we have four teams 
<br/>on the ground continuing with their investigations and the awareness part of it. We were working in 
<br/>with close collaboration with WAF and the Director of Water as well together with the NDMO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently on the ground, as I mentioned, we have four teams doing investigation and other 
<br/>research and together with that, yes, water carting is also in the plan.  It must be noted that as I had 
<br/>mentioned,  we  have  not  found  any  contaminants  from  the  water  supply  itself  but  there  has  been 
<br/>evidence of contaminants within their own water source (tanks).  So those ones, we are working with 
<br/>WAF on flushing, cleaning and refilling.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ask a question and may be a plea as well 
<br/>to Government.  First is, when will the results be available because one of the concerns that we have 
<br/>is the inconsistency in the statements coming from WAF and, of course, the results as highlighted by 
<br/>the Ministry of Health?  However, my plea to Government is, please, complete the project. As the 
<br/>honourable Pillay has stated, this is an ongoing issue since 2012.  The previous Government has done 
<br/>a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second is, the lease was under Dayal’s and then they have given up part of the lease. The 
<br/>previous Government had constructed a dam, put fencing around the catchment area and the next 
<br/></span><span>thing which is incomplete is the treatment plant.  We need to connect as well with them, so there is 
<br/></span><span>work that needs to be undertaken there.  There is allocation too in rural development on high-risk 
<br/>water and sanitation, probably in terms of funding, because this must be a priority so that these people 
<br/>can be assisted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you make your reply, honourable Minister for Health and Medical 
<br/>Services, now I see that the honourable Minister for Works wants to make a comment as well to the 
<br/>third supplementary question.  Can we agree, first of all, honourable Members, that this has been an 
<br/>ongoing case from 2012 and now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard from the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services that they have 
<br/>done checks and it is not so much the water, as alluded to by honourable Pillay, coming from the 
<br/>trucks, et cetera, but it is their water source.  Their own tanks have been contaminated, et cetera.  We 
<br/>have  four  teams  on  the  ground,  as  alluded  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services.  So, whilst there is a need to address this agenda issue, can we agree that for the time being, 
<br/>we just leave it to the Government and then we revisit the issue, probably in the next Sitting, so as to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recheck on what has been stated in Parliament that addresses the issue of concern as you have raised, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the only view that I hold from up here, otherwise, it is a never ending one.  It is still 
<br/>ongoing, it is a long existing case but somehow or other, it needs to be addressed.  I hope you will 
<br/>agree to that.

<div><span>Oral Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Eligibility for Civil Servants 
<br/>(Question No. 90/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament on the current arrangement on housing eligibility for civil servants?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past when civil servants were under contracts, the condition was that when they 
<br/>were transferred on promotion to the rural or remote areas, they sign the contract but they are 
<br/>not entitled for housing, even though there are Government quarters available.  With the lapse 
<br/>in that contractual arrangement and retirement age has been extended, I am just asking the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister whether we can review the housing entitlement for civil servants? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  has  really 
<br/>answered his own question.  During the time of the contract, housing was part of the contract.  Now, 
<br/>that  the  contract  has  been  removed,  we  have  gone  back  into  the  Government  responsibility  of 
<br/>providing quarters or giving housing allowances according to the scales that were in operation in the 
<br/>past.  That is, rate per month for what used to be USO1 down to USO4, and so on.  These have been 
<br/>revised and will be part of the salary packages given out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  actual  quarters  provision,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  Quarters  that  were 
<br/>available for occupation by civil servants are now in very, very bad state and we will have to go 
<br/>through a big renovation programme from the Ministry of Works to get them up to a standard for 
<br/>human occupation.  But the answer in  short is that we have arrangements in  the absence of right 
<br/>status,  quality  of  quarters  available  for  senior  civil  servants.    The  others  will  be  paid  housing 
<br/></span><span>allowance in accordance with the scales that have been allowed for in the Budget through the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question;  I know that a few 
<br/>years back under the current Permanent Secretary for Civil Service, a new policy was introduced 
<br/>where we have gone away with institutional quarters and all Government Quarters are referred to as 
<br/>Government  Quarters  and,  therefore,  it  is  not  restricted  to  only  the  Ministries  involved.    Sir,  for 
<br/>example, Koronivia is  mainly for the Ministry of Agriculture but  under that  policy, anyone from 
<br/>outside, if a quarters is available, can also apply for that.  So, is that policy still being retained or is 
<br/></span><span>it in the process of being reviewed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, those quarters are available, they are Government 
<br/>Quarters and any civil servant being posted into the area would be entitled to occupy those.  In lieu 
<br/>of the quarters, they will get their housing allowance.  </span><span>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1619 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, I am glad to see that Government is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looking into the conditions of the quarters for a lot of the workers whom we have in the outer stations.   
<br/>One of the things that we have had in the past and has also encouraged is trying to assist landowners 
<br/>to have ways of getting income for themselves.  So, I am wondering whether the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister would look into this and whether the Government would consider a scheme of incentivising 
<br/>landowning units in those areas, like we did for subdivisions, to help the landowners build houses 
<br/>that can then be made available for rent because that also might give them an opportunity to save on 
<br/>the  capital  that  they  would  inject  into  building  quarters  for  people  in  the  rural  areas.  I  am  just 
<br/>wondering if the honourable Prime Minister would look into those sorts of measures to assist I n 
<br/>dealing with this shortage of quality housing for civil servants, especially in rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the former Minister for his question. As he 
<br/>is  aware,  earlier  this  year,  we  had  introduced  the  concept  of  Public  Private  Partnership  with  the 
<br/>provision  of  affordable  housing,  which  includes  the  concept  of  providing  housing  for  our 
<br/>Government  workers.    So,  it  is  there,  and  it  is  also  dovetailed  into  the  allowances  for  first  home 
<br/>owners which is also contained in our Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proposed Visa-Free Travel to New Zealand and Australia 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 91/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the request made by him 
<br/>during the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting on the proposed visa-free travel for Fijians to 
<br/>New Zealand and Australia? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.    In  fact,  this  is  not  a  new  issue  and  it  has  not  just  been  discussed  at  the  recent  Forum 
<br/>Economic Ministers Meeting, personally, I have been talking about regional economic integration, 
<br/>which means access to the Forum Member countries in terms of realising the full benefits of not only 
<br/>trade  relationships  but  investment  relationships,  and  the  ease  with  which  people  from  within  the 
<br/>Forum Island countries can travel to each other’s countries.  But, for the first time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>this issue was put on the agenda, if I may say, or as part of the discussion at the Forum Economic 
<br/>Ministers Meeting.  In fact, Sir, for the first time, the draft outcome which has been finalised, the 
<br/>Ministers noted that there was a strong desire for visa free travel within the PIF Member countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers were also concerned about how we have talked about regional integration for 
<br/>many years, yet there are a lot of barriers that exist.  With respect to visa free travel to Australia and 
<br/>New Zealand, that is obviously part of the overall agenda of free movement of people, goods and 
<br/>services and investment provisions within the different countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the call for visa free travel is in that context.  However, visa free travel does 
<br/>not mean that people can just buy a ticket and get to Australia and New Zealand and go and live there 
<br/>illegally - it is not that.  A lot of our people have great difficulty in not only getting visa to Australia 
<br/></span><span>and New Zealand, but also to travel to some of the Pacific Island countries.  So, I think it is a good 
<br/></span><span>discussion that the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting had and that is something that we will pursue 
<br/>further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do understand the need for visa free travel.   I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would like to give a little background before I ask my supplementary question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>1620 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister of Finance has emphasised on the urgent need because he wants to 
<br/>facilitate growth of businesses in the geo-economic landscape in the Pacific, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yet, 
<br/>what we get to see is what had been done with a foreign investor, like Grace Roads.  They had been 
<br/>put on red notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Ask your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- What message is the Coalition Government sending to the foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investors, the tourists and the people?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  on  from  that  question,  with  visa  free  travel,  you  have  security  concerns, 
<br/>immigration  challenges,  overstays,  illegal  activities  and  economic  impacts,  so  what  plans  and 
<br/>strategies will the honourable Minister of Finance endorse to strike a balance between the security 
<br/>concerns for the Fijian people, while providing international relations and tourism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before  we hear from the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister of Finance,  I thought we have very clearly heard from the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister that this is something that he had just floated and it is  subject to talks and further 
<br/>discussions.  Maybe, that is where issues that you have raised, honourable Sharma, could then be 
<br/>addressed but this is just something that he has floated and they are still waiting for a proper response, 
<br/>whether  it  is  a  positive  or  negative  response  to  that  suggestion.  Do  you  still  want  to  answer, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, I still want to because of the frivolous nature and the 
<br/>ridiculous statement about Grace Road.  The honourable Member really does not know what he is 
<br/>talking about.  As you have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, quite correctly, he does not even understand what 
<br/>visa  free  is  and  I  have  just  explained.    He  does  not  even  understand  what  it  means  to  promote 
<br/>investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have talked about ease of doing business, removing the various taxes, et cetera, but this 
<br/>is the Government which, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, has set up national committees and is 
<br/>working to remove that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, he is talking about hogwash, he was the biggest hogwash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He talked about it earlier but he was responsible for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He was talking about Government Quarters, et cetera, but the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>worst ever deterioration in Government Quarters happened under their Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Memory lapse!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1621 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I do not know whether we have got a response for honourable Sharma’s 
<br/>question,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Can  this  be  the  last  supplementary  question, 
<br/>honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  for,  once  again, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meandering into somewhere else, being condescending with our young Members of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Question, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should not do that, just let him ask. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right at the outset, the question was regarding getting an update about the request that he had 
<br/>made, when in his answer, he has failed to tell us what the response was from Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand.  He has really said, “We have made a request.”  We all know about this, it has been ongoing 
<br/>for many years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the question to the Minister of Finance is, in your approach, did you discuss the fact 
<br/>that  we  have  also  had  a  lot  of  our  young  people  leaving  our  shores  and  how  has  that  being 
<br/>counterbalanced with respect to this particular request being made by you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- This is still a suggestion that has been floated and we are going right up to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the hills now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  are  absolutely  right,  but  let  me  just 
<br/>explain to honourable Koya.  He asked, what is the progress?  This is the first time, Sir, that this issue 
<br/>has  been  on  the  agenda  of  the  Forum  Economic  Minister’s  Meeting.    The  outcome  document 
<br/>specifically mentions the desire from members for visa free travel within the PIF countries - that is 
<br/>the progress itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this is the first time that the Forum Economic  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministers talked about this whole issue of labour mobility, visa free travel, how this is going to impact 
<br/>on  the  labour  situation,  so  it  is  all  part  of  a  broader  discussion  in  terms  of  the  whole  economic 
<br/>integration agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Workplan - Extension of Sealing Works on Roads 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 92/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on the Ministry’s workplan on the extension of sealing works on roads in 
<br/>Vanua Levu, Ovalau, Taveuni and Kadavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, the seal extension upgrading plan for Vanua Levu includes the Nabouwalu Road from the sealed 
<br/>end, Natewa West Coast Road from Buca Bay Road and Wailevu West Coast Road from Savusavu,  
<br/>with a total distance of approximately 50 kilometres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sealed road upgrading proposal will focus on the following sections of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>roads:

<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Natewa  West  Coast  Road  from  Nacavanadi  to  Korotasere/Sevaci  Junction  spanning 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approximately 30 kilometres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as for Taveuni, we are focusing on the maintenance of the existing road 
<br/>network on the island with some village frontage sealing programme for Vuna Village which also 
<br/>covers Vuna Health Centre, Vuna District School and Kanacea Village on the South-Coastal Road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the plan for Ovalau Island is the resurfacing for the main town centre and seal extension 
<br/>for another five kilometres from the end of the seal road.  Whereas for Kadavu, we are focusing on 
<br/>the ongoing road project and the routine and periodic maintenance programme for the existing rural 
<br/>road network, to maintain its reachability for the travelling public on these two islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for his reply.  My question through 
<br/>you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  in  relation  to  Kadavu  -  is  the  sealing  of  the  road  within  the  Vunisea 
<br/>Government Station and the road down to Naluvia Jetty which services the islands of Galoa and all 
<br/>that goes down to Ravitaki, Nabukelevu and going all the way from Sanima to Naceva to Nakasaleka 
<br/>- would that be part of the plan for the sealing in Kadavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUSAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I focussed on the question which was given 
<br/>to me but I can provide the details of that to the honourable Member later on.  I would like to add 
<br/>that we are budgeted separately for communities, villages and school access, and that is something 
<br/>which we will be focusing on as we move forward.  Those are some of the areas which have been (I 
<br/>do not want to say the word neglected but I will say it) … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Needing attention! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Say it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUSAWAU.- … in the last few years.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Look,  we  are  all  laughing,  honourable  Minister.    This  is  like  the  rugby 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>game we watched this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  we  are  on  roads,  on  Saturday  night  I  was  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua, the road leading up to Tavua Hospital is in a very bad shape. Can that be looked into? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that another new question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUSAWAU.- I have already received that and we have included that in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>West Upgrading Programme.

<div><span>Government Plans - Increase in Departure Tax and VAT 
<br/>(Question No. 93/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1623 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due to the recent increase in the Departure Tax and VAT on tourism-related products 
<br/>and services, can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation  explain  how  the  Government  plans  to  alleviate  the  potential  burden  on  local 
<br/>communities and businesses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- If I may, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say how much the people of Fiji 
<br/>are enjoying their Parliament now that question time has come in the morning.  Also, for the first 
<br/>time, we allowed an urgent oral question.  For eight years we tried in the last Parliament, but it was 
<br/>never allowed. This is democracy, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  Since coming into office, 
<br/>the Coalition Government made it known that our priority was to deal  with our debt repayments. 
<br/>That meant some immediate sacrifices because we would not pass the burden on and that is not good 
<br/>governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We made known that Government resources were limited and collectively put together a fiscal 
<br/>strategy to support immediate recovery while maintaining a sustainable level of economic growth in 
<br/>the future.  A large part of this was to raise revenue and ensure that every tax paying money is spent 
<br/>where it is needed the most - water in taps, better roads, better medical care, education for children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last 16 national budgets, the people of Fiji would have to wait for 
<br/>the day of the announcement to know how lives would be impacted.  But we are not doing it that 
<br/>way.  The honourable Prime Minister, and the Minister for Finance have been open on what to expect 
<br/>in taxes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I come from the tourism sector, and I know its implications.  We have been open and engaged 
<br/>in meaningful dialogue through the Fiscal Review Committee, the National Economic Summit and 
<br/>in the now free and open media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Departure Tax prior to COVID-19 was $200, so to be clear, we are looking at gradual re-
<br/>instatement.  But unlike in the past, we are implementing this change in phases from $100 to $125 in 
<br/>August  2023  and  $140  from  January  2024,  so  that  businesses  and  the  Tourism  Industry  are  not 
<br/>burdened with a drastic change and can make wholesaling and commercial arrangements.  This will 
<br/>add a total of $30 million towards overall tax revenues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Value Added Tax system, firstly we have made it simpler by having 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>only two VAT rates and that has been greatly welcomed.  Second, the 15 percent VAT is not new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before COVID-19, the combined taxes in tourism was  - VAT 9 percent, 
<br/>Service Turnover Tax (STO) 6 percent and ECAL 10 percent; meaning 25 percent taxes on tourism.  
<br/>So, we are in fact 20 percent lower than what the other side of Parliament had.  The Tourism Industry 
<br/>is recovering stronger than anticipated with higher consumption spending and economic momentum.  
<br/>For the last seven months of this year, we have consistently recorded visitor numbers above pre-
<br/>COVID-19 levels with higher yield.  People are spending more in tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism will continue to grow and recover whilst supporting our economy and we know the 
<br/></span><span>industry is doing extremely well.  To cushion any impacts, we are providing social relief while being 
<br/>mindful, the current measures put us on a better path in the long term.  It is only about a financial 
<br/>year - over 90 thousand people on social welfare have increased monthly allowances of 15 percent 
<br/>and  25  percent,  $78.2  million  will  go  towards  almost  55  thousand  senior  citizens.    The  family 
<br/>assistance scheme is allocated $45.6 million, we are also investing significantly in our health care

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and in education to ease the burden of the vulnerable.  We are simplifying the regulatory environment 
<br/>to support businesses and investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of tourism, we have actually increased the allocation for Tourism 
<br/>Fiji’s Marketing Grant.  From what it was in 2019 to $30 million today.  This, coupled with  Fiji 
<br/>Airways significant investment in marketing and connectivity, means that we will continue to expect 
<br/>a  growing  industry.    Sir,  these  tax  measures  are  permanently  adding  $600  million  in  additional 
<br/>revenue of about 5 percent of GDP to bring the Government debt situation on a path of sustainability.  
<br/>That is the big picture we should be talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure if he has answered that fully, but that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>alright.  He is used to meandering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, in light of the fact that Australia is again going to go 
<br/>through  another  interest  rate  rise  and  New  Zealand  is  somewhat  still  in  recession,  the  onward 
<br/>bookings  with  respect  to  people  coming  to  Fiji,  is  there  a  likelihood  that  we  are  going  to  see  a 
<br/>downturn specifically because of this particular rise and also that means the suffering of our tourism-
<br/>based communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>What we have today is what we normally term in marketing as “pent-up demand”.  What we see is 
<br/>that pent-up demand has legs, and we believe that this momentum we see today should go on for 
<br/>another three or four years, but we are not going to rest on that.  I am calling for a tourism conference 
<br/>in December to try to understand this phenomena. It is true, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that inflations are up 
<br/>but the pent-up demand for travel supersedes all those needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a phenomena that we need to get to understand but as we know, Mr. Speaker, there was 
<br/>a  survey  carried  out  in  Australia  some  weeks  ago  and  Fiji,  by  Expedia,  one  of  the  biggest 
<br/>consolidators, was top of the ranks in terms of preferred destination to travel to.  So, we are sitting 
<br/>pretty comfortably, Mr. Speaker, and we now have a modern aircraft A350.  The tourism products 
<br/>are all high class, young fleet, top product so our tourism industry, Mr. Speaker, is sitting comfortably 
<br/>and it is something that has been built over the years, not only during the FijiFirst period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, this increase 
<br/></span><span>in VAT brings $600 million but please also tell the other Deputy Prime Minister and honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minster for Finance that he also increased our debt by $600 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, you have talked about repayment 
<br/>but what repayment are your going to do this year?  Are you confused between debt repayment and 
<br/>refinancing?  I want to know if there is a repayment done in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
<br/></span><span>Finance had articulated that very clearly.  It is all factored into the macro situation of the country.  
<br/>We already pay our debts with all interest and continued to grow the economy, Mr. Speaker, and 
<br/>tourism will play a big part of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  honourable  Professor  Prasad  was  not  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister....

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1625 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- It is a background to the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Everything is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interconnected.  Coalition Government, get used to it!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! He is coming to the question, I think. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- When honourable Professor Prasad was not a Minister, he said, “the 
<br/>price of goods are very high”, and what he does after becoming a Minister, he increases VAT.  On 
<br/>the other hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has supported the nuclear waste dump, but the 
<br/>question Fijian people asked is, “where do we go, how do we consume?” </span><span>Na idhar ge na udhar ge</span><span>
<br/>and that is what they are saying in our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question for the honourable Deputy Prime Minister is that local businesses are challenged 
<br/>and suffering from VAT increases because no one is celebrating this new democracy that you talk 
<br/>about - access to finance allows the idea of strengthening local businesses and markets to expand 
<br/>their businesses.  But with limited assets to use as collateral, SMEs are seen as high-risk borrowers 
<br/>which means high cost of fees and interest rates from the bank with the increase VAT for them as 
<br/>well. So, what is the Government support to mobilise and optimise access to finance for this locally 
<br/>led businesses in Fiji to survive and go on in accordance with your plans in the tourism sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a mouthful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It is a good question but I will answer, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We appear to be living in two different worlds.  The world this side is saying there is a boost 
<br/>in confidence in the economy where there is liquidity in the banking system, where people are coming 
<br/>out to borrow money and the banks are lending.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we have said, the economy will grow this year and tourism is driving it in a 
<br/>huge  way  and  of  course  benefiting  other  sectors  of  the  economy.    So,  I  am  really  at  a  loss  to 
<br/>understand where they are coming from because they appear to be coming from another planet.  What 
<br/>we see here in Fiji today is very different – the confidence level, the lack of fear in getting things 
<br/>done.  Mr Speaker, this is translating to a confidence to grow the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would ask them to ask the Governor of the Reserve Bank to give them an update but the 
<br/>bottom-line is that the economy is booming, and it is growing today and will continue in the future, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will resume when the bell sounds.
