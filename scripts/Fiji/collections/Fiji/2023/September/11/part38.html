<div><span>In December 2017, School Heads, School Management, Divisional and District Offices were 
<br/></span><span>informed via Circular (C103-17), that primary schools were to be classified as Small, Medium 
<br/>or Large based on the number of teaching staff in the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SMALL primary schools were classified as those schools that had 7 teachers or less and had no 
<br/>AHT;  MEDIUM  primary  schools  were  classified  as  those  schools  that  had  8-25  teachers 
<br/>including one AHT; and LARGE primary schools were classified as those schools that had over 
<br/>26 teachers and two AHTs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  2017,  Executive-approved  changes  to  some  schools'  classifications  have  occurred.  In 
<br/>addition, many schools have been allocated additional teachers. As a result, under the current 
<br/>'teacher-only'  criteria,  there  has  become  a  lack  of  equity  and/or  consistency  for  a  number  of 
<br/>primary schools within the primary classifications system.
