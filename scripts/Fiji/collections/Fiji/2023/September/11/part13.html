<div><span> Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1603 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was compiled by the previous Committee in reviewing the contents of the Ministry of Youth and 
<br/>Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the financial year 2019-2020 was the beginning of an extremely challenging 
<br/>one for the Ministry.  This was because of the rapid response plan in the wake of the global pandemic 
<br/>through  the  announcement  and  implementation  of  the  Youth  Farm  Initiative  Programme.  The 
<br/>Ministry  continued  with  its  programmes  under  the  Youth  Empowerment  Programmes  and 
<br/>simultaneously, carried out the implementation of the Civil Service Reforms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  continued  conducting  accredited  trainings  at  its  five  Youth 
<br/>Training Centres, mobile skills training continued to be rolled out across the four Divisions, and there 
<br/>was a notable increase in the number of youth attending these trainings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  development  of  sports  is  ongoing  with  the  Ministry  through  close 
<br/>collaboration with the Fiji National Sports Commission.  In raising our sporting standards, experts 
<br/>were brought in to enhance the participation of youth in local and international sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in addition, the Ministry also conducts programmes through its own initiative, 
<br/>targeting youth groups.  Over the years, the Ministry continued to uphold an all-inclusive approach 
<br/>towards sports development in the country and ensured that all Fijians received equal access to sports 
<br/>and sporting facilities regardless of gender, background or ability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in 
<br/>the last term of Parliament for their input, which has greatly assisted the Committee in the completion 
<br/>of  this  Report.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Members  of  the  current  Standing 
<br/>Committee, the Secretariat and other support staff for their valuable input and support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I also extend my gratitude to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Youth 
<br/>and Sports, Mr. Rovereto Nayacalevu, and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all honourable Members to take note of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed over to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>move a motion without notice:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I  am  pleased to  present  a 
<br/>report  from  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  on  the  Review  of  the  Fiji  Sports  Council 
<br/>Annual Report from the period of August 2017 to July 2018.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), 
<br/>which mandates the Committee to look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, 
<br/>culture and media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Social Affairs, on the last term of Parliament, was referred this 
<br/>Report.  In this new term of Parliament, the Annual Report was re-introduced and referred to the 
<br/>current Standing Committee.  As per the normal process for scrutiny, the Committee was mandated 
<br/>to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Report built on the work that was compiled by the previous Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in reviewing the contents of the Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  noted  that  there  were  achievements  in  the  2017-2018 
<br/>financial year - the most memorable one, and its greatest long-term impact was the commissioning 
<br/>of the new Fiji Sports Council Head Office, the reopening of the refurbished FMF Gymnasium and 
<br/>the redevelopment of the Vodafone Arena. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Vodafone arena is the first venue in Fiji to assist weightlifting in hosting the International 
<br/>Weightlifting  Federation  World  Junior  Championship.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  also  noted  that 
<br/>Netball Fiji won the bid to host the World Youth Championship in 2022, but this did not eventuate 
<br/>due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, developments that had taken place within the Council now contribute to the 
<br/>health  and  well-being  of  all  Fijians  by  providing  venues  and  facilities  for  sports  and  active 
<br/>recreational activities that bring people from all walks of life together through sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament for their input. I would also like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Members of the current Standing Committee, the Secretariat and other support staff for their valuable 
<br/>input and support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not least, my sincere gratitude to the former Chief Executive Officer of the Fiji Sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Council and staff for their timely assistance in this review process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this 
<br/>Report to Parliament and request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of 
<br/></span><span>the Report.
