<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Urgent Oral Question – Hon. I.B. Seruiratu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, on to the next Agenda item, I have received an Urgent Oral Question 
<br/>from the honourable Leader of the Opposition with respect to recent reports of people being reported 
<br/>to have fallen sick and seven, unfortunately, have died in the general areas of Balevuto, Nukuloa, 
<br/>Nacaci and Toge in Ba due to waterborne infections.   I will now proceed to give my ruling with 
<br/>respect to the Urgent Oral Question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I wish to clarify that Standing Order 43(1) provides –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That a written copy of the question must be delivered to the Secretary-General one hour 
<br/>before the sitting, in which the question will be asked.  I can confirm that this was adhered 
<br/>to.   
<br/>The question must be of an urgent character and relates to a matter of public importance 
<br/>in  which  the  Speaker  must  decide  whether  the  question  satisfies  the  requirement  of 
<br/>urgency and public importance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I am satisfied that the Urgent Oral Question is of an urgent character 
<br/>and relates  to  a matter of public importance.   Whilst  at  the same time,  I  can  confirm  that a joint 
<br/>statement by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Water Authority of Fiji and the Ministry 
<br/>of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  on  the  diarrhoea  outbreak  in 
<br/>Balevuto, Ba was released on Sunday, 10</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also concerned that perhaps not all Fijians may have had the opportunity to read that 
<br/>statement.  In that respect, I am allowing the Urgent Oral Question by the honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition to be asked first today and pursuant to Standing Order 43(3), Oral Question No. 89/2023 
<br/></span><span>will be omitted accordingly, and that is already in the Standing Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Oral Question No. 89/2023 has lapsed) 
<br/></span></div>
