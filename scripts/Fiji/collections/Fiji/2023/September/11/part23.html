<div><span>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>State  Land  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  23/2023),  be  considered  by  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 but 
<br/>that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  State  Lands  Act  1945  provides  for  the 
<br/>administration of State land.  In 2021, section 13 of the Act was amended by the State Lands (Budget 
<br/>Amendment) Act 2021 (commonly referred to as 21 Amendment Act) to remove the requirement of 
<br/>pinning consent from the Director of Lands for any mortgage, charge, pledge, caveat or for any such 
<br/>lease to be dealt with by any court of law or other process of any court of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2021 Amendment Act also amended Section 13 of the Act to provide 
<br/>the consent of the Director and can only be refused when there is a breach of any lease condition or 
<br/>where such application to deal with the land is not in accordance with any law.  The 2021 Amendment 
<br/>Act came into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2022, section 16 of the Act was amended by the State Land (Amendment) Act 2022 to 
<br/>empower the Director to re-enter land and cancel land lease, licence or approve any notice of lease 
<br/>in instance where occupants of the land have as a result of dispossession of land or due to political 
<br/>upheaval or cancellation or non-renewal of the leases or licenses resort to seek refuge on the land for 
<br/>which they were not lessees under the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In these instances, the lessees permitted such persons to use the land, it did not obtain the 
<br/></span><span>consent of the Director of Lands making the arrangement unlawful under the Act.  Therefore, the 
<br/></span><span>Director may re-enter land and cancel the lease, lessors who approve the notice of lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due to the challenges  and difficulties faced as a result of the amendments, the State Land 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill 2023 seeks to amend the Act to remove some of the amendments made by the 
<br/>2021 Amendment Act and the 2022 Amendment Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations were held with the Office of the Solicitor-General and of course with the Office 
<br/>of the Ministry of Lands.  Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement if passed 
<br/></span><span>by Parliament, the main legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice 
<br/></span><span>in the gazette. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 13 of the Act by deleting sub-section 1(a) and sub-section 
<br/>6 as substituting section 1.  Clause 3 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a new section 38 to 
<br/>provide for the transitional provision and give clarity to any application for any mortgage, charge, 
<br/>pledge, caveat or for any such lease to be dealt with by any court of law, that has been made under 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1649 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 13 of the Act on or after 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2021 and before the commencement of the State Land 
<br/>(Amendment) Act 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill  amends Section 16 of the Act  to  delete sub-sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  
<br/>Clause 5 of the Bill amends the Act by consequently amending the State Land, leases and licence 
<br/>regulation 1980 to remove part of the regulations and to clarify that any pending application before 
<br/>the Committee established under part 4 of the regulation prior to the commencement of the many 
<br/>legislations must be dealt with in accordance with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that the Bill be debated upon on Thursday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At the end of the day as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>usual, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the standard response to this is again the use of 
<br/>“Order 51”, I  think enough has been said on it, but we do raise objection to it being used in Parliament 
<br/>time and time again without actual reason and without them showing the actual hurry as required 
<br/>with respect to these particular amendments.  Just in short, we do object the use of “Order 51”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be no right of reply. I have articulated the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urgency of this matter. This is also consequential to the earlier Bill which now enact in relation to 
<br/>iTaukei Land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes cast: 
<br/>-  29 
<br/>Ayes 
<br/>Noes 
<br/>-  25 
<br/>Not voted  -    1
