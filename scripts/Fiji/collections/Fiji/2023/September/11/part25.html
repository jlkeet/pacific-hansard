<h3>REVIEW OF THE PARLIAMENTARY REMUNERATIONS ACT 2014</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW OF THE PARLIAMENTARY REMUNERATIONS ACT 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  in  addition  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on  Wednesday,  12th  July  2023, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament approves that the Emoluments Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Review the salaries, allowances and benefits of the Members of Parliament, President and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker as provided for under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Review the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989; and 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Must report back to Parliament at a later sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are given 20 minutes, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not 
<br/>intend to take 20 minutes.  This is a motion Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is brought before Parliament really 
<br/>in agreement in terms of the Emoluments Committee being a bipartisan Committee and represented 
<br/>by both sides of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  July  2023  I  had  moved  that  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  129  that  the 
<br/></span><span>Emoluments  Committee  be  established  to  review  the  salaries  and  allowances  of  the  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament as provided for under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 and the Emoluments 
<br/>Committee must report back to Parliament at the September Sitting.  This was unanimously agreed 
<br/>to by all Members of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Emoluments Committee has convened six times and in our meetings, 
<br/>we have received submissions from all political parties who are represented in Parliament and as a 
<br/>result  of  these  submissions,  the  parties  have  addressed  the  position  of  the  Speaker  and  also  the 
<br/></span><span>President as provided for in the Parliamentary Remunerations Act, as well as submissions were made 
<br/></span><span>about the retirement allowances under the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to make further additions to the words of the motion to amend it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to 
<br/>include the Review of the Salaries, Allowances and Benefits for the positions of His Excellency the 
<br/>President and the honourable Speaker as well as the inclusion  of the retirement allowances in the 
<br/>Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act including pensions.

<div><span> Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do acknowledge that this was submitted in the motion being moved in July by the Members 
<br/>of the Opposition to include the issue on pensions and the Retirement Allowances Act.  However, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, the Emoluments Committee convening has received a huge support from all parties 
<br/>represented here in Parliament to also review this.  So, we are a Committee that listens and though 
<br/>we were to report back this week, we have sort the extension of time to report back at a later sitting 
<br/>in this motion, Sir, as well as to seek Parliament’s support for the inclusion of the remuneration of 
<br/>the honourable Speaker as well as His Excellency the President as well as the consideration of the 
<br/>retirement allowances in the Parliament, Retirement Allowances Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I seek Parliament to adopt the following amendments as highlighted in the motion that I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moved as I had read out earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak on 
<br/>this motion.  This motion seeks Parliament’s endorsement for the Emoluments Committee to review 
<br/>salaries, allowances and benefits not only for the Members of Parliament but also for the Speaker 
<br/>and  His  Excellency  the  President  under  the  Parliamentary  Remunerations  Act  of  2014  and  the 
<br/>Parliamentary Retirement Allowance Act of 1989.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the legislation guiding MPs benefits are outdated. For example, 
<br/>the Parliamentary Retirement Allowance Act is 34 years old. Also, there are certain provisions in the 
<br/>Parliamentary  Remuneration  Act  that  need  to  be  amended  as  discussed  during  the  induction 
<br/>workshop for better clarity and interpretation.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is whether it 
<br/>is ethical for the MPs to review their own salaries and benefits through an Emoluments Committee 
<br/>made up of Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  MPs  salaries  and  allowances  is  a  sensitive  issue  that  needs  to  be  handled 
<br/>carefully and ethically otherwise it can erode public trust.  In my view, we have to avoid conflict of 
<br/>interest.  Parliamentarians must not have a direct role in setting their own salaries and benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are international best practices used by Parliaments around the world 
<br/>and  we  must  do  the  same  to  ensure  the  remuneration  is  fair,  equitable  and  free  from  political 
<br/>influence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Emoluments  Committee  can  play  the  role  of  a  facilitator  but  not  directly  involved  in 
<br/>determining the salaries and benefits, not even receiving a submission from political parties as I have 
<br/>heard from the Chairperson of the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before the House, in my personal view, needs to be amended to 
<br/>allow the appointment of an independent authority or expert to determine MPs salaries and benefits 
<br/>including the Speaker and His Excellency the President. If we lack that expertise or interest in the 
<br/>Fijian market then the Emoluments Committee, with the help of Parliament can seek assistance from 
<br/>development partners or from other Parliaments around the globe.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to hear a little bit more during the closing of motion for honourable Tabuya to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tell us whether how the Parliamentarians are involved in this Committee just for clarity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard from honourable Gavoka that our economy is 
<br/>doing very well, very emphasised.  Liquidity is high but I just want to highlight one simple point, 
<br/>yes, liquidity is high, people have taken loan in fact the loans have been approved but it is sitting in 
<br/>the banks, they are not uplifting the loan.  So, liquidity may be high, approvals are there but they are 
<br/>not uplifting the loans and that needs to be taken into consideration.    
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1655 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the economy is doing so well, then my question is, why the 
<br/>Government has forgotten its promises made during the elections such as increasing minimum wages 
<br/>for our unskilled workers and the review of salaries and wages for our civil servants?  I hope this is 
<br/>also  on  the  Government’s  agenda  and  I  look  forward  to  a  motion  in  the  future  or  a  ministerial 
<br/>statement or anything of that nature detailing what you intend to do on these two issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a two cents contribution to the motion 
<br/>that is before us.  It will be proper if I, at this stage, declare an interest on this motion.  I am expressing 
<br/>my own personal view and not those of my colleagues.  The motion that is before us says that the 
<br/>Parliament approves that the Emoluments Committee reviews the salary, allowances and benefits of 
<br/>the Members of Parliament, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  submit  that  it  is  wrong  for  us  as  Members  of  Parliament  to  be  in  the 
<br/>Committee and review the salaries, allowances and benefits.  I would like to suggest as earlier on 
<br/>suggested by the honourable Premila Kumar that a committee should be entirely of people outside 
<br/>this Parliament.  At the moment, I am told that the committee is made up of all political parties except 
<br/>National Federation Party (NFP).  One wonders why not NFP, by these three, so three parties there; 
<br/>one each.  Okay, let me tell why – because when people will start asking them about the salaries and 
<br/>wages, they will say to the ordinary people, “we were not even in the committee.”  So stop! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Honourable Manoa, where is the report on Grace Road? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is what you do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- By this Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think by having an independent committee, 
<br/>we would be showing the very people who voted us in here that we are quite happy to have our work 
<br/>assessed by an independent committee.   For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the workers have their trade 
<br/>unions, the salary staff have their associations and for us, are we going to bargain ourselves?  That is 
<br/>what  really  concerns  me.    I  would  say  no  and  that  is  why  I  am  very  strongly  suggesting  that  an 
<br/>independent committee to assess our work and may I also urge that such a committee must not only 
<br/>be seen to be independent, but it must be independent in practice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  whether  the  time  is  right  for  this  exercise?    We  heard  what  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister had to say about the economy this morning.  Let us be fair to the 
<br/></span><span>people, they are going through some difficult times.  On Friday, I have an opportunity to make an 
<br/></span><span>End of Week Statement but let me say and I put it to Parliament, let us amend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  that  Committee,  during  the  introduction  of  the  motion,  the  mover  said  that  the 
<br/>Committee had met six times, that is fine because this is in front of us, this is an opportunity to correct 
<br/>it.  Dissolve that Committee and appoint an independent committee, what is wrong with that?  If we 
<br/>can ask the workers to bargain with their trade unions, the salary staff with their association, why not 
<br/>us?  What example are we giving to the people out there?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my two cents contribution and I think it will make some sense to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people on the Government side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the motion by the honourable Madam Minister 
<br/>and Leader of the Government Business deserves our full support because it would result in giving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what  I  say  true  meaning  to  the  credibility  and  independence  of  the  work  of  the  Parliamentary 
<br/>Emoluments Committee in determining the remuneration and allowances for Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just to remind honourable Bala and honourable Kumar, when this motion was 
<br/>brought to Parliament and I know that motion was brought to Parliament with the concurrence of 
<br/>Opposition Members and I know without naming some of them, they were coming to me and saying, 
<br/>“when is the Emoluments Committee is going to meet?”  When I spoke on that motion and I want to 
<br/>quote what I said, “but that does not mean that the Parliamentary Emoluments Committee itself, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, will make an assessment because the principle is that we cannot determine our own salaries 
<br/>and allowances ourselves”. We have said that, and he is ignoring it, so what we said .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What did the motion say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  So  we  need  some  experts.  The  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Government in Parliament had already said that this Committee will invite independent experts, those 
<br/>who can look at best practices, data, et cetera and advise the Committee because ultimately whatever 
<br/>happens, whether it is a Committee of experts or independent Committee, it will still have to come 
<br/>to Parliament and we will have to vote. The only thing that we are saying is that the experts based on 
<br/>some reasonable independent in our assessment but the work of Parliament and passing of an Act or 
<br/>amendment to an Act will have to be done by Parliamentarians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I want to say, Mr. Speaker, is the process of determining the allowances 
<br/>of office holders and Members of Parliament is distinctly different. What we are doing is distinctly 
<br/>different, Sir, under what happened under the FijiFirst Government in 2016.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, a 
<br/>five-Member Committee made its own recommendations, and this was in 2016, they forgot that there 
<br/>was an independent Emoluments Committee that met.  That Committee chaired by a Government 
<br/>Member, recommended huge increases in allowances for Ministers and others.   This is a Government 
<br/>that is going to review that.  They have actually forgotten, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make and remind all of them,  I know he is playing politics and 
<br/>trying  to  pretend  that  he  is  concerned  about  the  people  and  making  generalisations  about  cost  of 
<br/>living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- People know we have qualities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We know that he goes and lies around the place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Everyone knows you too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- But what, Mr. Speaker, they forget when the military took 
<br/>over the Government and some of them were part of it, there was a Decree which established the 
<br/>Government Ministers salaries and it was paid by a private accounting firm without any disclosure 
<br/>and more, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  they  brought  the Constitution  when  we  had  the  2014  Elections,  after  the  Elections, 
<br/></span><span>when they knew that they had won and were going to form Government, on 6</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2014 before 
<br/></span><span>the first sitting of Parliament because in the Constitution they put a provision to say that Decrees can 
<br/>be made until the first sitting of the Parliament under the Constitution. What they did, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, some of them were part of that party in Government, they brought a Decree. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the first sitting of Parliament in 2014, they passed and determined 
<br/>their own salaries. Some of them were sworn in, they did not know, they knew what was going to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1657 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happen, that is what they did.  So, really as a Government, we brought this motion to review all these 
<br/>and we are saying that the Committee should invite independent experts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What does the motion say? You cannot read the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have already had discussions, the Committee is already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>doing it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker he is totally confused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am not confused! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are the Professor, you cannot even read the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is so agitated and confused that he forgot 
<br/>that there is a Terms of Reference for the Emoluments Committee. The Terms of Reference very 
<br/>clearly says… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- All of you will benefit! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … that you can have an independent committee to look at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the kind of lies that he tries to tell about what he is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Decrease your pay! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Privately, Mr. Speaker, they all want it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They all want increase in allowances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You want it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They all want retirement allowances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Stop blaming us! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is yelling, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Don’t point at me! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is yelling, Mr. Speaker, because I am telling the truth.

<div><span> Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying this, when Parliament came into being, the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee of which the convention was always that the Opposition will Chair. When as 
<br/>Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I asked the Ministry of Economy at that time and the 
<br/>Prime  Minister’s  Office  to  come  to  the  Committee  and  disclose  what  was  happening  with  these 
<br/>private accounting firms and what was being paid.  The moment I did that, the next thing they brought 
<br/>a motion in Parliament to change the Standing Order and sack the Chairman of the Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee.  That was what they did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hypocrisy!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Here,  they  are  talking  about  hypocrisy,  they  are  trying  to 
<br/>moralise when they have no standing, no leg  to stand on. In fact, what has happened, what we have 
<br/>done, Sir, since we have come into Government, not only we have provided the freedom for them as 
<br/>Opposition  Members,  resources  but  we  are  practising  what  should  be  practised  in  a  normal 
<br/>parliamentary democracy and that is why we are going through this process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that they will support the motion as they have been already part of it. 
<br/>He was talking about why NFP is not there, we are in Government, as Government Members were 
<br/>there, they represent all of us. When we talk about a Committee, it means the three parties and it does 
<br/>not have to be NFP or SODELPA or PAP, if two parties can represent us, that is fine, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank the …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You playing politics with your partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish 
<br/>the honourable Members on the other side would have consulted their honourable Members on the 
<br/>Emoluments Committee, because they would have received full information of what has occurred 
<br/>within the Emoluments Committee.  We put out an Expression of Interest twice for an independent 
<br/>consultant and there are terms of reference for the Emoluments Committee.  We are in the process 
<br/></span><span>of securing one and we are convening again next week to continue our work.  Yes, we have also 
<br/></span><span>consulted our development partners as suggested.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just hope that we will support this unanimously as we have done in the 
<br/>first  motion,  simply  because,  this  has  become  a  bipartisan  exercise,  working  very  well  with  the 
<br/>honourable Opposition Members, honourable Bulitavu and honourable Maharaj, with the rest of us 
<br/>with the Members of the Committee, myself, honourable Radrodro and honourable Tuisawau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  I  want  to  thank  the  Members  of  the  Committee  for  their  hard  work  and  also  the 
<br/></span><span>political parties who made submissions.  At the end of the day, whatever the independent consultant 
<br/></span><span>submits to us and whatever we bring, will only be recommendations and it will be up to Parliament 
<br/>to pass - that is the prerogative of Parliament, so I seek the full support of Parliament in this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.

<br/></span><span>honourable Members are aware, in the previous two terms of Parliament, Parliament used to pay a 
<br/>certain figure amounting to $15,000 as part of the funds allocated to the political parties for attending 
<br/>to its political party functions that are represented in Parliament, and it has been the practice in the 
<br/>last two terms.  Some political parties would allocate a constituency allowance to its Members of 
<br/>Parliament, so this is nothing new.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It should be noted that the current Government would now like to channel these funds to the 
<br/>honourable Members as part of their Parliamentary Duty Allowance, to be able to visit areas where 
<br/></span><span>they come from and to certain areas close by and assist the people of Fiji wherever they can even 
<br/></span><span>though Fiji is one constituency.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funds breakdown is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$10,000 be allocated to all honourable Members; and  
<br/>$5,000 be allocated to the political party they represent.

<div><span> Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These funds allocated would be like the past Parliaments where these allowances were given 
<br/>to all honourable Members.  However, we have brought this by way of motion as there are precedents 
<br/>done in the past, for example, on 12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2018 to be exact, this was a motion presented by the 
<br/>honourable Usamate in terms of the FNPF contribution to be paid to the honourable Members who 
<br/>are not allowed to re-join FNPF after withdrawing twice, and now this motion is moved to amend 
<br/>the determination of the Parliamentary Remuneration Act 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is something new here and given that all honourable Members of this august Parliament 
<br/>serve the people of Fiji in their own different ways, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these funds would greatly assist 
<br/>the honourable Members as part of their duties to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in order to address this particular issue to see what can be done about it, this is why the 
<br/>members of this Parliament need to support this motion so that Parliament adopts the Amendment to 
<br/>Part B of the Schedule to the Parliamentary Remuneration Act 2014, as highlighted in the motion 
<br/>that I just read out earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a point of clarification.  We would like to enquire 
<br/>why the Chairperson of the Emoluments Committee is bringing in this particular motion.  It should 
<br/>be the Leader of Government Business but as being  mentioned by you Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 
<br/>Leader  of  Government  Business  is  bringing  this  motion  as  Chairperson  of  the  Emoluments 
<br/>Committee.  There has been no discussion and I think we need to rephrase it to Leader of Government 
<br/>Business rather than the Chairperson of the Emoluments Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The subject is both… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- </span><span>Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Its record, evidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is just seeking clarification on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your indulgence, I agree with the 
<br/>correction that has been stated by the honourable Opposition Whip, that it is a motion moved by the 
<br/>Leader of Government Business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  That  has  been  clarified,  honourable  Maharaj.    It  is  the  Leader  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must all remember at all times that our </span><span>Hansard</span><span> is 
<br/>really there for infinity and it must always be correct.  So, honourable Minister of Finance, I think 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Women  has  actually  done  the  right  thing.    We  cannot  mull  over 
<br/>something and just say that it is okay.  We cannot do that because </span><span>Hansard</span><span> must be correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think with this particular motion right at the outset, let me just say from 
<br/></span><span>our perspective we are objecting to it.  There are a few reasons to it and I think the people of Fiji 
<br/>deserve an explanation of what has transpired and why this is actually before us.  Everyone in Fiji 
<br/>needs to be aware of what is actually happening.  It has been said before that this is tantamount to a 
<br/>backdoor way of giving MPs an increase of $10,000 per annum in cash.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1661 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also led to believe that there were consultations between the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance and senior executives in Parliament, and the SGP’s Office decided to disburse the actual 
<br/>grant to the political parties which was in the sum of about $2.125 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what will happen is now that irrespective of the numbers or members you have 
<br/>in Parliament each political party will receive $325,000 each.  Please bear with me because I think 
<br/>this is something that needs to be said.   Each political party is also at liberty to spend without any 
<br/>acquittals to Parliament which simply means … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are we on the same… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, Sir. It is part of the same package and I will get to the $10,000 one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in a minute because it has been done like that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, what is happening is that it simply means that you do not have to tell Parliament how 
<br/>the money is spent.  However, because of the Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding and 
<br/>Disclosures) Act, all political parties have to, on an annual basis, provide to the Fijian Election Office 
<br/>the annual audited accounts which includes sources of revenue, includes any Parliamentary grants 
<br/>and this $325,000 now is a new allocation.  This was never previously given to political parties.  The 
<br/>reason why I am doing this, Sir, is for the whole of Fiji to understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was given by Parliament previously during the FijiFirst Government was a grant based 
<br/>on the number of Members a political party had in Parliament.  And quite simply put, if you had five 
<br/>it was multiplied by $15,000. If you had three it was three times $15,000. So, whatever your number 
<br/>is what you got.  Again, this money would be spent by the Party as it saw fit, to conduct its affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  apart  from  this  new  allocation  of  $325,000  given  to  each  political  party  the 
<br/>previous allocation of $15,000 would be paid differently.  Now, what is happening is only $5,000 
<br/>will be given per Member to the political party. In other words, if a political party had three seats, 
<br/>they would get $15,000 as opposed to $45,000.  The balance of $10,000 from the $15,000 would be 
<br/>given to each Member of Parliament and this new personal benefit will be called the Parliamentary 
<br/>Duty Allowance.  This would be payable to all individual parliamentary Member right from the Prime 
<br/>Minister, 3 Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Leader of Opposition, and all 
<br/>Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, basically that $10,000 was going to be paid to each MP in the form of $833.33 
<br/></span><span>on a monthly basis, and it will go directly into each individual MPs bank account. That also, along 
<br/></span><span>with that $10,000, every MP would not have to provide any acquittals. In other words, they can spend 
<br/>it  as  they  like  and  not  to  provide  receipts  or  invoices  to  Parliament.  And  more  significantly  that 
<br/>$10,000 would be tax exempt.  Are there any problems with this? It is a very simple explanation, Sir. 
<br/>This explanation was given to the other side by our General Secretary of the FijiFirst Party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are deeply concerned with all of this for two very critical reasons.  Under this particular 
<br/>scheme  of  allocation,  all  the  political  parties  will  receive  their  $325,000  despite  their  size.    Two 
<br/>political parties namely SODELPA and NFP with no more than five seats and then you have got the 
<br/></span><span>People’s Alliance Party and FijiFirst both with more than 26, but we all get the same amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The disparity is quite huge, Mr. Speaker, but then again this is the prerogative of the SGP and 
<br/>mind you, Mr. Speaker, this cannot be interfered.  I think we have raised it also with respect to the 
<br/>anomaly that exists with respect to what has been send out by the Secretary-General of Parliament.  
<br/>On the one hand, it is stated that the party did not have to provide any acquittals and could spend the 
<br/>funds as it actually wish but on the other hand, it is stated that the party was to spend on parliamentary 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenses such as staffing and other expenses.  There appears to be some restrictions. Again, we have 
<br/>sought clarification and I am not sure if that has actually been received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the second more critical issue is that the new $10 thousand allocation tax-free to 
<br/>individual Members of Parliament, this is a matter that raises some legal issues.  There is a concern 
<br/>here.  In fact, under the Parliamentary Remuneration Act, any remuneration which includes salaries, 
<br/>allowances, benefits under section … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … allowances are not taxed when you travel, as far as the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting allowance is not taxed, do not confuse yourself again … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This is what happens, when he gets told something and he knows that he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is about to gig it, he starts … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Why did you not object in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the previous sitting … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Please listen.  It is a legal matter, so the Section 2 of the Act pertaining 
<br/>to  those  particular  officer  holders  such  as  the  President,  Prime  Minister,  other  Ministers,  it  also 
<br/>applies to Leader of the Opposition, Speaker, Deputy Speakers and Members of Parliament.  Section 
<br/>3 of that particular Act that fall on that must have Parliamentary approval. We are not saying anything 
<br/>bad here, we are just pointing out to you that actually you are doing this wrong, you have done it 
<br/>wrong, you have actually disbursed the money without proper approval of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure whether the Office of the Attorney-General proffered the advice or whether it 
<br/>was done without the advice of the Attorney-General.  I am not sure, they can figure that out and 
<br/>they can sort that out themselves, that is their problem, but we have pointed it out and this is why we 
<br/>are here today; we are rectifying something that they made a very huge mistake on.  It is massive, 
<br/>this is the people’s money that we are actually talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  That  is  exactly  what  we  are  doing,  honourable  Minister.    This 
<br/>Parliamentary Duty Allowance for individual members which includes everyone, this new allowance 
<br/>has not  been approved under the  Act  and the part  (b) of the schedule which sets  out  the specific 
<br/>amounts has not been amended.  As you can see, we are saying what they are now trying to rectify 
<br/></span><span>after having been rightfully informed by the former Attorney-General and our Secretary-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can tell you right now, all FijiFirst parliamentarians will be returning the 
<br/>sum that has been sent by Parliament because in effect, it is illegal.  We can all get done by the Fijian 
<br/>Elections Office (FEO).  That is something that you must do very carefully.  This is not a laughing 
<br/>matter, it is not something that you can just whitewash over, you can just brush it by the wayside.  
<br/>The very reason why this motion is before us, is to correct the mistake made by those that decided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- One man … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I do not know who.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the upshot of all of these, is that any increase in benefit for Members of 
<br/>Parliament whether it is an allowance, or salary or other benefits, must be approved through the Act 
<br/>which includes the amendment to the Schedule and sets up all those particular benefits.  The whole 
<br/>purpose of having these independent committees deliberating on the increase and followed by debate

<div><span>1663 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Parliament show that honourable Members can actually do this so the public can actually speak 
<br/>and participate and have a say through the Members of Parliament whether they should get a pay rise 
<br/>or not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular increase of $10 thousand for the 55 Members of Parliament, being done like 
<br/>this in a backdoor manner without following the process is actually 100 percent incorrect and wrong, 
<br/>and they are trying to correct it now.  It is an abomination, and we cannot be part of making just 
<br/>white washing it over and we are not supportive of this particular motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been incorrectly done and we mostly certainly at the moment also in light of what is 
<br/>actually happening with the 15 percent VAT, increase cost of living, we do not see that but that is 
<br/>another argument but the processes and the law have not been followed.  History will tell because as 
<br/>I said right at the outset, </span><span>Hansard </span><span>will report this, word for word verbatim about who said what and 
<br/>whether it was right or wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There needs to be an admission on the part of those that actually decided that they were wrong. 
<br/>That admission comes by way of this motion being on the floor today Sir, they are wrong they admit 
<br/>that they are wrong.  This motion tells them that they are wrong and we as a party and all of us sitting 
<br/>in this side of the House do not support this particular motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  you,  and  I  now  call  upon  the  Chairperson  of  the  Emoluments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Thank  you,  Sir,  the  amendment  to  the  schedule  of  the 
<br/>Parliamentary Remunerations Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Secretary-General for explaining 
<br/>this very clearly during the Business Committee as to why this was being done and Honourable Koya 
<br/>was  there.  It  allays  any  doubt  whatsoever  to  the  legitimacy  of  this  $10,000  duty  allowance  per 
<br/>Member for each of the 55 Members of Parliament as provided for by the Legislature in the 2023-
<br/>2024 Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things, Mr Speaker, they need to understand unlike before that the budget process 
<br/>in some parliaments, there is an independent committee who does the budget for parliament, once 
<br/>the budget is approved it is for the Parliament to determine how it wants to use its expenditure as per 
<br/>their submissions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know, Mr Speaker, what this is and I want to thank you for that, the initiative under the 
<br/></span><span>grant  for political  parties represented in  Parliament  is  well- thought-out  and carefully  considered. 
<br/></span><span>And if what  I heard from Honourable Koya, if in my view greedy, unscrupulous, 2-men party of 
<br/>which there are 26 Members of the Opposition, demands the money that they are being given as duty 
<br/>allowance channelled into the financial coffers of that party then it is their only internal governance 
<br/>they need to deal with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Allowance  is  payable  to  them  only  in  monthly  instalments  to  fulfil  the  needs  of  the 
<br/>people they represent  as well as members of the public in  what  is  a single national  constituency.  
<br/>They will tell me and we know, I sat in the Opposition for 8 years, the MPs have certain obligations, 
<br/></span><span>commitments  and  many  in  the  Opposition  benches  know  that.  I  know  that  they  told  me  and  I 
<br/></span><span>understand what they are talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  referring  to  the  Opposition  because  Members  of  the  coalition 
<br/>government,  we  are  not  puppets  of  the  leaders,  that  is  very  clear,  that  is  the  difference.  And  our 
<br/>leaders, …

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Sir. I think the Honourable Minister of Finance ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Standing Order 46 - Unparliamentary language, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your point of order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Unparliamentary language. Mr. Speaker, sometimes we take as good as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we get. But this continuous barrage or unscrupulous …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have not granted that you continue because you have just raised a Point 
<br/>of Order and I still have to rule on that.  I think he is within his rights of using whatever words he 
<br/>has been using. Please, continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think honourable Members on 
<br/>the other side are actually having a nightmare because they have to decide, to give or not to give ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … to keep clearing the FijiFirst Election debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Which is not their responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the legislature has the highest court, has been given substantial funding. As you 
<br/>know this is to ensure that the Parliamentary Committees work well on addressing some of the issues, 
<br/>making recommendations with the view to halting the non-consultative manner where Parliamentary 
<br/>democracy was trampled upon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the political party represented in Parliament, we want to ensure 
<br/>that  they  have  sufficient  funding  and  resources  to  fulfil  not  only  their  objective  of  being  highly 
<br/>efficient and robust in parliamentary work but also to facilitate people access to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Koya was talking about accountability and all that. The 
<br/></span><span>current funding formula is guided and provided for under the political parties, Registration, Conduct, 
<br/></span><span>Funding and Disclosures Act. When we were getting those funding before, we had to account for that 
<br/>as part of the Political Parties Act. For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the current funding formula, 
<br/>FijiFirst would receive a total of $455,000 in the current financial year.  The biggest grant of the four 
<br/>political parties in Parliament and that too, despite being in Opposition, they wanted the $10,000 pay 
<br/>for each of their 26 Members of Parliament to be deposited in their party account.  That is where the 
<br/>source of contention was despite saying it was illegal, so they were confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If it was illegal then they do not have the desire to grab it.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know, Mr. Speaker, what the real motive is.

<div><span>1665 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up debt on the country that is what they want to pay because they want all the money to go to their 
<br/>political party’s account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, let me also say that the then Attorney-General  
<br/>proposed  $10,000  per  Member  of  Parliament  as  political  party  grant,  this  is  after  2014  General 
<br/>Elections.  Previously, Sir, in all Parliaments and this is true for all democracies anywhere in the 
<br/>world,  Members  of  Parliament  are  provided  appropriate  funding,  resources  constituency  office, 
<br/>research  officers,  some  of  those  luxuries  we  cannot  afford.    But  in  the  normal  Parliamentary 
<br/>democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this sort of funding all political parties were provided funding to operate 
<br/>the offices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2014,  the  then  FijiFirst  Government  and  the  Attorney-General  who  was  the  Minister 
<br/>responsible  for  Parliament  unilaterally  decided  that  he  was  going  to  change  the  funding  formula.  
<br/>Smaller parties like us we did not even have an office in Parliament, they moved  from the bigger 
<br/>space in Veiuto to this Parliament, we do not have any of those resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In the previous Parliament, Sir, you would recall every political party regardless of their size 
<br/>had a minimum funding whether you have two Members or three Members or 50 Members, you had 
<br/>a minimum guaranteed funding from Parliament which provided you a certain number of staff to do 
<br/>your duty as a political party, that was taken away say in 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  a  lot  of,  in  some  sense,  misinformation  about  these  allowances. 
<br/>Honourable  Koya,  I  was  talking  about  allowances  not  being  taxed.  I  mean  he  knows  all  the 
<br/>allowances, even the allowances for travel, all not taxable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON I.B. SERUIRATU.- It is already established. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is already established.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yeah, so he is talking about this as we are talking about Parliamentary Duty Allowance. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, there is nothing untoward about what the Parliament has done. Previously, MPs were paid 
<br/>a Constituency allowance, now we have a single national constituency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last such allowance Mr. Speaker, Sir, was a sum of $7,000 per annum paid to MPs from 
<br/></span><span>1996-2006.  It  did  not  belong  to  the  political  parties  but  to  the  MPs  to  help  their  constituents. 
<br/></span><span>Similarly, this Parliamentary Duty Allowance is for the MPs to provide assistance when invited for 
<br/>public engagements and I know there is a lot of demand for Members of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still, Mr. Speaker, on the same issue of resourcing we now see that there are political leaders 
<br/>out there who are not in Parliament commenting about how this allowance and one of them knows 
<br/>very well, his party was a beneficiary of the allowances that Parliament provided in terms of not just 
<br/>the allowance but also to run an office. Let me give you an example, Sir, the Parliamentary Hansard 
<br/>of  March  1998  detailed  expenditure  incurred  by  political  party  officers  from  1994  when  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister was the Prime Minister then to 1997.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The records reveal then are clear. In fact, under that arrangement for example the Fiji Labour 
<br/>Party office staff which was looking after only seven MPs incurred office expenses of $21,325 from 
<br/>1994 to1997, this is just office expenses, this does not include the salaries. Then SVT Government 
<br/>office staff incurred expenses of only $2,679 for the same period.  The three-year total expenses for 
<br/>the Office of the Leader of the Opposition occupied by 20 NFP MPs was $1,900.

<div><span> Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, the point I am trying to make is that the decision by the Parliament to ensure 
<br/>that  there  is  adequate  resources  for  all  political  parties  in  Parliament  to  be  able  to  do  their  work 
<br/>effectively is the right thing to do. I think this motion itself Mr. Speaker, in this Parliament I know 
<br/>honourable Koya talked about correcting it, I mean when they were in Government they corrected so 
<br/>many things….    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Do not worry about us! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, the point we are making Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this is a 
<br/>very normal Parliamentary assessment by the Office of the Speaker by the Parliament which is an 
<br/>Independent Institution. This motion Mr. Speaker is designed to do that and I would urge honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side because I know they all want to support that but, Mr. Speaker, they are 
<br/>hunger with the system of a political party which does not provide any democracy to them. They do 
<br/>not have caucus meetings, they do not have management board, they do not have a policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Stop pointing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a two-men party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Talk about yourself! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- All of them Mr. Speaker, are afraid because if they do not 
<br/>listen to the former Attorney-General the General Secretary they can be sacked tomorrow and losing 
<br/>their seat in Parliament, that is their problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I know a lot of then actually agree with this Mr. Speaker and what you have done is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right thing and we support that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Premila first then honourable …… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like remind honourable Biman Prasad… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Please, do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… that he is so obsessed with the Opposition.  Please, focus on the Government.  If he had 
<br/>focused on the finances and running of the Government, they would have not made this blunder.  You 
<br/>have already paid us, you have put it into our accounts, what are you trying to do here?  Correction?  
<br/>Of course, that is what you are doing.   We are simply picking up the process because it is illegal to 
<br/>receive that money, when it is not endorsed by Parliament.  That is the point here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, any amount of damage control will tarnish the Government’s image.  You 
<br/>are trying to control this, but people know what you have done.  They are already talking about how 
<br/></span><span>you can illegally give this money, put it into every honourable Member’s account without getting an 
<br/></span><span>approval from Parliament.  When you pay allowances to the Parliamentarians, we are guided by the 
<br/>Remunerations Act and the Act makes no reference to this parliamentary allowance.  If it was paid 
<br/>to the parties directly, that is another matter, but because it is paid to individual MPs as a non-taxable 
<br/>amount,  of  course,  it  raises  a  question  because  people  and  businesses  are  suffering  with  this  15 
<br/>percent VAT increase, and here, we are given $10,000 into our account without ….

<div><span>Review of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1667 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  But  you  have  already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>received that amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is what I am saying, we have received the money but that is illegal 
<br/>and you are trying to legalise the process now; admit that.  You have failed to do the right thing.  
<br/>Unfortunately,  the  legal  eagles  on  that  side  had  not  been  advising  properly.    Again,  I  urge  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, “Prime Minister, Sir, you have to change your Attorney-General.  What 
<br/>kind of advice is he giving you?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Sit down!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Get honourable Vosarogo, he will be a better Attorney-General, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has been a 
<br/>professor  for  a  long  time.    He  is  very  good  at  mudding  the  waters.    Her  issue  is  talking  about 
<br/>something else, he goes on this long lecture about allowances all over, but the issue is very simple.   
<br/>A mistake has been made, money was put into the accounts of honourable MPs without authorisation 
<br/>from  where it was supposed to  be  authorised.   A mistake has been made.  This  is  the point, you 
<br/>lectured  about  this,  lectures about  that,  that is  the point.  He is  talking  about  this  allowance, that 
<br/>allowance - those allowances were already prescribed.  He is talking about something here that is not 
<br/>prescribed in an existing legislation and wants to make the change, and before that change is made, 
<br/>the money is deposited into our accounts.  That is illegal.  Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is not illegal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is illegal. I concur with the sentiments of my fellow colleague, 
<br/>the honourable Premila Kumar.  If those who are supposed to be giving advice to the Government 
<br/>on what is legal are not doing their jobs, maybe they should be changed.  This is not the first time 
<br/>that  this  has  happened.    Earlier  this  year,  we  had  a  motion  that  had  to  be  withdrawn,  because,  I 
<br/>believe, of faulty legal advice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We heard what happened with the GCC, the implementation of that without the subsidiary 
<br/>requirements being fulfilled, and again here, action is being taken without the legal processes being 
<br/></span><span>completed.  This, for me is ineptitude, it is incompetence.  You have to take it and swallow it, you 
<br/></span><span>have made a mistake, admit it!  Admit that you have made a mistake.  Stop mudding the waters, focus 
<br/>on the issue.  The very fact that this motion has come, shows that a mistake has been done.  That is 
<br/>the point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- May I have your Right of Reply, Madam.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unbelievable, the other side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The mistake you made?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Unbelievable. First of all 
<br/>they have got to realise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where the Parliamentary Duty Allowance came from.  This 
<br/>is the prerogative and the discretion of Parliament, it is an independent institution from Government.

<div><span>Get that in their heads, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not a decision of the Government, it is a decision of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Say it again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who wants the money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- In order to regularise the 
<br/>issue,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  brought  by  motion  in  Parliament  by  the  Leader  of  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament.  Yes, we have taken it on.  One of you else could have brought the motion to Parliament. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and none of them will admit, they are all sitting there on that side of Parliament, 
<br/>they have come to us and said, “we need this allowance.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- They will not admit it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  I  said  some,  not  you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Bala. It is okay, you can sit down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Sit down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Not you, you can sit down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not him, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You sure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Yes, sit down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- State my name and say that I was not one of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Not honourable Bala, not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Bala.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are going on as if this is an increase in any amount.  They are saying 
<br/>that people are suffering, 15 percent VAT, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been receiving the same amount 
<br/>for the last two terms - $15,000.  You know what they are really defending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/></span><span>decision  of  their  General-Secretary.  He  wants  the  whole  $15,000  for  the  party,  that  is  what  is 
<br/></span><span>happening here.  He does not want to give an amount to their Members.  Why make it our problem 
<br/>and bring it here to Parliament and go on about this whole crusade….

<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- You the one making it, they 
<br/>are  making  it,  that  is  a  crusade,  “Oh,  you  know  what,  the  people  are  suffering,  we  have  made  a 
<br/>mistake.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Who increased VAT? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- This  amount for the last 
<br/>two terms has been going to the parties, maybe they have not been paid constituency allowances, the 
<br/>rest of us have and you know what, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are doing the right thing here because now 
<br/>we are becoming accountable to allow for Members to spend money outside of their ministries and 
<br/>outside of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Leader of Government is not saying the truth.  She is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  What  is  your  Point  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Misleading Parliament because she says that this same allowance was 
<br/>done  in  the  previous  Parliament.  There  is  a  difference.    Now  $10,000  is  coming  to  individuals, 
<br/>previously it all went to the party.  Those are two distinctly different things, so to say that it is the 
<br/>same is different.  An individual is different from a party.  Individual, one, </span><span>dua.</span><span>  Party, a group of 
<br/>people so that is not correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue, honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, the point I am 
<br/>making is that the other side is going on about people are suffering, 15 percent increase in VAT, and 
<br/></span><span>that we should not be receiving this money, you have been receiving it under your government for 
<br/></span><span>two terms.  You have been receiving it!  Mr. Speaker, Sir, stop misleading the people to say that you 
<br/>feel sorry for them.  It is the same amount.  Members have been receiving it individually, maybe not 
<br/>your party but we have been receiving it individually in our party and that is an internal decision, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Now, we are bringing to 
<br/></span><span>the forefront, we are making it a Parliamentary Duty Allowance that Members receive so when we 
<br/></span><span>Ministers go out and spend in our constituencies, we will not be accused of using Government State 
<br/>funds like they were in their campaign, Sir.  Using State resources to campaign, using State resources 
<br/>to visit constituencies, this is clear, this is transparency, this is accountability, we have the allowance 
<br/>to be able to do so.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was your prerogative and Parliament and we as Government 
<br/>are defending it and that is why we are regularising it now.  Your decision to make it between
