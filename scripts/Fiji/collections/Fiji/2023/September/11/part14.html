<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under Standing Orders 40, the:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change,  Environment,  Civil 
<br/>Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Ministers, I will invite the Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition or his designate to speak on the Statements for no more than five minutes. There will 
<br/>be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Release of Treated Water from the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I add my congratulatory remarks to our Fiji Water 
<br/>Fiji Team playing in the World Cup for a very bravely fought first match.  I deliberately wore my 
<br/>blazer and my tie but win or lose, I was going to wear my blazer this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to present a statement as the Minister for Environment and Climate 
<br/>Change on the  release of treated water from the  Fukushima Daiichi  Power Plant by Japan which 
<br/>commenced last month after the report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was 
<br/>released.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The IAEA Report, Mr, Speaker, Sir, affirmed that the discharge of the treated  wastewater 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meets international safety standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  incumbent  upon  us  to  champion  ocean  issues  and  the  needs  of  our 
<br/>people and of the region.  We do this for ourselves, for each other and for the future generations we 
<br/>are responsible for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  remain  fully  alert  and  conscious  of  the  nuclear  legacy  issues  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to affect our communities today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the Special Pacific Island Forum (PIF) Leaders Retreat in February this year, Forum 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaders supported the importance of science and data to guide their decisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Leaders supported continued comprehensive dialogue with Japan to reassure that what 
<br/>they were doing was in keeping with our thoughts on what would be safe for us in the Pacific, and 
<br/>for our future generations.  We wanted Japan to commit to science and research until it was safe for 
<br/>them to discharge the treated water, and this they did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  same  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  acknowledged  Japan’s  standing  as  an  important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development partner both for us bilaterally and also for us as a region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  recognise  the  position  that  Japan  has  taken  in  consulting  with  the  region  before  the 
<br/></span><span>discharge was started.  Some weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I issued an initial public statement on the 
<br/>environmental issue, acknowledging the controversy it has generated in Fiji, the wider Pacific region 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and internationally.  This controversy is likely to persist for some time given the complexity of the 
<br/>matter at hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  many  of  us  are  aware,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fukushima  Daiichi  Nuclear  Power  Plant 
<br/>suffered severe damage due to a tsunami in 2011, and Japan initially announced its wastewater plans 
<br/>in 2021.  It is essential to put the volume of wastewater into perspective.  While the quantity involved 
<br/>is substantial, we must consider that the Pacific Ocean covers about one-fifth of the earth’s surface.  
<br/>To illustrate, the volume of wastewater is estimated to be equivalent to filling up 500 Olympic-sized 
<br/>swimming pools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Japan plans to carry out this disposal into the ocean gradually, over a period of 30 to 40 years, 
<br/>with each stage closely being scrutinised.  I have declared my support for a report by the IAEA that 
<br/>affirms the discharge of the wastewater meets international safety standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  crucial  to  clarify  that  my  support  is  based  on  the  science  and  the 
<br/>assessments carried out by the independent IAEA which operates within the United Nations system.  
<br/>The safety standards mentioned by IAEA are reviewed annually by the UN General Assembly based 
<br/>on  estimates  by  the  United  Nations  Scientific  Committee  on  Effects  of  Atomic  Radiation 
<br/>(UNSCEAR).  The standards also include a recommendation from an independent, non-government 
<br/>group, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to draw your attention to a recent article by the BBC, a renowned source known 
<br/>for  its  quality  and  accuracy  in  reporting.    The  article  states  that  “Scientists  largely  agree  that  the 
<br/>impact (of the treated wastewater) will be negligible”.  This reflects consensus among experts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent IAEA report concluded that the approach, methods and plan put in place by Japan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>complies with international safety standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to the release, the wastewater has undergone a complex multi-stage 
<br/>treatment  processes, effectively  removing most of the radioactive isotopes including  caesium and 
<br/>strontium.  This is understood to have significantly mitigated the potential for the wastewater to harm 
<br/>marine life and ecosystems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the release systema and schedule is designed to ensure that the wastewater is 
<br/>introduced gradually, allowing for further dilution.  This  reduces the concentration of radioactive 
<br/>materials to levels well below those deemed to be of concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, tests results by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) show 
<br/>that the treated water contains up to 63 becquerels of tritium per litre, which falls well below the 
<br/>World Health Organisation limit of 10,000 becquerels per litre for drinking water.  A becquerel, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is a unit of radioactivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  morning,  I  want  to  emphasise  that  nothing  is  more  important  to  me  than  the  safety, 
<br/>security and prosperity of Fiji  and our Pacific  Island neighbours.    I  assure those who oppose my 
<br/>position that I share the same love for this country as they do.  As we move forward, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir,  I  am  committed  to  continuously  study  expert  analysis  of  treated  wastewater  discharge  and 
<br/></span><span>making submissions to Japan if any problems arise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Government, in collaboration with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, will facilitate 
<br/>ongoing dialogue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Japanese Government and the IAEA to ensure that we 
<br/>have access to the latest information and updates.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1607 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is crucial to acknowledge that there are divergent views and responses within the Pacific 
<br/>Island  Forum  regarding  the  treated  wastewater  discharge.    While  a  majority  of  the  expert  panel 
<br/>commissioned by the PIF expressed criticism of certain aspects of the IAEA report, it is essential to 
<br/>note  that  Professor  Tony  Hooker,  a  member  of  the  same  panel,  dissented  from  the  criticism.    In 
<br/>complex matters such as this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, unanimity is often elusive and national leaders must 
<br/>decide which expert opinions to favour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that unfortunately the view of the Pacific Island Forums 
<br/>Secretariat, scientific panel is not consistent with the IAEA Findings and does not account for the 
<br/>advancements in water treatment technologies that enable Japan (and other nuclear energy users) to 
<br/>effectively remove harmful radioactive elements from the wastewater addressing many of the initial 
<br/>concerns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) used by the Fukushima Daiichi plant has 
<br/>been  proven  effective  in  removing  62  radioactive  elements,  leaving  only  relatively  low  levels  of 
<br/>tritium, which is the radioactive form of hydrogen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  tritium  is  naturally  occurring  and  have  been  released  by  other  nuclear 
<br/>facilities globally. In its recent report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IAEA confirm that the control release of 
<br/>treated water from the plant is a scientifically acceptable option. The IAEA has also acknowledged 
<br/>that the final distribution to discharge treated water, rest solely with the Government of Japan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my capacity as the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I felt that it was imperative that I 
<br/>support the IAEA Report that safety standards utilised by Japan is a scientifically acceptable option.  
<br/>It is also imperative that I ensure that there is continuous dialogue between our nations to ensure that 
<br/>these standards were maintained throughout the process.  I felt that it was in our best interest and in 
<br/>the best interest of our shared marine environment, to focus on upholding the standards and maintain 
<br/>dialogue rather than stand in direct opposition to a decision which Japan has made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have witnessed different viewpoints, with a significant number 
<br/>of citizens opposing the wastewater dispersal, as demonstrated by recent protest in Suva.  It is worth 
<br/>noting that this peaceful protest marked a significant step forward in our democratic nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  former  Attorney-General,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  my  most  vocal  critics,  expressed 
<br/>contradictory and confusing views.  He initially argued that Japan presented “compelling evidence” 
<br/>about  the  safety  of  their  proposal  and  then  called  for  Fiji  to  assess  the  impact  for  itself.    It  is 
<br/></span><span>noteworthy that Mr. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum’s government did not issue a formal protest note to Japan 
<br/></span><span>in 2021 when the wastewater discharge plan was first announced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, the former Prime Minister, Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, who was portrayed as an 
<br/>international  environmentalist,  made  initial  statements  in  2021  seeking  “sincere  dialogue”  and 
<br/>“continuous  information  sharing”  with  Japan.    However,  there  was  no  formal  protest  and  it  is 
<br/>essential to clarify that the discharge had not yet occurred at that time.  Some critics have attempted 
<br/>to  draw  a  connection  between  the  wastewater  discharge  and  past  nuclear  weapons  testing  in  the 
<br/>Pacific.  This comparison is not grounded in scientific facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commercial-type power reactors such as the one in Fukushima, cannot explode like nuclear 
<br/>bombs, as the fuel is not enriched beyond about 5 percent, significantly lower than the level required 
<br/>for explosives. I urge those who do not share my position to thoroughly study the views of scientist 
<br/>and other experts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My decision to endorse the IAEA report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was made based on my prerogative 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>1608 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as  Prime  Minister.  The  Pacific  Islands  Forum  has  emphasised  the  importance  of  international 
<br/>consultation adherence to international law, and independent and verifiable scientific assessments 
<br/>regarding the Fukushima controversy. The Forum has urged Japan to take all necessary measures to 
<br/>prevent transboundary harm to the territory of another state as required by International Law.  Japan 
<br/>has provided assurances that the discharge will not endanger the lives of Japanese citizen or those of 
<br/>Pacific Islands countries.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the Rarotonga South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cook 
<br/>Islands Prime Minister and Pacific Island Form Chair, Mr. Mark Brown, stated that it is up to the 
<br/>Government of Japan to demonstrate that they are not dumping radioactive waste. He believes that 
<br/>if the waste remains within safety standards, it may not breach the Treaty.  He also highlighted that 
<br/>tritium occurred naturally in the ocean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Experts, including Associate Professor Tony Hooker and Dr. Nigel Marks, have emphasised 
<br/>that the proposed release of wastewater poses minimal threats to both environment and human health.  
<br/>Tritium, a by-product of nuclear energy production if found naturally in the environment at higher 
<br/>levels than the proposed discharge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific Islands Forum Chair shared the same view as Fiji with regard to 
<br/>the IAEA report. The Chair further proposed that a regularised mechanism with the IAEA needs to 
<br/>be  established  to  continue  dialogue  on  this  issue,  particularly  on  the  provision  of  updates  and 
<br/>reporting  during  the  process  of  the  release.  The  Chair  also  emphasised  the  need  to  respect  the 
<br/>sovereignty of each Forum member to have their own views on this matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Japan  came  to  the  decision  after  exhausting  all  other 
<br/>alternatives.  Contrary to options that some have proposed, such as storage on land, it should be noted 
<br/>that  the  cost  of  storing  and  managing  the  increasing  volume  of  treated  wastewater  on  land,  was 
<br/>unviable for Japan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The storage tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant are reaching their maximum 
<br/>capacity,  and  the  on-going  maintenance  of  these  tanks  requires  significant  resources.  By 
<br/>implementing the slow-release plan which will take up to 30 years to 40 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>Japan  can  redirect  resources  towards  decommissioning  the  plant  and  further  improving 
<br/>environmental safeguards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  other  countries  with  nuclear  facilities  have 
<br/></span><span>successfully employed control releases of treated water into the ocean without causing widespread 
<br/></span><span>harm.  Facilities in the Unted States and Europe have been releasing treated water for decades in 
<br/>compliance with strict regulations.  In each case, these operations have taken place without harm to 
<br/>marine life and the environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in respect to the bell that has been sounded and the Standing Orders, I would 
<br/>like to reiterate that this whole statement quite a lot of it is still to come, based on the concerns that 
<br/>have been raised by the people, it is my duty to put to rest any of the fears that they may have.  The 
<br/>statement I made is based on science and research and it has been happening with over 30 nuclear 
<br/></span><span>powered countries in the world, who have treated their wastewater and had discharged those into the 
<br/></span><span>oceans, and they are falling within the mark, or the boundaries laid out by the agencies that make 
<br/>sure that whatever they discharge, is safe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the honourable Prime Minister, this is an issue that 
<br/>goes to the heart of every Fijian.  For this matter, there is a start point and that point is just very 
<br/>constitutional.  In it, there is a particular Section 40, and I will read it aloud for the purposes of every 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1609 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian hearing what we, as Parliamentarians, must do.  Section 40 is with respect to environmental 
<br/>rights and, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1)  Every person has the right to a clean and healthy environment, which includes 
<br/>the  right  to  have  the  natural  world  protected  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future 
<br/>generations through legislative and other measures.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is our job to ensure that our oceans are protected.  It was not so long ago when the motion 
<br/>was  moved,  not  even  by  the  honourable  Opposition  Members,  it  was  moved  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica.  It gathered the support of the whole Parliament.  Not a single 
<br/>person in this particular Parliament disagreed with that motion.  Why?  Because of that Section in 
<br/>this particular book and because we wanted to protect the future generations in Fiji.  It is our ocean.  
<br/>The honourable Prime Minister (forgive me Sir if I am going to sound harsh today), took it upon 
<br/>himself to decide because he thinks that the scientific proof is okay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will hold up my hand, because I have been part of the discussions with 
<br/>this, I have seen the differing scientific reports that say otherwise.  You have seen people protesting 
<br/>and I might add, we were not even allowed to protest for that, but we have seen people protesting, 
<br/>not just here, but around the world with respect to this particular discharge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an impassion speech here by everyone, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister spoke about it, everyone who could that day spoke about it.  The science is still inconclusive.  
<br/>We cannot and we must not.  We must make sure that we continue in the same vein that we have as 
<br/>the protectors of the environment.  Fiji has become a massive voice around the world with respect to 
<br/>the environment.  What now?  What are they going to call us now when suddenly we have decided 
<br/>that we are going to say that it is alright to release that nuclear wastewater into the Pacific Ocean?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  seat  of ours is  now in  question.  I understand, we understand, we all understand our 
<br/>relationship with Japan but there are times when we would differ, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The science is 
<br/>still inconclusive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, as a nation, are also in a position where we guide our Pacific Island 
<br/>brothers and sisters, they look to us for guidance, they look to us so much.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>dumping  also  violates  the  Rarotonga  Treaty.  What  happened  to  that?    We  are  signatories.    What 
<br/>happens to that?  We are a leading voice in the Pacific region, we have a long history of leadership 
<br/>in the Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just a creek, this is the whole of the Pacific 
<br/>Ocean and, yes, we must get, and the operative word here is conclusive scientific results.  Right now, 
<br/>the scientific results are still inconclusive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a huge economy, a huge country, a huge power in the world like China has 
<br/>suddenly decided they are going to completely ban Japanese fish.  What does that say to us?  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, they … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Even South Korea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- South Korea also.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can say geopolitics if you want to but that is not a decision that is taken 
<br/>lightly.    They  have  the  necessary  expertise  we  do  not,  there  are  several  conflicting  reports.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I have here different reports from different Green Peace Universities, et cetera, that say 
<br/>and I quote, “the proof is still inconclusive”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Prime Minister that in light of the fact that this whole 
<br/>Parliament represents every single citizen in Fiji condemn this.  We must continue to condemn it, we 
<br/>must  continue  to  condemn  it  with  the  proviso  obviously  that  says  that,  until  we  get  absolute 
<br/>conclusive proof, that it is alright for disbursement, and again when I say that, the question was asked 
<br/>by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and he said it very, very passionately, Sir, if it is alright to 
<br/>put in the Pacific Ocean why cannot they put it on their gardens, in their rivers.  What is it? I could 
<br/>stand here for an hour Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking about tritium and all the different things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 64 radioactive elements that actually go into the ocean. Of those, they have a shelf 
<br/>life, some go to a thousand years, some go to 14 years.  If tritium is actually ingested by the fish, it 
<br/>gives it an extra life!  What happens to our </span><span>Walu?  </span><span>Are we going to end up with two-headed </span><span>Walu</span><span>?  
<br/>Who knows?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But Mr. Speaker, Sir, I plead on behalf of every single Fijian and I know this on behalf of 
<br/>every single person in government who stood up and spoke on it with the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>please retrack what you did, retrack it unless we get conclusive proof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We cannot, we must not hurt our future generations. The rest of the world 
<br/>has hurt our future generations already.  We have a higher seat in every single table, in every place 
<br/>that we visit Sir, Fiji has a massive reputation in terms of being the protectors of environment. We 
<br/>must continue in that same old and I urge the honourable Prime Minister, please Sir, we must protect 
<br/>our future generations.  The science is inconclusive.  We do not know what it is going to do to human 
<br/>health and that is the major question that still has not been answered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, round off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, I have been a part of it, Sir, so I 
<br/>know.  Once again, Sir, my time is up but I urge you honourable Prime Minister, please, reconsider 
<br/>your stance with respect to that because the International Atomic Agency Report, as we all know, 
<br/></span><span>there are many things that they have done that are inconclusive and they have been condemned by 
<br/></span><span>the developed nations with respect to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Fiji National Education Summit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  fellow  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; I would also like to take this time to congratulate and thank our Fiji Water Flying Fijians 
<br/>gladiators for their excellent match against Wales this morning, and we look forward to more positive 
<br/></span><span>results in the remaining pool games in 2023 World Cup.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also would like to take this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to wish all the students, teachers, parents, 
<br/>guardians and all stakeholders well as they embark on the Term 3 academic year starting this week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  brief  this  august  Parliament  on  the  upcoming  Fiji  National 
<br/>Education Summit that will be convened from 20</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 to 22</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2023 at the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sheraton  Denarau,  Nadi  with  the  theme,  “Transforming  our  Education  System,  Building  and 
<br/>Supporting Resilient Fijians”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I do that, allow me to provide some historical background into how 
<br/>the concept of gathering public opinion and views through education summits and commissions have 
<br/>happened in Fiji in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  1969,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  before  Fiji  became  independent  the  colonial  government 
<br/>convened the first education commission to gather public opinion and input into an education system 
<br/>that will best meet the aspirations and the future of Fiji’s children.  One of the most transformative 
<br/>outcome I may say of the 1969 Education Summit Commission was the agreement to establish Junior 
<br/>Secondary Schools in rural areas to make secondary education much more accessible to rural students 
<br/>around the country at least to Form 4 level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Junior Secondary Schools were established, such as Ratu Finau Junior Secondary School and 
<br/>Adi Maopa Junior Secondary School in the Lau Province.  In the Province of Lomaviti, Gau Junior 
<br/>Secondary Schools and Koro Junior Secondary School.  In Bua, Naikavaki Junior Secondary School 
<br/>and in Cakaudrove, Napuka Junior Secondary School, Saqani Junior Secondary School and Vaturova 
<br/>Koroalau  Junior  Secondary  School.    Other  Junior  Secondary  Schools  were  established  in  other 
<br/>Provinces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say transformative because the establishment of junior secondary schools 
<br/>in rural areas really transformed education delivery and put a halt to rural urban migration for rural 
<br/>families because of education transition for their children as a transition from primary to secondary 
<br/>education which at the time was only available in urban centres. As of today, Sir, all these junior 
<br/>secondary schools have expanded into full secondary status with some conducting Year 13 level of 
<br/>education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 30 years later in 1999 another Education Commission was convened as an 
<br/>initiative of the Fiji Labour Government at that time. The Commissioners were appointed and went 
<br/>around the country gathering views and ideas from all segments of societies and communities on 
<br/>what they perceive should be included in any future education plan in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, the work of the Commission was disrupted by the political upheaval and this 
<br/>resulted in the downgrading of the final outcome of the panel report rather than commission review 
<br/>report as the Commissioners left before their report was finalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2005 the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) Government decided 
<br/>to convene an education summit to engage with our stakeholders and the wider community seeking 
<br/>their  views  on  the  future  of  education  in  the  country.  This  resulted  in  the  launching  of  the  Suva 
<br/>Declaration on Education in Fiji providing a quality framework for education development in Fiji.  
<br/>However, the political upheaval of 2006 resulted in the shelving of the Suva Declaration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consultation is key to allowing policies to be owned by our people and so 
<br/>the National Education Framework that will be an outcome of the Fiji National Education Summit 
<br/></span><span>will ensure that education is equitable, standardised and effective and that is aligned with the needs 
<br/></span><span>of the country and its citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is providing the opportunity to all stakeholders and communities 
<br/>who engage in education in the country to become part of the consultation leading up to enduring the 
<br/>national education summit.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has put together a status of education report that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shows the status of education in the country as the Coalition Government came into Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The report shows huge concern areas that need urgent attention such as the TVET subsector, 
<br/>the organisation structure of the Ministry, status and work conditions of teachers, assessment system 
<br/>and grant distribution, to name a few.  The status report has been discussed during the pre-summit 
<br/>consultation and has helped guide the development of a new Fiji Education Policy Framework that 
<br/>will be presented at the National Education Summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji being the newest member to be part of the Global Pacific Education 
<br/>(GPE), the global funding mechanism providing funds to support countries transform their education 
<br/>system to achieve quality education for all boys and girls.  The Ministry of Education has managed 
<br/>to merge the National Education Summit with the GPE processes for cost effectiveness and efficiency 
<br/>as they work towards similar goals.  The revised cost for the Fiji National Education Summit is now 
<br/>set at $266,576 from the initial $250,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is grateful that funding provided by GPE can be 
<br/>utilised to fund the pre-summit activities as well as the summit itself and we acknowledge the support 
<br/>of UNICEF, who are the grant agent for GPE funding in Fiji in facilitating the release of funds to 
<br/>fund the National Education Summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  a wide range of stakeholders  have been meeting since  May 2023 to  put 
<br/>together seven thematic areas as the focus area for a new Fiji Education Policy Framework.  The 
<br/>seven thematic areas are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Teaching profession and leadership; 
<br/>Early Childhood Education, inclusive education access, equitable safe and healthy schools; 
<br/>Financing of education and effective governance; 
<br/>Technical vocational education and training non-formal and life-long learning; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Curriculum and Sustainable Development and Quality Assurance and Assessment; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Digital learning and transformation technology, integration and cyber-safety; and 
<br/>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education Policy, planning, research and data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pre-summit consultations have been held in the four Divisions - Levuka for 
<br/>the Eastern Division, Labasa for the Northern Division, Suva for the Central Division and Nadi for 
<br/>the Western Division.  In all the consultations, a virtual platform was also established where those in 
<br/></span><span>remote areas were able to link in and be part of the consultations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  members  of  the  public  who  wished  to  make  presentations  in 
<br/>person were also catered for by the consultation teams.  I can say with confidence that the Ministry 
<br/>of Education has worked hard to be as inclusive as it could be in the pre-summit consultations to 
<br/>facilitate  public  consultations  and  the  responses  from  the  public  was  indeed  overwhelming  and 
<br/>encouraging as we look into a future where the people are assuring us that they want to be partners 
<br/>in transforming education in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Education  Programme  will  run  for  three  days  from  20</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span><span>September  to  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  September;  approximately  150  participants  are  expected  to  participate  in  the 
<br/>Summitt which includes our education donor partners, Government and non-government agencies, 
<br/>statutory and private organisations.  The Summit program is structured to allow for this wide cross 
<br/>section of stakeholders to participate and become part of the panel discussion and speakers at plenary 
<br/>sessions.

<div><span>Analysis of school enrolment rates Mr. Speaker, Sir, has shown a large number of students, 
<br/>out  of school  students who are of school  age particularly  at  the secondary school  age level.   The 
<br/>Education Summit Programme provides a space for participants to discuss the issues of out of school 
<br/>students and consider solutions to the issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the case of those already in schools, some are at risk of dropping out due 
<br/>to limited learning pathways in the curriculum.  Unfortunately, the school programmes are limited 
<br/>and  are  exam  oriented.    Space  is  also  provided  for  teacher  training  institutions  to  be  part  of  the 
<br/>discussions in regards to teacher training and development.  We are also providing an opportunity 
<br/>for our development partners to share their support towards the education sector in Fiji and consider 
<br/>mechanisms for closer collaboration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  main  outcome  of  the  National  Education  Summit  is  a  Fiji  National 
<br/>Education Policy Framework document that has been developed collaboratively during pre-summit 
<br/>consultations  to  guide  the  education  development  in  Fiji  over  the  next  10  years.    The  document 
<br/>outlines the main strategies in developing education in the country under the seven thematic areas as 
<br/>earlier outlined. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We understand the employment landscapes in the country and through the processes of GPE 
<br/>Funding  and  Education  Sector  Analysis  has  been  undertaken  by  specialists  and  the  report  has 
<br/>provided evidence in the development of the new education policy framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the National Education Summit will be the establishment of an 
<br/>Education Commission as part of Government’s policies in the development of the education sector.  
<br/>The intention is to bring together a group of experts to be called Commissioners to look deeply into 
<br/>the National Education Policy Framework which is the main summit’s outcome documents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The appointed experts will be determined by the focus area of each thematic area in the policy 
<br/>framework.   We will be engaging  experts in  areas such  as the  curriculum,  an assessment teacher 
<br/>development  and  training,  early  childhood  and  inclusive  education,  technical  and  vocational 
<br/>education, education and information technology, child protection and education in emergencies and 
<br/>education policy planning, research and data.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  as  part  of  the  Education  Summit  documentation  has  also 
<br/>developed a draft education sector plan for the first phase of implementing the National Education 
<br/>Policy Framework.  The sector plan further unpacks the strategies under each thematic area.  The 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  of  Education  intends  to  implement  the  new  Fiji  Education  Policy  Framework  in  three 
<br/></span><span>phases.    For  each  phase,  education  sector  plans  will  be  developed  based  on  the  strategies  of  the 
<br/>Fallacy Framework.  A robust monitoring framework will be developed to ensure close monitoring 
<br/>and implementation will be undertaken and assessing the continued relevance of these strategies as 
<br/>defined in the policy framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  continue  to  engage  the  thematic  area  taskforces  in 
<br/>monitoring processes of implementation of the policy framework to continue that strong leadership 
<br/>role of our education stakeholders and continue to build a strong sense of ownership of the policy 
<br/></span><span>framework.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is important in transforming education in the country and 
<br/>efforts in building resilience in the education process in the phase of pandemics and disasters. Let us 
<br/>learn from the recent global events and through our education system build resilient Fijians who are 
<br/>able to survive and thrive in whatever situations that they encounter.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  closing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  all  individuals,  regional  and  international 
<br/>agencies, who have worked with us and have been part of our journey in preparing towards the Fiji 
<br/>National Education Summit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial 
<br/>Statement.  Although he is not from the education teaching faculty or has experience in the teaching 
<br/>world, he has presented a very good Ministerial Statement with a very focused vision of how the 
<br/>Ministry is going to transform the education sector, and I appreciate that, at least. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past, we have been always hearing about this education commission as the only solution 
<br/>to the problem. Let us set up education commission, that was the thinking but now I can see that 
<br/>thinking has been further diluted and there is a realisation that we need to  work on the education 
<br/>sector plan and that can only be done through evidence-based research. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to correct the honourable Minister by saying that all these works started actually 
<br/>in the month of May 2023 - that is incorrect.  The work started last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The first 
<br/>step was to present the Cabinet paper, get approval to join the GPE, we became a member of  GPE 
<br/>and after that, we were working very closely with UNICEF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, UNICEF came on board, in fact, they were the ones assisting the Ministry in conducting 
<br/>not  just  the  workshop  but  technical  workshops  as  well  as  including  consultation.  So,  these  two 
<br/>processes were happening simultaneously, and the idea was to gather information, gather data, clean 
<br/>out this data and then draw some of the thematic areas where the Ministry needs to work towards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The three key areas that were identified during that time and, of course, it will change now 
<br/>with the new Government, we looked at three areas.  The first one was TVET reform, technology 
<br/>enhanced  learning,  how  do  we  include  computer-based  teaching  and  learning  and  also  teacher 
<br/>welfare.  So, those were the three key areas that we worked out that needs to be looked at rather than 
<br/>just focusing on curriculum, because as soon as you touch TVET reform, automatically you need to 
<br/>look at the total curriculum of the school or even tertiary institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are doing what we can at the Ministry level, I want to highlight a 
<br/>problem  that  still  exists,  which  is  the  quality  of  teachers  coming  out  of  the  tertiary  institutions.  
<br/>During my short period at the Ministry of Education, I visited more than 60 schools and had been 
<br/>having consultations with school management committees, teachers, parents, students and even with 
<br/>tertiary institutions.  Whenever I visited schools and addressed the teachers, during that consultation, 
<br/></span><span>I understood that teachers were not even aware of the legislation guiding their profession.  This is 
<br/></span><span>how bad things are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  other  words,  at  university,  when  they  are  trained  to  become  teachers,  the  laws  are  not 
<br/>discussed with them, they do not know about the child protection legislation, they do not know about 
<br/>the Sex Offender Act in place.  It is extremely important that the tertiary institutions need to support 
<br/>the Ministry of Education by producing quality teachers; teachers who are able to drive change and 
<br/>develop skills in our students rather than rote learning and exam-centred teaching which is what we 
<br/>see today.  If we do not change that, no matter what we do at the national level, we will not be able 
<br/></span><span>to achieve the good outcome that the honourable Minister is thinking that we will be able to derive 
<br/></span><span>from the Education Summit.  That is one area that needs to be looked at very seriously - improving 
<br/>the quality of our teachers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the honourable Minister’s briefing, particularly 
<br/>the  fact  that  they  will  be  holding  this  Education  Summit  because  the  idea  was  to  have  small 
<br/>consultations, technical workshops, ultimately Education Summit, and then you set up Education

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission, not to develop the framework, but to oversee the implementation of the policies that 
<br/>are  derived  because  you  need  to  have  an  independent  group  that  should  be  overseeing  the 
<br/>implementation of policies in the education sector.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The education sector is not just the Ministry, but it is the employers, students, parents and 
<br/>tertiary  institutions.    There  are  many  people  involved,  and  therefore  Education  Commission  is 
<br/>definitely needed but as an overseer and not in developing the framework because that can be done 
<br/>by technical people.
