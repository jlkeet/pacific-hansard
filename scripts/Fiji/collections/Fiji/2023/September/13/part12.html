<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under Standing Order 40, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes.  After the Ministers, I will then

<br/>minutes. There will be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Violence Against Children in Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin my Ministerial Statement, I wish to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wish our honourable Prime Minister a very happy birthday today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members; I would like to start my Ministerial 
<br/>Statement with a verse from the </span><span>Holy Bible</span><span>, Psalm 127: 3 which says, and I quote: “Children are the 
<br/>gift from the Lord, and they are a reward from him”.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  to  make  reference  to  a  well-known  quote:  “Our  Children  are  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>foundation and future leaders of our country”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must, at all costs, ensure that we, as a nation, strengthen our commitment to caring for 
<br/>and protecting our children.  Each child in Fiji depends on us to make decisions that will guarantee 
<br/>they are safe and their  rights  are protected, to  ensure they have a bright future to  reach their  full 
<br/>potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is a sad reality in our country.  Children are still subject to physical abuse, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sexual abuse, verbal abuse and neglect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have been informed of the statistics of violence against women which is two 
<br/>in every three women in this country or 64 percent of women face some form of violence in their 
<br/>lifetime.  However, Mr. Speaker, the statistics for children is far worse - four out of five children, 
<br/>that is 83 percent of our children are facing some form of abuse or violence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Child Welfare Act (CWA) database reported in 2022 a total of almost 2,000 
<br/>cases. This was a 29 percent increase from 2021, which was 1,500 cases reported.  According to the 
<br/>statistics for 2022: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>child victims were girls - 54 percent; 
<br/>child neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse - 68 percent; 
<br/>child victims were below the age of 12 - 58 percent; 
<br/>child victims were below the age of 1 - 3.7 percent; and 
<br/>perpetrators are known to the victims - 80 percent; and 
<br/>immediate family members - 60 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this year alone, a total of almost a thousand cases have been reported between the months 
<br/>of January to July.  In the same period last year, it was a total of 1,200 cases. This was a decrease 
<br/>compared to last year.  However, cases are still being reported from these months and can increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the 956 cases reported this year: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>54 percent of the victims were girls; 
<br/>75 percent of the cases are of neglect, physical abuse, behavioural and sexual abuse; 
<br/>4 percent of the victims are below the age of one; 
<br/>75 percent of the perpetrators are known to the victims. Out of the 75 percent, 70 percent 
<br/>are immediate family members, so these numbers are on the rise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Government of the day recognises the importance of establishing a dedicated 
<br/>Department for Children, to effectively address increasing incidents of social issues involving our 
<br/>children. As you all know, we have allocated a budget to the establishment of the Department for 
<br/>Children of $100,000 initially which will see to having the Director for Children, Principal Officer 
<br/>and another Officer, as I had mentioned, to start it off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to inform the Parliament that the Ministry is in the process of recruiting 
<br/></span><span>the Director and other key positions.  Of course, Government continues the funding of $200,000 for 
<br/>Child Protection; $2,000 for the Child Helpline; $10,000 for the development of Childcare Policy 
<br/>and Programme; $230,000 for grants to voluntary oganisations managing our children’s homes and 
<br/>Empower  Pacific;  $100,000  for  the  State  Home  for  Girls;  and  $692,000  for  the  Boys  Centre  or 
<br/>juveniles.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1763 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this time, I would like to explain a little bit about the frangipani lapel pins which 
<br/>were  distributed  earlier  this  week,  and  I  thank  all  honourable  Members  for  wearing  them  today.  
<br/>Allow me to share the story of the frangipani with you my colleagues and of course to the members 
<br/>of the public and those who are watching.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The frangipani is a flower that grows from the plumeria temple tree.  For the tree to flower, 
<br/>it strongly depends on the environment in which it grows. In order for the frangipani to manifest its 
<br/>soft and enriching qualities, the roots of the tree must be strong. When a frangipani is fully developed, 
<br/>it consists of five petals.  A frangipani can come in diverse range of colour combination and exudes 
<br/>a beautiful, sweet fragrance. The petals of the flowers are delicate, pure looking and need proper care 
<br/>and attention in order to sustain its features.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The nature of the frangipani exemplifies the natural essence of a child.  The flower is a symbol 
<br/>of a child and the roots from which the flower grows symbolises families, communities, schools, our 
<br/>culture, our religion. These roots, when strong enough, will help the child grow and develop the five 
<br/>petals. These five petals symbolise the core values of love, trust, protection, care and respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to help children grow, their roots must work together by guiding them, speaking up 
<br/>and being their voices.  Families and communities must spend time with their children and focus on 
<br/>enriching their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being.  Every frangipani, like a child, 
<br/>is unique.  For each flower to bloom and for each child to flourish it requires nurturing, care and love.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We carry the symbol of the frangipani with us to remind ourselves of the potential of every 
<br/>child. Child Protection is all of our responsibility, not just the Government and we must ensure that 
<br/>every child feels loved, protected, respected, cared for and trusted in order for them to reach their full 
<br/>potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  last  month,  a  group  called  the  Concerned  Citizens  of  Fiji,  led  by  Pastor  Joe 
<br/>Yaya, approached me and sought for us to host the screening of the highly anticipated movie called 
<br/>“Sounds of Freedom”. This film sends a very powerful call to action and exposes the global activity 
<br/>on this legal and severe form of child sexual abuse which includes kidnapping and transferring of 
<br/>children for the purposes of forced labour and exploitation for child sex trafficking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I accepted this proposal, and it links well with the Ministry’s mandated role in 
<br/>the care and protection of children, through creating awareness.  If any Member of this Parliament 
<br/>has not seen this movie, I do implore you to, please, watch, it is based on a true story of trafficking 
<br/></span><span>of children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the screening on 24</span><span>th</span><span> August, we invited Members of Parliament, representatives from 
<br/>across  Government  agencies,  Foreign  Missions,  international  governmental  organisations,  Civil 
<br/>Society Organisations, faith-based organisations, media partners and also members of the public, to 
<br/>attend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the main actor (Jim Caviezel) shares at the end of the movie, his own excerpt of 
<br/>why he supports the movie and why we should create awareness on child trafficking.  He said that 
<br/></span><span>we  need  to  be  aware  that  even  though  human  trafficking  may  not  be  visible  in  our  country,  it  is 
<br/></span><span>happening.  The line of the movie that I wish to share here in Parliament is that, God’s children are 
<br/>not for sale.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry, in partnership with UNICEF, the University of the South Pacific 
<br/>(USP), Fiji National University (FNU) and MFAT (New Zealand), is launching the Violence against 
<br/>Children in Fiji Report at the end of this month on 26</span><span>th</span><span> September, to which we will all be invited as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members  of  Parliament,  at  5.00  p.m.  at  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific.  Our  Ministry 
<br/>commissioned this Report at USP and FNU to conduct this joint research with a specific focus on 
<br/>children in the home setting.  As I had mentioned, this month on 26</span><span>th</span><span> September, we will be launching 
<br/>this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  previous  efforts,  we  see  high  numbers  of  violations  continuing, 
<br/>including  child  rape  and  neglect.    Levels  of  sexual  violence  are  very  high  against  teenage  girl 
<br/>children, but do include cases down to infants under five years of age, and these are some of the 
<br/>findings in this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority  of  the  perpetrators  are  family  members.    The  Report  provides  an  indication  of 
<br/>geographical hotspots by type of violation. This study represents a significant and timely step forward 
<br/>in the protection of children in Fiji.  Evidence-based reports provide a solid footing to set targets 
<br/>connected  without  outcomes  for  children,  including  child  friendly  services  and  reduced  rates  of 
<br/>children in institutional care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are clear recommendations in this Report on the need for a whole of Government and 
<br/>whole  of  society  approach  and  improve  coordination  across  our  key  Ministries.    Importantly,  the 
<br/>Report  also  provides  material  to  inform  and  focus  prevention  efforts  whether  with  parents, 
<br/>communities, religious leaders or with children themselves which, going forward, needs to include 
<br/>boys. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, lastly on 19</span><span>th</span><span> November, the Ministry will be commemorating the International 
<br/>Day for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect and the theme for this year is, “Every Child is one 
<br/>caring  adult  away  from  being  a  success  story  -  it  starts  with  us”.    The  theme  emphasises  the 
<br/>importance  of  fulfilling  our  responsibility  as  a  parent  or  guardian.    This  is  also  extended  to  our 
<br/>communities, our places of worship and many public spaces in which a child is in.  No matter what 
<br/>your role is, child protection is everyone’s responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, child abuse in all its forms exists in Fiji and we have heard the recent statistics 
<br/>and trends - very worrying trends.  We, as a Ministry, will continue to work with our stakeholders to 
<br/>increase awareness on child abuse and neglect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To this end, I would like to begin with our esteemed colleagues in Parliament and hopefully, 
<br/>in time to come, we will organise with Parliament to have an informational session on this very topic 
<br/>to raise awareness on child welfare issues, including the relevant laws and international laws, which 
<br/></span><span>the Fiji Government has ratified to address child abuse and strengthen the rights of a child.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We believe that as Members of Parliament, we are the public figures in our communities and 
<br/>we can play a vital role in supporting the Ministry to being champions for children or child advocates. 
<br/>Once  again,  I  thank  you  for  donning  the  frangipani  pins  to  raise  awareness  about  caring  for  our 
<br/>children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would conclude by reminding us of the theme for this year “Every Child is one caring adult 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>away from being a success story - it starts with us”</span><span>.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  I now call upon the Leader of Opposition or his designate to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, I would like to echo 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the birthday well wishes from Members of Parliament:  Happy birthday, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1765 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members; I 
<br/>think most of us in this Parliament are parents and grandparents and some may be great grandparents.  
<br/>Congratulations,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  for  being  a  great  grandparent.    Anything  to  do  with 
<br/>children is always something that is very important for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I would like to thank the Ministry and the honourable Minister for continuing this 
<br/>focus on children.  I think all Governments in the past have held children to be dear, as you have 
<br/>mentioned.    They  are  a  gift  from  God  and  it  is  our  job  to  make  sure  that  they  flourish  in  an 
<br/>environment where they are not abused, they are not subject to neglect and they can realise the full 
<br/>potential of their being created because we believe that when every child is created, there is a future 
<br/>that is there for that particular child. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  future,  as  has  been  explained  by  the  honourable  Minister  in  the  ideology  behind  the 
<br/>petals of the </span><span>bua</span><span> (frangipani)</span><span>, </span><span>the </span><span>bua </span><span>(frangipani) is named after Bua, the </span><span>vanua </span><span>of the </span><span>yalomatua.</span><span>
<br/>I think it is a reflection that if you have </span><span>yalomatua</span><span>, you will make sure that you look after the children 
<br/>that we have because the petals have been explained.  Bua and Verata, I do not know which one 
<br/>comes first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that we have read with great trepidation 
<br/>and horror some of the stories that have been coming out lately about the extent of violence against 
<br/>children.  It is not just sexual violence, it is also a lot of the psychological violence.  I think one of 
<br/>the great things that we have been able to do in this country - our traditional notions about how we 
<br/>think about children have evolved.  I remember when I was a child, children used to sit or eat later 
<br/>on when we sat down to eat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we are beginning to see these values beginning to change.  If I read about the whole 
<br/>history of how children were treated in the past, they were treated as not very important at all.  Over 
<br/>time, it has evolved, but I think whilst we that live today, a lot of their abuses are more subtle.  They 
<br/>are more ingrained into some of the things that we do, so it is incumbent upon us to take this action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having this frangipani and lapel pins, I have heard my children and grandchildren ask me 
<br/>what it stands for?  So, I told them it is something to do with violence against children and I am 
<br/>hoping and looking forward to grip all the plans that you have in place and the call for all stakeholders 
<br/>to become involved is something that we will all play our part. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From our part in this Parliament, we will make sure that we do that because the children, as 
<br/>we say, are gifts from God to us.  Some of the statistics that the Minister has talked about here are 
<br/>quite shocking.  I find it quite shocking - 75 percent of the abuse was known, sexual perpetrators of 
<br/>people are known by the child, and 70 percent from family members.  I think that tells us that the 
<br/>solution is not going to be handled by laws, it will need a multi-faceted approach from all of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, on this side of Parliament, commit to taking this message and we hope to be there at the 
<br/>launch of that Report on Violence Against Children in Fiji and the International Day Against Child 
<br/></span><span>Abuse and Neglect.  We look forward to the Government to be able to take the next step with the 
<br/></span><span>report coming out and the development to the programmes, the plans, the policies, the outputs and 
<br/>the targets to make sure that we, in our time, in leading this country here that we can reverse this trap 
<br/>that we are seeing.  It keeps on going up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  one  of  the  statistics  that  the  honourable  Minister  talked  about  was  the  29  percent 
<br/>increase  in  case  of  child  abuse.    Sometimes  people  say  that  some  of  these  increases  are  because 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people are now reporting more of the things that were happening in the past.  I hope it is just that, but 
<br/>it could be that there is also an increase in the propensity of abuse happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, from our side, we fully appreciate the initiatives for the frangipani badge 
<br/>and also the development to the Report on Violence Against Children in Fiji.  We look forward to 
<br/>the programmes and we call upon all stakeholders in this country - the Churches, communities and 
<br/>all of us, to join hands and to make sure that we join hands in attacking this curse so that during our 
<br/>time, this increase in child abuse reverses and begins to go down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members  just  to  pause  for  a  minute  and  think  of  this  very 
<br/>important subject that we have heard from the honourable Minister for Women and the input provided 
<br/>by the designate for the Leader of the Opposition, all he has asked is, we all have a vested interest in 
<br/>this because they are our future, they are our children. But if this statement is just going to be made 
<br/>and then passed through without any collective effort from us, or from you honourable Members, 
<br/>then the issue will still be an ongoing one, without any hopeful decision to address the very source 
<br/>of the problem and that is from the family, from the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I just want to raise is, what has happened to the institution that used to be there in Nasinu 
<br/>-  Nasinu  Approved  School.  If  the  army  has  taken  over,  why  can  they  not  join  the  Army?    You 
<br/>remember for the British Armed Forces who want to join, they are not worried about your age or 
<br/>your education level. They put an advertisement out in the streets, “We will educate you, we will 
<br/>school you”. All you need to do is join the army. There are different cadre of age groups that join the 
<br/>armed forces because they are joining the Disciplined Forces, what we are trying to do is keep them 
<br/>off the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just said the other day that I almost ran into some, they were crossing the street at Nabukalou 
<br/>to go below the bridge. That is where they spend most of their evenings. They are our people.   I 
<br/>sincerely ask both sides of Parliament to, please, if we could play a much more active role on this, 
<br/>rather than the initiative on the yellow </span><span>bua</span><span>, where the </span><span>bua</span><span> comes from, where the name comes from. 
<br/>It is good, but does it address the issue or is that just another lapel pin on your jacket there?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I like the yellow ribbon concept, they got the </span><span>vanua</span><span> involved, they got the people involved, 
<br/>yet  we  still  have  people  frequently  in  the  prisons  every  now  and  again.  They  get  free  food,  free 
<br/>medical supplies, free medical check-up when in prison, even though the conviction is added to your 
<br/>history. That is all that I want to raise as the matter of concern because every now and again, we will 
<br/>get this kind of statements, but what have we done to address the issue?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I leave that to you and plead with you that we need to take a collective 
<br/>position on this.  Let us try and address the issue and hammer the head on the nail right on the head 
<br/>instead of sideways or whatever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Livestock Breeding Programme for Farmers in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a statement  on the Livestock   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Breeding Programme for farmers in Fiji. The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span><span>Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; one of the core roles of the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>and Waterways is to ensure the supply of high quality livestock breed and breeding stock to farmers 
<br/>with the view to improve the quality of genetics on their farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture is committed to breeding and distributing high performing breeds 
<br/>of sheep, goats and cattle to farmers in Fiji.  Apart from supplying quality livestock genetics, the

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1767 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry is also committed to assisting farmers with technical support and capacity building to ensure 
<br/>the sustainability of the breeding programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Livestock Nucleus are reared on eight livestock Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research Stations in Fiji, and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Koronivia Research Station; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Sigatoka Research Station; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Wairara Bull Station;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Dobuilevu Bull Station; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Nawaicoba Sheep Station; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Seaqaqa Sheep Station; 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Batiri Sheep Station; and 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Mua Sheep Station in Taveuni. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Note  that  the  stations  are  geographically  spread  out  due  to  these  programmes  being  national 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the various livestock species are bred on Government  Research Stations 
<br/>using bio-technology  interventions such as embryo transfer, artificial insemination and controlled 
<br/>natural  mating.    The  livestock  progenies  produced  from  the  breeding  programmes  are  carefully 
<br/>selected based on good genetic attributes which are then sold to farmers with the aim of improving 
<br/>genetics of livestock on their farms.  The breeds on the Government Research Stations are assessed 
<br/>and evaluated on their adaptability to local conditions and resilience to impacts of climate change 
<br/>and disease as well as on production levels before they are released to farmers for breeding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Nucleus Stock for different livestock breeds are adequately 
<br/>reared  on  the  Government  Stations  where  execution  of  the  best  animal  welfare  and  good  farm 
<br/>management  practices  are  conducted  to  produce  quality  livestock  progenies.  Livestock  rearing, 
<br/>breeding, nutrition, health and husbandry practices are professionally carried out by the Ministry to 
<br/>ensure quality livestock are produced and supplied to farmers.  Note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that good 
<br/>genetics goes with good feed if we want livestock products of high quality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the existing livestock breeding plans, the Ministry intends to sell the 
<br/>improve livestock breeds to farms in the form of live animals and this programme is further supported 
<br/>through  artificial  insemination  and  control  making  on  those  farms.  In  the  last  financial  year,  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry has supplied six Senepol, five Brown Swiss and three F1 Senepol crossed with local breeds 
<br/></span><span>of  cattle  to  selected  farms.    Sir,  68  improved  breed  of  sheep  were  supplied  from  the  Nawaicoba 
<br/>Research Station and 82 were supplied from Seaqaqa Research Station to selected farms.  Also, 26 
<br/>improved breed of goats were also supplied from the Sigatoka Research Station to selected farms for 
<br/>breeding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Livestock Breeding Programme for the current financial year, the 
<br/>Ministry anticipates selling 80 bulls of improved breeds to selected farms in Fiji.  Let me inform this 
<br/>august Parliament,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  we  currently  have  four  Senepol  bulls  that  weigh  over  one  tonne  in  the 
<br/>Sigatoka Research Sation, the heaviest being 1.4 tonne.  I must give credit to the current Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition  because  when  he  was  our  Minister,  we  had  embarked  on  this  very  ambitious 
<br/>programme where we had difficulty in convincing the Ministry of Economy to give us money for 
<br/>this Programme.  But eventually, the Minister through his intervention, managed to get the funds for 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Programme and I was the unfortunate officer sent to Australia to accompany the embryos back 
<br/>to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry’s Breed  Improvement Support Programme through the provision of artificial 
<br/>insemination  services  will  be  targeted  at  beef  and  dairy  farms  in  the  current  financial  year.  The 
<br/>Ministry  intends  to  produce  2,000  semen  straws  locally  from  the  improved  cattle  breeds  in  the 
<br/>Sigatoka Research Station which is intended to be inseminated in cows on selected farms in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support the pool of locally harvested semen, the Ministry will also be importing 160 dairy 
<br/>that is Jersey, Friesian and Kiwi Cross genetics and 160 beef, that is, Hereford genetics of frozen 
<br/>semen straws from New Zealand to further improve the genetics on our farms in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For sheep, Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry anticipates to supply 400 breeding stock (70 percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>male and 30 percent female) to potential farms in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For goats, the Ministry intends to supply 100 breeding stock (80 percent male and 20 percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>female) to potential farms in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,</span><span> </span><span>the  current  improved  breeds  that  exist  at  our  Research  Stations  are  as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For dairy cattle, we have the Kiwi Cross, Brown Swiss and Crossbred (F1) between Brown 
<br/>Swiss and the Kiwi Cross breed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For beef cattle, we have the Senepol, we have the Drought Master and we have the Wagyu. 
<br/>For those of you who may not know, ‘Wagyu’ is the most expensive beef in the world and 
<br/>it goes for US$250 per kilogramme, but it is here in Fiji through embryo transfer. We have 
<br/>F1 Cross from Senepol crossed with the local breed, and the local cattle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For sheep, we have the Fiji Fantastic breed which is the locally produced breed, we have 
<br/>the Dorper breed, we have the F1 from Fiji Fantastic crossed with Dorper and the F2 from 
<br/>the F1 crossed with Dorper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For goats, we have the Anglo Nubian, we have the imported Boer, we have F1, that is the 
<br/>Anglo Nubian crossed with the Boer, and we have F2 which is F1 crossed with Boer, we 
<br/>have  the  imported  Anglo  Nubian,  and  we  have  the  imported  Saanen  and  Toggenburg, 
<br/>which are both dairy goat breed and these are crossed with the local goats.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key criteria that are set out by the Ministry for farms to receive improved 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>breeds of livestock are as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farms need to be free from disease; 
<br/>Farms need to have the required number of female livestock for breeding; and 
<br/>Farms need to have sufficient land for expansion and to cater for the increase in livestock 
<br/>numbers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is promoting commercial agriculture as one of its priorities under its Strategic 
<br/>Development Plan, and packages for assistance to farmers for farm development have been made 
<br/>available  online  to  support  this  sector  and  assistance  such  as  fencing,  pasture  improvement  and 
<br/>infrastructure development on the farm.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1769 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the livestock breeding activities under the Ministry are supported through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>capital programmes in this financial year and funds allocated are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beef breeding - $1 million; 
<br/>Livestock rehabilitation (cattle) - $400,000; 
<br/>Sheep Breeding - $400,000; and 
<br/>Goat breeding - $215,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  have  adequate  number  of  improved  breeds  of  livestock  in  Fiji,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry has made a commitment to the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upgrade Government owned nucleus stock through embryo transfer technology in cattle 
<br/>and artificial insemination in sheep and goat. 
<br/>Operationalise the cattle breeding centre at Sigatoka Research Station to supply cattle with 
<br/>improved genetics in the form of semen through straws.  
<br/>Increase the number of breeding stock on Government stations so that adequate improved 
<br/>breeds of livestock are available for distribution to farmers when needed. 
<br/>Improve nutrition through pasture development and supplementary feed formulation. 
<br/>Control and eradicate endemic disease in livestock in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving the genetic makeup of livestock breeds in Fiji remains a high 
<br/>priority for the Ministry of Agriculture.  With improved breeds, better husbandry management and 
<br/>disease control, we aim to increase the volume of local meat and the whole milk production and aim 
<br/>to reduce our import bill for those products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue with its breeding programmes on research stations and collaborate 
<br/>with its partners on adaptive research, and better coordinate with stakeholders and farmers on the 
<br/>ground with the aim to grow the livestock sector in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just be very brief, but let me again  convey, 
<br/>on behalf of the Members of the Opposition, our very best wishes to the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>on his birthday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, I do not have much to add, but we, as Members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Natural Resources, are very much looking forward to our field visit, subject to your approval in 
<br/></span><span>the next two weeks so that we can see the programmes and the new breeds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  always  says  that  he  is  the  unfortunate  one  to  go  and  bring  the 
<br/>embryos  because  of  two  reasons,  firstly,  it  coincided  with  the  well  renowned  Israeli  Agriculture 
<br/>Show.  He said that he was victimised in that decision because he wanted to go to the Holy Land.  
<br/>Secondly, I always say as a joke to him that because he accompanied the embryos, there was no live 
<br/>animal that was brought into Fiji, so he is the father of the bulls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I was a bit worried about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So if you see the animals, Sir, I think it will make a lot of sense too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  on  a  serious  note,  again,  transforming  the  agriculture  sector  takes  time,  particularly 
<br/>research.  I think we are at this juncture where we can build on the potentials and the opportunities  
<br/>that are here. Again, huge potentials and all that, I would plead to Government is the support that 
<br/>will be needed, particularly in terms of infrastructure because I know with embryos, one of the initial 
<br/>difficulties was the storage and the need for us to have all the proper gadgets and technology involved.  
<br/>May I acknowledge, Mr. Simon Walton, the main man behind the embryo transfer. What is needed 
<br/>is the support to the honourable Minister and, of course, the Assistant Minister. as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to encourage all those with land, including your good self, Sir, because there 
<br/>is a lot of potential.  All landowners in Fiji, freehold landowners and </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners because we 
<br/>have  the  breed  in  here  but  I  think  in  the  transitioning,  I  know  that  currently  they  are  already  in 
<br/>discussions with the </span><span>Turaga na Ka Levu</span><span> and some others, they are approaching a few because as we 
<br/>all know, we need to revive Yalavou, Yaqara and, of course, Tilivalevu.  I know that agriculture is 
<br/>looking  for  land  in  which  they  can  expand  this  programme  and,  again,  to  all  the  stakeholders 
<br/>particularly the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, iTLTB and Ministry of Lands, if they have some land 
<br/>deposited into the Land Bank, a huge opportunity is in here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have talked about the necessary support, I know that the honourable Minister has talked 
<br/>about the nutrition aspect because he spoke about the one tonne plus weight that the bulls have gained 
<br/>but it took them about five years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In the most ideal condition, these breeds can hit 
<br/>that weight at around three and half years and that is why the nutrition aspect is so important and 
<br/>probably  something  that  the  Government  needs  to  consider  seriously  as  well  in  supporting  the 
<br/>honourable Minister to achieve his aims. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, genetics are here, we just need to provide the environment for the expansion because 
<br/>as the honourable Minister has stated very clearly, the challenge for us right now is the shift from 
<br/>research into commercial production so that we can reduce our import levels and, of course, increase 
<br/>our export levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  did  talk  about,  not  only  cattle  but  the  dairy  cows  as  well.    I  am 
<br/>thankful for the new initiative, again, for further cross breeding but we were fortunate to have been 
<br/>able to have the Brown Swiss as the honourable Minister has already alluded to.  I am told in some 
<br/>of my conversations with Ministry of Agriculture staff that right now, those cows are hitting almost 
<br/>20 litres, our dairy cows normally hit 5 litres to 10 litres at their best.  Again, nutrition is important.  
<br/>I am told that in the second round of their lactation, they are now reaching 20 litres and above.  So, 
<br/>huge potentials, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have nothing further to add but to wish the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>all the very best in this programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  those  scientific 
<br/>comments, especially with the massive weight of the bulls and the scientific approach that you now 
<br/>use in getting embryos and whatever you stated there to be inseminated, and that is very educational.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea and we will resume 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>2023 International Youth Day Celebration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to address this august House  by providing 
<br/>an update of this year’s International Youth Day Celebration and the impact it created.  Before I do 
<br/>that,  on  behalf  of  our  youth  in  Fiji  and  all  the  sportspeople  and  sporting  bodies,  we  wish  to 
<br/>congratulate the honourable Prime Minister on his 75</span><span>th</span><span> birthday and we wish him a long life.  I further 
<br/>we wish to congratulate our Fiji Water Flying Fijians for the remarkable game they played against 
<br/>Wales.  We wish them well in the next game against the Australian Wallabies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International Youth Day is observed annually the world over on 12</span><span>th</span><span> August. It is meant as 
<br/>an opportunity for Government and others to draw attention to youth issues worldwide. This year, 
<br/>the event was held in four different locations around Fiji namely; Western, Northern, Central and 
<br/>Eastern, spanning from 3</span><span>rd</span><span> August to 25</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the 2023 International Youth Day was, undoubtedly, a remarkable event that 
<br/>highlighted the essential theme of “Green Skills for Youth Towards a Sustainable World”.  In this 
<br/>age of pressing environmental challenges, it is vital for us to empower our young population with the 
<br/>necessary  skills  and  knowledge  to  build  a  sustainable  future.    The  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports 
<br/>recognised  this  urgency  and  orchestrated  a  celebration  that  fostered  awareness,  education  and 
<br/>employment opportunities for our youth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have a very young population, current figures indicate that up to 70 percent 
<br/>of our population is youth under 40.  This is significant and indicates the challenges we face as a 
<br/>country  regarding  full  employment  to  ensure  our  economy  continues  to  grow.    A  drastic  drop  in 
<br/>employment  post-COVID-19  with  the  country  recovering,  and  the  recent  influx  of  migration  of 
<br/>workers overseas has had many negative implications not only on the economy but on the lives of 
<br/>many young people in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  with  unemployment  amongst  youth,  comes  a  whole  host  of  socio-economic 
<br/>issues such mental health problems, domestic and gender violence, alcohol and drug use and crime.  
<br/>Additionally,  being  unemployed  is  associated  with  increased  risk  of  death  by  suicide  and  this 
<br/>negatively  affects  physical  well-being  of  youth,  hinders  skills  development,  causes  youth 
<br/>homelessness, increased population of street kids and increased poverty, especially in urban and peri 
<br/>urban communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is against this backdrop that the Ministry launched a “Youth Career Fair” as part of the 
<br/>International  Youth  Day  Celebration.    The  Youth  Career  Fair  aimed  to  address  the  high  youth 
<br/>unemployment  rate  in  Fiji  by  focusing  on  eco-friendly  industries,  also  filling  the  skills  gap  and 
<br/>available local job opportunities, hence creating a platform for local employers and environmentally 
<br/>conscious job-seeking youth to connect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  International  Youth  Day  celebration  embarked  on  the  following  key 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expected outcomes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increased (Green) Employment Opportunities; 
<br/>Enhanced Eco-Literacy Employability; 
<br/>Strengthened Green Collaborations; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Heightened public awareness regarding the importance of green skills, investing in the local 
<br/>workforce,  ensuring  that  employers  forge  partnerships  to  address  youth  unemployment 
<br/>collectively and creating a sustainable future for Fiji.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  International  Youth  Day  celebrations  witnessed  a  good  response  with  1,240 
<br/>youth attending the two-day celebration held at the Fiji National University, Nasinu Campus.  Sir, 
<br/>446 youth attending the celebration held at Labasa Civic Centre, 996 youth attending the celebration 
<br/>held at Nadi Civic Centre and 308 attended a programme held in Kadavu.  A total of 2,990 youth 
<br/>were registered during International Youth Day that was celebrated across all four divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Various  workshops  and  interactive  sessions  were  organised  to  facilitate  learning  and 
<br/>knowledge exchange.  Experts and professionals from different domains of sustainability delivered 
<br/>informative talks to inspire and motivate the young generation to be agents of change in our society.  
<br/>The  events  featured  informative  exhibitions,  educational  programmes  that  engaged  our  youth  in 
<br/>understanding the significance of green skills.  It was indeed heartening to witness the enthusiasm 
<br/>and passion as they actively participated in discussions and practical sessions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Youth and Sports ensured that the celebrations provided holistic 
<br/>experience for our youth. The collaboration with various stakeholders and organisations working in 
<br/>sustainability  played  a  pivotal  role  in  the  success  of  the  event.    Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  the 
<br/>presence of the compliance industry such as the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (FRCS), Fiji 
<br/>National Provident Fund (FNPF), Ministry of Justice through Birth, Death and Marriage and banking 
<br/>sectors provided the enabling environment and a one-stop shop for the youth to take advantage during 
<br/>the Youth Career Fair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the impact of the programme was realised almost instantly as some youth were 
<br/>interviewed and absorb directly into the workforce. A total of 83 recruitments was done during the 
<br/>International Youth Day 2023 celebration.  As of this week, 600 youth are currently training on the 
<br/>job prior to full employment.  With discussions we are regularly having with stakeholders, we expect 
<br/>to see an increase in recruitment numbers for those youth who had attended the Career Fair in the 
<br/>coming weeks as employers commence their respective recruitment formalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to ensure success in our venture towards effective youth development, firstly, 
<br/>we need to foster partnerships with local and international organisations, youth-led initiatives and 
<br/>community  stakeholders  to  create  a  broader  and  more  inclusive  platform  for  youth  engagement. 
<br/>Collaboration enabled us to tap into diverse resources, expertise and networks, amplifying the impact 
<br/>of the International Youth Day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we need to address critical global challenges such as climate change, poverty, 
<br/>youth  unemployment,  inequality,  education  and  health  innovatively  with  our  young  people. 
<br/></span><span>Encourage them to contribute their innovative ideas  and solutions  towards  achieving these goals, 
<br/></span><span>fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. We need to expend educational opportunities and 
<br/>continually  provide  platforms  for  sharing  best  practices  in  education,  exploring  new  pedagogical 
<br/>approaches and leveraging technology to enhance learning outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaking of youth unemployment, there is a need to strengthen Youth Entrepreneurship by 
<br/>empowering young entrepreneurs through creating an enabling environment that supports youth-led 
<br/>businesses  and  start-ups,  facilitate  access  to  finance,  mentorship  programmes  and  business 
<br/>development  services,  enabling  young  people  to  turn  their  innovative  ideas  into  sustainable 
<br/></span><span>enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as a way forward, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has set up a roadmap to 
<br/>have such similar events like the Youth Career Fair on a quarterly basis - to quickly address the need 
<br/>of the industry on human capital and to strengthen youth development agenda aligned to the SDG 
<br/>and the National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1773 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the Ministry will continuously engage with employers and other line Ministries in 
<br/>continuing  to  drive  partnership/closer  collaboration  in  addressing  the  current  issues  of  increasing 
<br/>unemployment for our young people, addressing skills gaps that is increasing due to the number of 
<br/>people heading offshore for job opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly,  the  Ministry  will  seek  for  an  increased  budget  allocation  to  support  these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programmes to ensure effective implementation and sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry will establish a targeted approach towards implementing Youth 
<br/>Empowerment  and Skills  Training by coordinating with  employers to  ascertain  skills  needed and 
<br/>organised  trainings  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  job  market.    Moreover,  the  Ministry  will  setup  a 
<br/>database to store information of all youth registered through the Youth Career Fair including their 
<br/>CVs  to  ensure  ease  of  reference  when  dealing  with  employers  and  employment  opportunities 
<br/>available for our youth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the dedication and hard work put into organising this year’s International Youth 
<br/>Day celebrations are commendable and I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the media 
<br/>industry  especially  the  CEO  of  Fijian  Broadcasting  Corporation  and  his  team,  UNFPA  for  its 
<br/>continuous support towards youth development, stakeholders, line ministries and our dedicated staff 
<br/>in  the  Ministry  for  their unwavering  commitment.    Our  special  gratitude  to  the  honourable  Sashi 
<br/>Kiran for her support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we look ahead to the future of the International Youth Day and Youth Career Fair in Fiji, 
<br/>it  is  crucial  that  we  build  upon  the  success  of  this  year’s  event  and  continue  to  prioritise  the 
<br/>empowerment and development of our youth. Mr. Speaker, together we can create a world where 
<br/>every young person has the opportunity to thrive where their dreams and aspirations are realised and 
<br/>where their contributions are valued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of economic opportunities has led to extreme poverty within our 
<br/>communities.  The lack of economic opportunities has also led our youth to illegal activities, like 
<br/>growing  marijuana  in  remote  areas  and  others,  as  source  of  income.    It  is  the  lack  of  economic 
<br/>opportunities that has also led more youth to loiter around our urban centres and live on the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  by  aligning  the  event  with  the  theme  of  “Green  Skills  for  Youth  Towards  a 
<br/>Sustainable World” and launching a Youth Career Fair, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has taken 
<br/>a significant step towards empowering our young people to champion environmental sustainability 
<br/></span><span>and bridge the gap of the current employment need with different employment sectors and invest on 
<br/></span><span>our  young  people.    We  are  very  confident  that  the  knowledge  and  skills  gained  by  our  young 
<br/>generation during these celebrations will shape a brighter and greener future for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker and esteemed Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or his designate, for their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker. This is a subject that we should 
<br/></span><span>all be passionate about - our young people.  Our future, the future of Fiji, are in the hands of our 
<br/>young.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and also for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>successful conduct of that international event.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, this is a subject, as I have said earlier, that we should be passionate about - 
<br/>all of us who are in this august Parliament.  Like the first Ministerial Statement on our young, this is 
<br/>something similar to that. If you are not able to look after them when they are young at that early 
<br/>age, how can we ensure that the future of Fiji will be a peaceful one, or a prosperous one and a stable 
<br/>one?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few days ago, we gathered and shouted for our gladiators in France, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I 
<br/>believe it is also in that same voice, that same passion and that same commitment, that we should be 
<br/>able to do that this morning, on this day, and shout out to our young, telling them and assuring them, 
<br/>that we are committed to their future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have three key questions this morning that I wish to pose, on behalf of this 
<br/>side of Parliament. The fourth one is really an initiative initiated globally and I believe it resonates 
<br/>with the efforts and the attempts by us all, especially the Government, in directing a pathway for our 
<br/>future generation. The questions are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Are we prepared to advocate strongly on our youth and their future?  How do we do that? 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Can we give them that space that they can live, enjoy and know that they are supported 
<br/>fully by us - the communities in the village, urban, rural and at home? 
<br/>Can we keep them on track?  
<br/>Last  few  days,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  you  have  been  talking  about  the  Yellow  Ribbon 
<br/>programme.  In the last few days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been talking about the Yellow 
<br/>Ribbon Programme.  The Yellow Ribbon Programme is about bringing them back on track 
<br/>for those who have gone off track.  Can we keep them on track?  Our Churches, our </span><span>Vanua, 
<br/></span><span>our community, mums and dads, can we keep them on track?  So that this Report that you 
<br/>have tabled this morning in this august Parliament becomes a reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>Can we assure them of our support and our prayers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have policies, we have a clear direction on where we want 
<br/>to take our youth and prepare them for the future of our nation.  Those four questions that I have 
<br/>posed in this august Parliament are important to us all this morning.  We advocate, we give them the 
<br/>space, we keep them on track, we assure them of our support and above all, we pray for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This side of the Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, fully supports and endorses the Report that has 
<br/>been tabled this morning and we have the assurance on anything and everything to do with the youth, 
<br/>we support it, for therein lies the future of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- On the next Agenda item which is Questions, I have made some decisions 
<br/>on the first Oral Question.  The author, honourable Bala, is not in Parliament and as such, I have 
<br/>allowed honourable Bia to raise this question on his behalf.
