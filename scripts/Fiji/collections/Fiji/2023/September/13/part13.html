<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cane sector by the Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, I must congratulate the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prime Minister on his birthday and I wish him well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had prepared a six-page answer and since honourable Bala is not here, I 
<br/>will be very short and sweet.  Yes, the election is going to take place as Cabinet has endorsed that 
<br/>Sugar Cane Growers Election and we are now proceeding to hold the Election.  Our target is to hold 
<br/>the Election probably on the first quarter of next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar and the very Minister who said that the Fijian farmers are lazy...    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- …who made that statement and he is here, after the election of the 
<br/>District  Directors  and  will  be  members  of  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Council,  can  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister inform Parliament who is going to fund the operation of the Council? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- It is part of the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  answered  the    question  which  was  specific  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether the election will take place, and that it is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Sugar; what measures does the Government have in place to address the concerns and grievances of 
<br/>cane sector stakeholders, if the promised Sugarcane Growers Council Election faces further delay or 
<br/>complications? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it is a new question, but there will be no delay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, how is this Election going to take place?  
<br/>We know it is going to be sector-wise and we know that the number of farmers in each sector has 
<br/>reduced, so are we going to merge the sectors or how are we going to have this Election? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we are currently looking at the entire 
<br/>formula on all the sectors. Once we determine how many farmers are left, then we will put up the 
<br/>roll. So, let us wait for the Elections Office to help us out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>EFL Grid Extension Work Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 116/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on the EFL Grid Extension work programme for the current financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question and I thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>1776 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, the Ministry has allocated $4.1 million.  This will 
<br/>include grid extension and house wiring, in addition to the $12.4 million that has been paid in 2022-
<br/>2023 financial year. This will cater for 111 projects with a total of 1,545 households to benefit from 
<br/>these projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a reduction from the $12.4 million to $4.1 million but this will enable the Department of 
<br/>Energy and Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) to catch up on the backlog from 2018. This will be in addition 
<br/>to  the  29  projects  that  are  currently  under  construction  by  EFL,  which  benefits  about  1,966 
<br/>households with a value of $16.38 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for grid extension, normally communities apply to EFL, EFL does a survey 
<br/>and determines a budget, the Department of Energy proposes this budget which is then paid to EFL 
<br/>to progress the work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned, there is a backlog and this includes ongoing projects for grid extension 
<br/>with a total of 140 projects from 2018 to 2019 which is worth about $12.1 million; from 2021-2022 
<br/>which is worth $2.05 million; and from 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 which is worth $15.9 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of Parliament, some of the constraints or causes of delays include projects 
<br/>crossing leased areas, for example, Fiji Pine lands with the Navatusila Grid, the limitations in terms 
<br/>of the number of contractors and also their capacities; there have also been issues regarding material 
<br/>shortages - transformers, poles, et cetera; of course, high staff turnover, not only in EFL but also in 
<br/>the Department of Energy; we faced the issue of COVID-19; there have been issues with the revised 
<br/>tenders  and  costs;  global  supply  chain  issues  in  terms  of  such  technical  equipment;  inclement 
<br/>weather;  and finally also the challenges of our rural roads in terms of access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the information 
<br/>that  has  been  provided  on  the  continuation  of  grid  extensions.    It  is  good  to  see  that  the  work  is 
<br/>continuing.  Now, we can see that the grid has been extended right up to the upper reaches of Naitasiri, 
<br/>across to Tavua and up Namosi.  We are glad to see that that work is continuing, and that money has 
<br/>been set aside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister mentioned that there was also backlog of projects, initially way back 
<br/>to 2017 but now it is from 2018 to 2022.  So, the funds for this year will be from 2023 to 2024.  I 
<br/>would like to request if the honourable Minister might just give us an update on those backlog where 
<br/>money has already been paid to EFL, I believe now it is only back from 2018 up to 2022, and when 
<br/></span><span>is it likely that these projects will be completed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, those backlogs are nearing completion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Below are the details:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Nukulau Village, Yawe, Vuniyasi, Korolevu, Keiyasi, Sigatoka Stage 3 worth $1.7 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- this has been paid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Navatusila District, Navosa, Sigatoka Stage 1 including Nabutautau Village, Drokadroka, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Natoka worth $5.05 million - this has also been paid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Nalawa District, Nasau, Rakiraki Stage 2 worth $2.3 million - this has been paid to EFL. 
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Naikelikoso, Wainikoro, Labasa worth $2.5 million - this has been paid. 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Welagi, Naselesele, Taveuni Stages 1 and 2 worth $3.9 million - also conveyed to EFL. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the information I have been provided with, this will progress significantly this year and, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>definitely, we will be working towards their completion next year.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1777 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for that feedback.  I know the people of Uluisavudua, Sawani, will be celebrating after hearing this 
<br/>news from the honourable Minister.  The question is, whether the backlogs cover those who already 
<br/>have the grid, but the power is yet to be released - from the Nacavanadi Junction to Navakaka and 
<br/>those from Nacavanadi Junction to Kasavu, who have been waiting for quite some time now for that.  
<br/>The line is there or grid, but there is no power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I note that, but as mentioned, what is in the programme is what 
<br/>I have mentioned.  But we have also received requests and also there are some in the pipeline which 
<br/>will be factored into the annual budget as we move forward into 2024 to 2025 and onwards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mission of EFL is to transition into clean energy 
<br/>in the future.  Instead of transitioning to net zero emission, clean energy and zero carbon footprints, 
<br/>how do you justify that these operations are running mostly on diesel operation and causing a lot of 
<br/>air pollution?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a new question.  A major percentage 
<br/>of our energy in the country is renewable energy, through hydro.  Even in Taveuni, that is hybrid 
<br/>both hydro and also diesel, so that is the target we are working towards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  supplementary question to  the honourable 
<br/>Minister would be as he has mentioned that there has been a decrease in the budget from $12.5 million 
<br/>to $4.5 million and he has actually mentioned some of the projects that will be undertaken in this 
<br/>financial year.  There were two projects earmarked for this financial year, one was for 21 families in 
<br/>Tabia, Labasa and I would like to declare my interest for the second one which is for 15 to 18 families 
<br/>in Bulileka, Labasa.  Can the honourable Minister confirm if these projects are still on the lists or 
<br/>have they been removed because of the decrease in the budget?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you honourable Member, I do not have that information 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with me but I can convey it to you later.  You can send me an email on that. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Support Systems for Single Mothers 
<br/>(Question No. 117/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection explain what 
<br/></span><span>specific provisions or support systems the Government intends to implement to assist single 
<br/>mothers who might be financially impacted by the recent tax adjustments, especially given 
<br/>their increased responsibility as sole breadwinners? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>Yes, the increase in VAT has been acknowledged and is seen in the increase in prices.  Certainly, in 
<br/>anticipation of this, honourable Member, you have seen an increase accordingly in terms of our Social 
<br/>Protection Allowance which increased by 25 percent in this year’s Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government,  through  the  Ministry,  especially  for  single  mothers  who  are  sole 
<br/>breadwinners, we have seen an increase in their allowances in terms of the Family Assistance Scheme 
<br/>which used to be called the Poverty Benefit Scheme, as well as Child Protection Allowance, so any 
<br/>children they have they can claim also the Child Protection Allowance which has seen an increase 
<br/>from $177 to $196.  There is also, of course, the Food Voucher which was only limited to Max Value 
<br/>Supermarket  now  has  been  turned  to  cash  so  that  they  have  the  liberty  and  the  freedom  to  shop 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>1778 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wherever they want  - a  cheaper supermarket  or to buy fresh  produce outside of the supermarket.  
<br/>Before they were limited only to the prices that Max Value is imposing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further to  our Social Protection Assistance, we  have been  working  with our development 
<br/>partners and our line Ministries to create opportunities for our single mothers as well as our young 
<br/>people who we can train and put to work.  One such initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is our partnership 
<br/>with  the  Australian  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  (DFAT)  and  APTC  and  they  are 
<br/>piloting  this  programme  which  actually  began  yesterday  -  12</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2023,  so  we  have  10 
<br/>participants who have been given full scholarships to undertake an entry level Engineering Certificate 
<br/>Level II.  So, no experience required, and it runs for 10 weeks until 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023 where there 
<br/>will be employment-ready and placed in employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  the  10  participants  who  were  identified  from  the  HART  community  and  other 
<br/>organisations  like  Homes  of  Hope,  two  are  single  mothers  and  there  are  two  from  the  Nasinu 
<br/>Women’s Rugby Club - their names were put up, one participant is from the Veilomani Boys Home 
<br/>in Ba and I wish to thank the Australian Government and APTC for that initiative. While it is a small 
<br/>number, we hope to increase this engagement through APTC and other colleges where we are seeking 
<br/>the  support  of  the  Australian  Government  and  other  development  partners  to  provide  these 
<br/>scholarships for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, another initiative is by TVET Pasifika. The advertisement has gone out at the 
<br/>Fiji National University which just started with free courses for our street dwellers, street kids and 
<br/>our people, including single mothers in informal and squatter settlements.   This training programme 
<br/>is  in  domestic  electrical  installation,  basic  screen  printing,  basic  cookery,  small  engine  repairs, 
<br/>household and sanitary plumbing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  and  FNU  for  partnering  with  our 
<br/>Ministry to provide the scholarships, to deal with our unemployed men, women and youth living in 
<br/>settlements and streets, to have a pathway, to move our people from poverty to productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while our Labour Mobility Programmes are taking a majority of our men, we 
<br/>have a huge opportunity to put our women to work, including our single mums, so we are working 
<br/>with our development partners - Australia and New Zealand, to help us mitigate the loss of labour 
<br/>we are experiencing. I think we, as a Government, and we in this Parliament should demand more 
<br/>from our development partners to come to the table to train our people and incentivise them to stay 
<br/>and not to move overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am also in negotiation with the honourable Minister for Housing in terms of 
<br/>our single mothers and single parents living in the Public Rental Board flats. I have approached the 
<br/>Ministry and hopefully they are reviewing to see what they can do for our single parents and single 
<br/>mums especially for the huge debts that had been incurred during COVID in terms of rentals because 
<br/>they had lost jobs during that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is something I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Housing for considering 
<br/>this proposal in terms of looking at a way to either reduce or forgive that debt of what was owed from 
<br/></span><span>COVID period because of the loss of jobs.  I am talking about single parents because there are quite 
<br/></span><span>a  number  of  fathers  living  in  Public  Rental  Board  with  a  number  of  children  who  are  on  Social 
<br/>Welfare  that  struggling  to  pay  that  debt  from  during  the  COVID  period,  but  the  rentals  kept 
<br/>accumulating at PRB so, we hope that we can finalise that soon enough.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, in mitigating the loss of labour that we are experiencing, we 
<br/>do want to put our women to work.  We want to encourage our employers to have childcare in their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1779 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>places of employment to support our women, because one of the main reasons of absenteeism and 
<br/>other issues that our women face, especially our single mums, is a need for childcare and they are 
<br/>struggling to have this kind of care in their own homes or support from the communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are very grateful for the HART community coming forward in terms the APTC Course 
<br/>because they have agreed to look after the children of the single mums and single parents from the 
<br/>HART community, while these single mums and parents attend to the course for the next 10 weeks.  
<br/>The  HART  community  now  providing  the  childcare  to  look  after  their  children,  so  I  want  to 
<br/>acknowledge the HART community for coming forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Companies  like  Mark  One  Apparel  already  has  a  Child  Care  facility  in  their  place  of 
<br/>employment.    Vinod  Patel  has  come  forward.    Fiji  Airways  is  exploring  it.    I  know  I  have  been 
<br/>speaking  with  honourable Kamikamica in  terms  of these BPOs  coming into the country that  will 
<br/>employ thousands of people, to see to it that there are childcare facilities for our mums or parents to 
<br/>be able to place their children in there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know there is a question coming later about Early Childhood Care Centres but working in 
<br/>conjunction with our Ministries also includes our Ministry for Agriculture, Ministry for Fisheries so 
<br/>that we can see to our rural women to have some form of employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is on us to come up with project proposals to put our women to work and they do want to 
<br/>work.  So, while the Government is assisting to provide welfare payments, it is a vision and mission 
<br/>of the Coalition Government that we need to move our able-bodied men and women.  We are about 
<br/>to complete our database in terms of our able-bodied men and women who are on family assistance 
<br/>Scheme, including our single mums to put them to work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to just quickly address this issue about the EBayShop.  Many are defending it, many 
<br/>are opposing it, but it is time for our people to stop falling for these schemes where they can make a 
<br/>quick buck, make money without having to work for it.  We, as Members of Parliament, need to 
<br/>condemn these schemes and we need to encourage our people to apply for jobs.  There are so many 
<br/>vacancies, if we are giving money to our young people simply to make them go away or simply to 
<br/>make a quick buck.  Let us get our young people, our mums and dads and also young families to 
<br/>apply for employment and to go for training.  Now, being available for free and on scholarships, it is 
<br/>very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we move our people from poverty to productivity and from a 
<br/>life of welfare to well-being. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the answer which 
<br/></span><span>is quite comprehensive.  Sir, if I may just have a little extra minute just to add something to it.  There 
<br/>is a phenomenal opportunity, and my question is coming with respect to not just single mums.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You said  that DFAT and FNU offer training, but  there is  a phenomenal  opportunity  for a 
<br/>training exercise and it could be jointly done between the Minister for Trade and yourself because 
<br/>they have a lot of training facilities; financial literacy et cetera to get these people to them.  Have you 
<br/>been able to maybe form a committee to do that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also concur with the honourable Minister’s comments with respect to the EBayShop issue.  
<br/></span><span>We should condemn it outright now.  Unfortunately, Sir, we, as Fijians, are quite gullible when these 
<br/>things happen and I know for a fact that civil servants, the Police Force, military people and educated 
<br/>people have actually been stunned with this and the number is quite large.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I still think that it needs to be a whole lot more education on it, but 
<br/>the  question  is,  will  you  or  have  you  already  put  something  in  place  with  respect  to  getting  the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financial literacy and training that is needed for these people to get out in the workforce?  I know the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade has a lot of avenues with respect to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member.  As the former Minister for Trade, 
<br/>I know you  would have  had collaborations with  the Ministry.  We are  continuing  with  that good 
<br/>work.  I am grateful to the Trade Officers at the Ministry of Trade who come to all our activities that 
<br/>they work with our Department of Women on exactly that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  having  said  that,  honourable  Member,  this  is  something  that  we,  as  Ministers  or  as 
<br/>Government  or  as Members, need to  perhaps increase our capacity in  terms  of project  proposals, 
<br/>engaging the private sector, working together  through the Ministry for Trade and getting their skills 
<br/>(I know they have met with Investment Fiji and trade officers where they can increase the capacity 
<br/>of  our  people;  women  especially  to  be  able  to  put  together  project  proposals,  so  that  we  as  the 
<br/>Ministry can then take it to our development partners.  That is a skill in itself and I am hopeful that 
<br/>we will continue that work and I am very grateful for the Ministry for Trade for working with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for her reply 
<br/>to that question.  Just a suggestion before I ask my supplementary question in terms of doing your 
<br/>scoping for various trainings and courses that are available for single mums, in terms of focusing on 
<br/>HART and various homes and various women organisation, can I suggest that you just increase your 
<br/>scoping to the various communities and settlements that are available because there are more that 
<br/>live within these communities and settlements within the urban areas and the rural areas as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are focusing on women and I thank the honourable Minister for focusing 
<br/>on single mums.  Just to ask whether there are avenues as well out there for single dads in terms of 
<br/>social protection?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That was a lengthy one, honourable Bia.  First of all, you began with that 
<br/>suggestion, then you went  to  the women, and now you end up with  single  men.  The question is 
<br/>directed towards the Ministry of Women.  Your question is on single men. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Single dads, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the suggestion 
<br/>about working with the communities widely. As I have said, this is a pilot project,  Why the HART 
<br/>community  was  approached,  even  though  we  consulted  widely,  was  because  of  their  ability  to 
<br/></span><span>provide child care for the mums so that they can attend the course.  That was the very big part of our 
<br/></span><span>scoping.  I would then hope to appeal to settlements where the mums or the community will come 
<br/>together and be able to provide that help so that they can attend courses.  But I thank you and I note 
<br/>your suggestion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the single men, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Single dads.

<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Single dads, yes, same thing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That goes to another Ministry.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1781 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- So, single dads, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact the suggestion to approach 
<br/>it was an appeal from a single dad  at the PRB flat in Nabua, that triggered discussions with the PRB 
<br/>and the honourable Minister for Housing.  He has five children, he was on his own and he had to 
<br/>leave his work to look after his children during COVID.  It wrapped up in a thousand of dollars in 
<br/>terms of PRB rental arrears.  But this is something we look at all of them, they are entitled of course 
<br/>to apply for the Family Assistance Scheme, just as single mothers do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Social  Welfare  increment  of  25  percent  that  the 
<br/>honourable Minister is talking about is not fully reflected in the payments.  Those who are supposed 
<br/>to receive $125 some of them are receiving only $115.  I have received some complaints from the 
<br/>senior citizens, we have registered the complaint with the Nasinu Welfare Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand because the Budget was implemented on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023 but then again this 
<br/>month, Sir, some of them who were supposed to receive $125 have just received $115.  While I am 
<br/>speaking on that, Sir, just to let the honourable Minister know that those who are getting $115 are 
<br/>only able to withdraw $110 and those are receiving $125 are only able to receive $120 due to this 
<br/>ATM  provisions  where  they  cannot  receive  the  $5.    My  question,  Sir,  when  is  this  going  to  be 
<br/>rectified?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I will ask the honourable Member to, please, write in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>formally so that we can act on it.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There are cases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not think that is correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Women for the answer she has given.  I would like to ask something with regards to the nutrition bit 
<br/>of babies if we are talking about single mothers and working mothers, though we are actually promote 
<br/>from Ministry of Health that breastfeeding is best for the babies but most of the time we are not able 
<br/>to do so, especially with working mothers and even single mothers who are working.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the price even though on the price control, a tin of SMA is around S22, S26 is 
<br/>ranging from $38 to $45 which is quite massive.  Is the Ministry actually looking at subsiding these 
<br/></span><span>formula somehow or the other, or are there any talks in place to give some tax incentive to one of the 
<br/></span><span>companies in Fiji who can actually manufacture so that this cost can go down because nutrition for 
<br/>babies at a very tender age is very important? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply honourable Minister, you look at the rest of the questions 
<br/>has changed, a single mother to single dad and now we are talking about breast feeding.  This is all... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- All connected!! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- All connected? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think we need to address the issues that were raised earlier on, which is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the thrust of the question, it is do with single mothers.  Let us keep it at that.

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  provided  a 
<br/>comprehensive answer, which is why a lot of questions developed around it.  My question will be 
<br/>very brief.  Will the Government consider the review of national minimum wage?  It is good that you 
<br/>are encouraging single mums and women to be educated and come back to the employment sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an advocate for the national minimum wage, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>think there is always room for improvement and certainly we will consider that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, my plea is, please confine the question to the thrust 
<br/>of the first question and let us keep it at that, otherwise we are going around in circles here.  We are 
<br/>even going to men breastfeeding the children or something.

<div><span>Update – 4</span><span>th</span><span> Review of Fiji’s Trade Policy 
<br/>(Question No. 118/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications provide an update on 
<br/>the 4</span><span>th</span><span> Review of Fiji’s Trade Policy at the World Trade Organization that took place 
<br/>from 19th July to 21st July, 2023 in Geneva? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps just very briefly before I begin 
<br/>my answer, I hope the other side of Parliament starts getting what we have been talking on this side 
<br/>of Parliament, which is,  that there is new democracy in this country now.  In the old Parliament, they 
<br/>would never have the opportunity and you had been so tolerant, and I think they owe you … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- … some gratitude.  On behalf of this side of Parliament and 
<br/>for the people of Fiji, the other side of Parliament will agree with us that there is new democracy in 
<br/>this country, real democracy in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to answer the question.  I rise to provide an update on the Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>recent engagement in the fourth review of our trade policy at the World Trade Organization (WTO).  
<br/></span><span>I wish to extend my gratitude to the former Minister, who was part of the process from the beginning, 
<br/>and it shows what we were able to achieve in Geneva this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 19</span><span>th</span><span> July to 21</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2023, Fiji actively participated in the fourth review of our Trade 
<br/>Policy at the WTO.  The review process played a pivotal role in enabling us to thoroughly assess the 
<br/>impact of our trade policies, engage in constructive dialogue with our trading partners and deliberate 
<br/>on the necessary adjustments to enhance our trade strategy further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The trade reviews are mandated as an exercise stemming from the Marrakesh Agreement that 
<br/></span><span>established the WTO.  This review serves to enhance transparency and understanding of countries’ 
<br/>trade policies and practices and enable multilateral assessments of how the WTO member policies 
<br/>affect the world trading system.  It is crucial to clarify that this is not an illegal scrutiny, but rather, a 
<br/>constructive stocktake aimed at fostering a better understanding and providing recommendations for 
<br/>improvement.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1783 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The frequency of this review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, varies according to country size and for Fiji 
<br/>our  trade  policies  undergo  review  every  six  years  at  the  WTO.    Trade  Policy  Reviews  process 
<br/>involves  two  essential  documents  -  our  policy  statement  by  the  Government  under  review  and  a 
<br/>detailed independent report authored by the WTO Secretariat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The journey towards Fiji’s 4</span><span>th</span><span> Trade Policy Review began in July 2022. To prepare the WTO 
<br/>Secretariat  Report,  we  work  diligently  to  provide  timely  information  to  the  Secretariat,  with 
<br/>assistance  of  our  stakeholders.    Additionally,  a  scoping  mission  to  Fiji  was  conducted  by  the 
<br/>Secretariat in March 2023 to finalise the report.  The Ministry also coordinated consultations with 
<br/>relevant  agencies  and  stakeholders  to  prepare  Fiji’s  policy  statement.    Once  these  reports  were 
<br/>compiled, they were circulated to all WTO members for submission or written questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji then had to respond to the questions in advance of the Trade Policy Review at the WTO 
<br/>headquarters in July.  Fiji received over 169 written advance questions from various WTO members 
<br/>demonstrating the global communities’ keen interest in our trade policies.  We are pleased to have 
<br/>provided comprehensive and well considered answers to these questions both in writing and during 
<br/>the Trade Policy Review session. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have to say Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we did answer all the questions and I would just like to 
<br/>thank the Ministry officials who worked very hard to ensure that we projected a very good image of 
<br/>our  country  at  the  WTO.    During  the  Trade  Review  Policy  session  Fiji  received  overwhelming 
<br/>support and recommendations from numerous WTO countries such as Barbados, Vanuatu, Ecuador, 
<br/>Timor-Leste, Samoa, Indonesia, Kenya, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Mauritius, Japan, Canada, 
<br/>Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, United States, Singapore, European Union, China, Costa Rica, 
<br/>Brazil and South Korea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These wide-ranging support underscores Fiji’s small but robust presence on the global trade 
<br/>stage.    Fiji’s  significant  contributions  to  the  WTO  did  not  go  unnoticed  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  The 
<br/>contributions  on  the  Fisheries  Agreement  were  particularly  highlighted  and  acknowledged  by  all 
<br/>members underscoring our commitment to the Blue Pacific Ocean, blue oceans, the conservation of 
<br/>oceans and sustainable fisheries management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard the ratification of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies yesterday will actually 
<br/>do a lot to confirm our stature as a leader in this area.  In the realm of environmental sustainability 
<br/>Fiji’s role as co-chair of the plastics dialogue received high praise as we facilitated discussions on 
<br/>plastic  pollution  and  promoted  environmentally  sustainable  plastic  trading.    Furthermore,  Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>decision to lower tariffs on meat imports was warmly welcomed by WTO members demonstrating 
<br/></span><span>our commitments to open and accessible trade environments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  Fiji’s  active  role  in  the  WTO  Fiji  was  also  invited  to  join  a  number  of  plurilateral 
<br/>negotiations taking place in the margins of the WTO.  These include services, domestic regulations 
<br/>and  e-commerce.  Australia  has  also  invited  Fiji  to  join  the  Care  and  Needs  Scale  (CANS)  group 
<br/>which lobbies against agricultural subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade has long been the lifeblood of Fiji’s development Mr. Speaker, Sir, deeply engrained 
<br/></span><span>in the very fabric of our society. It is through trade that we have expanded our horizon, open new 
<br/></span><span>opportunities  and  fostered  innovation.  Our  journey  towards  economic  progress  has  been 
<br/>fundamentally linked to our ability to connect with the world and showcase the richness of our culture 
<br/>and its produce or products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  WTO  plays  a  critical  role  in  this  endeavour  providing  a  platform  for  a  rules  based, 
<br/>transparent  and  equitable  global  trading  system.  As  a  small  island  nation,  Fiji  acknowledges  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importance of the WTO in ensuring that all nations regardless of their size, but can participate in 
<br/>international trade on fair and just terms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I wish  to  extend my  heartfelt  gratitude to  the WTO  Secretariat  for their 
<br/>tireless efforts in producing the comprehensive report that served as a cornerstone of our trade policy 
<br/>review in Geneva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank His Excellency, Mr. George Mina of Australia who is the WTO 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ambassador for Australia who served in his role as the Discussant for Fiji’s Trade Policy Review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji  remains committed to the principles of fair and open 
<br/>trade and we will continue to work closely with our global partners through the WTO to strengthen 
<br/>our trade policies for the benefit of Fiji and its people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister that we are also seeing contradicting scenarios of the so-called new democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  his  answer,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  the  question  he  stated  about  Conservation  of  Oceans 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something that is in the heart of the Marrakesh Agreement, Conservation of Oceans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  5</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  he  moved  the  motion  in  here  about  the  protection  of  our  oceans.  So,  if  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister can tell us and tell the House where is Fiji’s official position on 
<br/>the Conservation of Oceans?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, sometimes some of us have hearing issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have just been talking about supplementary question being related to the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You mentioned it in your answer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  That is a new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- In democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No answers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Have been hearing you mentioning Japan all  the time, honourable Ketan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lal.  What has that to do with this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Very cheeky. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hey, who is cheeky.  That is unparliamentary language. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You cannot raise a Point of Order because I will just be inviting honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ketan on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I think what honourable Usamate was about to say was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that, I think sometimes we need to treat our younger MPs as MPs. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- We will talk about … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No running commentary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I commend the honourable Minister because I know that 
<br/>the review was some 111 odd pages of report. So, trying to condense it into a 10 minute answer was 
<br/>actually quite difficult.  I have like a 111 questions to ask but something that I can speak to him 
<br/>about.    Just  one  question,  honourable  Minister,  in  light  of  the  review  that  has  taken  place  this  is 
<br/>obviously guided by the fact that Marrakesh Agreement has asked that periodically your trade policy 
<br/>be reviewed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Initial Fijian Trade Policy Framework was set up in 2015 sort of had a 10 year lifespan.  
<br/>We are about almost less than 24 months may be away from that expiry. Will you be going through 
<br/>another  exercise  to  come  up  with  the  new  Trade  Policy  Framework  bearing  in  mind  the 
<br/>recommendations that have come out of the actual Trade Policy Review by the WTO?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are quite a few things that we need to do in terms of intellectual property rights and we 
<br/>are talking about trips and trips waiver, et cetera and all of those things. There are many new things 
<br/>that have been made available to Fijians and are now part of our landscape. So, my question really is 
<br/>that to incorporate all of that will we be doing another exercise in terms of getting a newer Trade 
<br/>Policy Framework sooner rather than later, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thank honourable Koya for that question.  Yes, absolutely 
<br/>when  I  first  came  in,  I  saw  the  documents  from  the  last  Trade  Framework  and  one  of  my  first 
<br/>questions was, why can we not update it now when there are suggestions from the technocrats which 
<br/>is a wise one?  Let us focus first on delivering on the TPR in Geneva and after all the comments are 
<br/>received, we can then progress on the framework reviewing and issuing a new document.  That is in 
<br/>the pipeline, we will be starting work on that soon.

<div><span>Construction/Extension of Nayavu Health Centre 
<br/>(Question No. 119/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry’s plans for the construction and extension of Nayavu Health Centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for his Oral Question.  Sir, the Nayavu Health Centre in Wainibuka is one few of the health facilities 
<br/>around  the  country  that  the  Ministry  is  working  on  for  infrastructural  improvement.    The  current 
<br/>clinic has aged through the years and its ongoing renovations together with the  current structures 
<br/>needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  in  2020,  Government  then,  through  the  Construction  Implementation  Unit  (CIU) 
<br/>constructed a building beside the current health clinic at a cost of $576,580.  The brand new building 
<br/></span><span>was intended to be staff quarters and has been occupied recently by clinical staff working at the health 
<br/></span><span>centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, upon reviewing the priorities for the health services at Nayavu, we were given that 
<br/>there are adequate housing still in place and the Ministry is planning to repurpose the new building 
<br/>to house some health services that are currently provided from the health clinic.  Those health services 
<br/>will be:

<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Doctor’s Consultation Room; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Holding beds for short term patient observation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prior to this, we will re-house the staff living in the new building and the nearby staff quarters 
<br/>and we will duly inform the general public whilst we have finalised the new arrangements for the 
<br/>health services from the health centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  this,  I  would  like  to  also  acknowledge  the  continuous  support  from  our 
<br/>development partners, both multi-lateral, unilateral in assisting the Ministry in terms of improving 
<br/>the  infrastructure.    One  in  particular  that  is  assisting  the  Nayavu  Health  Centre  facility  is  under 
<br/>KOICA funded SHAPE Projects (Strengthening Health Adaptation Project). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the SHAPE Project, we have identified to do extension of the waiting area,  polarisation 
<br/>of the facility and other improvements in the wash facilities as well.  Those are earmarked for Nayavu 
<br/>Health Centre and not only that, the Ministry is also looking at other facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to add on to that, the KOICA is looking also into 19 other facilities, a total of 20 with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nayavu being one of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Health for what he had mentioned of Nayavu Health Centre.  I think the people from Wainibuka 
<br/>and parts of Ra will benefit from the new standard of health service in Nayavu in years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with relation to the extension of the Nayavu Health 
<br/>Centre, will that also mean that the scope or the status of the health centre will be increased because 
<br/>I know in some of these health centres they always have a problem?  Whenever there is a problem at 
<br/>Korovou,  the  staff  get  pulled  out  and  they  are  put  into  Korovou.    I  am  just  wondering  about  the 
<br/>staffing structure, will that also be improved and also the level of service that will be provided there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the extension is for the scope of 
<br/>the infrastructure, but the Health Centre level itself is standard to cater for that amount of population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nayavu Health Centre looks after Rokovuaka 
<br/>on the border of Ra, Naveicovatu on the border of Wainibuka and Nakida in Naitasiri and also Soa.  
<br/>So the population has grown over the years and also with the infrastructure development in terms of 
<br/>road, electricity and connectivity.  There is also a lot of accidents along that road.  My question to 
<br/>the honourable Minister, will the Ministry consider the introduction of the new medical services like 
<br/>laboratory, dental, x-ray and mortuary at the Nayavu Health Centre due to the increase in population?  
<br/>Will the honourable Minister consider the introduction of new services together with the expansion 
<br/>of the infrastructure at Nayavu Health Centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is an interesting request coming now. They asked for the scope, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extension, now they went four mortuaries.  It is a great expectation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Ravunawa for his supplementary question.  As I had mentioned, one of the new buildings done in 
<br/>2020 are repurposing it to cater for clinical services.  For the new building if you have been there, 
<br/>the road goes straight in front of it and there is a small round about in front.  We are trying to utilise 
<br/></span><span>that space for clinical services and as you mentioned, it is along the highway at a accident prone area, 
<br/></span><span>we can utilise that area for emergency as well.  However, at the moment the standard is, as I had

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1787 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned before, if we are to increase that, then we have to involve other speciality in that area, then 
<br/>we have to improve and raise the standard of that health facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the mortuary, as I was talking with honourable Rokomatu, it has been raised a 
<br/>couple of times from that area in Wainibuka.  We have also identified the need that between Rakiraki 
<br/>and Korovou, there is nothing in between those areas.  So, we will be taking that into consideration 
<br/>probably in the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will resume when the bell is sounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.33 p.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members just before we continue, I would like to show you 
<br/>the yellow and red cards, for some have been calling for the yellow card.  It is good that the Secretariat 
<br/>has prepared this, and it is now ready. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope I would not be like the referee that ref the game against our team, but I hope to be 
<br/>impartial.    It  is  just  get  some  sense  of  direction  in  how  we  conduct  ourselves  honourably  in  this 
<br/>House.  This will be the intermediary between the Privileges Committee so at least you have some 
<br/>process in between as the yellow and if that continues then it becomes red and then the Privileges 
<br/>Committee can sit in and decide.  I think it will make it easy for them because right now I have been 
<br/>getting a few letters of complaints and it is quite hard.  And for that respect we had long meetings 
<br/>with  the  Secretariat  and  we  even  sought  the  views  of  the  Solicitor-General  to  help  us  because 
<br/>everything has to be seen to be transparent and legally done as well.

<div><span>Progress of Land Development for Informal Settlements 
<br/>(Question No. 120/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the status of land development works in progress to formalise informal settlements? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for  the  question  placed  before  the  august  Parliament  this  afternoon.    Before  I  provide  my 
<br/>Parliamentary response this afternoon, please, allow me to express my wishes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First,  I  would  like  to  join  the  former  speakers  as  well  as  honourable  Members  who  have 
<br/>expressed their best wishes to our humble Prime Minister on his special day today as well as the 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu on his birthday today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are they getting younger? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to congratulate and express 
<br/></span><span>my best wishes to the Fiji Water Flying Fijians Rugby Team. The Captain of the team is from the 
<br/></span><span>province of Serua so as a neighbouring province, I congratulate them for a job well done in their last 
<br/>game against Wales, even though they fell short.  But I think they really warmed our hearts after that 
<br/>game and also wish them the best in their next game against Australia. I know they are going to beat 
<br/>Australia in their second game. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I also thank the honourable Members who have also shown their 
<br/></span><span>support placing the Fiji Rugby Union pins as well as from the Municipal Councils throughout the 
<br/></span><span>country, they also showed their  support by putting up the national flag just to support our national 
<br/>rugby team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formalisation of informal settlements  is  a crucial endeavour towards 
<br/>achieving  sustainable  outcomes.  It  involves  improving  the  living  conditions,  infrastructure  and 
<br/>services in these settlements to provide their residents with secure and dignified living conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1789 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  currently  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Informal  Settlement  Upgrade 
<br/>Programme is an </span><span>in situ</span><span> capital programme focused on improving livelihoods for people living in 
<br/>informal settlements across our nation.  It comes to the Ministry as a total of 48 development leases, 
<br/>out of which 44 are located on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land and four on State land.  These development leases are 
<br/>spread  throughout  Fiji  with  13  settlements  located  in  the  Central  Division,  14  settlements  in  the 
<br/>Northern Division and 21 settlements in the Western Division.  The acquisition of these development 
<br/>leases started from 2012 and I thank my predecessors for this great initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, three out of 48 informal settlements, they are Cuvu in Nadroga, Ledrusasa 
<br/>in Nadi and Waidamudamu in Nausori have had their upgrades completed in 2022.  These settlements 
<br/>are now in the process for lot allocation.  Additionally, four informal settlements are presently in 
<br/>construction phase and these are in Sakoca in Nasinu which comprise of 174 households, Tavela in 
<br/>Nadi with 68 households and recently Field 4 of Lautoka which is around 77 households as well as 
<br/>Tore in Lautoka too with 59 households.  The total estimated cost of upgrade in these settlements is 
<br/>around $20.1 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, completion of preparatory work includes topographic surveys, preparation 
<br/>of scheme plans, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), geotech surveys and engineering plans 
<br/>are completed allowing the commencement of constructions works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, engineering plans for five informal settlements have recently been approved 
<br/>and these are Lovu Seaside, Nabare and Delaisaweni informal settlements in Lautoka, Valewaquyaya 
<br/>Settlement in Ba and Vunika in Labasa.  Additionally, Caubati and Wakanisila Settlements in Nasinu, 
<br/>Sasawira Settlement in Nausori and Nadonumai in Lami are earmarked to complete their engineering 
<br/>plans by end of this financial year.  The total estimated cost for the upgrade of these settlements is 
<br/>around $75 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, four settlements are currently in scheme plan phase which is planned to be 
<br/>also completed in this financial year.  The first one is Tukutora in Lautoka, Vunivau A and Vunivau 
<br/>B in Labasa and Qauia in Lami.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are five settlements that will be commencing preparation phase with consultants recently 
<br/>awarded,  these  includes  River  Road  in  Nasinu,  Veivauceva  in  Nasinu,  Vatia  settlement  in  Siberia, 
<br/>Delaimasimasi in  Lautoka and Uluisila in Sigatoka.  Hence, all these 25 Settlements are earmarked to be 
<br/>formalised for the next six years subject to budget allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the remaining 23 informal settlements out of the 48 are in preliminary phases 
<br/></span><span>to begin preparatory works by 2026. The preliminary phase includes preparation of bidding documents 
<br/>for the tender to select a Consultant to undertake the preparation work.  Furthermore, the Ministry also 
<br/>pays the lease premiums and yearly rentals for the 44 development leases in iTaukei.  A total of $4.1 
<br/>million in premium have been paid in addition to $0.9 million in yearly rentals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also highlight that the Ministry of Housing is also working in exploring 
<br/>options to include the improvement of housing conditions such as ways in which existing homes can be 
<br/>renovated, construction of new housing units and providing financial support to residents who are not 
<br/></span><span>eligible for home loan to upgrade their homes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Coalition Government is ensuring 
<br/></span><span>that the formalising work is not completed after upgrading but guaranteed homes are also improved to 
<br/>meet the appropriate standards for families and that is safe and resilient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, through you, I would like to ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister if he can also update Parliament on any programmes that complement the informal settlements 
<br/>upgrade programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  parallel  to  the  informal  settlements  upgrading 
<br/>project that is undertaken by the Ministry, we also has two on-going partner pilot projects that will assist 
<br/>to identify new approaches and best practices for the upgrade and development of informal settlements 
<br/>in  Fiji.  These  two  projects  are  the  Fiji  Resilient  Informal  Settlements  (FRIS)  as  well  as  Revitalising 
<br/>Informal Settlements and their Environments commonly known as RISE. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also 
<br/>thankful to our development partners, the New Zealand Government as well as UN-Habitat for supporting 
<br/>these projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, RISE in Fiji involves 12 informal settlement sites.  The project will be carried 
<br/>out in two phases with six sites in each phase. The successful implementation of the RISE programme 
<br/>will enable approximately 3,600 Fijians living in these 12 project sites to recycle their wastewater, harvest 
<br/>rain  water,  create  green  space  for  food  cultivation,  water  cleansing,  restore  waterways  to  reduce 
<br/>vulnerability to flooding and strengthen climate resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, concurrently the Fiji Resilient Informal Settlement Programme is underway 
<br/>with 16 vulnerable families in informal settlements across four urban areas in Lautoka, Sigatoka, Nadi 
<br/>and Lami have been identified. The initial capital works under this project is expected to commence 
<br/>around November to December this year. Upon completion of these projects, it is going to benefit a total 
<br/>of 8,231 families with improved resilience to climate change effects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his detailed response which I 
<br/>truly  appreciate.  In new  Fiji, the  cost  of living has  skyrocketed, even the  cost  of doing business  has 
<br/>increased.  Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament whether the cost of land development has 
<br/>increased as a result of 15 percent VAT?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  even  though  it  is  not  directed  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question but I will try and provide some response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  cost  of  land  development  is  an  issue  that  is  not  only  related  to  VAT,  it  has  other 
<br/>components that lead to the increase in development costs, especially in land development.  It would 
<br/>not be right to say that it is only related to VAT. There are other factors apart from VAT that can lead 
<br/>to development costs.  For example, if subdivision is held and if you look at the cost of consultancy, 
<br/>it has escalated over the past 10 years, as well as development costs associated to the consultancy 
<br/>fees is a good example, and these factors actually lead up to increased development costs around the 
<br/>country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for providing an update on the formalisation of informal settlements.  My question is, can 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  inform  Parliament  whether  the  Government  will  provide  assistance  to 
<br/>tenants if the current tenants are displaced from their settlements?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker,  may I respond to the question.   For the last three 
<br/>weeks, I have been visited by two families who have been evicted from a settlement in Vatuwaqa 
<br/>and it is fortunate that we have been able to assist these families.  I can assure them now that they are 
<br/>going to relocate them to two sites that we have already identified for them. We have a system in 
<br/></span><span>place to assist families that have been evicted or have been asked to relocate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, honourable Kirpal has spoken and also written to 
<br/>say that the statement by the honourable Minister for Agriculture in the morning, right down to the 
<br/>details of the big bulls that he brought from Australia, has satisfied him, so his question will now be 
<br/>omitted from the Order Paper.  We will now move on to the next Oral Question.

<div><span>Promotion of Digital Literacy 
<br/>(Question No.122/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the initiatives that 
<br/>the Ministry has undertaken to promote digital literacy and ensure that students have access 
<br/>to  technology  for  remote  learning,  especially  in  light  of  recent  disruptions  to  traditional 
<br/>education due to the pandemic? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  may  I,  first  of  all,  seek  your  indulgence  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unreservedly  correct  a statement  I made yesterday, that was rebutted by  honourable Hem  Chand.   
<br/>Sir,  my  good  friend,  honourable  Hem  Chand,  took  up  the  acting  head  of  HR  in  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education from January 2020.  Prior to that promotional appointment, he held the position of Director 
<br/>Primary Education.  He may have knowledge of all the appointments including Head of School and 
<br/>I leave it to his conscience of all the appointments that was made during his term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this time to sincerely apologise to his good wife if 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my statement yesterday may have brought harm upon her or her professional reputation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of that, I promise to be more careful in 
<br/>the future with the information provided by staff of the Ministry of Education to be uttered in this 
<br/>august Parliament.  Preferably, I would like to stay away from personal attack and for that, I sincerely 
<br/>regret any lowering of standards according to this august Parliament. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, and honourable Members of this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for that brave position you have taken.  
<br/>Really, honourable Members, you do not have to personalise things.  I want to implore that to each 
<br/>and every one of you.  You may argue as hard as you like in the Chambers, but do not personalise 
<br/>anything and when you leave the Chambers, that is the end of it.  You go as colleagues down to the 
<br/>tea room or where we have our meals and then we share the same table and discuss issues that we 
<br/>can play a part in solving.   I thank you for that brave effort, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question by the honourable 
<br/>Member, the COVID-19 pandemic has, indeed, disrupted traditional education for our children.  This 
<br/>causes a shift  towards remote learning and to  ensure that students  have access  to  technology  and 
<br/>promote digital literacy. There were several initiatives that should have been taken, which have not 
<br/>been done and the Ministry of Education is now working hard to get this platform off the ground for 
<br/>all schools in Fiji.  It is a huge target, given the intent to provide equitable learning for all our children 
<br/>and  the  challenges  of  our  geographical  locations  especially  for  schools  in  the  rural  and  maritime 
<br/>zones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is engaged in various initiatives aimed to ensure 
<br/>that students have access to online learning, through technology which will allow them to engage in 
<br/>effective remote learning.  By promoting digital literacy, educators and policy makers strive to equip 
<br/>students with essential skills for the future while minimizing educational disruptions during crisis, 
<br/>like the COVID-19 pandemic.  The future will demand that our learning platforms are ready for any 
<br/>evolving demands. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the lessons learnt so far, the Ministry of Education has engaged a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>number of platforms to boost e-learning and these include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The “I am digital” initiative that educates students on online safety and this is being carried 
<br/>out in partnership with Save the Children Fiji, engaging student leadership bodies which 
<br/>has been piloted in 10 schools so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Another exciting platform is the "Girls in ICT training project”, which was conducted this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year in collaboration with the Ministry of Trade and Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Another initiative that is being undertaken by the Ministry of Education (MOE) with the 
<br/>University of  the South  Pacific  is the development of  1500  Open Education Resources 
<br/>(OER) for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.  This is 
<br/>a government initiative in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>MOE is also developing an audio-visual studio with relevant stakeholders.  We thank the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Finance  for  the  budget  of  $100,000  in  this  financial  year  which  has  been 
<br/>allocated for this project. The studio will include six recording rooms for the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>school broadcasting programmes; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>production of education channel content; 
<br/>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>airing of education channel lessons; 
<br/>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>live lessons (distance learning) for our rural, remote and maritime schools; and  
<br/>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>airing of recorded lessons.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Government is working to improve the Learning Management System 
<br/>which is currently in place and available through the Government ITC Services, and this will support 
<br/>the existing digital learning platforms being used in Early Childhood Education (ECE) up to Year 13 
<br/>level for all schools in Fiji, to become more interactive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  support  services  made  available  through  device  learning,  MOE  is  currently  having 
<br/>discussions with stakeholders in having an end to end solution for this initiative.  Students will be 
<br/>able to have devices with educational resources and platforms for their personal learning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry to date has increased E-learning connectivity to schools, on an 
<br/>average of 57 percent throughout Fiji.  Following the Ministry’s continued audits to access the current 
<br/></span><span>status in Fiji, the MOE is pushing for an increase in budget in the next financial year, so we can reach 
<br/></span><span>100  percent  connectivity  so  those  children  from  rural,  remote  and  maritime  areas  will  be  able  to 
<br/>browse the web and use technology very different from what most of us had back in the early days. 
<br/>This requires a collaboration with internet service providers and it is something that the Ministry of 
<br/>Education is pushing to ensure that we are able to address the E-learning shortfalls currently existing, 
<br/>due to internet connectivity issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Could you please update on education via the Walesi platform?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  progressively 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>working on available existing platforms like the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Web-based learning hub in partnership with Telecom Fiji limited. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>School broadcast programs. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Education Channel (Walesi). For this term external examination revision lessons will be aired 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from 5pm to 10pm in the afternoon and evening.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, we have the Ministry of Education Moodle for Heads of Schools and teacher online 
<br/>training.   This is an MOE </span><span>talanoa </span><span>forum for teachers and sharing of resources.  We also have the 
<br/>web-based  learning  hub.    This  is  a  Fiji  Open  Education  Resource  done  in  partnership  with  the 
<br/>Commonwealth of Learning (COL) and provides an open web learning hub where specific subjects 
<br/>can be accessed for learning purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir.  Honourable Minister, you spoke about 
<br/>handing  over  the  possibility  or  you  forecasted  to  hand  over  devices  to  the  students.    Now  that 
<br/>mitigates  inequality,  but  to  access  devices  you  need  data  connection  as  well,  so  how  would  you 
<br/>monitor data misuse, and the misuse of these digital learning devices.  If this would just be temporary 
<br/>for the period they would be in the schools and after that they probably would have to return, how 
<br/>would you monitor the misuse of data provided or the devices provided to the students and if it is 
<br/>given until that timeframe when they are in school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  probably  the  question  is  asking  about  the 
<br/>challenges that we are confronted with as a Ministry of Education.  One of the challenges that has 
<br/>been identified is the lack of resources with students, and also the connectivity to power supply.  We 
<br/>also  have lack of training with  teachers and students  and  even parents  who are necessary  for the 
<br/>support system and ensuring such platforms are in workable arrangements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for apologising for what he said yesterday. In fact, my wife was very disturbed yesterday, so thank 
<br/>you  honourable  Minister  for  that.  My  question  to  you  is,  can  the  honourable  Minister  inform 
<br/>Parliament whether teacher training institutions have incorporated digital training in their course? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>supplementary question. This is part of the items that will be dealt with in the National Education 
<br/>Summit that will be convened next week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That brings us to the end of the Oral Questions.  Before you proceed to the 
<br/>Written Question, honourable Members may I remind each and  every one of us about the line of 
<br/>sight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the honourable Minister for Education was on the floor, hopefully honourable Minister 
<br/>for Sugar, could have gone the other way around to take your seat rather than trying to come across 
<br/>this line sight from the Mr. Speaker, to whoever is on the floor.  I say this out of respect because that 
<br/></span><span>is the kind of decorum that we observe and that we nurture very much in this Parliament. It might 
<br/></span><span>affect you as you stand and wait but that is the rule of Parliament and I hope this reminder will serve 
<br/>us well.
