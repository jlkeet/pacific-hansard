<div><span>2023 PARLIAMENT SITTING CALENDAR – AMENDMENT OF 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Parliament approves the amended Sitting Calendar as previously circulated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, as all
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1795 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members would know that Parliament had already passed the Sitting Calendar for 2023 
<br/>during the Sitting of Parliament earlier in the year, as well as an amendment during the July Sitting 
<br/>of Parliament after deliberations at the Business Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As has been the practice that the Business Committee had agreed that should there be a dire 
<br/>need  to  re-adjust  some  of  the  sittings  that  this  would  be  subsequently  tabled  in  Parliament  for 
<br/>endorsement.  So,  in  essence,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  motion  is  seeking  Parliament’s  approval  to  allow 
<br/>flexibilities for two requests:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first is for  a  deferment of the second week of Sitting  for this September Sitting to 
<br/>another time to be decided later. The request needs the endorsement of the House to enable 
<br/>the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  to  attend  and  participate  at  the  United  Nations  General 
<br/>Assembly in New York.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second amendment to the Sitting Calendar, Mr. Speaker is in the November Sitting and 
<br/>that is to bring the second week of sitting of Parliament that was earlier scheduled for the 
<br/>week of 27</span><span>th</span><span> November to the 1</span><span>st</span><span> December to be brought forward to the week of the 14</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>November to 17</span><span>th</span><span> November.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  reason  for  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  to  allow  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Fiji 
<br/>Government delegation upon the invite of the honourable Prime Minister to attend the invitation of 
<br/>the COP Meeting in Dubai.  This is an important meeting, Mr. Speaker as you would know, Climate 
<br/>Change affects  the Pacific  Island States, especially  our vulnerability as small  Island States to  the 
<br/>devastating power of natural disasters, tropical cyclones, floods, etc and we are amongst the most 
<br/>susceptible and expose to Climate Change impacts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, Mr Speaker Sir, given the salient  points that I have put  to the floor of this 
<br/>House, I do seek the indulgence of the Members to support this motion and I commend this motion 
<br/>before Parliament to prove the proposed amendments to the sitting week as per the new calendar that 
<br/>is  in  front  of  all  Members  today.  I  thank  you  for  the  support  of  the  Members  of  the  Business 
<br/>Committee that have agreed to it so we hope that Parliament will do the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor I have a list of speakers that have been identified by the honourable Whips 
<br/>and for the Government, it is the honourable Prime Minister that would like to take the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Opposition, it is the honourable Hem Chand, honourable Ketan Lal and to be rounded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>off by honourable Koya so I will now offer the floor to the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to support this motion to amend the 
<br/>Sitting Calendar that have been circulated to us because of some obligations that particularly in my 
<br/>case, I did not plan on the United Nations General Assembly that had come up later in our term and 
<br/>after the original sitting plan had been formulated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, in a later sitting where both I and the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>away for the COP Conference and we have also had to ask for those changes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament for responding to some of these urgent calls from the Cabinet, particularly, from me as 
<br/>the Prime Minister.  I also thank Parliament, honourable Members and you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 
<br/>favourably considering these late requests.   With those, I support the motion before Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  share  my  views  on  the  motion  before 
<br/>Parliament.  It is imperative to highlight the potential consequences of reducing the number of sitting 
<br/>weeks in a parliamentary calendar.  While certain benefits may be sought through this approach, it is 
<br/>crucial  to  carefully  assess  the  negative  impacts  that  such  measures  may  have  on  democratic 
<br/>processes, representation and effective governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  beginning  of  each  year,  before  the  commencement  of  the  new 
<br/>Parliament  session,  the  Government  releases  the  sitting  calendar,  which  is  done  after  careful 
<br/>planning.  The Parliament Sitting Calendar guides the honourable Members of Parliament to develop 
<br/>their own personal calendar so that Members of Parliament can also attend to their delegated duties.  
<br/>The parliamentary sitting calendar is a great tool, not just for Members of Parliament, but also for 
<br/>anyone who interacts  with  the honourable Members of Parliament and those who take interest  in 
<br/>politics.  People look forward to Parliament Sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  reduced  number  of  sitting  weeks  in  the  parliamentary  calendar  can  impede  the  vital 
<br/>democratic principle of accountability.  We were supposed to have two weeks of Parliament sitting 
<br/>in July and September, but it had been reduced to one week.  The total sitting days, which was planned 
<br/>at the beginning of the year, was 49 days and now it has been reduced to 33 days.  That means, the 
<br/>sitting days have been reduced by 6 days, which is equivalent to more than three weeks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the motives behind the reduction in the sitting days.  I 
<br/>suggest that honourable Ministers give priority to Parliament sitting, and where possible, delegate 
<br/>technical staff from the Ministry to attend overseas meetings and engagements.  Parliament siting 
<br/>days should not be compromised because Parliament has very important roles where important issues 
<br/>are  debated,  Government  spending  is  discussed,  laws  are  made  and  amended  and  Opposition 
<br/>examines and challenges the work of the Government through questioning and debating.  With these 
<br/>words, I do not support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Hem Chand? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my apologies, I support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- After having heard you in your first comment, I wanted to state clearly in 
<br/>this august Parliament that it took a lot of us in the Business Committee to agree to the very issues 
<br/>that you have raised here.  It is lucky that we have the honourable Leader of the Opposition, together 
<br/>with honourable Koya and honourable Usamate, who had been in the Cabinet Office for a very long 
<br/></span><span>time.  They gave their superb advice that the month of September is a definite for the UN.  If we take 
<br/></span><span>this to the members of our staff, we will just be passing the buck here.  It stops with us here and when 
<br/>a request comes from the honourable Prime Minister, we have to accommodate that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In so doing, we reluctantly agreed to this change of the timetable because we are also used to 
<br/>something that we have agreed that sticks but, again, nothing is set in stone here.  It is not a blueprint 
<br/>calendar because it is subject to change.  When issue arises to make changes, we will just have to 
<br/>address it head-on and what I would like to share with you, honourable Members, was the very thing 
<br/>that we discussed in the Business Committee. It took a while to get an agreement, especially with 
<br/></span><span>your Whip.  Honourable Maharaj is always sounding out the very thing that you said honourable 
<br/></span><span>Chand - 2 weeks, the number of sittings in a year - is all part of the plan from January when this 
<br/>comes out, but we have changed this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This has been changing and we bear your indulgence in that, but we have been guided by the 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition just to ensure, through his advice, that we have taken on board the Leader 
<br/>of the Government in Parliament to advise the honourable Prime Minister that September is a “no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1797 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>go” area for us because that is when the United Nations sits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have heard from the honourable Prime Minister that he will be going to Dubai again, 
<br/>that has just been finalised too and apart from that, the other meetings together with the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition.  Please, bear with us on that, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I wish to withdraw my opportunity to speak 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as you have already explained the reasons behind these things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir, a very short contribution.  Honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>we do understand very well with respect the commitments that you have and also with respect to the 
<br/>United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the Parliament must also know is that the UNGA meeting is actually set for a particular 
<br/>time  always  is  the  last  week  in  September.    I  urge  the  honourable  Members  of  the  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament  to  ask  their  staff  to  pull  up  their  socks  because  I  think  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition had actually warned everyone earlier that that week is dedicated for UNGA and nothing 
<br/>was done about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It came at a later stage, we understand that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why we are agreeing to 
<br/>it.  But I think sometimes we do not (speaking for both sides) listen and at times when you are offered 
<br/>good advice from us, please, listen because that is important.  It is about Fiji at the UNGA, it is about 
<br/>Fiji at the Climate Conference and I think that is very, very important.  I think someone dropped their 
<br/>lunchbox, obviously, at the Ministry and that is not anything bad with respect to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, it is someone at the office that did not actually do their job properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Sir, I think enough has been said with respect to the number of days but just 
<br/>the last point, Sir, next time, I think the request was made from the government with respect to having 
<br/>two weeks, et cetera, we have canvased all of that at the Business Committee.  It is a good idea that 
<br/>we have the two weeks, maybe for the next year’s Calendar which might come up sooner rather than 
<br/>later.    At  end  of  the  day,  we  need  to  ensure  that  we  get  our  calendar  right  because  travelling  is 
<br/>important.  We have lost quite a number of days in Parliament. I know Mr. Speaker, Sir has said, 
<br/>look, utilise it well, the Committee has considered et cetera, all of that is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, Sir, ask the staff to ensure that the honourable Prime Minister’s calendar is correct 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right at the start of the year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Members for your contribution 
<br/>and  I  especially  thank  our  Members  from  the  Opposition  for  supporting this  motion  and  also  for 
<br/>withdrawing contributions upon what you have shared, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  take  note  of  the  improvements  that  need  to  be  made  in  terms  of  setting  the  next 
<br/>Parliamentary Calendar.  I will look forward to the Business Committee of having certainly a more 
<br/>robust and mutual exchanges for the next Sitting Calendar whether two weeks is suited or whether 
<br/>one week and more frequently that is something we are certainly always open to and we look forward 
<br/></span><span>to that in the setting of the next Calendar.  I want to thank honourable Members for supporting the 
<br/></span><span>motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, in addition to what has been said, I forgot to mention 
<br/>what was raised by the honourable Leader of Opposition in the Business Committee and that is for 
<br/>us to do a late booking in that month at the United Nations in New York.  The hotel rates are really 
<br/>sky high.  I think the previous Government paid a price for that when they summoned him to attend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>1798 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the rate that they paid was about $14,000 or something just for those few days of meeting at the 
<br/>United Nations, so it is a very costly and expensive thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
