<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.  -  Honourable  Members,  I  now  intend  to  adjourn  Parliament  for  tea  but 
<br/>before doing so, I seek your indulgence.  I have two more speakers from the Government side and I 
<br/>have  seven  from  the  Opposition  side  that  have  been  listed.  So,  I  will  perhaps  ask  that  since  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister has taken the lead in the batting order, I would like to strongly suggest 
<br/>that  I  will  be  naming  the  five  or  six  honourable  Opposition  Members  to  bat  as  well  without  any 
<br/>alternate Member from the Government accept after the fifth and that is where I will call the name 
<br/>of the Deputy Prime Minister honourable Biman Prasad, honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Koya 
<br/>I will then ask Deputy Prime Minister honourable Gavoka to be last speaker on the motion. I hope 
<br/>that speaks well with each and every one of you, honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now adjourn Parliament for tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.03 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
