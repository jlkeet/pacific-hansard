<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE  
<br/>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion that is before the Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will say that I am mindful of Standing Order 62(4)(d) where 
<br/>the words that you utter may incite racial violence or racial “ill-feelings” is  the word.  I have no 
<br/>intention at all and I ask honourable Members even on this side if you hear me saying something that 
<br/>is close to violating that rule, please raise a Point of Order so that I can withdraw. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all want a country that is united.  A country that is prosperous, peaceful, 
<br/>the foundation for that country is stability, security and safety.  And to be in a country that is totally 
<br/>united, very prosperous, totally peaceful, where the citizens are safe and secure and there is stability 
<br/>all around, is a dream;  perhaps a utopian dream.  Because if we look around the world, there is none. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The closest, in my view, is the definition of heaven in the Christian Bible where everything 
<br/>is good.  But it is a dream that we carry as the Government, as a Prime Minister, I am sure as the 
<br/>Speaker  of  the  Parliament,  as  members  of  the  Opposition;  a  dream  that  we  carry  as  a  father, 
<br/>grandfather, mother, grandmother.  It is a dream that we carry even though utopian, but we carry it 
<br/>all the same.  I would suggest that it is a dream that we should never ever discard.  It has to be there 
<br/>because by it being there, we worked towards it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As we all know, modern nations are born out of some difficult circumstances, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  The modern America was born out of the civil war, very much flavours their political landscape 
<br/>right now, and very much coming to the fore (left and right).  We also had the circumstances where 
<br/>the modern Fiji was born and Mr. Speaker, people can take it as far back as to the myth that we 
<br/>migrated from Africa, we had this period where we were colonised, we were offered to be colonised. 
<br/>There was this period where we became independent and dominant of the Commonwealth, we were 
<br/>declared a Republic out of a </span><span>coup </span><span>and this is how the events that have saved us and that is the nation 
<br/>that we are today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But as we navigate through and every nation navigates through, through the circumstances 
<br/>and the events that come, problems begin to surface.  This morning we heard the problem that we are 
<br/></span><span>facing about child abuse, problem that we should deal with, there is this problem of drugs, yesterday 
<br/></span><span>I heard honourable Tuinaceva talking about the carnage on our roads. These are problems that surface 
<br/>as  we  build  this  nation,  utopian  idea  that  it  is  the  best  nation  surfaces  any  risk  and  these  are  the 
<br/>problems that Government deal with.  But in all nations and almost all societies, there are deep-rooted 
<br/>problems that exist and regardless even of those deep-rooted problems, we still have that utopian 
<br/>dream that our country is peaceful, safe and secure, good for me now, good for my children and good 
<br/>for my grandchildren.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  motion  before  us  defines  the  problem  as,  and  I  quote:  “conflicting 
<br/></span><span>statements  and  utterances  regarding  motives  behind  the  political  upheaval”.    That  is  the  way  the 
<br/>motion is worded and the end state that it desires is that closer and healing for Fiji is achieved and 
<br/>permanently  put  to  rest.    The  way  the  motion  is  structured  does  not  show  a  big  problem,  it  is 
<br/>conflicting statements of events, how do you solve it?  Deconflict the conflicting statements but I 
<br/>think we all know, what the problem is.

<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a Western concept.  We have our 
<br/>own and you understand it very well.  For us the way we forgive begins from a perpetrator, he goes 
<br/>to the person that he hurt and asks for forgiveness, </span><span>matanigasau</span><span>, </span><span>bulubulu</span><span> and ours in the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>is 
<br/>a ritual.    It  is  a ritual  when we go  and ask for forgiveness,  never starts  from  the person that  was 
<br/>victimised to use the word, it always starts from the perpetrator, I know that I did wrong and then I 
<br/>go and do what I have to do according to our tradition and customs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our culture when that is done you forgive and forget.  An amazing part of our Fijian culture 
<br/>is  the  ability,  after  all  is  said  and  when  that  ritual  is  performed,  we  forgive  and  we  forget.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we talk about reconciliation, we talk about forgiveness.  I will tell you a very quick 
<br/>story and my reaction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  and  I  was  watching  the  live  church  service  that  was  done  spearheaded  by  the 
<br/>Methodist Church where the Church sought forgiveness from the descendants of the Girmitiya</span><span>,</span><span> and 
<br/>I think, </span><span>Qaselevu</span><span> honourable Penioni Ravunawa was also there.  I watched that and the exchanges 
<br/>and the words that were said.  I am a member of the Methodist Church, I am the </span><span>iVakatawa </span><span>in the 
<br/>Church, and when the Methodist Church had their Conference lately, when they had the elections, 
<br/>and  then  when  the  Secretary  General  was  elected,  and  they  overlooked  the  descendant  of  the 
<br/>Girmitiya, I told myself “no”, what a wonderful opportunity to show that forgiveness that you sought 
<br/>from them, because all these years, the Deputy Secretary General has always been the next Secretary 
<br/>General  and  the  optics  to  me  was  so  wrong.    I  told  myself,  “Man,  you  just  lost  a  wonderful 
<br/>opportunity to really show that forgiveness.”  It is up to them, I will say, and I have no say in it, but 
<br/>I am just talking about the optics and my reaction to it.  I am talking about the optics for me and I 
<br/>know that they have their own way of doing that.  I am not saying that the election is wrong, I am 
<br/>just saying that that optics knowing that they had done that forgiveness church service before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem we have is the divide that exists in our society, the divide along 
<br/>racial lines, and now there is even a bigger divide along political lines.  There is that divide and I 
<br/>think the big task that we have is to try and narrow the gap as much as we can and we keep working 
<br/>on it and pull it together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2000, it was the first time I heard this word ‘ethnonationalism’, said to me by an officer, 
<br/>who is now doing the review of the GCC, Colonel Baledrokadroka.  We were talking about why that 
<br/>is happening and he was sharing with me his thoughts along this idea of ethnonationalism, and why 
<br/>he thought that it was a big root cause of what was happening.  That word stuck with me and I studied 
<br/>and read in to those that know things about ethnonationalism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think that if you want our nation to come together as one, and we have proved, as mentioned 
<br/>by the honourable Kiran, the times when we can show that we unite when there is a rugby game on, 
<br/>we breathe as one and our heart beat beats as one; when a big disaster hits, we breathe as one and our 
<br/>heart beat beats as one.  We can and it can be done, but it was only in those circumstances that just 
<br/>happened  in  Fiji,  and  this  nation  that  utopian  dream  that  we  are  dreaming  about  this  nation  is 
<br/>happening.  We are getting there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had three Olympic gold medals, this tiny nation of Fiji: one in the Paralympics, two in 
<br/></span><span>the main Olympics. I think the honourable Prime Minister wears one of the highest medal decorations 
<br/></span><span>from  the French Foreign Legion,  and that is because of the work that we do in  the peacekeeping 
<br/>arena, we are considered one of the best in the world, this tiny nation best in the world when it comes 
<br/>to peacekeeping. We are getting there, we are building but I think that we need to tackle the deep-
<br/>rooted problems that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are equal and for me equal in the eyes of God starts from there, equality because we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1807 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>equal in the eyes of God.  If that is the start point of our wanting to continue to build and working on 
<br/>that very utopian dream I think we will get there and I have no doubt that we will get there.  I was 
<br/>amazed at the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he refers to him, “I am a British Hindu” not a 
<br/>Indo-British or a British of Indian decent. That is just the way he introduced himself - I am a British 
<br/>Hindu.   It is equality Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we have the truth and reconciliation Commission you 
<br/>are opening up wounds of the past, it needs to be opened up, it needs to be treated so that it can heal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to caution Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as we try and open the wounds of the past, treat 
<br/>it and get it healed and we must make sure that we are not creating wounds now.  Equality that we 
<br/>strive for can be dealt with policies, policies that unite, policies that bring us together, policies that 
<br/>leave no person behind regardless of who he or she is.  It can be dealt with laws that deal with us 
<br/>equally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I dream of a country not for me really, that utopian dream is not for me, this is mine, it is for 
<br/>my grandchildren, my children.  I am grateful enough to see their faces and God has been favourable 
<br/>to me to allow me to live this long to see my grandchildren’s faces but I can only dream of the country 
<br/>of the Fiji that we live in right now and I have a dream of that country that I talked about where it 
<br/>does not matter where they come from, it does not matter that they come from the smallest island in 
<br/>Vatoa, it is closer to Tonga than to Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It does not matter that he is a Lauan, he lives or she lives in that country and on merit and the 
<br/>only  thing that is  important  for him or her is  to  work hard and live your life.  We can build that 
<br/>country, one day it will happen.  We have to be tough, I think we have to be brave enough to face 
<br/>those deep rooted problems that plague our society, we have to be brave enough, it might cost us our 
<br/>political career but be brave enough to tackle it and put in place those policies, those laws that bring 
<br/>us together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I talked about political divide and I mentioned that it is widening, this is why I say it, when 
<br/>we  see  that  most  of  the  things  that  were  put  in  place  by  the  government  of  the  past  has  been 
<br/>dismantled, it means also that the 200,000 people that voted for us you know I am feeling bad also 
<br/>because that is the reason why they voted and so our divide widens now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I plead that if you want and work on that utopian dream of this country that is prosperous, 
<br/>peaceful and stable, good for my grandchildren, good for your grandchildren we have to be tough 
<br/>and face those deep-rooted problems that we have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to honourable Tuicolo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a short contribution towards the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, why is there an urgency in the establishment of such Commission in the face of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a socially cultural sick society? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, are you aware that around 80 percent of deaths in Fiji this year alone are caused 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and those numbers are still growing?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, according to the Fiji Sun Editorial on 20</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 the number of new HIV 
<br/>infections has surged by a staggering 260 percent since 2010 making Fiji the second fastest country 
<br/>in the Asia Pacific with the HIV epidemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, teenage pregnancy has totalled to 1,279 from 2018 to 2021 between the ages of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>1808 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13 and 19.  According to the Women Crisis Centre, children both boys and girls under 11 years old 
<br/>are indulging in sexual activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, sexual offences numbers from the DPP’s office is very shocking with 768 cases 
<br/>in the year 2022. The youngest accused being a 12-year-old boy and the youngest victim being a 3 
<br/>year old girl. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on 27</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2015 Fiji was ranked fourth in percentage for searches of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>word ‘porn’ and ninth for searchers of the word ‘pornography’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  cannot  blame  children  and  youth  alone.  The  parent  must  bear  a  bigger 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibility of what is happening in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  </span><span>Bible</span><span>  clearly  states  in  Proverbs  22:6  for  parents  to  train  their  children  while  they  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>young. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we need to educate our adult population.  We need to spend money in educating 
<br/>our adult population on parenting.  According to the </span><span>Signs of the Times</span><span> monthly magazine dated on 
<br/>24</span><span>th</span><span> November, 1889: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If  parents  decide  to  teach  their  children  self-control  they  must  form  the  habit 
<br/>themselves.    The  scolding  and  fault  finding  of  parents  encourage  a  hasty  passionate 
<br/>temper in the child”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, how far back should we go on this reconciliation agenda?  The reconciliation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>must not be limited only to one event or period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  let  us  go  back  to  the  Girmit  era  when  the  last  ship  S.S.  Sutlej  carrying  888 
<br/>labourers arrived on November, 1916.  Some 42 ships made 87 voyages and carried about 60,000 
<br/>labourers destined for the Colony of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all know when they were in the sugarcane plantation, they were treated like 
<br/>animals, beaten, poorly housed, meagre pay and long hours of work, poor medical facilities and poor 
<br/>educational arrangements for their children, shortage of women amongst labourers created a huge 
<br/>social problem, being confined like sardine in the ship laid to the breaking of the caste system and 
<br/>emergence of the Jahaji Bhai System. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, after all those sacrifices and suffering the event of 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1987 Fiji’s first 
<br/>military coup the Indo-Fijians were badly brutalised. This pain has traumatised the lives and minds 
<br/>of Indo-Fijians. This shattered the economy of Fiji.  Many fled the shores of Fiji to settle in Australia, 
<br/>New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America.  This began the flights of capital and skills 
<br/>from Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, sincere thanks to the FijiFirst Government which has given all Fijians a common 
<br/>name and sense of belonging and respect. Fijians of Indian descent are no longer treated as </span><span>vulagi </span><span>under 
<br/></span><span>the 2013 Constitution, they continue to play a vital role in the economy of this country. We must also 
<br/></span><span>consider the unfair treatment done to our people in Navosa during the little war in 1876 where many of 
<br/>our people and chiefs were either killed or exiled to the other parts of Fiji. A good example are the people 
<br/>of  Colo-West  who  are  in  Koro,  perhaps  this  is  one  of  the  areas  where  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission should start from. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1809 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we must also remember that in 1944 there were 13 provinces in mainland Viti Levu. 
<br/>During the reorganisation of that year Nadi, Lautoka</span><span>, </span><span>Colo-North, Colo-East and Colo-West Provinces 
<br/>were  scrapped  and  dropped.  This  is  one  of  the  biggest  blunders  and  injustices  done  to  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>administration in the Western part of Viti Levu. Why combine the Nadi Province, Lautoka Province and 
<br/>Ba Province together with vast land and natural resources and keeping Rewa and Tailevu intact? Perhaps, 
<br/>it was purposely done to undermine or weaken the West.  While the Eastern bloc are unaffected, the ill-
<br/>conceived westerners continue to be satisfied with the present arrangement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we in Navosa are still asking whatever government to come into power to release 
<br/>us from  Nadroga.   More  than 20  </span><span>tabua</span><span>  have been  used since 1987 to request for the  separation.  On 
<br/>Thursday,  27</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  1999,  Navosa  Province  have  been  granted  to  become  a  separate  and  fifteenth 
<br/>province of Fiji. The Permanent Secretary of Fijian Affairs that time, the late Ratu Meli Bainimarama 
<br/>assured in Navosa chiefs that he would work on other aspects and requirements before the declaration of 
<br/>Navosa as the fifteenth province.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are now still eagerly waiting for the Emancipation Day.  That is where the Truth 
<br/>and  Reconciliation  Commission  should  focus  on.  It  appears  that  this  motion  is  geared  towards  a 
<br/>camouflage of a sinister agenda of an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> utranationalist propaganda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Come on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.N.  TUICOLO.-    Mr.  Speaker,  we  should  not  regard  this  proposed  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission  as  relevant  for  Fiji  just  because  it  has  been  used  in  other  countries  with  very  different 
<br/>settings.  Do we really need to establish this Truth and Reconciliation Commission when the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government through the 2013 Constitution has already bandaged and healed the wound?  What we are 
<br/>doing today is just re-opening the wound. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What happened to 2000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I beg you please…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- ... leave everything as it is because the healing has already taken place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are touching a very sensitive topic and I ask for your 
<br/></span><span>co-operation, let us hear them up. That is the very heart of what is being introduced here.  Please let us 
<br/></span><span>show some maturity and let us listen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the  opportunity to contribute to the 
<br/>motion on hand.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, what is our priority at this time?  Putting 
<br/>bread on the table, bus fare increases, trying ways to decrease it, the high cost of living for our society or 
<br/>our people, crime is on the rise, farmers are struggling with the high cost of inputs and mass exodus of 
<br/>our population to greener pastures which is Australia and New Zealand and others. These are the key 
<br/>important priorities I feel that we as representatives of the people need to discuss and try to resolve it, not 
<br/></span><span>using this much needed resources into establishing a Commission which does nothing to address the basic 
<br/></span><span>needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why do we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission? These Commissions are set up 
<br/>after a period of oppression or conflict. There has not been a conflict recently. Why do we need to 
<br/>set up a Commission now? Which period are we discussing, are we only discussing the first coup, 
<br/>the  second  </span><span>coup</span><span>  or  everything  from  Independence  until  now  or  are  we  discussing  issues  prior  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>1810 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independence? It is a can of worms, if you open one, everything will spill out, there are a lot of things 
<br/>need to be discussed, so we need to set our priorities right. How many times are we going to say 
<br/>sorry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If one’s apology is sincere and genuine, then one sincere apology is good enough; looks like 
<br/>all these apologies which we have been getting is just a show.  If it was a sincere apology, that should 
<br/>have been enough, but it is not. If you talk about the events of the first and second coups, a lot of us 
<br/>have lost our livelihoods, our dear ones and to some extent our identity. Do people think that simply 
<br/>setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a simple sorry will set it right?  No, it will 
<br/>not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I personally lost my dad because of the </span><span>coups</span><span>.  No matter how many commissions you set, 
<br/>no matter how reconciliations you do, that gap in my life will remain and no amount of sorry will fill 
<br/>that gap. We cannot reconcile if some of the citizens of Fiji are referred to or called visitors, not 
<br/>matter in which language it is called, that is not reconciliation. We cannot achieve reconciliation if 
<br/>equal  employment  opportunities  is  not  provided  to  all  citizens.  One  has  to  look  at  the  recent 
<br/>appointments, it clearly spells out, I do not know why people are so silent about it. Reconciliation 
<br/>will never be achieved if policies are leaned towards one particular ethnic community or a division.  
<br/>Policies should be set to benefit all citizens of Fiji, not only one particular group or ethnicity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  a  lot  of  ways  we  can  reconcile  without  setting  up  a  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission.  If one wants to reconcile in this society then we should follow the Constitution of Fiji.  
<br/>A lot of decisions, a lot of actions are being taken that does not concur with the Constitution. This 
<br/>Constitution is what bridges the gap in the society and recognises every citizen equal.  If one is to 
<br/>genuinely  reconcile,  then  your  actions  on  the  ground  should  be  more  important  than  what  the 
<br/>commissions or establishments we want to make.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is human nature that if one approaches or touches a scorpion, he has to 
<br/>take care, he has to be very careful, he needs to understand.  By nature, the scorpion will sting, and 
<br/>for  us  to  reconcile,  the  attitude  of  the  scorpion  needs  to  go.    Before  sitting,  Sir,  I  would  like  to 
<br/>conclude by quoting from the same play the honourable Prime Minister has quoted, the last words 
<br/>Julius Caesar said before he was stabbed to death </span><span>“Et tu Brute?” </span><span>which</span><span> </span><span>means, “You too Brutus?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my views on the motion before the 
<br/>House.    At  the  outset,  let  me  reiterate  that  what  we  need  in  this  country  is  not  a  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission, but political maturity, adherence to the rule of law, compliance with the 
<br/></span><span>2013 Constitution and recognising that Fiji is a multi-racial and multi-religious country.  Constant 
<br/></span><span>echoes of divide is made by the leaders who should be healing the divide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it hurts when Indo-Fijians are called </span><span>vulagi.  </span><span>Is this reconciliation?  Where 
<br/>is political maturity?  We have heard the honourable Prime Minister apologising to Girmityas and he 
<br/>has done it many times.  After barely a few months later, he calls the same people he apologised to 
<br/>as </span><span>vulagi.  </span><span>The main reason is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we came after.  So, the whole debate is, who came 
<br/>first?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People who came here have passed away.  I did not come with my great grandparents.  My 
<br/></span><span>parents were born here, I was born here.  Apologies will not heal or reconcile, and a living example 
<br/>is our honourable Prime Minister, he has been apologising but doing the opposite.  Words and actions 
<br/>matter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have heard from honourable Naupoto, after the Methodist Church 
<br/>sought forgiveness, they did the opposite.  It is the words and actions that matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Constitution provides all Fijians irrespective of one’s race,

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023

<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1811 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>religion, cast or creed, it gives us equal citizenry.  And then whatever I have discussed now is the 
<br/>same government that brings in a motion to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  This is 
<br/>where I feel that as leaders, we lack maturity, we are not responsible for the words that we say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  look  around  the  world,  there  are  a  few  countries  that  have 
<br/>established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Why are few countries?   It is because they 
<br/>had very serious issues of human rights violation, civil wars, atrocities, persecutions, child abuse and 
<br/>very serious social injustices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whatever it  was,  the Truth  and Reconciliation  Commission  was established for a specific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purpose to investigate a single matter. Below are few examples: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>South Africa - to transition from apartheid to democracy. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Peru - human rights abusers suffered during internal arm conflicts of 1980s and 1990s. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Sierra Leone - addressing war crimes and human rights abuses during the civil war. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Timor-Leste - human rights abuses committed during the Indonesian occupation. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mauritius - to determine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indentured labourers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Nepal - investigation of disappeared persons.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Liberia - violence and human rights abuses during Liberia’s civil war.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question I have are outlined below: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Are we going to back to 1879, the commencement of Girmit as Mauritius did? 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Are we going to go back to the first coup in Fiji in 1987?  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Are we going to go back to the overthrow of the Chaudhry government in 2000? 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Mutiny in 2000 or the overthrow of the Qarase government in 2006?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question is, why are we trying to open the wounds, Mr. Speaker Sir? In some cases, as 
<br/>the saying goes, time heals.  I believe that establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is 
<br/>more to deviate attention from the real issues facing the country – the underlying issues of economic 
<br/>inequality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as leaders, we should be focusing mainly on policies where we can grow 
<br/>our economy and we can look after the disadvantaged in our community. We should be focusing on 
<br/>economic growth and developing policies that will assist in bringing in equality in this country. If we 
<br/></span><span>are  able  to  achieve  that  then  we  will  not  have  such  issues  that  we  a  discussing  today.  In  a  small 
<br/></span><span>country like Fiji, establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission gives a signal to the world that 
<br/>we do have some serious issues. This will have a negative impact on investor confidence or even 
<br/>consumer confidence, having huge impact on our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  main  challenges  of  establishing  a  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission  is  the  danger  of  political  manipulation.  The  Government  might  use  it  to  selectively 
<br/>investigate  the  political  opponents  while  protecting  their  own  interest  which  can  undermine  the 
<br/>impartiality and credibility of such a Commission and there are many cases available which talks 
<br/>about  impacts,  effectiveness  of  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  and  it  is  advisable  that  we 
<br/>should be on top of what has happened in other countries before we even adopt this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it can also lead to the provision of a form of amnesty or leniency for those 
<br/>who  have  committed  serious  crimes.  This  Coalition  Government  continues  to  disregard  the 
<br/>Constitution, the rule of law. They are pursuing their agenda without proper legal procedures which 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>poses significant threat to the stability and integrity of the nation and this is what we all should be 
<br/>focusing on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission often rely on voluntary testimony 
<br/>which means that not all individuals with relevant information may come forward. Some perpetrators 
<br/>may choose not to testify leading to an incomplete picture of the truth. Witnesses may be afraid to 
<br/>speak openly due to fear of the reprisals, victims will also have a high expectation that the Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission will provide them with justice or compensation but if these expectations 
<br/>are not met it can lead to disillusionment and disappointment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must pause and ask ourselves whether Fiji has that level of human rights 
<br/>violation, abuses, atrocities and political persecutions.   Our issues are not as extensive and serious 
<br/>as we have seen in countries where Truth and Reconciliation Commissions have been established. 
<br/>What Fiji needs is further strengthening of the institutions that are there to protect all Fijians from 
<br/>human  rights  abuses,  racial  and  other  discrimination.    We  must  make  this  institution  totally 
<br/>independent of any political interference. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a Constitution that guarantees our fundamental rights and recognise 
<br/>all  citizens  as  equal.  We  should  work  towards  political  maturity  and  acceptance.    Finally,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, if you want to achieve a better nation for our children and our grandchildren, we need 
<br/>to address the underlying issues.  The underlying issues in my view is lack of political maturity and 
<br/>economic inequality.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is an important motion that 
<br/>we have in Parliament as you earlier mentioned it touches our heart and in totality, we cannot deal 
<br/>with it with our own physical strength.  I read to us a scripture passage from the Bible - Philippians 
<br/>2: 3-4: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.  Rather, in humility value others 
<br/>above yourselves, not looking at your own interests but each of you to the interests of the 
<br/>others.  Humility allows us to approach reconciliation with a willingness to listen, to learn, 
<br/>to acknowledge our shortcoming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  for  me  personally  when  I  am  putting  my  head  around  this  motion 
<br/>presented  before  Parliament,  in  my  personal  opinion,  it is  poorly  worded and  it  can  have  several 
<br/>immediate  and  long-term  effects.    Poorly  worded  motions  can  often  bring  confusion  and 
<br/></span><span>misinterpretation.  It can also give us a difficult time as Parliamentarians, to fully understand the 
<br/></span><span>intended purpose or implications of the proposed motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  confusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  result  in  honourable  Members  voting  in  favour  or 
<br/>against something that we do not fully grasp.  If a motion is poorly worded it may also fail to meet 
<br/>the necessary procedural requirements.  First and foremost, the honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>due  to  its  unclear  and  ambiguous  nature,  lacks  to  support  that  can  undermine  the  credibility  of 
<br/>parliament, credibility of Government and weaken its ability to effectively advance its agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  extreme  cases,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  poorly  worded  motions  can  raise  legal  and  legislative 
<br/></span><span>concerns.  If the language used in a motion is vague or contradictory it may create legal loopholes of 
<br/>conflict with existing laws. This can lead to legal challenge and costly revision to rectify the issues, 
<br/>and also public perception and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A poorly worded motion can impact the Government’s image and perception. It may be seen 
<br/>as a sign of incompetence or negligence.  It can erode public trust and confidence in Government’s 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1813 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ability  to  govern  effectively.  It’s  an  important  juncture  that  we  are  in  this  afternoon  -  we  can  be 
<br/>setting precedents.  In looking at the motion itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it requires careful consideration 
<br/>of language, the legal requirements, potential interpretations or the consequences of this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Fijian  Constitution  of  2013  includes  provision  of  truth  and 
<br/>reconciliation.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  decision  to  establish  a  commission  for  truth  and 
<br/>reconciliation is often based on a specific circumstance of the country or the community.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our Constitution gives Rights to all Fijians. We are all equal in the eyes of God 
<br/>and also in the eyes of the Law and we are united in this country for  a common purpose. Every Fijian 
<br/>is  equal.    We  are  equal  in  accessing  justice  through  the  courts.    We  are  equal  with  our  Right  to 
<br/>equality and freedom from discrimination. That is the basis of the 2013 Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If it is already there, duplicating a legislation, it can have a detrimental effects to our nation.  
<br/>In duplication a legislation can lead to redundancy and confusion within the legal framework.  It may 
<br/>create  over-lapping  provision  and  inconsistent  legal  interpretation,  causing  difficulties  in 
<br/>implementing and enforcing the law effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, duplicating a legislation with a specific purpose or significant amendment 
<br/>can be a waste of resources and time.  It needs careful consideration in order to avoid under-mining 
<br/>the  principles  of  legal  certainty.  Regarding  to  the  proposed  and  reconciliation  Bill  tabling  in 
<br/>Parliament today, Mr. Speaker Sir, it is essential to once again evaluate its objectives, provisions, the 
<br/>potential impact before concluding whether it constitutes duplicative legislation or not, or if the Bill 
<br/>aims  to  address  specific  gaps  or  issues  that  are  not  already  covered  in  the  existing  legislation.  
<br/>Ultimately, it is crucial for law and policy makers to carefully assess the necessity, implications and 
<br/>duplicating legislation to ensure the legal framework remain clear, efficient and representative of the 
<br/>communities need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the brag of the Fiji 2013 Constitution and the pathway and framework of 
<br/>the people’s charter for building a better Fiji, we have done well to ourselves.  I believe honourable 
<br/>Kiran, the mover of the motion, herself has testimonies and good stories that she can testify to the 
<br/>transformation that took place in the event of exchange with the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Navilaca in Noco, and the 
<br/>elevation accorded to the descendants of the </span><span>Girmitiyas </span><span>to the esteemed position of </span><span>luvena na turaga 
<br/>na ratu</span><span>.  All those exchanges and transformations took place without the Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is blessed, not because of the sun, sea and the sand, but because in the early 1800s, when 
<br/></span><span>missionaries first came to the nation, they brought with them the Gospel message that our forefathers 
<br/>embraced, and that is why we are different.  We can easily forgive and move along.  I will end there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will start by quoting the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, as well as myself on what we said during the Girmit Commemoration and Reconciliation 
<br/>Service organised by the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma at the Vodafone Dome on Sunday, 
<br/>14</span><span>th</span><span>  May  this  year.      This  is  relevant  to  the  debate  on  the  need  for  Parliament  to  agree  to  the 
<br/>establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not a Bill, as stated by honourable Ravunawa, this is a motion to establish a Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation  Commission.    All  the  motion  seeks  to  do  is  to  ask  Parliament  to  agree  to  the 
<br/>appointment  of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  so  that  we  can  have  some  debate  and 
<br/>discussions as to what it will amount to.  Obviously, the terms of reference and the appointment by 
<br/>the President of the Commission will be after Parliament agrees.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, while confessing his  wrongdoing in  1987, and asking for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forgiveness, said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We confess our wrongdoings, we confess that we have hurt so many of our people 
<br/>in Fiji, particularly those of our Indo-Fijian communities at the time, and amongst them 
<br/>were  sons  and  daughters  of  those  who  were  indentured  labourers  from  India  between 
<br/>1879 and 1916.  The power to forgive is beyond our human power. The power to forgive 
<br/>is  godly.    As  you  forgive  you  release  us  and  you  are  released.  You  are  released  from 
<br/>hatred, from your anger and we begin to feel the peace of God coming to our beings and 
<br/>our lives”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will quote what I said on that momentous day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This  may  well  be  the  start  of  resetting  the  moral  compass  of  our  nation  and 
<br/>repairing  the  social  moral  and  political  fabric  so  badly  needed  to  forge  a  united  and 
<br/>harmonious future. More importantly, what Fiji and our diaspora have just witnessed has 
<br/>sowed the seeds for a truth and reconciliation commission so critically needed to put a 
<br/>permanent closure to an ugly chapter of upheavals.  Once and for all it will put an end to 
<br/>those whose political ambitions devolve around invoking fear and ill-will by fanning the 
<br/>flames of racism.  The courage and humility of the Methodist Church in apologising for 
<br/>the hurt, pain and suffering caused to the descendants of the </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> community by the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei </span><span>community should be an eye opener to those who have participated in the political 
<br/>upheavals but continued to defend their role.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support this historic motion and this, if I may state, is a 
<br/>National Federation Party motion, seconded by the honourable Prime Minister as the Leader of the 
<br/>People’s Alliance Party and also supported by the SODELPA Party and its leader.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the motion was entrusted to what I say an Indo-Fijian woman of the National Federation Party, the 
<br/>party  that  I  lead  by  us  in  the  Coalition  Government  including  the  Prime  Minister  and  to  which 
<br/>honourable Sashi Kiran did not hesitate to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  issue  of  harmonious  race  relations,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  long  held  question  that  she 
<br/>herself, has toiled in her previous role as an NGO leader.  I must say Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable 
<br/>Kiran is a perfect example of someone who has learned to confront her own fears, not by castigating 
<br/>others  or  playing  the  blame  game  but  by  making  an  honest  effort  to  understand  the  wishes, 
<br/></span><span>aspirations, and fears of other races or ethnic groups.  That is why honourable Sashi Kiran is such a 
<br/></span><span>passionate advocate Sir, of </span><span>luvedra na Ratu mai</span><span> Noco, Rewa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard before that the Commission is a pre-requisite Mr. Speaker, Sir, to genuine 
<br/>healing which is crucial to our effort to make Fiji a land of hope and opportunity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>you may not be aware that in confirmative to the National Federation Party’s principles and the party 
<br/>they tried to move a similar motion in Parliament during its sitting in April 2017, and of course that 
<br/>motion was not allowed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Six years later Mr. Speaker, Sir, under your leadership we are kind of putting a rest to our 
<br/></span><span>ghosts  and  essentially  laying  the  foundation  for  what  a  nation  wants  to  bequeath  to  our  future 
<br/>generations.    That  too  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  you  said  earlier  this  morning  without  promoting  or 
<br/>provoking ill-will or any kind of hostility and pinging upon the rights and freedoms of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, Mr. Speaker, a Commission is necessary for us as Fijians to come to terms with the 
<br/>past  and  there  is  quite  a  lot.  Some  have  gone  in  Girmit  days,  others  have  gone  even  before  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1815 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because we need to accept this on a morally accepted basis and to advance the cause of reconciliation 
<br/>somewhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know it is not a secret that attempts to reconcile the past efforts to encourage truth telling, 
<br/>confessing our wrongdoings or even apologising to the victims of political upheavals were turned 
<br/>into political football and band standing and that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are aware.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For many years truth telling and taking ownership of mistakes that have robbed the nation 
<br/>had actually disappeared.  And until 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023, Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of the Girmit Day 
<br/>reconciliation organised by the Methodist Church, no racial intolerance but love, respect and sound 
<br/>of goodwill, understanding and mutual peaceful co-existence.  The Fiji Forward Declaration, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, on that occasion that we signed cemented our resolve to work together and the leaders 
<br/>of political parties without any fear or racial prejudice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that some may argue as we have heard that the establishment of a 
<br/>Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  will  open  old  wounds  impede  progress.    However,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, I firmly believe that true confronting are passed. We can actually find a way for a brighter 
<br/>and more harmonious future. Sometimes confronting the past, discussing the past, what happened in 
<br/>the past can lead to a better future, it can shine light on truth.  We have heard mentioned deep rooted, 
<br/>underlying mistrust, prejudice, divisions that hinder us moving forward.  I know the South African 
<br/>experience has been mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  South  African  experience,  Mr.  Speaker,  demonstrated  the  transformative  power  of 
<br/>collective truth telling and forgiveness. It kind of provided a blueprint for healing, unity and growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to some of the points that have been raised before.  I think, 
<br/>honourable Naupoto was right when he was talking about stability, security, he related those two 
<br/>issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at Fiji, Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago we were better than Mauritius on all indicators: 
<br/>economics, social indicators and some of us were wondering why Fiji cannot be the Mauritius of the 
<br/>Pacific.  A lot of the research, studies and my own research on Mauritius with comparison to Fiji 
<br/>shows that the respect for rule of law, democracy but more importantly the social cohesion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we talked about law, I know the honourable Members from the other side talked 
<br/>about rule of law - the Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is no sense of purpose, unity, trust 
<br/></span><span>between different  communities if there are prejudices, mistrust  than any law you cannot  legislate 
<br/></span><span>these things.  We have seen four constitutions in this country. The 1970 Constitution was agreed to 
<br/>by  the  then  NFP  leader  and  the  leader  of  the  Alliance  Party.    It  was  in  many  ways  a  negotiated 
<br/>Constitution,  it  provided  a  Bill  of  Rights,  it  provided  a  system  of  government  where  all  those 
<br/>principles were embedded.  But that Constitution was thrown out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then we had the 1990 Constitution which was imposed.  Then the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>showed  leadership  with  the  other  political  leaders  and  got  the  1997  Constitution  which  actually 
<br/>provided power-sharing.  It was more a concessional type of politics where power sharing was made 
<br/></span><span>a law.   Yet Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Constitution was also thrown out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  we  had  the  2013  Constitution  imposed  on  the  people  of  Fiji.  It  might  be  the  best 
<br/>constitution in the views of people or the population; a sizeable section of the population.  We have 
<br/>heard about laws and policies, yes laws and policies are important.  I heard Members talked about 
<br/>issues.  Yes, those are issues that we need to deal with whether it is drugs, NCD, economic growth, 
<br/>poverty or lack of economic growth, these things do not happen in a vacuum. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this motion is a great opportunity.  This is not about hiding something as 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister said and he is absolutely right.  If there is anything in this Parliament 
<br/>amongst us right now, it is something that he would, but he is showing the wisdom saying let us talk 
<br/>about it.  If there is a dispute in any small family household setting, if the people are not getting on 
<br/>and if you do not talk about it, if you try and hide it under some kind of law and policy, it will never 
<br/>work.  It has never worked in any country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Kumar talked about political maturity  - yes, this is political maturity.  This is 
<br/>political maturity that we, as Members of Parliament, are prepared to talk about what happened in 
<br/>the past.  We are showing courage as Members of Parliament.  But if you say, “look, we do not want 
<br/>to talk about this, we want to go by some law that everyone should respect without addressing the 
<br/>underlying principles, without talking about how we can merge our interest, how we can enhance 
<br/>social cohesion at all levels”, Mr. Speaker. Sir, you cannot guarantee and you cannot satisfy. I think 
<br/>the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  is  also  about  education.    We  cannot  continue  to  be 
<br/>cantankerous in our expressions of views that we hold very strongly at a personal level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  personally  we  were  all  part  of  it  in  terms  of  opposing,  talking  about 
<br/>democracy, talking about human rights. There are a lot of human right violations that took place in 
<br/>the last so many year. Whether you are talking about 1987, 2000, 2006 people died after the human 
<br/>rights were violated.  Some waited for 10 to 15 years to come back to their own country. These are 
<br/>all issues there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is a great opportunity for this Parliament to talk about these 
<br/>things.  It is not about opening old wounds. The old wounds are there and we keep talking about 
<br/>those wounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Premila Kumar talked about confidence that this will somehow 
<br/>share our confidence. In fact what this motion will do if the honourable Members of the Opposition 
<br/>give this a bipartisan support this will be a defining moment for this country, Mr. Speaker, this will 
<br/>spur confidence, this will bring that sense of freedom and exuberance in the ability of our country 
<br/>and everyone knows it is not true that Fiji is not recognised as a country where there are issues and 
<br/>we keep talking about it here in Parliament as well.  When we were in Opposition, we talked about 
<br/>it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some people say about the Constitution, honourable Tikoduadua talked about how the Police 
<br/>Force was totally racialised in terms of 90 percent of the officers coming from a one particular group.  
<br/>It happened under the 2013 Constitution so it is not always about law, not always about policies, you 
<br/>can have the best Constitution, you can have the best law, you can think about the best policies but 
<br/></span><span>if there no sense of unity, purpose, understanding each other’s sensitivities, fears, expressions, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, we will not be able to.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not saying, the mover of the motion is not saying that we will solve all the problems 
<br/>tomorrow after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  No one is saying that, but Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it will be a great opportunity for us not only as honourable Members of Parliament but because 
<br/>when you talk about political maturity and what people see below, comes from that political maturity, 
<br/>that ability to get together and talk about issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I urge the honourable Members on the Opposition side 
<br/></span><span>not to forgo this opportunity.  This is going to be an historic bipartisan opportunity to work together.  
<br/>We  may  not  agree  with  all  the  pluses  and  minuses  of  having  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission, but at least we would have tried altogether collectively to move towards a situation 
<br/>where  we  are  able  to  come  together  and  talk  about  these  issues  and  move  forward.    I  strongly 
<br/>commend this motion to all the honourable Members of this Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1817 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the honourable Members of this Parliament, I thank 
<br/>the honourable Opposition Members for their contributions to this motion.  I stand before you to shed 
<br/>light  on  the  dark  side  of  the  proposed  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  as  presented  by  the 
<br/>Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the intention may seem noble, we must confront the potential damaging consequences 
<br/>that this endeavour might inflict upon our people.  First and foremost, we cannot ignore the harsh 
<br/>reality that Truth and Reconciliation Commission has the potential to reopen wounds that have barely 
<br/>healed.  It is not just the matter of reliving the past traumas, it is a cruel reminder of the pain our 
<br/>fellow Fijians endured.  This process could be traumatising for countless victims, leaving scars that 
<br/>may never truly heal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  us  also  consider  the  financial  burden  placed  on  our  already  strained 
<br/>resources.  Establishing and maintaining such a Commission is an expensive endeavour.  At a time 
<br/>when our nation faces economic challenges, should we really prioritise initiative that may drain our 
<br/>coffers?  Should we not be focusing on immediate needs of our Fijians instead?  Furthermore, there 
<br/>is a grave risk that this Truth and Reconciliation Commission may become a platform for political 
<br/>manipulation.    The  Government  with  all  its  power  and  influences  could  use  this  Commission  to 
<br/>promote  its  own  agenda  and  selectively  target  individuals  or  groups  potentially  deepening  the 
<br/>divisions within our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must also recognise that Truth Commissions by design, do not possess 
<br/>the  power  to  prosecute  perpetrators,  and  this  raises  the  question  of  accountability.    Will  those 
<br/>responsible for heinous crimes simply be allowed to walk free and their sins forgiven in the name of 
<br/>reconciliation?  Is this justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Let us not be naïve about the willingness of all the 
<br/>stakeholders to participate.  The scars of the past run deep and some may choose not to engage with 
<br/>the  Commission.    Will  their  voices  be  silenced,  and  their  stories  left  untold?    Is  that  the  kind  of 
<br/>reconciliation we truly seek? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission because today 
<br/>the Fijian people already stand more united than at any other point in their history and that is owed 
<br/>to  the  unprecedented  state  of  civil,  political,  socio-economic  rights  and  a  sign  of  all  time  in  our 
<br/>beloved 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  those  who  do  not  know  our  Constitution  unlike  those  on  that  side  of  Parliament  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and past governments before, FijiFirst knows that the only true path to unity is through 
<br/></span><span>equality.    That  belief  and  commitment  is  defined  given  everything  Fiji  has  achieved  under  the 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst  government  and  the  leadership  of  the  former  Prime  Minister  Bainimarama.    In  the  very 
<br/>Preamble of the Fijian Constitution states clearly that we are all Fijians, united by a common and 
<br/>equal citizenry and because of our Constitution, for the first time in our history, we are all equal in 
<br/>the eyes of the law and united with a common purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members because of our Constitution, every Fijian knows 
<br/>that their vote and voice matter the same, that all our citizens are equal, regardless of their ethnicity, 
<br/>religion, socio-economic status, gender, physical ability or where they live in Fiji and that is the truth 
<br/></span><span>the Fijian people deserve; the truth the FijiFirst Government was able to make a reality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Constitution also recognises the right of indigenous Fijians, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>and the Rotuman people. It  guarantees the ownership and protection of their land and the unique 
<br/>culture, traditions, customs and language.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the same Constitution every Fijian 
<br/>has  equal  access  to  justice  through  the  courts  or  tribunals,  executive  and  administrative  justice, 
<br/>freedom  of speech, expression and publication, freedom  of assembly,  freedom  of association, the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right to fair employment practices, the right to equality and freedom from discrimination, freedom 
<br/>from compulsory, acquisition of property, the right to education and economic participation, the right 
<br/>to  work  and  a  just  minimum  wage,  the  right  to  reasonable  access  to  transportation,  the  rights  of 
<br/>children and the rights of persons with disabilities and the list goes on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the basis of unity, that is a Fiji for every Fijian and with the foundation 
<br/>of equality in place, FijiFirst embarked on a programme of Legal and Policy Reform that has uplifted 
<br/>every Fijian from all walks of life all across our nation. We have achieved eight straight years of 
<br/>economic growth.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, 
<br/>we have made education free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst have built a network of reliable infrastructure and services throughout the country. 
<br/>We had formed our first National University, we had expanded access to scholarship and affordable 
<br/>tertiary loans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst has done all that because we had adhered to the mandate 
<br/>setup by the Fijian Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst had achieved such success because for 
<br/>the first time in Fijian history, we can say with every confidence that our unity is our strength. We 
<br/>have  no  bounds  that  divides  our  society  that  the  past  governments  sought  to  entrench.    We  had 
<br/>levelled the playing field for every Fijian and we have put greater opportunity in the lives of all our 
<br/>people everywhere in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while on the subject of truth, I see great irony in the Coalition Government 
<br/>which is posing this motion when they themselves are so blind to the true history of our country.  
<br/>They ask about truth and reconciliation while they themselves live in denial of the truth.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they live in denial of the years of institutionalised discrimination and systematic 
<br/>oppression of our fellow Fijians that crippled our nation for decades. FijiFirst had recognise the dark 
<br/>part of our history and we have come to grips with the grim reality that was faced by far too many 
<br/>Fijians for far too long.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Fijians who felt unwelcomed in their own homes and those on the margins of 
<br/>society  were  excluded  from  meaningful  participation  in  their  country.  FijiFirst  recognised  the 
<br/>immense harm those years caused and our leader, Mr.  Bainimarama had made it his personal mission 
<br/>to ensure that Fiji never slips back into those lost years. It is our Constitution and the strong and 
<br/>independent  institutions  that  establishes  and  guarantees  equality  in  our  society.  It  is  equality  that 
<br/>unites us as one nation, one people. That is the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and armed with the truth.  We 
<br/></span><span>will continue to carry Fiji into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While reconciliation is a noble aspiration, we must be cautious about the potential negative 
<br/>repercussions  of  establishing  a  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission.  We  must  consider  the 
<br/>emotional toll on our people, the financial strain on our nation, the risk of political manipulation, the 
<br/>lack of accountability and the potential silencing of voices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let us trend carefully on this path for the road to reconciliation is fraught with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>uncertainties and potential pitfalls that could harm our beloved Fiji and its people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Koya, I intend to adjourn Parliament 
<br/>now.  I have been informed that dinner is ready and probably after having your meal then we shall 
<br/>come and finish off the day’s agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 6.12 p.m.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 7.30 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before the House is asking the House to setup 
<br/>a Truth and Reconciliation Commission so that a lot of things can be done but it is not very specific in its 
<br/>form at the moment.  It has been badly drafted.  It is asking literally to facilitate open, free engagement 
<br/>truth telling and confront fears in view of conflicting statements and utterances regarding motives behind 
<br/>political  upheavals  so  that  closure  and  healing  for  Fiji  is  achieved  and  permanently  put  to  rest  this 
<br/>unfortunate turbulent chapter of our independent history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have a history, we have quite a substantial and how history goes back to, not just 
<br/>the upheavals from 1987 and onwards, but also during Colonial times for which I am sure you are aware 
<br/>of. I can speak a little bit on that because of my family and I mean my father, the late honourable S.M. 
<br/>Koya who sat in this very chair during Colonial times and also during Independence. He was someone 
<br/>who also went through the Colonial times and fought hard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can relay a story about how they were treated then by the Colonial rulers of Fiji at that time. He 
<br/>and  a  very  famous  man  from  Ba,  for  those  of  you  from  Ba  would  remember,  his  name  was  Sashi 
<br/>Mahendra Singh.  They used to go across to the Grand Pacific Hotel and put their money on the table to 
<br/>try and get a room, only to be chased out of there because they were coloured. We are all coloured but 
<br/>today we are all Fijians irrespective of colour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That kind of persecution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, led them to be strong, led them to be patriotic and it 
<br/>led them to work hard to develop this great nation of ours. Despite our frailties and difficulties, they never 
<br/>asked for any Truth and Reconciliation Commission to move forward. Their philosophy then was if you 
<br/>got burnt, you are left with a scar that you had to witness for the rest of your life, you cannot remove it; 
<br/>the same principle applies here. We have scars all over this country, but we will never ever be able to 
<br/>remove that, but we must put that at the back of our minds and move forward. We cannot dig it up some 
<br/>more, we cannot allow this to happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, truth be told, if you really want the truth, why do you need a Commission? If you 
<br/>really want reconciliation, go no further then how we culturally do it.  We have a system culturally 
<br/>within the indigenous folk who actually have a reconciliation system that we all used all the time for 
<br/>literally everything.  A lot of that has been done already in the churches amongst our families. Even 
<br/>the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  I  am  sure  his  testament  to  the  fact  that  so  many  have  actually 
<br/>happened.  Why is it that we actually keep digging this up again and again?  I want to correct few 
<br/>things also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Professor Biman Prasad said that he had somewhat, I think it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was 2021 that he said, he did as for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission ...  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- … to Parliament.  He said  that  Fiji  needs  a Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission for truth telling to bring a closure to the traumatic events arising out of our four military 
<br/></span><span>coups</span><span>.  He  said  it  was  grossly  unjust,  unfair  and  most  unreasonable  that  people  especially  those 
<br/></span><span>subjected to unlawful detention, harassment, torture and abused by the security forces especially the 
<br/></span><span>military  are  prevented  from  seeking  justice  and  compensation.  That  was  the  core  basis  of  that 
<br/>application.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many  people  who  championed  democracy  and  human  rights  were  victims  of  torture  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>abused by the military, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>1820 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Following the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span> pro-democracy activists were also subjected to detention. 
<br/>Some  were  tortured  after  2000  </span><span>coup,</span><span>  many  became  victims  of  violence  committed  by 
<br/>those supporting the mayhem.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He went on to say that the 2013 Constitution entrenched the limitation of liability for the Limitation 
<br/>of  Liability  for  Prescribed  Political  Events  Decree  2010  which  means  the  alleged  perpetrators  of 
<br/>violence of human rights abuse cannot be brought to justice.  We do not know what the reasoning is 
<br/>behind this particular motion because they have not said anything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His also spoken about compensation. We do not know. I am not labelling any accusation here, 
<br/>I am just saying that we do not know what is being sought here.  What I must point out with the 
<br/>greatest of respect to the former speaker, Sir, who sat in that very chair who ruled that the motion 
<br/>was inadmissible under the Standing Orders because debate of the motion would be likely to promote 
<br/>and provoke feelings of ill-will or hostility between the different communities in Fiji.  Further, the 
<br/>motion was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights of the 2013 Constitution. That fact, when you talk 
<br/>about something like that, you ought to tell the full story, Sir. That was his reasoning for not allowing 
<br/>that motion.  It is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  heard  some  very  passionate  speeches  today,  but  I  think  it  is  very 
<br/>important today that we speak freely and everyone is heard. What is being asked of us is that we 
<br/>agree  to  a  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission.    Mr.  Speaker,  the  truth  is  this  book,  the 
<br/>reconciliation is this book, and I will tell you why.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all take the Preamble in this Constitution for granted but that Preamble tells us that we 
<br/>recognise the indigenous people or the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and their ownership of the land, culture and customs, 
<br/>tradition  and  language.  We  recognise  the  indigenous  people  of  Rotuma,  similarly  to  them,  we 
<br/>recognise the unique culture, customs, traditions and language. We also recognise the descendants of 
<br/>the indentured labourers from British India and the Pacific Islands, their culture, customs, traditions 
<br/>and language.  We also recognise the descendants of the settlers and immigrants to Fiji, their cultures 
<br/>and customs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is another line in there, Mr. Speaker, that basically puts everything to rest and gives us 
<br/>all an equal footing. This Preamble declares that we are all Fijians, united, Mr. Speaker, by common 
<br/>and equal citizenry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker it also has a Bill of Rights that protects literally everything.  We must respect 
<br/></span><span>this book that we swore on.  We swore on oath on it.  This book is the very reason why we all sit 
<br/></span><span>here.  This book allows us to have elections.  This book allows us to have this particular debate that 
<br/>we are having now, but we must not start by saying in the first 7 months – “Oh!  Let’s dig up the past 
<br/>and let us set up a truth and reconciliation committee”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We don’t even have the ambit of what you are actually trying to put before this Parliament. 
<br/>There were so many parts and parcels to this particular idea that it actually does not make sense.   
<br/>Again, historically Sir, in 2005 also this is during the Qarase Government, there was a reconciliation 
<br/>and unity commission that was proposed by the Government then to be set up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the reconciliation tolerance and unity built which was introduced in the Fiji Parliament on 
<br/>the 4</span><span>th</span><span> of May, 2005 was passed but guess what Mr. Speaker, Sir, that also was shelved because it 
<br/>created havoc amongst the community or they proved it really did.  It was going to create problems 
<br/>and animosity in Fiji.  What are we trying to do?  Are we going to do that again? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1821 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will go back to what I said earlier that we as the people are probably the 
<br/>most reconciling human beings on earth in Fiji.  We have the ability to talk to each other even by 
<br/>different  means.    We  resolve  disputes.    We  taught  the  climate  change  conference  how  to  have  a 
<br/>talanoa session and resolve disputes.  Why is it that we need a truth and reconciliation committee at 
<br/>a  great  huge  expense?  Why  is  it  that  all  we  need  to  do  is  protect  this  constitution  adhere  to  this 
<br/>constitution and rely on this constitution, because we swore an oath on this particular book. This is 
<br/>all we need. There are other ways we can do many things like we do, we are champion around the 
<br/>world for having a system within our cultural system to be able to protect our environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, every time you set up a  Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and this was 
<br/>spelt out by the speakers before, many countries do this, but normally the TRC’s they don’t have any 
<br/>powers  to  prosecute  perpetrators.    They  make  recommendation  and  we  understand  it,  to  prevent 
<br/>future abuses, but generally speaking these bodies are established straight out of a period of unrest.  
<br/>We have gone out 16 years of no unrest, we have had economic growth in such a phenomenal way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a matter of fact, if you look at it in reality sir, in 1987 those who would remember that are 
<br/>probably over 40-plus now, we have such a young population.  A lot of healing has gone on.  During 
<br/>election time, these racial insults that you talk about now rears its ugly head because it is a ploy that 
<br/>is used, it is not just here but it is worldwide.  But deep down inside, the level of patriotism we have 
<br/>in this country right now because of what has been created by this blue book, is unsurpassed, it is 
<br/>unbelievable!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will share a little light moment with you, honourable speaker.  When Fiji plays rugby - just 
<br/>now we played Wales but, unfortunately, we lost and guess what?  Every single person in this country 
<br/>was Fijian, we had a gentleman whose name is Hamzad Hussain, he took his little flag from Labasa, 
<br/>and he was in the stadium in France and guess what his sign read?   He was so disappointed because 
<br/>Fiji had lost and guess what his sign read (I hope you understand this Hindustani part).  He said, 
<br/>“</span><span>referee murgi chor”</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>which means that the referee was a chicken thief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Patriotism Sir, he did not look at who was playing and who was not playing, it is about Fiji.  
<br/>All of that exists under this Constitution.  We are not at a stage where a Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/>Committee is required.  The honourable Prime Minister has gone and apologised millions of times 
<br/>already.  Any more truth to be told, why do you need the Commission?  Why do we need to dig up 
<br/>scars some more?  Is that going to heal? No Sir.  Like a gentleman who shall remain nameless, who 
<br/>served sometime in prison said to me one day, one minute of incarceration is a lifetime of memory.  
<br/>Is that not enough? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The effectiveness of having a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission (TCR) has varied from 
<br/>country to country.  The success actually depends on many different factors but all these have not 
<br/>been factored in or it would seem to me that not much thought has been given to the actual motion 
<br/>before the Parliament.  Previously, there was a Bill that came first, but again I reiterate Sir, there is 
<br/>no need for us to have a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this motion will effectively divide Fiji again.  It is divisive Sir.  We have 
<br/>healed a lot. We have a lot of differences here, we carry on with business as usual.  We do not need 
<br/></span><span>a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Committee here in Parliament because we have got so many differences.  
<br/></span><span>Of course, we have differences, this country has gone through and had enough trials and tribulations 
<br/>to last us 20 lifetimes.  We have got a phenomenally young population, some (I apologise honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister) do not even know what transpired and they asks us what actually happened? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not a lie, that is the truth.  We have young people who want to move forward.  We start digging 
<br/>up some more, what is going to happen?  We are going to be divisive again.

<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the experiences that have come out of TRCs have been set up worldwide, I 
<br/>know South Africa did one.  It is very hurtful Sir – hurtful to the extent that there are provisions in 
<br/>the Constitution that say you cannot be prosecuted, nor you can be compensated and all of the </span><span>coup</span><span>
<br/>perpetrators that did them before all had them.  What is the purpose? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you want the truth, just say it, why do you need the commission?  Why do we need to set 
<br/>up a 22 to 30 men commission to do this?  What will be the ultimate objective of this particular Truth 
<br/>and Reconciliation Commission especially in light of the fact that you do not need to go any further.  
<br/>This book (2013 Constitution) is the truth, this book is the reconciliation.   We all must have the 
<br/>political will and the nous to say we need to move forward.  We need to protect ourselves by putting 
<br/>in new laws, new policies and it can be done.  You have seen in your time Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have 
<br/>seen some great achievements this week.  We have been able to do things with agreement on both 
<br/>sides. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a son of Fiji, I was born here.  My father was born here.  I do not need 
<br/>to reconcile with anyone because everyone here (to me) is Fijian.  I do not need to tell the truth to 
<br/>anyone because I already have, whether it is good or bad.  Sir, there are times when we sit down and 
<br/>we have a conversation awe all hurt but it does not need this Committee for it to be dragged up even 
<br/>if it is history.  Sir, our students, our young people, we learn through history that this is something 
<br/>which should not be done.  We have healed, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet the things that we need to resolve, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are things like; when you go out and 
<br/>I know some people say and use this particular word, like the word that is used with respect to people 
<br/>saying  “</span><span>vulagi</span><span>”.    Sir,  I  was  born  here  I  understand,  I  understood  what  you  said  in  the  Business 
<br/>Committee Meeting, it may have been brought up in different context but the context in which is 
<br/>being used is actually insulting to us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, all I am going to say is, this is what our sons and daughters need 
<br/>to rely on.  Otherwise, Sir, my other half is from Oneata, what are my children going to be called?  
<br/>The former Attorney-General’s children what are they going to be called? We should not be doing 
<br/>that to ourselves.  We have a happy medium already here, Sir. With respect to the majority of the 
<br/>population that send us here to do things, yes sometimes we may not agree but most of the time the 
<br/>only people that are best at being Fijian are us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of us, not some of us - we are the best at the world in doing many things, Sir.  We are the 
<br/></span><span>best at the world now being flaunted around the world in many institutes as Fijians having the best 
<br/></span><span>way to resolve things, yet at home we need to setup a Truth and Reconciliation Commission?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to end by saying something in iTaukei, “</span><span>kevaka keimami sa vulagi 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me keimami qai lako tale i vei”</span><span> where do we go?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, serving my third term in Parliament, this motion 
<br/>is  perfect  and  is  most  suitable  for  Fiji  today.  The  honourable  Prime  Minister  is  celebrating  his 
<br/>birthday today and I am around the same vintage, so I have seen Fiji grow.  We saw the battle during 
<br/></span><span>the Colonial days to decide and to agree on the way forward with our politicians in their time at 60s.  
<br/></span><span>Independence came in 1970, the brave new world - I was part of that, we were young, and I have 
<br/>seen Fiji grow from where we are today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say again, this motion is a must, and we must embrace the provisions and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1823 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this motion Mr. Speaker. When I read it, it captures the essence of what I believe should be done in 
<br/>Fiji today to strengthen our community, bring people together, unify us as one.  I will read it out 
<br/>again:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Parliament  agrees  for  the  establishment  of  a  Truth  &amp;  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission by the Government to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling and 
<br/>confront fears in view of conflicting statements and utterances regarding motives behind 
<br/>the political upheavals so that closure and healing for Fiji is achieved and permanently put 
<br/>to rest this unfortunate and turbulent chapter of our independent history.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to do this.  As the honourable Kiran has said today and I loved what she said, “this 
<br/>is a beautiful country”.  We are a beautiful country, but we need to clean up a number of things to 
<br/>fully realise the potential of this country and enjoy the beauty that we know is there.  This motion is 
<br/>presented  with  humility  and  the  importance  of  humility  is  this  -  it  extends  more  compassion  and 
<br/>empathy to others.  This presented with humility.  You notice the tone from this side of Parliament, 
<br/>the tone that is driving, dictating the leadership in this country today, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Our Prime 
<br/>Minister epitomises the humility and most importantly, Mr. Speaker, he does not hide anything.  He 
<br/>has been very open, yes, he has apologised a number of times but here is a leader who hides nothing 
<br/>from his people.  Of course, others can do the same for 2006.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know we celebrated for the last few days about the changes that we saw in this Parliament, 
<br/>the tabling of the Urgent Oral Question which I had shared with you.  For eight years, I sat on the 
<br/>other side of Parliament, I remembered the day there was this landslide that almost buried Draubuta 
<br/>in my Constituency at Nadroga/Navosa. I wanted to raise an Urgent Oral Question and I was told 
<br/>that is the business of the Executive, the Legislature has no business asking what the Executive does.  
<br/>These were the principles of separation of powers that prevail at that time but today we know things 
<br/>have changed, the tone has changed. It is true parliamentary democracy, the Executive will not hide 
<br/>anything from the Legislature. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course  yesterday,  we  withdrew  a  Bill  that  we  believeD  based  on  the 
<br/>presentation from the other side needed a bit more work.  We argued for eight years over certain 
<br/>Bills, we knew they were not perfect but not once it have the humility to say “we withdraw it and 
<br/>bring it back”.  This is a new tone in the country today and I would urge everyone to buy in, into this 
<br/>tone and do things with humility, accept and embrace the way we bring forward some very important 
<br/>issues that are important to our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see a lot of emotions today and the emotions confirm to me that we need 
<br/></span><span>this Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  I remember in the case of the South African TRC – in 
<br/>one case a white policeman was called by the Commission and in the presence of his township, he 
<br/>was asked, “How did you treat these people?”   Truthfully, he explained what he did to them, the 
<br/>manner he treated the black people in South Africa.  The people could not help themselves and they 
<br/>cried openly, but at the end of all that weeping, they embraced each other because the truth came out.  
<br/>The black people could not believe that the white man who did that to them, would be truthful in a 
<br/>Commission like that.  That is what Fiji needs.  We know there is a lot of hurt in our country, so we 
<br/>need to bring that out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that it is very difficult to stand in the gap and pull our people 
<br/>together.  You ask our colleagues who pulled together and set up the </span><span>luvedra na Ratu</span><span>, what they had 
<br/>to go through to bring that together.  It was not easy, and it is still not easy today.  Standing in the 
<br/>gap means it is still not easy, but we need to stand in the gap and pull the people in, and this is one 
<br/>way of standing in the gap.  There are some concerns raised by my colleague, honourable Ravunawa, 
<br/>that  there  could  be  mistakes,  that  the  motion  is  not  properly  worded.    But,  as  enumerated  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>1824 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable  Premila  Kumar,  many  of  the  countries  have  done  this  and  we  will  learn  from  them.  
<br/>Indeed, when we set this up in 2005 and 2006, the South Africans helped us set up what we wanted 
<br/>to do at that time, which unfortunately, did not see the light of day.  Please, do not be fearful.  It has 
<br/>been done all over the world and we will reach out to whoever, to help us set this up and make sure 
<br/>that it is done properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  this  fear  of  opening  up  the  old  wounds,  but  it  was  on  this  side  of  Parliament  that  is 
<br/>sweeping things under the rug, and we know that you cannot do that.   You have to bring it out in the 
<br/>open for all the wounds left  unattended, will fester.  It is better to cleanse those wounds and it is 
<br/>political maturity to take on that challenge and do it.  That is what we are saying today, the political 
<br/>maturity to do this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I look at the case of Australia in terms of the natives of Australia.  A member of my family is 
<br/>married to a native of Australia and I can relate, and I am very impressed with the way they have 
<br/>improved over the years.  A week ago, honourable Kamikamica and I were part of the Fiji Business 
<br/>Council AGM in Sydney.  As traditional in Australia today there is this. “Welcome to Country”, and 
<br/>it is normally by a native, who are the traditional custodians of the land, who greet you in whatever 
<br/>event you hold in Australia.    This lady who gave us the welcome to the country, her name is Aunty 
<br/>Ding, and she has 81 great grandchildren.  I say this because I just saw the strength in this woman, 
<br/>and  knowing  the  natives  back  then  some  years  ago,  there  is  a  sense  of  confidence  within  the 
<br/>community now in Australia.  Indeed, my family who is married to a native of Australia, said that 
<br/>natives of Australia have made great strides over the years.  There was a time when we were way 
<br/>ahead  of  them,  but  now  they  are  equal  to  us  in  terms  of  education  and  other  areas  of  human 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened in Australia, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the acknowledgment by the leadership 
<br/>back in the 1990s that they were not treating the natives well.  It used to be harsh harsh but Paul 
<br/>Keating in the 1990s said, we know we did not do this, and that process of acknowledgement Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, has helped uplift the natives of Australia and of course we remember the apology by 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister Kevin Rudd over the Stolen Generation that all added up to strengthening 
<br/>the  native  Australians  today  and  into  what  they  are  today.    They  are  very  powerful  people  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  and  what  I  am  emphasising  here  is  the  acknowledgement,  something  needed  to  be 
<br/>acknowledged and they said about doing, improving the lot of the natives of Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we need to have in Fiji today is also to acknowledge that there exists in our midst the 
<br/>sense of reservation, the concern that we are not being truthful to each other, that fear, we need to 
<br/></span><span>acknowledge that and we need to do something about it and we believe this is the way to do it.  As I 
<br/></span><span>have said, standing in the gap is not easy, ask those who have tried and we need Mr. Speaker, Sir, to 
<br/>move forward.  We need the sense of acknowledgement.  We must all agree, we must all acknowledge 
<br/>this. You cannot hide your head in the sand or sweep it under the rug, we have to acknowledge this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have today in my Ministry is an unprecedented level of interest to 
<br/>invest in this country and just yesterday I was called during Parliament sitting to meet some people 
<br/>in the Government Chambers and they just said to me that there is something about this country.  We 
<br/>feel a sense of goodwill in this country, there is something here.  It is very unique compared to the 
<br/></span><span>other parts of the world where they go to and this is our strength Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to build 
<br/></span><span>confidence.  We know there is still room to develop and being honest with each other, being truthful 
<br/>is the way forward for our country and I must share with you today the investors that we are seeing 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, are mostly the diaspora of our own people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our own people over the last eight months with the new Coalition Government have come 
<br/>back in big numbers to invest in Fiji.  This process will confirm to them that we are on the right path, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1825 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that yes there is now freedom in this country. There is no more fear, people can come back to where 
<br/>they were born.  No one is going to be kept out of this country and we are going one step further to 
<br/>cleanse ourselves of all these fear that has held us hostage for a good many years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, I agree with honourable Koya, our history goes back to the colonial days, the deed of 
<br/>cession hence the need to cleanse.  We are not going to limit the dialogue to 1987, 2000, 2006 it is a 
<br/>whole process of listening to people and that is what will uplift the country.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 
<br/>urge everyone to accept us. As I said we are not the only one, our neighbours, the Solomon Islanders 
<br/>did this and it worked for them and Fiji there is something that has been hanging over our head for 
<br/>quite some time and we need to cleanse ourselves and move away from being held hostage to old 
<br/>feelings that need to be cleansed. And if I may, Mr. Speaker, let me close with Psalms 133:1:  “How 
<br/>good and pleasant it is when brothers live in unity”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, that is what we are trying to accomplish here today. To live in unity, in truth and without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fear hence the need to set-up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the speakers that have contributed to this 
<br/>motion.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Much  has  been  said  that  shows  us  the  need  for  the  set-up  of  the 
<br/>Commission. Many of our honourable Members from the Opposition side has spoken about bringing 
<br/>out  hurts,  yet  in  Parliament  they  themselves  have  brought  out  the  events  of  1987  during  the 
<br/>contribution over the past few months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  can  only  give  what  we  have.    Our  honourable  Prime  Minister  has 
<br/>reflected on his actions, healed and has been working on making amends for decades. It started with 
<br/>his partnership with NFP Leader late Justice Jai Ram Reddy who was held at gun point during 1987. 
<br/>They shook hands, they forgave and tried to move the nation forward through deep conversations 
<br/>and processes to deliver the 1997 Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the consultation for development of 1997 Constitution, I think that would have been 
<br/>the first healing process where I saw submissions being made from all extremes. I have admired the 
<br/>leadership of NFP and the NFP leaders of our past who had the vision to be able to look beyond the 
<br/>pain to see the growth of the nation. I know honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Professor Biman 
<br/>Prasad was also affected by the events of 1987, he also chose to work on building peace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you read the life of Ghandi or Nelson Mandela, people we all admire, we learn that path of 
<br/>peace and healing is much more difficult, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is much more difficult to work on and 
<br/></span><span>requires a strength of character that is not easy but I am humbled to serve in this Parliament with 
<br/></span><span>leaders who have chosen this difficult path. I admire the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership 
<br/>during that time and devastated when I realise the nation was not ready to receive the gift of healing 
<br/>and working together. I know our honourable Prime Minister was committed and kept working on 
<br/>peace building not only here but in the Pacific region, in particular Solomon Islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More recently, Mr. Speaker, when I joined politics I have been privileged to be in forums 
<br/>where the honourable Prime Minister has spoken his heart. I have seen in his eyes and his voice a 
<br/>deep commitment to re-building the nation. I know he has been blamed for starting all the problems 
<br/></span><span>and he has taken the responsibility and wants to do everything possible to leave this country a better 
<br/></span><span>place. The question I often ask myself, why is one person taking the blame? When this must have 
<br/>been a collective work, there were many people involved in 1987 and could have stopped him as 
<br/>well. But he received support for his actions, why? For any plant to grow the ground has to be ready; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>What were the reasons? 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Why was the ground ready for this plant to take root?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>What were the root causes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Have we dealt with the root causes? Sir, maybe not so we kept seeing political upheavals over 
<br/>the years. Is it not time we study these roots to try and eliminate them Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, we can only give what we have, you have been a beacon of hope that you have taken 
<br/>the time to reflect, heal and are ready to help the nation heal by answering the questions. After taking 
<br/>leadership  of  this  nation  our  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  reminded  us  regularly  to  lead  with 
<br/>kindness, not to be revengeful, raise the bar for leadership and let love shine in all things we do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has changed the tone of this nation. I have 
<br/>seen the honourable Prime Minister apologise many times and every time I feel very humbled and as 
<br/>a leader and elder, I wish he would not do that anymore and I hope through this process the need for 
<br/>that apology is no more as we will create a process to have everyone’s questions answered and heal the 
<br/>hurts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are all coloured by experiences from political upheavals, I was too after seeing 
<br/>2000 and learning from that event made me want to understand the root causes and heal the relationships 
<br/>in this nation. I had witnessed evictions, met rape victims, crime against my people and I was feeling very 
<br/></span><span>pained on behalf of my people as I moved around most affected areas during the crisis of 2000. I was 
<br/></span><span>angry and blessed to joined the peace process and took the time to look at my stereotypes, to look at the 
<br/>fears of the people, learn the concerns of the people and realise if the communities are hurting. I am very 
<br/>blessed that having a deep desire to work healing of this nation I have been given the opportunity to raise 
<br/>this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to raise the issue of </span><span>vulagi </span><span>that has been mentioned and has been all over the media 
<br/>and raised in this Parliament today, Mr. Speaker. I wonder those who have commented whether they have 
<br/>listened to the Prime Minister’s speech where he allegedly called us </span><span>vulagi</span><span>. When I listen to the Prime 
<br/>Minister’s speech, he seemed he was speaking about himself being a guest in that space, he did not call 
<br/>anyone else </span><span>vulagi</span><span>, he did not say Indo-Fijians, Melanesians or </span><span>vulagi</span><span>, he used the word for himself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are wounded so we have taken that to hurt ourselves and create more divide instead of looking 
<br/>at the context in which it was spoken and that is what the Commission can do, heal us so that we can look 
<br/>at the context. I remember when we visited Bau to attend the late Roko Tui Bau's funeral with the </span><span>Gone 
<br/>Marama Bale na Roko Tui Dreketi</span><span> she explained to me that she is a </span><span>vulagi</span><span>, a guest on the island and there 
<br/>is a traditional door a family we had to go to. They will announce our arrival to the Chief of the land, it 
<br/>is a normal tradition but maybe we have been wounded by the past. Being called </span><span>vulagi</span><span> in the past and 
<br/>we are still carrying the wound, the leaders have not healed keep amplifying the pain passing it to younger 
<br/>generation. When we are leaders, people hold on to our words thinking we must be telling the truth but 
<br/>some of the truth is coloured by our own experiences and pain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address this to the people, leaders have to heal themselves first. From what I have learnt from 
<br/>Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commissions  in  different  parts  of  the  world  including  Solomon  Islands,  I 
<br/>strongly believe that we could move ahead for healing of this nation. Create peace for generations to 
<br/>come as we keep narrating to younger generations our pain of the past. 60 percent of this nation was not 
<br/>here in 1987 as mentioned by honourable Koya but young generations tell a story of pain because that is 
<br/>how we related it to them during political campaigns. We must heal so we do not rob our next generation 
<br/></span><span>of the innocence, we give them the gift of love of different people in this land. For that we need humility 
<br/></span><span>to be able to tell the truth and be able to have the patience to listen to allow time and space to heal so no 
<br/>politician uses this painful events to further their political campaign as we have seen in the recent past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank all the leaders who have contributed and plead with all Members of this Parliament to 
<br/>bless this nation with healing and support the motion to agree to establish the Truth and Reconciliation 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>because we have leaders committed to the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you I wish to thank our Prime Minister I was hoping for his birthday 
<br/>we will have the gift of passing this motion and can sincerely say “happy birthday.” Because I have seen 
<br/>the emotions and the pain he has been carrying that he wants to work on healing this nation and pray that 
<br/>he has a healthy and long life to continue passing his wisdom and luck to this nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may this nation grow with peace and prosperity with the leadership 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of our Prime Minister, with that I commend the motion to Parliament.
