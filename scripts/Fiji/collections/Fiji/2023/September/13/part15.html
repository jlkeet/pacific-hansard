<h3>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</h3>
<div><span>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament agrees to the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
<br/>by the Government to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling and confront fears 
<br/>in  view  of  conflicting  statements  and  utterances  regarding  motives  behind  the  political 
<br/>upheavals  so  that  closure and healing for  Fiji  is achieved  and permanently put  to  rest  this 
<br/>unfortunate and turbulent chapter of our independent history. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of this august Parliament and people of our beloved 
<br/>nation; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka saka, sab ko mera pranam</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is long 
<br/>awaited.    Our  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  promised  the  setting  up  of  this  all-important 
<br/>Commission for very good reasons as I tried to articulate this in this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am grateful and honoured that I have been asked by the honourable Prime Minister and the 
<br/>Coalition Government to move this motion in the hope that it may become a significant step towards 
<br/>our national building.  Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it is our hope that the Coalition Government’s task of 
<br/>rebuilding Fiji together for our future will reach greater heights after the work of this Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Prayer and Reconciliation Programme initiated by the President of the Methodist 
<br/>Church during the Girmit Commemoration and participation of leaders and various faith groups in 
<br/>the event indicate that our people are ready for a healing process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all three Parties in the Coalition Government are firm in their commitment to 
<br/>see to their establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It is long overdue, Sir, but it 
<br/>is better late than never.  Some may ask whether this is the time for it. Some may say we should focus 
<br/>on cost of living and on better public services, and I understand that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I know from  many long  years of personal  engagement  with  our people, 
<br/>there are a lot of people that are hurting. There are many unresolved issues that need closure.  Can 
<br/>we be a prosperous society if we live in fear and insecurity, if we do not trust our neighbours and 
<br/></span><span>carry wounded hearts, Mr. Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our nation has been plagued by political upheaval since 1987. Officially, we have had four 
<br/></span><span>coups</span><span> including that of 2000 and 2006.  But other events have also caused pain and misery to many. 
<br/>Each time we recovered and tried to move forward with the hope that political upheaval should become 
<br/>a thing of the past, sometimes we seem to make progress. The creation of the 1997 Constitution was a 
<br/>time when all sides of this House came together under the leadership of the man who was then and is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1799 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>again  now  our  Prime  Minister  together  with  the  late  Justice  Jai  Ram  Reddy.  The  House  voted 
<br/>unanimously for a new form of government and new ways of leadership.  Sadly, Mr. Speaker, this was 
<br/>not to last but this is not a time to dwell on that issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the sad events which have plagued our history themselves pass into history and after 
<br/>then, each time our economy has recovered. Sometimes we create new legal regime and we all try to 
<br/>move forward but we are also avoiding some hard truths, we are not looking deep inside ourselves to 
<br/>learn the lessons of the past. It is easier to look away from the painful events and perhaps pretend that 
<br/>they did not happen but constant echoes of divide, narratives of the past remind us that there are deep 
<br/>rooted wounds in many hearts unable to heal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of us can look away and pretend but when we do this, we forget the pain and suffering of 
<br/>those who cannot. The destruction of lives and careers, displacement from homes and physical and mental 
<br/>trauma and these are passed down generations through painful narratives, keeping us trapped in inter-
<br/>generational trauma; not all of us can move on. We need to come together as a nation to give true meaning 
<br/>to truth telling and achieving genuine reconciliation, helping our current, past and future generations to 
<br/>heal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reconciliation is a process of healing of relationships that require public truth sharing, apology 
<br/>and commemoration that acknowledges and redresses past harms and violations. Its focus is to replace 
<br/>fear  with  a  sense  of  security  and  peaceful  coexistence,  to  build  confidence  and  trust  and  to  develop 
<br/>empathy. Co-existence, trust and empathy has to develop between the individuals who are connected as 
<br/>victims, beneficiaries and perpetrators. We have to create safe spaces for sharing our stories, we have to 
<br/>ensure  all  sections  of  our  society  are  engaged  including  our  women,  young  and  elders  and  there  is 
<br/>continuity  to  ensure  healing  and  closure  and  narratives  that  help  us  move  forward  as  a  nation. 
<br/>Reconciliation requires political will, joint leadership, trust building, accountability and transparency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, in this House were entrusted less than one year ago with the votes of people exercising their 
<br/>democratic rights, the right to choose their leaders.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether we are in the government 
<br/>or opposition, here we are all leaders.  We are here because others put their trust in us.  That is why I hope 
<br/>that we will see our way unanimously to bring into being this Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  
<br/>This is not easy, it requires us to become vulnerable, to tell our truth, to engage in dialogue with people 
<br/>we are not comfortable with, to be able to listen to them with an open mind and open heart without 
<br/>judgement, with humility and with empathy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to give to those who have hurt us an honest chance to engage with us, to share honestly 
<br/></span><span>with them the impact of their actions on us.  We also need to explore how we have dealt with our hurts; 
<br/></span><span>hurt people, hurt people.  We need to acknowledge and reflect on our own words and actions, engage 
<br/>honestly and allow time and process to heal.  This will not be easy but healing and growth is never easy.  
<br/>We must do this, we cannot pass the pain and resentment of the present generation to those of the future.  
<br/>We cannot burden their innocence with our past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many lessons to learn from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, 
<br/>Canada, Sri Lanka and closer to home, Solomon Islands.  Our Commission will have to take into account 
<br/>our cultural context and may have to have Fijian flavour.  But let us be clear about one thing.  This is not 
<br/></span><span>about one community forgiving or seeking  forgiveness  from  another, this is  not  about divisions of 
<br/></span><span>race, religion or province even though those elements play a strong part in it, this is about each of us 
<br/>as human beings with all honesty to look deep into our hearts and confront the things that we have 
<br/>done which may have caused deep loss or hurt to others, people of other ethnic groups but also of 
<br/>our own.  Race is not the only fault lying in our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the civil unrest in 2000, I was part of a trauma healing and peaceful 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initiative lead by Father Frank Hoare, an outstanding Columbian priest who has now been in Fiji for 
<br/>50 years.  Through this process I was trained to be a peace facilitator. I joined the team for trauma 
<br/>healing in the Northern Division. Our first facilitation was held in Savusavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  workshop  created  a  space  for  many  factions  to  come  together.  There  were  rebels, 
<br/>members of the security forces and villagers.  They were all angry with the other; all angry and hurt.  
<br/>I did not facilitate that session but what observed taught me new realities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first time I saw that indigenous people considered themselves victims of the crisis 
<br/>while many of us Indo-Fijians saw them as perpetrators.  After a week long process, raw emotions 
<br/>and many tears, we realised that we were scratching the surface and there was a need for a deeper 
<br/>process.  As we travelled to Dreketi, Bua, Macuata and Wainikoro, we saw many indigenous people 
<br/>in confusion.  Some had lost their Indo-Fijian tenants and wanted them back.  They had lost, not just 
<br/>economic relationships but personal friendships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We met Indo-Fijian tenants who felt they had no sense of security and were packing to leave.  
<br/>We  also  met  indigenous  youth  who  were  embroiled  in  the  civil  unrest,  taken  to  task  by  security 
<br/>forces, confused because they said they only had done what the elders told them to do.  We met chiefs 
<br/>who said they thought they were fighting for a cause and were suddenly left high and dry to face the 
<br/>consequences on their own.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I saw similar sentiments in Ra and Tailevu, making me an Indo-Fijian realise there are a lot 
<br/>of unresolved issues within the indigenous community also.  When we had sessions with our armed 
<br/>forces, I realised that those who served as trusted peacekeepers carry many burdens of trauma from 
<br/>their assignments and personal losses that go unacknowledged.  I have listened to soldiers deeply 
<br/>affected by the 2000 mutiny. These emotions remain raw more than two decades later and needs a 
<br/>process enclosure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is much more I can talk about here.  I have not talked about the divisions 
<br/>within  the  Indo-Fijian  community.    The  minority  communities  such  as  the  Melanesians,  some  of 
<br/>whom still struggle with their sense of place and identity. But these are the things that do not belong 
<br/>here. They belong to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that I hope we will all endorse and 
<br/>support. Mr. Speaker, this is such a beautiful nation in every way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the differences, our people standby each other, not only during sports and festivals 
<br/>and joyous times but through every disaster we go through.  Our own identities are inter-twined.  As 
<br/></span><span>Fijians, we are incomplete without the presence of the others.  Only when we are able to heal and 
<br/></span><span>genuinely accept and love the other, we will truly have Fiji the way the world should be. We owe it 
<br/>to our future generations, Mr. Speaker, and I commend the motion.   May God bless Fiji with peace 
<br/>and prosperity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  on  the  motion. 
<br/>Right now, I have a list of three speakers from the Government side and I have not received a list of 
<br/>speakers from the Opposition.  So, honourable Prime Minister then followed by the Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister, honourable Professor Biman Prasad and rounded off by Deputy Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Viliame Gavoka.  Whilst we will begin, we will begin with the Government whilst we are waiting 
<br/></span><span>for your list, honourable Opposition Whip.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute and support the motion for a 
<br/>Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  moved  by  the  honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  the  motion  that  is 
<br/>before Parliament at this time.  Sir, the motion is probably going to be one of the most important in 
<br/>our parliamentary history.  The debate that is now going to unfold will similarly make its mark in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1801 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>annals of history of this  Parliament and of this nation.  The motion calls on us to lead Fiji into a 
<br/>national crusade of healing and reconciliation, to take our homeland, take our home into a new era 
<br/>of unity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier on this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in Papua New Guinea.  Also present was the 
<br/>Prime Minister of India, the honourable Narendra Modi and also representing His Excellency the 
<br/>President of the United States was Mr. Antony Blinken.  In our discussion in which they were both 
<br/>very intently listening to what I was going to say, they were both looking at me and I knew, they 
<br/>knew who I was at that meeting, who I am, who I was some years ago.  I proposed an idea for the 
<br/>Leaders of the Pacific that we should strive to make the Pacific a “zone of peace”.  That call is still 
<br/>being talked about in leadership circles in the Pacific and it is gaining traction in other parts of the 
<br/>world.  This motion as I said, leads Fiji into a national crusade of healing and reconciliation, to take 
<br/>our homeland into a new era of unity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Leader of the Opposition, I had proposed to bring 
<br/>a motion, this same motion. It was opposed in the Business Committee and defeated.  On 15</span><span>th</span><span> March 
<br/>that year, I had a dream and in my contribution to the Business Committee, I quoted the soothsayer 
<br/>in Julius Caesar because of the date.  Earlier on, the soothsayer had warned Julius Caesar, “Caesar, 
<br/>beware the Ides of March” and they were passing through the city on the Ides of March; 15</span><span>th</span><span> March.  
<br/>When Julius Caesar saw the soothsayer on the side of the road, he called out to him, “Behold the Ides 
<br/>of March are come”. The soothsayer spoke to Julius Caesar and said “Aye, Caesar, but not gone” and 
<br/>on that day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world heard of the massacre in Sri Lanka.  I thought that to me, it 
<br/>was a call; a call not only to try and find out what happened before 1987, what happened before 2000, 
<br/>what happened before 2006?  But why did it happen?  Why did those three events happen and appear 
<br/>in the calendar of unfortunate events in our country?  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  were  talking  about  the  motion,  I  thought,  I  should  not  move  it  because  in  this 
<br/>Parliament, I am the only one guilty of any activity that we would like to find out the background of. 
<br/>You should all support it because you want to know what happened, why we should not have it, why 
<br/>we  should  move  away  from  those  emotions  and  from  those  feelings.    I  believe  I  was  given  this 
<br/>opportunity  to  be  able  to  be  part  of  the  discussion  of  this  motion,  hopefully  we  will  agree  and 
<br/>contribute to the deliberations of the Commission.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must face the realities that we have.  Someone had even said that Fiji is now going through 
<br/>the most turbulent chapter in our independent history as mentioned by the honourable mover.  What 
<br/>do we do about it?  Do we just move away from it, and hope will heal the wounds or heal the sources 
<br/></span><span>of those ill-will that give rise to hostile activities and malicious thoughts that created those situations, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When South Africa went through their Truth and Reconciliation conferences and meetings, 
<br/>the Great Desmond Tutu said, “At times such as this, it is not enough to look for compromise. It calls 
<br/>on all of us to make sacrifice.”  Through this motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and driven by our combined 
<br/>resolve, we should  aim to remove the division  between our two main communities that have  co-
<br/>existed since well before Independence.  In fact, I was reminded recently that a commentator once 
<br/>described Fiji  as  probably  one of the most divided countries in  the  world, as  I mentioned and as 
<br/></span><span>mentioned also by the honourable mover.  But also, we are reminded of what His Holiness Pope John 
<br/></span><span>Paul II mentioned when he came to visit Fiji only a few years before 1987.  He said, “Fiji the way 
<br/>the world should be”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable mover mentioned the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
<br/>that was held in the Solomon Islands to try and resolve their inter-ethnic violence.  I was called by 
<br/>His  Excellency  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Commonwealth  to  try  and  broker  peace  among  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>1802 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>warring factions of the Solomon Islands.  At the end, I made a recommendation, recommending a 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know why His Excellency Mr. Jitoko (now Justice Titoko) had recommended me to 
<br/>the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth knowing of my own history in Fiji.  But during that 
<br/>time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I asked to go to the heart of the rebel camp. The people of Guadalcanal were 
<br/>the ones who were trying to drive the Malaitans off Guadalcanal.  I asked the Commissioner of Police, 
<br/>he said, “No it is unsafe, I cannot provide you any escort.”  So, I asked the Archbishop of the Roman 
<br/>Catholic Church.  He also told me that we could only go as far as the Balisuna Bridge and beyond 
<br/>that was not safe.  I went and I walked with my Deputy, Professor Adebowale Adefuye of Nigeria, 
<br/>who was sent by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were walking through the palm plantation, and I could see that the grass on both sides of 
<br/>the track had been disturbed.  I knew there were people probably hiding in the grass, under the grass 
<br/>or behind the grass.  All of a sudden, there was a whistle, and everyone stood up with their old World 
<br/>War II weapons and machete, and bows and arrows.  Up to that time, Adefuye was asking me, “What 
<br/>is that in your hands?”  I said, “Do not worry, you will find it useful.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they all got up, I sat down in the middle of the road and brought out a bundle of </span><span>waka.  
<br/></span><span>I clapped my hands </span><span>(cobo)</span><span> and presented the </span><span>yaqona </span><span>to the rebels and their commanders in Fijian.  
<br/>Everything in Fijian up to “</span><span>Soso ratu!</span><span>” and out of the group someone called out “E!”.  He moved 
<br/>forward, took up the </span><span>waka</span><span> from my hands, gave it to the Commander who gave it back to him and 
<br/>he received it in the language of </span><span>Sawakasa,</span><span> people of Tailevu or the dialect which he had picked up 
<br/>during his time at Fulton.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But that simple presentation, he went on and explained everything to his commanders and to 
<br/>the fighters, who accepted that they should come into the next village hall to talk.  I asked if I could 
<br/>bring the Commissioner of Police, and they said no, not yet.  “Can I bring the Archbishop of the 
<br/>Roman Catholic Church.”  They said yes.  So we continued the discussion until they agreed to speak 
<br/>to some politicians.  They also asked for someone who was to represent them.  That was the beginning 
<br/>of the talks that gave rise to my report which was the foundation of the establishment of the Regional 
<br/>Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).  Some of you may have participated when you 
<br/>were in the Forces at the time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We again took a chartered flight later on when things did not get off the ground.  A group of 
<br/>friends from Congress and the Senate in the United States flew down to Australia, and called me to 
<br/></span><span>join them in Brisbane, where they had hired an aircraft which flew us to Port Moresby.  I was allowed 
<br/></span><span>to see the Governor General and the Prime Minister.  As we walked into the Prime Minister’s office, 
<br/>I saw our own Minister for Foreign Affairs sitting there waiting for an appointment, or an opening to 
<br/>go and see the Prime Minister.  I said to him, “</span><span>Tu Inoke, e vakacava?  Au wara’a ji’o me dua noqu 
<br/>appointment.  Oi, o kemudou?  Sega neitou appointment, ‘eitou sa la’o madaga  yani iloma</span><span>”.  So we 
<br/>went to see the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea without an appointment, spoke to him and what 
<br/>we said was “maintain harmonious co-existence among the people of Papua New Guinea”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We came to the Solomon Islands, everyone was in their bunkers.  The Governor-General was 
<br/></span><span>the only one that could see us, Sir Peter Kenilorea.  No-one was serving him, only the ADC. We 
<br/></span><span>spoke to him, we asked for his cooperation.  We looked for cigar that night Mr. Speaker, Sir, because 
<br/>one of our friends could not sleep without smoking cigar so I said, who knows Honiara?   He said I 
<br/>know.  At this time the only place open would probably be a Mess but they do not have a Mess or 
<br/>the Yacht Club, they have a Yacht Club.  They managed to open the Yacht Club and brought a cigar 
<br/>out for my friend.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1803 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We went to Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa all without an appointment but we were received.  I 
<br/>think something had preceded us.  I think it was the spirit for peace or the strive for reconciliation 
<br/>among the people. We managed to get everyone to come and talk even when we did not have an 
<br/>appointment and when they asked me at the end, what do you think of the Solomons?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Solomons is like driving along and you see someone that has been hit by a hit and run driver 
<br/>and you pick him up and take him to the hospital.  The doctor looks at him and they say we have to 
<br/>administer blood transfusion.  They save the life and when the comes to, he is strong and he sees 
<br/>blood flowing to his veins, “I cannot have this, I am not allowed to have this” why not? In my belief 
<br/>I am not allowed to receive anyone else’s blood. The doctors had to do what they had to do, but he 
<br/>had to sign and then he signs but he was alright.  He had already received how many pints of blood 
<br/>but  he  was  alright.    That  was  the  story  I  checked  -  Solomon  needed  that.    Solomon  needed  that 
<br/>injection of people to work for Solomon Island’s peace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this case we are fortunate, we are moving our own motion.  We are going to be debating 
<br/>this motion for our own peace, for our own harmonious co-existence with one another and I challenge 
<br/>you all.  You do not have any reason to oppose this, I have but I am opening it up.  I would probably 
<br/>want to hide a lot of things I know, none of you has anything to hide so we should cooperate and 
<br/>work for this because I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to develop the idea of the Pacific 
<br/>being a zone of peace and also the Commonwealth of the Pacific, to be one that can be enjoyed by 
<br/>everyone in the Pacific and the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have so much to offer the world but how can we go and offer something that we do not 
<br/>have?  If we can do that here, I am encouraged by the language in Parliament; by the way we are 
<br/>interacting with one another and I hope that we can take that out of Parliament and spread it amongst 
<br/>the people and also find out for ourselves what we can do better for the future generations. With those 
<br/>words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  leading  the  batting  and 
<br/>honourable Members for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders and with respect to the 
<br/>sitting times.
