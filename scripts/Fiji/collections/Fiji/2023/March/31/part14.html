<div><span>Maintaining Institutional Integrity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  commence,  you  would  notice  that  my 
<br/>lectern is a little bit slanted towards you.  This is to confirm with your direction to me on the first 
<br/>day that I have to learn to be an MP, to remind me that I have to direct my speech to you.  I hope 
<br/>that later on, you might give me some feedback if my skin is thick enough also as an MP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise to deliver one of the two End of Week Statements from this side of Parliament. It is on 
<br/>maintaining institutional integrity, a subject that is close to my heart. Given the past lives that I have 
<br/></span><span>had and heads of some of these institutions as a Permanent Secretary, as a Director and just recently 
<br/></span><span>as the Commander of RFMF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, institutionally integrity in the public sector especially is particularly important 
<br/>due to the public character of these institutions that implies public trust in the institutions’ practices, 
<br/>operations and policies.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         End of Week Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there has been a relentless attack on our public institutions since December 
<br/>2022,  and  if  I  can  just  use  one.    On  29</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  2022,  five  days  after  being  sworn  in,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration announced to the public that he had asked 
<br/>the Commissioner of Police to resign and the reason stated to the public was that, he did not trust 
<br/>the Commissioner due to his previous affiliation with the previous Government.  And I emphasise, 
<br/>Mr.  
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that this was aired in public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When it is publicly stated that the Minister does not trust ahead of a Disciplined Force, it 
<br/>resonates down to the lowest rung of the organisation.  It creates doubt, it creates uncertainty in their 
<br/>minds as to how they should behave. Their own integrity is watered  down, and it has a negative 
<br/>effect on the institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In major leadership, there is a golden rule and that is, you never criticise and officer in front 
<br/>of his men or women, and criticising heads of institutions publicly has the same effect as breaking 
<br/>that golden rule.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in addition to this example, the Judiciary, the Civil Servants are suffering the 
<br/>same fate also Permanent Secretaries have been terminated, they have been forced to resign.  In the 
<br/>words  of  one,  he  said  that  he  was  advised  by  the  Public  Service  Commission  Chairman  of  the 
<br/>discontinuation  of  his  contract,  and  he  claims  that  this  is  based  entirely  on  the  Government’s 
<br/>preference and not on performance. No consideration at all on the impact of their decision, on the 
<br/>faithful Civil Servants who work under his very experienced and hardworking PS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that Ministry, I was their Permanent Secretary for approximately 
<br/>three years. If you go and ask the staff, “What did your PS did wrong?”  They will tell you, “Nothing” 
<br/>or “we do not know, he was a good PS.”  I have, no doubt, that his former Minister who is here, will 
<br/>say the same if you ask him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Is that professionalism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Acting  Permanent  Secretaries  have  been  appointed  in  very 
<br/>questionable  circumstances.    Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  integrity  of  the  institution  is  violated.  
<br/>Government statutory bodies, Government owned companies, iTLTB, Boards are all suffering the 
<br/>same.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It started in 2006. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, those who were at 
<br/>the top were removed or forced to resign, replaced by another Board. The Chairman was replaced 
<br/>by the founder of a political party.  He wanted to show his power and organised the lavish party to 
<br/>unveil the new logo of the company, a logo that is available online for free, turn the </span><span>Davui</span><span> around a 
<br/>little bit, only to return to the original logo the next day or few days later and in the process, according 
<br/>to the honourable Minister of Finance, wasted over $26,000.  Just like that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I had just returned from Tonga last Sunday, as you had directed, to attend the 
<br/></span><span>CPA MP induction event that was held over there.  One of the Tongan MPs or Emele to be exact, 
<br/>told me what he said in their assembly and this what he said to the Tongan assembly, and I quote:  
<br/>“</span><span>Tapau tekeuki  Falealea , o ko e ha fiekaia, kua pau kekeulu akai kai koe.” </span><span>In English it says, “If 
<br/>you come to Parliament hungry, you will eat first.  If you come to Parliament hungry for power, you 
<br/>will eat first.  You will target those that are in power.  If you come to Parliament hungry for political 
<br/>vengeance …

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- 2006 and it continued for 16 years.  Talk about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- …you will eat first.  You will abuse your political power for political 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vengeance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- And we have seen the results already.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I apologise for the noise coming from the other side, Mr. Speaker, I 
<br/>think I must have hit the wrong note.  But if they say or if one says that they come to Parliament 
<br/>hungry for service or hungry to serve, I will say that this Parliament is the wrong place for them 
<br/>because  if  you  say  that  you  come  here  hungry  to  serve,  what  have  you  been  doing?  These 
<br/>opportunities to serve are just all around us in all facets of our lives – in our family, in our </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, 
<br/>in our village, in our communities, to the Vanua, to the Church. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if they say they are hungry to come in to serve, it implies that they have not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been serving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance talks about a mess that they have to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- But the way they are operating – listening to the question and answer 
<br/>sessions in this Chamber and watching what is happening outside, some of which I have highlighted 
<br/>today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is akin to someone who is trying to mop an already clean floor with a pair 
<br/>of muddy boots on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- You reach the other side and look back and see the big mess that you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have created. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to build up our institutions instead of diluting its values, weakening 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the spine that holds these institutions together.  We need to maintain our institutional integrity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Our public institutions – the Civil Service, the Police, the Military, 
<br/></span><span>they  prop  up  and  support  our  young  democracy.    They  provide  continuity  of  governance  during 
<br/>elections, during the formation of governments, even a change of government like now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since Election began in Fiji, members of these institutions have been going out to vote – like 
<br/>everyone else with the freedom to choose whoever they wish and after Elections, they will go back 
<br/>to work, regardless of who is in power and who they voted for.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- They do that because their intuitional integrity is maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, politicians like us, governments will come and go, but it is 
<br/>the loyalty and integrity of these institutions that holds our democracy together, that allow us to do 
<br/>that transition.  They need no interference, unnecessary interference from politicians or governments 
<br/>for that matter.  The integrity of these institutions must be maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit, Sir, I send my wishes to the Fijian Rugby Teams that are playing this weekend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  thank the honourable Member for his End of the 
<br/>Week Statement. I would like to assure this august Parliament and the nation that we will try and do 
<br/>what you are asking us to do, even though you may not have done what you are asking us to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 35(2), I asked for leave to be given to the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General if he wants if we do not have the bell on time and also the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Defence to also respond to the End of the Week Statement, if they wish to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Standing  Order  35(2)  states  that  the  Right  of  Reply  to  each  of  these 
<br/>speeches by the Minister or Ministers as you emphasised also in your instructions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>or the subject matter of the Member’s speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, can I just intervene, I will be asking an advice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the Secretary-General on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Right, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, the answer is in the affirmative and the only thing that I would 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like to insist is you will be sharing the 10 minutes with your colleagues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, that is what I made clear, if the bell does 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not go while I am still on my feet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government acknowledges the Constitutional integrity.  We know that 
<br/>it is of utmost importance to ensure that those who make decisions on behalf of the people, or the 
<br/>public do so fairly and in a transparent manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that we are in very powerful positions, and we pray that God 
<br/>will grant us the right character to exercise power, and also exercise it in accordance with the rules 
<br/></span><span>of law and that we remain accountable to the people that we serve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As provided under the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Constitution shall be upheld and 
<br/>respected by all Fijians and the State, including all person holding public office.  Therefore, in order 
<br/>to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  Constitution  and  our  system  of  Government,  adherence  to  the 
<br/>provisions is essential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         End of Week Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>679 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Constitution does have provisions for amendments, so 
<br/>a review of the Constitution is followed by the Constitution itself because it is not set in stone, but 
<br/>it is very difficult, as we all know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I started by saying that we heard from honourable Naupoto of what we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should all look out for, that we do not do what he has accused us of having done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought it is a bit rich for the Opposition to go on about the rule of law 
<br/>and respect for the integrity of institutions of the State and I believe they have not been very honest 
<br/>in observing that simple rule. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not had Municipal Councils elections. They are institutions that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are set in our Statutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Constitutional  Offices  Commission  recognises  the  fact  that  Fiji’s 
<br/>Constitution  frame  the  rule  of  law  by  which  all  citizens  live,  including  us  the  Members  of  the 
<br/>Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also know that recently, we have not been able to hold meetings since the resignation of 
<br/>the former Leader of the Opposition and now that we have honourable Seruiratu as the new Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  we  look  forward  to  getting  his  participation  in  the  Constitution  Officers 
<br/>Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that we all learn from our own experiences.  For some years, Sir, 
<br/>while some Members of the Opposition now were members of the Regime, my pension entitlement 
<br/>was taken away and I was not given any reason. Some of it was restored a few years later but it was 
<br/>not enough to cover for the bank penalties when I was late in the repayment of my loan in the bank.  
<br/>It did not pay for the hardship that I and my family had, but I agree we must all respect the institutions 
<br/>we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  Member  of  the  Constitution  Offices  Commission,  we  have  had  to 
<br/>recommend the suspension of some of our Constitutional Office holders. They have been on full pay 
<br/>on the assumption that accused persons are assumed innocent until proven guilty, and I hope that we 
<br/>can do that and apply back.  I had mentioned many times something that I got from the biography 
<br/>on Abraham Lincoln - Do what is right, have malice towards none. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  get  the  message  from  honourable  Naupoto  that  we  must  respect  the  integrity  of  the 
<br/>institutions and we will try and do that. Our transitionary period is coming to an end. Our 100 days 
<br/>is coming up, so if you have noticed that we have misbehaved in this period, I ask that you bear with 
<br/>us, it is coming to an end and from here on, we will not be able to make any excuses for being new 
<br/>on the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I encourage all of us to bring to the attention of Government and those of us in Parliament, 
<br/>any concerns you may have about what we may be perceived to be not doing correctly.  I feel for 
<br/>those that get displaced, I feel for those that get subjected to the law and I feel for those that will 
<br/></span><span>eventually suffer the consequences of their actions if they are proven guilty and it is difficult.  I am 
<br/></span><span>glad that we all have had experiences, or some of us have, of going through this difficult periods in 
<br/>our lives.  It teaches us to be humble, to be law-abiding and to avoid them happening again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this case, it is the respect for the various institutions, I have a list of persons who were not 
<br/>properly treated by the previous Government, and I do not want to mention their names.  I think they 
<br/>are already embarrassed enough at this time, probably suffering already, and I do not want to twist 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the knife in their wounds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I thank honourable Naupoto for bringing this up and I expected no less from a person 
<br/>who has had a good run of whom much had been expected and now he expects much from us, and I 
<br/>call on this side of Parliament that we listen to what he said, we do what is right and let us have 
<br/>malice towards none.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank you, honourable Members.  I thank honourable Naupoto for his 
<br/>End of the Week Statement.  It is the first time that we have managed to seek advice again as to how 
<br/>many Ministers can reply to your statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure Development Growth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I thank you,  Sir, for giving me 
<br/>the  opportunity  to  talk  on  this  issue  that  I  regard    as  a  very  important  issue  -  infrastructure  - 
<br/>infrastructure development and the importance of infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No one in this Parliament is not aware of the importance of infrastructure.  It is critical to 
<br/>development, growth and as a result of that, critical to making sure that we develop or build a better 
<br/>quality of life for all the people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People everywhere want –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>good infrastructure; 
<br/>smooth and safe roads; 
<br/>timely boats that move passengers and freight around a wide range of destinations; 
<br/>clean water; 
<br/>reliable sanitation; 
<br/>easy access broadband internet connectivity and electricity available 24/7; 
<br/>well managed and functional airports and seaports to enable connection with the rest of the 
<br/>world and even within our country; 
<br/>schools  and  hospitals  to  ensure  wellbeing,  including  a  healthy  and  well-equipped 
<br/>workforce and they want the delivery of services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic and social infrastructure is amongst the most important functions of Government, 
<br/></span><span>and it is a key to how citizens perceive the role and effectiveness of Government.  This is something 
<br/></span><span>that we have understood during our time, and I am sure that the current Government is very, very 
<br/>well aware of that also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, infrastructure is  not  an easy thing to  keep up to  standard.  The state of 
<br/>infrastructure in this country, where we have had massive infrastructure progress over the years, and 
<br/>we all know that.  Back to the 1970s we have seen them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Monasavu power, this is huge infrastructure project and had a huge impact on a large 
<br/></span><span>number of people in Fiji.  It had a huge impact on lives in a daily basis, on businesses and schools.  
<br/></span><span>The Nagado Water Project, which is now feeding Lautoka and Nadi, which is the growing hub of 
<br/>the tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Already they are beginning to face problems and it will be incumbent upon those that are 
<br/>now in charge of this area to make sure that we can provide enough water to that area which is going 
<br/>to be the growing part of Fiji over the next 10 to 15 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>

<div><span>         End of Week Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>681 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Suva-Nadi Highway, and there are so many others, that various Governments along the 
<br/>way have been able to improve.  But if you are improving, Mr. Speaker, infrastructure is always a 
<br/>challenge.  Every single government will see infrastructure as a challenge that needs to be addressed 
<br/>because the needs grow, the demand grows, the existing infrastructure becomes old, and it needs to 
<br/>be upgraded and targets begin to change.  What is important in one era changes over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the Bainimarama Government came into power, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also came across 
<br/>those challenges.  Especially for the roads, we looked at the acid deterioration that was there.  A lot 
<br/>of the acid deterioration was because of historic underfunding on maintaining the assets.  That is 
<br/>always the challenge - finding the assets to maintain your existing assets as you want to grow and 
<br/>build new assets, as more people want to get benefits from the infrastructure that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vehicle  overloading,  resource  availability  -  we  talked  about  sand  and  gravel  aggregates 
<br/>today.  The importance of having access to those, whilst at the same time maintaining their pristine 
<br/>nature of the environment that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Design and construction capabilities are our abilities to be able to do that and uncontrolled 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development sometimes makes it hard to be able to manage infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over and above this, is now the big problem of our time and our age - the climate change.  
<br/>The impact this is having - phenomenal impact, huge impact on our infrastructure because a lot of it 
<br/>was put in places before we got so worried about sea level rise.  Before, we were not so worried 
<br/>about sea level inundation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lots of bridges needed to be fixed, a lot of roads, crossings, all of these were the problems 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we had to deal with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On water, access to water, getting water to all of our citizens - a clean, reliable and safe water 
<br/>is not always easy.  A lot of our parents when you go to the villages, people drank from the streams.  
<br/>Now, people do not want that anymore, that is a huge challenge to be able to move in that direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then the issue of sanitation, the Deputy Prime Minister talked about it as a challenge.  There 
<br/>have  been  improvements  made  to  this  area  -  sanitation,  but  it  is  still  a  major  challenge.    Rural 
<br/>sanitation, challenges for power - rural and urban.  ICT connectivity for ports and wharves all around 
<br/>our country, airports, schools and hospitals.  All of these always have significant problems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not saying that the Governments that existed before that did not have problems.  All 
<br/>governments always see that these are problems because the goal posts are always changing, and the 
<br/>context is always changing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  since  then,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Bainimarama  Government  came  in  and  the 
<br/>FijiFirst, there were some things that they have tried to do to try to address this, and one was the 
<br/>manner in which we try to deliver on the services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past, the focus was within Government to deliver the services through Government 
<br/></span><span>operations.  But over that time, looking at the dilapidated state of the infrastructure at that particular 
<br/></span><span>point in time, there was a move to move away from that to develop semi-autonomous bodies that 
<br/>still operated under the ambit of Government, but they had the freedom to develop themselves to 
<br/>deliver the services on their own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was what you have seen with the development of Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) in 
<br/>2010 - take it out of the Water and Sewerage Department, establish it as a body, so they can begin

<div><span>to do the service and can be more nimble on its feet.  This will not be restricted by the restrictions 
<br/>that might cover a government department and go out and do its work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same thing we also saw for the development of the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) in 2012.  
<br/>So, there is a massive change from the way we deliver this service in the past - from Government 
<br/>doing on its own, setting up bodies, independent, semi-independent, autonomous with the freedom 
<br/>and flexibility to go out and deliver addressing these very important issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This also bought with it the opportunity for us to build a local industry in these areas - a lot 
<br/>of capacity to build roads, a lot of capacity to develop water.  When we move these services out and 
<br/>we allowed others in the private sector to take on these roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was the ongoing development of Energy Fiji Limited (EFL).  If you go back many 
<br/>years, you will remember that the big power producer in Fiji was not FEA, it used to be the Suva 
<br/>City Council (SCC).  The FEA used to be a small entity in the West but over time that has been 
<br/>changed.  Now, FEA has become EFL and has grown.  It has become this entity that will move 
<br/>forward.  It is now become (if I am not mistaken) a liability company.  It has been privatised to some 
<br/>extent, although Government still has its major focus there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ports  -  there  have  been  massive  changes  in  the  structure  and  approach  of  Ports.    The 
<br/>management systems they have in Ports have really changed.  It used to be just run by Government, 
<br/>now it has been broken up into different companies.  The assets are maintained with Government, 
<br/>but different companies are operating on the ports to raise its effectiveness and efficiency.  So, we 
<br/>have  seen  massive  investments  over  the  past  16  years  in  infrastructure  -  roads,  water,  power, 
<br/>wharves, jetties, crossings, wastewater, ICT, schools – all have huge increases in investments in this 
<br/>area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  seen  the  developments  -  roads  being  built,  highways,  others  in  the  pipeline  at 
<br/>various stages for four-lane highways Suva-Nausori, around Nadi, around the Tourism Sector which 
<br/>has been at the heart of our economy, rural roads, the fixing of jetties, crossings, all of these have 
<br/>been impacting the people’s lives.  It has allowed accessibility - the economy to grow, and it has 
<br/>allowed to grow on all of us.  Massive investments in roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In water, have you ever seen the biggest problem in water over these past decade that we are 
<br/>feeling now?  I am feeling it now in my own home the access to water - the access to the water in 
<br/>Viria Project which is one of the major projects that we have had.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been major pressures because of rural urban drift into these areas that has brought 
<br/>restrictions in water.  We are now currently in phase 1 of this project, $270 million has been paid, 
<br/>the pipelines have been built and coming down from Viria to Waila.  Now, the tanks are already 
<br/>built in Raralevu.  The tanks are ready, all they need is the water to come from Viria, fill those tanks 
<br/>and they will fill the Rewa Delta.  They will meet the needs there.  Many rural water projects are 
<br/>going. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major increases in access to power.  Rural access to power has been increased.  We removed 
<br/></span><span>the deposit for grid extensions, so now when you want to bring the grid to your area, you do not 
<br/></span><span>have to pay a deposit, Government pays that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The emphasis on solar home systems - all of these has brought massive changes.  Massive 
<br/>transformation in the ports to an extent where our ports have been recognised internationally for 
<br/>how effective they have become.  It has also raised efficiency.   I think they won the Oceania’s Best 
<br/>Cruise Terminal 2021 Award at the World Cruise Awards.

<div><span>Sir, ICT infrastructure - we removed the restrictions in ICT, we broke down the monopoly.  
<br/>We brought down the charges to an extend now where a lot of people have one or two phones and 
<br/>as a result of that, we built the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, may I remind you a Government is in place now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Can I just get to my conclusion then? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I have tried to identify the massive improvements that are being undertaken, but there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are few things that I want to ask.  Is everything perfect now?  No, it is not!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it will be very hard for anyone to ever come to a point in time when we say that it is 
<br/>not perfect.  But what we did, we prepared the 20 Year Strategic Development Plan because we 
<br/>know for infrastructure, you have to lay it out over a long period of time.  It is not something that 
<br/>you can do in a short period of time.  We also had the National Climate Finance Strategy to cover 
<br/>all the things that needed to be addressed as a result of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the important questions as I have been standing in Parliament, I have 
<br/>been listening to all the Ministers asking, “I need more money for this  sector, and I think this is 
<br/>going to be the critical question for Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure is going to require funding and all the other sectors.  The key question is, what 
<br/>are  we  going  to  prioritise  first?    When?    Do  we  first  give  our  emphasis  on  structures  like 
<br/>infrastructure which, in turn, can help grow other sectors, or do we do other sectors first?  I that is 
<br/>the key question for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my own mind, I believe that infrastructure is a sector that if financed well, managed well, 
<br/>will help all the other sectors in Fiji.  I know that it is the role of Government to keep taking this 
<br/>forward, and I believe all the citizens of Fiji would like you to succeed, to take what you have been 
<br/>given as a legacy from FijiFirst and take it and make it work better to the best of your ability because 
<br/>when we come back, we will make it even better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to wish everyone in Fiji and all the children of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji in particular, a happy Palm Sunday this week.  </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister for Public Works, I think I will not allow a response 
<br/>on that because he was just complementing what was already here, what is already running, as a 
<br/>result of the Elections that we have just completed.
