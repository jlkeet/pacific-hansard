<h3>LARGE COUNCILS</h3>
<div><span>LARGE COUNCILS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These years from 2007-2011, the Council’s outstanding rates ranged increased from $2 
<br/>million  to  $2.5  million  due  to  change  in  new  subdivision  and  introduction  of  new 
<br/>Unimproved Capital Value (UCV).  
<br/>The rates outstanding increased from $2.5 million to $3 million in year 2012 was due 
<br/>to the implementation of the increased rates from Sexennial Valuation.  
<br/>In the year 2020, the rates collection dropped to 81 percent due to COVID-19 and there 
<br/>was  an  increase  in  the  rates  outstanding  to  $3.1  million.  Hence,  rates  collection 
<br/>increased in 2021 post-COVID and the rates outstanding reduced to $2.5 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Council’s  invoice  is  around  $2  million  and  the  Council  had  around  $820,000 
<br/>arrears from previous years. The Council had last rates increased in 2009.  
<br/>The Council managed to collect rates from the current and outstanding, yet the arrears 
<br/>from previous outstanding increased due to the accumulating compound interest.  
<br/>The Council has a good collection of rates, however, due to the COVID impact and 
<br/>compound interest on arrears have led to vast increase in the outstanding from 2007 to 
<br/>2022.
