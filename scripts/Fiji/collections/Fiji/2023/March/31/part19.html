<div><span>The Council does not have proper records on rates data from 2007-2011. 
<br/></span><span>In 2014 the rates were increased through Sexennial Valuation and this led to an 
<br/>increase from $7 million to $8.7 million. 
<br/>The collection rate reduced in 2019 and 2020 and the outstanding increased to $12 
<br/>million.  The Council have lodged long pending dues with the Court.

<div><span>The Council does not have proper records on rates data from 2007 to 2011. The figures have 
<br/>been pulled from audited FS which does not show rates collection  separately but collective 
<br/>figure for receipts from customers as the revenue for the Council. Thus, rates increased in 
<br/>2014 through Sexennial Valuation.

<div><span>The collection of rates reduced in these years due to COVID-19 effect yet managed to collect 
<br/>over  50  percent  of  the  rates.  The  rates  were  also  increased  in  2020  through  Sexennial 
<br/>Valuation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Comparing  collection  from  2007  till  2011,  the  Council  had  gradually  increased  in  the 
<br/>collection of rates. 
<br/>The Council managed to collect 50 percent in the year 2012.  However, in the next four 
<br/>years, the rates collection reduced to 36 percent.  There was increase in invoicing due 
<br/>to subdivision and rezoning. 
<br/>Due to COVID pandemic, the rate collection really reduced to 39 percent collection 
<br/>and gradually increased in its collection.  Also note that the rates were increased in 
<br/>2021 through Sexennial Valuation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Good  collection.  Outstanding  was  around  7  percent  to  11  percent  of  the  invoicing 
<br/>amount. 
<br/>Good  collection.  Outstanding  was  around  5  percent  to  9  percent  of  the  invoicing 
<br/>amount. 
<br/>Good collection from 2017 to 2020 ranging between 93 percent to 86 percent. However, 
<br/>collection dropped in 2021 to 65 percent and then increased in 2022 to 77 percent.  The 
<br/>reduced collection would have been due to the rates increased in 202 through  Sexennial 
<br/>Valuation.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council had good collection of rates and reduced the outstanding from $6 million 
<br/>to $1 million. 
<br/>Collection reduction dropped due to the increase in new subdivisions, revaluation of 
<br/>properties  and  increase  in  unit  cent,  and  also  increase  in  rates  through  Sexennial 
<br/>Valuation. 
<br/>The Council collection reduced in 2019 and 2020, however, regained its collection to 
<br/>71 percent after COVID-19.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council does not have proper record keeping and documents to determine the percentage 
<br/>collection from 2007 to 2010. Thus, 89 percent collection indicates for 2011.

<div><span>Due to increase in rates in 2016 through  Sexennial Valuation and COVID, the rates 
<br/>collection fluctuated in these years, yet managed to collect more than 50 percent per
