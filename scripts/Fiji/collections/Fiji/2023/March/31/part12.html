<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with 
<br/>a 10-minute response time by the Minister responsible or Ministers responsible for the subject matter 
<br/>of the Member’s speech.  No seconder is required and there will be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now call on honourable Sashi Kiran to deliver her End of the Week 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social Pension Scheme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation is an important Government 
<br/>Ministry as we deal directly with the most vulnerable in our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has been mandated to administer Social Protection Programmes that include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>care and protection of our children; 
<br/>provision of income support to families to address poverty; 
<br/>provision of policy intervention for older persons; 
<br/>Provision of policy intervention for persons with disabilities; 
<br/>community-based correction; and to  
<br/>monitor, evaluate and report on progress and impact of Government’s Poverty Alleviation 
<br/>Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry, in this fiscal year, had been allocated $147,684,400 of which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Capital Budget is $2.1 million and Operating Budget is $144.7 million.  It must be noted that 85

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent  of  Operating  Budget  or  $124.2  million  is  allocated  towards  the  Social  Protection 
<br/>Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these Social Protection Programmes are designed to reduce vulnerability 
<br/>and poverty while increasing resilience against sudden shocks, like pandemics and natural disasters. 
<br/>Currently, there are six major Social Protection Programmes that are implemented by the Ministry, 
<br/>as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social Pension Scheme; a non-contributory pension for older persons (ages 65 years and 
<br/>above) and it was meant for people who have never received superannuation through Fiji 
<br/>National Provident Fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty  Benefit  Scheme;  aimed  at  providing  a  safety  net  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable. 
<br/>Poverty targeted cash transfer aims at improving welfare of the poorest and to break the 
<br/>intergenerational cycle of poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Care and Protection Allowance; a child benefit for vulnerable children under the age of 18 
<br/>years.   Support is  available  for single parents, deserted spouses, death of breadwinner, 
<br/>prisoners dependent, foster parents/guardians, and children in foster or institutional care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Pregnant Mothers Programme; was established in 2014 and is designed to support 
<br/>women who are pregnant and living in rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Busfare  Subsidy  Scheme;  it  was  introduced  in  2011  and  is  aimed  at  supporting  older 
<br/>persons aged 60 plus and persons with disability who uses the bus fare services in Fiji as  
<br/>a mode of transportation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Disability Allowance; assist individuals with permanent disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These Schemes added together as of 5</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 have been assisting an estimated 96,966 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recipients:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty Benefit Scheme - Government from 2016 to 2021 had committed $185,696,446 
<br/>and assisted $127,082 recipients. 
<br/>Care  and  Protection  Allowance  -  Government  from  2016  to  2021  had  committed  $46 
<br/>million and assisted 34,797 recipients. 
<br/>Social Pension Scheme - Government from 2016 to 2021 had committed $212 million and 
<br/>assisted 199,331 recipients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Poverty Benefit Scheme and Care and Protection Allowance are meant 
<br/>to  be  safety  nets  for  individuals  for  a  certain  period  of  time  until  they  can  be  enabled  through 
<br/>graduation support programme to ensure all deserving families are assisted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  joining  this  Office,  I  have  discovered  that  our  staff  are  overworked  and  burnt  out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because there are no clear pathways in most of the Poverty Alleviation Programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welfare Graduation Programme has been halted by the previous Government and does not 
<br/>exist  since  2019.    So,  those  on  the  Scheme  have  stayed,  for  example,  families  impacted  by  </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span> in 2016, who had lost their homes now have rebuilt their home and livelihood are still on 
<br/>the Scheme, just to give an example. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot had been said by politicians about what I said in a meeting in Ra to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023

<div><span>669 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gain political milage. At that meeting, I discussed stories of many relatives who are taking care of 
<br/>their vulnerable, even if they have migrated and I know our people have strong sense of values and 
<br/>do not tap into services unless they are in need and Government has a responsibility to take care of 
<br/>the most vulnerable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we are finding that means test was not always applied and our teams have shared 
<br/>that in some cases, there were political pressure applied on them to validate the cases who did not 
<br/>qualify.  So, I call out the politicians to stop using poor people for their personal gain and if you 
<br/>really care about the vulnerable, work with our Ministry and identify pathways for these individuals 
<br/>so they can enjoy a sustainable livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, social protection should be responsive to the needs of the people and there should be 
<br/>support system to help them improve their status in life.  Post pandemic, we met many single mums 
<br/>who had lost their jobs  and could not get on Social Protection Scheme.  During that time, I was 
<br/>involved  in  design  and  implementation  of  the  Livelihood  Support  Programme  for  single  mums 
<br/>offered by FRIEND. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance  varied  from  $600  to  $3,000  and  evaluation  of  the  programme  indicated  that 
<br/>assistance yielded income of $500 to $2,000 a month for these recipients. Families are able to cater 
<br/>for their various needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  social  protection,  the  amounts  they  receive  are  very  limited  and  while  we  are 
<br/>looking at improving these, those who are able-bodied and need support should be supported with 
<br/>livelihood options - a programme we are working on developing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, additionally, we discovered that State Homes are dilapidated, and elders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Wards of State kept in these facilities have had to live in really poor condition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been working on renovations and repair of these facilities with various partners.  
<br/>There were no clear plans for girls who are Wards of State living in Institutional Homes when they 
<br/>turn 18 and boys at the age of 12.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foster Care System has lapsed over the past years. We are meeting with various stakeholders 
<br/>to plan and improve delivery of services to address the issue of care for our children, people living 
<br/>with disabilities and street dwellers. So, trust me, Mr. Speaker, we have been cleaning up and trying 
<br/>to fix the many challenges left behind while they politicise the issue of care of the people in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is also interesting is that in the Election year, the Bus Fare Programme amount was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accumulated and not based on usage method which created a shortfall for the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, no Government or Ministry will be so cruel to terminate allowance of welfare 
<br/>recipients without a proper reason or justification. Every government around the world strives to 
<br/>have programmes and policies which are sustainable and promotes a resilient society.  We need to 
<br/>analyse, understand the challenges, before tackling issues surrounding our most vulnerable. That is 
<br/>what, we, at the Ministry are currently working towards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Australia Government through its flagship social protection programme - Partnerships 
<br/>for Social Protection Programme (P4SP) is currently conducting a review of the social assistance 
<br/>programmes that will provide key recommendations around strengthening the processes and systems 
<br/>that underpin the assistance schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the Ministry is also working with the World Bank to design a draft Adaptive 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social Protection Strategy and Implementation Plan for Fiji, with a view to enable key government 
<br/>agencies to respond to covariate shocks, such as national disasters, by investing in the capacity of 
<br/>poor and vulnerable households to prepare for, cope with, and adapt to shocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World Bank is also providing technical assistance to the Ministry in reviving the Welfare 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Graduation Programme with stronger linkages with the new employment programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, as the Government, take our commitment to take of the most vulnerable 
<br/>of our society very seriously and we will continue to serve the most vulnerable.  So, I call on the 
<br/>stakeholders, please, let us pitch in together and work for the greater good of our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg your indulgence. I heard with a lot of interest today and earlier this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>week the conversation around the Yellow Ribbon Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The origins  of the Programme began under the leadership of Commissioner Aisea Taoka 
<br/>between 2003 and 2006.   It  was borne out  of an initiative of rehabilitation as part of an income 
<br/>initiative for prisoners I had designed when FRIEND started working with the prison.  It was one of 
<br/>the first income generation programme for inside and outside prisoners and it was funded by DFAT 
<br/>and after revaluating successes and failures, the programme kept evolving in design.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Australian consultants evaluated and indicated that the reoffending rate had dropped by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>80 percent, which was hailed as a huge success at their time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Programme  was  then  adopted  under  the  Yellow  Ribbon  Programme  so  we  do  have 
<br/>experience  of  looking  and  rehabilitating  and  that is  something  we  are  looking  at  the  community 
<br/>programme.  But  I  think  while  the  methodology  was  taken  on,  the  credit  was  never  given  to  the 
<br/>people who developed the initial framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would like to wish our children a very blessed Palm 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sunday coming this very blessed weekend and I thank you for this time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alleviation for her response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for sharing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Programmes of the Ministry, and I will not repeat them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker and honourable Members,  perhaps we are hearing from  the other side about 
<br/>what the Government has been doing for the last three months. Yes, there are certain things that 
<br/>coming in as Minister that we have discovered in the Ministry that we believe can be improved upon.  
<br/>I know that the honourable Assistant Minister has shared some of those concerns that we are working 
<br/>on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, firstly, our beneficiaries on the Social Pension Scheme are very happy that we 
<br/>are now extending under Fiji Care Insurance the funeral benefit and Term Life Benefits whether or 
<br/></span><span>not  they  are  vaccinated.  So,  this  has  been  removed.  This  was  a  condition  from  the  previous 
<br/></span><span>Government, and I thank Fiji Care Insurance for coming on board as soon as I came in in the first 
<br/>couple of weeks, we addressed this issue and it was backdated to 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023.  So regardless 
<br/>of being vaccinated, I want to inform the public, there is a member of your family who is on the 
<br/>Social Protection Scheme that has passed on, they will be entitled to this funeral benefit and term 
<br/>life benefit under the Fiji Care Insurance. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         End of Week Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>671 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would have heard from the honourable Assistant Minister about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bus Fare Subsidy which is being given to our recipients.  One thing we have noted, the amount that 
<br/>is being paid every month which is $25 continues to be paid in even though the recipients are not 
<br/>using  the  entire  amount,  so  it  keeps  accumulating,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  keeps  rolling  over  and,  of 
<br/>course,  this  is  a  big  cost  to  the  government.    We  plan  to  revert  to  just  topping  up  as  needed  or 
<br/>whatever is used so that money is not wasted and also the cards not abused because there is a balance 
<br/>in it.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our beggars and street dwellers, we see an increase in number continually.  
<br/>We are thankful for the meeting with the Ministry and churches, the Fiji Council of Churches as 
<br/>well as His Grace the Archbishop of the Catholic Church and the Head of the Methodist Church. 
<br/>They are willing to come on board to create a safe space for our beggars and street dwellers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we often find, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that when welfare officers visit our beggars and street 
<br/>dwellers or try to visit them, they run away.  They are afraid of the welfare officers as well as the 
<br/>police officers who accompany them.  We would like to reach out to them and so the safe space that 
<br/>we would like to create is what the churches and other good Samaritans have been doing which is 
<br/>feeding our street dwellers and beggars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hope to be able to do this in a permanent space where they will be able to come there 
<br/>and be in a comfortable environment where they have a meal but also, we will be able to sit with 
<br/>them and profile and find out what do they really need.  It includes providing psychosocial services 
<br/>because  few  of  our  street  dwellers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  face  these  mental  issues  and  they  do  not 
<br/>necessarily like to be locked up in St. Giles or attend to the hospitals and health centers that provide 
<br/>the service. So, we hope to bring them together in that space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last couple of weeks the Pearly Gates Home where our girls at risk 
<br/>are housed had a fire incident and due to the fact that the Home itself is dilapidated, it has got exposed 
<br/>wires, tiles are exposed but it is really in a dilapidated condition as the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/>had mentioned.  As a result, we had to intervene and for the safety of these girls transfer them to St. 
<br/>Christopher’s Home.  I thank Sr. Kalo who was accommodating to take on these teenage girls while 
<br/>we renovate the Pearly Gates Home. I thank the management of the Pearly Gates Home who do their 
<br/>very best, Ms. Kesa especially who manages the Home, who does her very best to take care of our 
<br/>girls at risk.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another thing that I would like to share is that the current food vouchers 
<br/>that are being given to our recipients which is being only where they can redeem it from Max Value 
<br/>Supermarket.  We have received numerous complaints, the fact that when our recipients go to the 
<br/>supermarket, quite often there is a lack of items on the shelves as well as spike in prices when they 
<br/>go to try to redeem this $50 food voucher. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on a study by the World Food Programme, it proves that when you 
<br/>give cash to those in need, they attend more to the needs rather than being forced to receive vouchers.  
<br/>So, this is what we intend to do. Unfortunately, we are not able to do it in the remaining months left 
<br/>to the next budget because the food vouchers have been printed and distributed to all the Divisions. 
<br/></span><span>So,  they  have  been  given  out  to  our  recipients.    We  are  currently  in  talks  with  Max  Value 
<br/></span><span>Supermarket to ensure that they have their items stocked as well as to control the prices and not to 
<br/>see this spike in prices that are complained of by our recipients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue too with giving them that $50 cash, we are looking at commencing 
<br/>it from August this year after the budget and this gives our recipients the option, not just to shop at 
<br/>a supermarket, but they can spend it out in the market and get fresh food and vegetables.  So, it gives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>

<div><span>         End of Week Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them that option to do so.  It is liberating for them to be able to receive that cash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things we also discovered coming in, as soon as I assumed the 
<br/>portfolio,  our  overtime  allowances  for  our  Social  Protection  Programme  especially  have  been 
<br/>exhausted.  So,  our  drivers  and  all  others  who  would  like  to  be  paid  overtime  allowance 
<br/>unfortunately,  what  had  been  happening  too  was  that  to  make  up  for  that  shortfall,  the  money 
<br/>allocated to our programmes were being vired for operational expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know this was mentioned earlier by the honourable  Leader of the Opposition,  querying 
<br/>about to ensure that the money that is supposed to be for the programmes are not being used for 
<br/>operational expenses. This is exactly what was happening because moving from our programmes 
<br/>and the one in particular I am talking about is the Rural Pregnant Mothers.  The money was being 
<br/>vired from that programme for our Rural Pregnant Mothers and going to cover overtime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was  a spike in  it interestingly,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  first  six  months leading  up to 
<br/>elections which was indicative of the number of hours our drivers in the Ministry driving around.  I 
<br/>have heard reports back that they were being used for the campaign unfortunately.  They were taking 
<br/>out officials and Ministry officials out on the campaign. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Lodge a complaint. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- There is no need to lodge a complaint, we are now the Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will change it.  So, just take that as a review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  issue  about  using  money  from  the  programmes  and  going  to 
<br/>operational, this needs to stop. This is all part of the wastage that we as a Coalition Government 
<br/>have inherited, we need to change that mindset.  Our civil servants are used to it, they suggested it 
<br/>and I said, “no, you cannot do that.”  That is actually unethical, and it should not be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, we are doing a review of the Social Protection Programmes with the World 
<br/>Bank and DFAT and we hope to look at having a more effective adaptive strategy should there be 
<br/>another shock like a pandemic or natural disaster. We need a proper plan, and we need to continue 
<br/>to  review  our  programmes  so  that  all  the  beneficiaries  on  the  programmes  should  not  be  there 
<br/>anymore and that we are committed to the economic empowerment of our people living in poverty 
<br/>to take them out of poverty and into a life of dignity and respect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Preparations for the Ratu Sukuna Day Celebration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to update Parliament on the progress taken 
<br/>regarding the Ratu Sukuna Day celebration.  Please, allow me, at the outset, to pay tribute to the life 
<br/>of  a  soldier,  high  chief,  scholar  and  statesman  and  let  me  read  this  description  of  Ratu  Sir  Lala 
<br/>Sukuna.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna was the best equipped Fijian leader in the 20</span><span>th</span><span> century.  He was born a 
<br/>chief of the royal house of Bau, his grandfather was a cousin of Ratu Seru Cakobau the </span><span>Tui Viti</span><span> who 
<br/></span><span>with  several  other  chiefs  ceded  Fiji  to  Great  Britain.  His  mother  was  the  eldest  child  of  the  </span><span>Tui</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Nayau, the paramount chief of Lau and as </span><span>vasu levu</span><span> of Lau, his chiefly status was greatly enhanced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His work in the Native Land Commission which he occupied most of his working life gave 
<br/>him unique insights in all the landowning </span><span>mataqali </span><span>and </span><span>yavusa</span><span> and thereby, became the authority 
<br/>on all matters for Fijians - a man of noble birth and soldier of heroic deeds and a scholar of a world- 
<br/>renowned university where the most enviable statesman proves to be in his later career as a civil

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>servant, politician and ultimately as the first Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just quoted the late Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who 
<br/>wrote the foreword for the book “</span><span>Ratu Sukuna; Soldier, Statesman, Man of Two Worlds</span><span>” by Deryck 
<br/>Scarr.  The theme of this year’s Ratu Sukuna Day celebration is “Celebrating visionary leadership 
<br/>for Fiji”.  Visionary leadership influence and will continue to shape Fiji’s development - past, present 
<br/>and future.  We look to the past and help us form the present and future.  We stand at the crossroad 
<br/>and look, ask where the good way is, and walk in it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government thought that it would be best to look back and learn from Fiji’s 
<br/>history, at the heart of our history is Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, preparation towards 
<br/>the  Ratu  Sukuna  Day  celebration  is  well  underway  after  the  Cabinet  decided  to  reconvene  the 
<br/>celebration.  The celebration will open on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May and conclude on 29</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023.  It is resuming 
<br/>after 16 years, so this year’s celebration will raise awareness on the life and work of Ratu Sukuna to 
<br/>the young generation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  National  Committee  for  the  Ratu  Sir  Lala  Sukuna  Day  celebration  chaired  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts  has  met  and  endorsed  the 
<br/>tentative programme  and the budget.    In  addition,  there are  working  committees appointed from 
<br/>relevant agencies of Government, statutory bodies, universities and NGOs to facilitate the detailed 
<br/>planning on the logistic and execute the plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I am pleased to state that a lot of positive response have been received.  The celebration will 
<br/>coincide his Excellency’s announcement of the Great Council of Chiefs meeting in May 2023.  The 
<br/>Great  Council  of  Chiefs  and  Ratu  Sukuna’s  works  cannot  be  separated,  where  possible  the  two 
<br/>events will intersect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  like  before,  the  celebration  will  include  participation  from  schools, 
<br/>universities  and  all  communities  under  the  four  divisions.    There  are  other  targeted  locations  to 
<br/>ensure that a wider section of the population in both urban and rural are covered.  The activities of 
<br/>the event will include public lectures, oratory contest, cultural exhibition, cultural sports, arts and 
<br/>other related display that depict the life of Ratu Sukuna.  It is a time of reflection and reconciliation 
<br/>as we celebrate Ratu Sukuna’s role in national unity.  An effective media strategy is needed to ensure 
<br/>the widest possible coverage of the event.  Consultation with available media outlet is currently in 
<br/>progress and we anticipate the widest possible coverage.  The media strategy will be rolled out from 
<br/>early May. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the celebration will promote inclusiveness with all segments 
<br/>of society and more importantly allow our young generation to appreciate Ratu Sukuna’s life and 
<br/>work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to respond to the Assistant 
<br/>Minister’s speech on the celebration of the life of the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna.  I move on to add a 
<br/>few educational achievements from Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also completed his secondary education at Wanganui in New Zealand.  In 1913, Ratu Sir 
<br/></span><span>Lala Sukuna went to England to study for a Bachelor of Arts Degree at Oxford University and was 
<br/>a resident at Wadham College when World War I broke out.  By 1921, he had obtained his Degree 
<br/>as a Bachelor of Art at Oxford University and had been called to the English Bar by the honourable 
<br/>society and middle camp.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to work, he was then 19 and was appointed as a Clerk in the Colonel Secretary’s 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Office where he stayed for about five years.  He spent a short period of time at the Lau Provincial 
<br/>School in Lakeba as its Acting Head Master.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  late  Ratu  Sir  Lala  Sukuna  had  a  colourful  career  serving  more  than  51  years  of 
<br/>continuous  public  service.    He  retired  from  full  time  duty  on  Tuesday,  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  April,  1958.    He 
<br/>continued being a personal advisor to the Governor of Fiji on Fijian affairs until his passing away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Few things regarding his military decoration, in 1913 he volunteered for active service and 
<br/>joined the French Foreign Legion in Paris where he served for 30 months and had distinguished 
<br/>himself in battle.  Upon being wounded in action, Ratu Sir Lala was discharged and for his courage 
<br/>and ability, he was awarded a military decoration on the French Republic for his service and act of 
<br/>bravery in the action against an enemy force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1946, King George VI made Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna a Knight of the Order of the British 
<br/>Empire for his outstanding and loyal service to the Crown.  Earlier, he had been made a Commander 
<br/>of the Order.  When Queen Elizabeth II visited Fiji in 1953, he also bestowed upon Ratu Sir Lala 
<br/>Sukuna the Honour of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  week  we  discussed  about  great  leaders  like  Mahatma  Gandhi  and 
<br/>Nelson Mandela.  Today I also ask us to look at great leaders before us and one of the visionary 
<br/>leaders is Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna.  He has taken us this far and I understand, with the celebration we 
<br/>are planning for 29</span><span>th</span><span> May, will really educate our children of the great achievements of a great leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thanked the honourable Minister for Education in yesterday’s speech, he mentioned that 
<br/>the education system is looking at the iTaukei Language and Culture for the schools.  Our children 
<br/>need to know the important roles that our visionary leaders have played, and we need to appreciate 
<br/>what they have done and guide us on our way forward for our beloved country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the celebrations, the University of Fiji, the Fiji National University and 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific will be fully committed to accommodate in terms of lectures that 
<br/>will  attract  professors  and  high  scholars  to  speak  on  the  life  of  Ratu  Sir  Lala  Sukuna  and  his 
<br/>leadership.  We are looking at more publications of the books - </span><span>Three-Legged Stool</span><span> to give to our 
<br/>primary schools and students to learn the great achievements of a great leader of Fiji.  We are also 
<br/>looking at Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna Memorial School.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are looking at upgrading the school to make sure it be one of the top schools in Fiji that 
<br/>will  bring  our  future  generations  and  students  around  the  Nabua,  Cunningham,  Kinoya  and 
<br/>Vatuwaqa  areas,  which  are  very  close.    In  upgrading  this  school  will  really  help  our  future 
<br/>generations in terms of education.  When we look at iTLTB today, we really appreciate the great 
<br/>work that is being done by Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna.  His foresight to establish the iTLTB really helps 
<br/>the landowners of today on how their land is managed and how it helps their daily livelihoods in 
<br/>regard to land lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the resources that we have is a major economical revenue for our nation.  
<br/>For these two days, the resource forums  are conducted by the iTaukei Trust Fund where we will 
<br/></span><span>bring in all the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> resource owners and the users to discuss the way forward on how we can 
<br/></span><span>utilise our resources to make sure the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> contribute into the economy of the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been discussing here for one week, I am very fortunate to witness the discussions 
<br/>and  debates.  I  think  with  the  Ratu  Sir  Lala  Sukuna’s  vision  and  achievements,  he  can  bring  us 
<br/>together to celebrate the life of the high chiefs of Fiji.  I invite the Members of Parliament from the 
<br/>other  side  to  join  the  Committee  for  the  Ratu  Sukuna  Celebration  Committee  to  make  sure  the

<div><span>celebration will be a memorable one after 16 years.  We will finish off from here with all the debates 
<br/>and I do hope we will go outside as one holding hands to take this nation forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying the Standing Orders 
<br/>with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a 
<br/>Suspension Motion.
