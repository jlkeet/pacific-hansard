<h3>REVIEW REPORT ON THEFIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY 2020 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE 
<br/>FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  review  of  the  Fiji  National  University  2020  Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report which was tabled on 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  proceed,  I  wish  to  convey  my 
<br/>sincere appreciation to the former Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs under the 
<br/>able leadership of honourable Pillay, for compiling this Report and tabling it to Parliament in August 
<br/>last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  National  University  (FNU)  is  a  public,  comprehensive  and  dual  sector  university 
<br/>offering technical and vocational educational training from Levels 1 to 6 and higher education from 
<br/>Levels 5 to 10, up to Doctoral Degrees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you would have known, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the University was established in its current 
<br/>form  by  the  merger  of  seven  Tertiary  Government  Colleges  in  2010,  with  the  mandate  to  make 
<br/>tertiary education an opportunity accessible to all Fijians.  The principal activities of the University 
<br/>are  the  provisions  of  post-secondary  programmes  of  study  in  higher  education  and  technical  and 
<br/>vocational education and training that are responsive to the needs of industry, the marketplace and 
<br/>non-formal  sector  of  employment  to  students  from  Fiji  and  other  countries  in  the  South  Pacific 
<br/>Region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period under review, the University also highlighted a few significant 
<br/>achievements,  despite  the  challenges  brought  about  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  that  brought  a 
<br/>sudden halt to business as usual and forced most of us out of our comfort zones.  The University 
<br/>responded with innovation and agility to minimise the disruption to operations and safeguarded the 
<br/>interests  of  the  students  in  the  delivery  of  e-learning  for  teaching  and  assessment.  Those 
<br/>achievements  include  the  production  of  academic  quality  assurance  which  brought  about 
<br/>comprehensive selection of policies and procedures related to academic quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a major strategic direction for the FNU is international recognition.  In 2020, 
<br/>the University commenced an accreditation strategy.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the FNU 
<br/>moves closer to a situation in which international education recognises the merits of the University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  has  highlighted  its  findings  on  the  University’s  financial  and  operational 
<br/>performance for 2020 and subsequently made recommendations to improve the University’s overall 
<br/>performance in its service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor, I would like to highlight that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there are eight speakers and the batting is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> honourable Minister for Education; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Pillay; 
<br/>2.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>523 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. K.K. Lal; and  
<br/>8.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  contribute  more  to  the  Report  before 
<br/>Parliament for debate on the review of the Fiji National University 2020 Annual Report, at the outset, 
<br/>I, once again, would like to acknowledge the work done by the Members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Social  Affairs  in  the  last  term  of  Parliament  –  the  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services,  
<br/>honourable  Alipate  Nagata,  and  former  Members  of  Parliament  -  Mrs.  Salote  Radrodro  and  Mr. 
<br/>George Vegnathan.  I was the Chairman of the Committee in the effort of putting this Report together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Fiji National University (FNU) is an institution committed to investing in its staff.  In 
<br/>2020, the University had a full-time staff body of 785 academic staff and 1,016 professional services 
<br/>staff.    In  terms  of  overall  staffing,  the  University  is  relatively  evenly  balanced  between  men  and 
<br/>women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  acknowledges  FNU’s  commitments  to  the  improvement  of  female 
<br/>participation in the College of Science and to promoting the advancement of women in their academic 
<br/>careers and has launched a series of initiatives to address gender imbalances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was commendable to note that the University, through its commitment of 
<br/>providing  equal  and  affordable  access  to  education  for  all  Fijians,  opened  a  newly  established 
<br/>Disability Centre at the Nasinu Campus in February 2022.  The University also conducted an online 
<br/>disability awareness workshop for the period under review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was a proud moment for the University community as two students living with disabilities 
<br/>completed their studies and graduated in April 2020.  One received a Bachelor of Commerce Degree 
<br/>majoring in Management and Accounting and the other a Master of Commerce in Accounting.  With 
<br/>that being  said,  I  am  looking forward to  seeing  annual  reports from other  Ministries highlighting 
<br/>disability inclusiveness at their workplaces and the services they provide.  Furthermore, I encourage 
<br/>the Members of the Standing Committee to raise questions on disability inclusion to stakeholders 
<br/>when scrutinising annual reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I wish the Management, the Board Members and staff of FNU well to fulfil its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vision to be a leading dual sector University in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  make  a  small  contribution  on  the 
<br/>Review  Report  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  on  the  review  of  the  Fiji  National 
<br/>University 2020 Annual Report.  We are talking about 2020 and a lot of things have changed since 
<br/>this  Report  was  reviewed  by  the  Committee.    We  have  seen  a  change  in  Ministerial  positions, 
<br/>especially for the Ministry of Education.  The former Minister for Education, honourable Premila 
<br/>Kumar, would be fully aware of the operations of the Fiji National University (FNU) at the time of 
<br/>the review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  contents  of  the  Committee’s  Report  basically  focused  on  some  of  the  major 
<br/></span><span>recommendations that have been alluded to in the Report.  I would like to make some contribution 
<br/></span><span>in  terms  of  the  progress  that  has  been  made  in  the  respective  recommendations  made  by  the 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the recommendation for the Fiji Maritime Building, the project as has 
<br/>been highlighted is nearing completion with the expected completion date of May 2023.  The project 
<br/>is in its finishing and compliance stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>524 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the College of Business, Hospitality and Tourism Studies, I am pleased 
<br/>to inform Parliament that the project has been successfully completed and was opened late in 2022.  
<br/>The facility is currently in use with the ground floor being used as the Office of the Registrar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very interesting in terms of theFNU Labasa 
<br/>Campus at Naiyaca Subdivision.  There has been a lot of discussions made regarding this project, 
<br/>especially the amount of money that has been spent and given by Government to FNU to construct 
<br/>this Campus and to be touted as the hub of academic learning in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been advised the project was estimated to be around $80 million and this Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  is  a  multi-million-dollar  project  involving  taxpayers’  money  which  has  been  spent  and  is 
<br/>incomplete at this stage.  So, when projects like these are not completed on time, it tantamount to 
<br/>poor  planning  which  resulted  in  the  promises  to  the  people  of  Labasa  not  being  fulfilled  and, 
<br/>therefore, delayed in trying to get their university. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  outstanding  grants  owed  by  Ministry  of  Health  and  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture,  the  FNU  is  liaising  with  respective  Ministries  to  address  the  arrears  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>collection of University fees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the land lease and finalisation of boundaries, developments have transpired with regards 
<br/>to land lease and boundaries.  The land lease conditions provided to FNU by the Department of Town 
<br/>and  Country  Planning  were  mostly  development  conditions  that  required  input  through  various 
<br/>stakeholders for properties such as Legalega, Natabua and McGregor.  The  University is  seeking 
<br/>deferment of conditions to a development stage from the Director of Town and Country Planning 
<br/>(DTCP) and the University is continuously following up for a meeting with DTCP which is yet to 
<br/>eventuate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a separate note, the issues at FNU are very complex and that is what I 
<br/>had anticipated the Committee to deliberate more on, especially the operations of the University in 
<br/>terms of the Academic and TVET Sections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today’s new media highlighted that some Academic streams, like the Veterinary Science and 
<br/>Animal Husbandry graduates, who have spent a big number of years at the University studying, I 
<br/>think  five  years  or  six  years,  have  not  been  able  to  be  registered  as  Veterinarians  because  of  the 
<br/>discrepancies in the programme that was offered by the University at that time.  Perhaps, we can get 
<br/>more from the former Minister for Education on how these programmes were being offered by FNU 
<br/>without consultation with respective stakeholders. So, when students graduate, they are still awaiting 
<br/>jobs to-date.  Five years or six years spent in schools, and they have yet to be recognised in the hope 
<br/>that the programmes that they undertook for studies will give them job opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very sad legacy regarding the FNU operations.  It is very sad because 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  have  also  voiced  their  concerns  in  terms  of  the  programme  that  was 
<br/>offered, but FNU at that time did not listen to the experts from the Ministry of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also note Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the FNU Act was reviewed and amended to give the FNU 
<br/></span><span>autonomy to operate.  Previously, we used to have the Permanent Secretary for Education part of the 
<br/></span><span>FNU Council so as to ensure that the programmes have some input from the Government.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question that the students are asking is, why are they being left 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>behind?  That is the question, and they have graduated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- (Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>525 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- They spent five years to six years.  Some of them have opted to 
<br/>be  paid  through  TELS  but  they  still  could  not  find  formal  employment  and  to  be  registered  as 
<br/>veterinarians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also hear about international recognition for FNU, but we also question 
<br/>the lecturers who were brought in to teach in this particular programme.  Were they of international 
<br/>certification?  Were they of international recognition in terms of what they have with them in terms 
<br/>of their accreditation, or the degrees that they brought with them to teach these programmes at the 
<br/>FNU?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  of  credibility  of  lecturers  and  resources  also  questions  the 
<br/>validity and the authenticity of their qualification.  These events were happening during the time of 
<br/>this Report or after this Report.  They spent a good number of years at the FNU and hopefully, this 
<br/>will be addressed. These are some of the works that we have been tasked to address - the anomalies 
<br/>that were left behind by the previous Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  also  concerned  because  the  livelihood  of  the  students  has  been 
<br/>compromised.  Now, they will not know how the FNU will give them certification to become certified 
<br/>veterinarians.  We have shortage of skills, we have shortage of veterinarians as it can be confirmed 
<br/>by the honourable Minister for Agriculture but when such programmes have been run without proper 
<br/>certification or accreditation, it questions how the University has been run over the years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  clock  is  moving  and  the  next  speaker  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Hem Chand but before he takes the floor, I would like to adjourn Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dinner is being prepared in the Big Committee Room so as to get you, honourable Members, 
<br/>re-energized because we are hearing very interesting stories about this Report which is the motion 
<br/>before us.  The Parliament is now adjourned, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 6.05 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Parliament resumed at 7.17 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my short contribution in support of the 
<br/>Review Report of the Fiji National University’s Annual Report of 2020.  At the outset, I would like 
<br/>to thank the former Standing Committee on Social Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National University (FNU) was established in 2010 through the merger of tertiary 
<br/>institutions.  It is the largest University in Fiji and is a dual sector University offering technical and 
<br/>vocational  education,  and  higher  education  up  to  doctoral  degrees.    It  was  the  initiative  of  the 
<br/>Bainimarama-led  Government  to  establish  FNU  in  order  to  promote  and  improve  education, 
<br/>strengthen  research,  increase  access  to  higher  education  and  offer  courses  in  other  disciplines, 
<br/>including Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FNU  is  an  institution  committed  to  investing  in  its  staff.    The  FNU 
<br/>invested in the recruitment of highly qualified and experienced academic staff to teach at FNU.  This 
<br/>has enabled FNU to offer a wide range of courses across a broad range of fields including medicine, 
<br/>engineering, education, business and social sciences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government’s investment in FNU has also enabled the University to develop partnership 
<br/>with  other  universities  and  institutions  around  the  world  which  has  facilitated  the  exchange  of 
<br/>knowledge and ideas.  This has produced highly skilled and qualified graduates who can contribute 
<br/>to the nation’s workforce and this is exactly what the country needs.  These graduates can work in 
<br/>different  sectors  such  as  industries,  government  departments,  non-government  organisations  and 
<br/>other sectors bringing their expertise and knowledge to benefit the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before the establishment of FNU, students faced challenges in upgrading qualifications.  For 
<br/>example, teachers in Fiji found difficulties in upgrading their qualifications from diploma to degree 
<br/>and  postgraduate  studies.  I  remember  before  the  establishment  of  FNU,  there  were  two  teacher 
<br/>training institutions.  One was Lautoka Teachers College which used to provide training to primary 
<br/>teachers and Fiji College of Higher Education which used to provide training to secondary teachers.  
<br/>The maximum qualification provided to these teachers; it was only up to diploma level.  Today, we 
<br/>have  many  teachers  who  have  completed  their  Bachelor  of  Education  and  higher  education  from 
<br/>FNU and before only USP used to offer pre-service and in-service Bachelor in Education to primary 
<br/>and secondary teachers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst government also focused on ensuring that higher education in 
<br/>other areas is accessible to all Fijians.  This led to the establishment of FNU’s regional campuses 
<br/>which are located in central, northern and western divisions of Fiji.  These campuses offer a range of 
<br/>courses  and  programmes  that  are  tailored  to  the  needs  of  the  local  communities.  The  FijiFirst 
<br/>government also introduced a range of scholarships and financial assistance scheme which helped 
<br/>increase the number of students accessing higher education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNU plays a significant role in preserving the cultural heritage of our nation by offering 
<br/>programmes  in  language,  literature  and  history.    Fiji  National  University  helps  to  maintain  and 
<br/>promote the country’s cultural identity and it also plays a very important role in promoting social 
<br/></span><span>mobility  and  reducing  inequality.    It  provides  opportunities  for  individuals  from  different 
<br/></span><span>backgrounds to access higher education which can improve their socio-economic status and increase 
<br/>their earning potential.  Sir, the FNU also helps address societal issues and promote social justice 
<br/>through research, public engagement and community outreach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, capital projects help universities upgrade their infrastructure and facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By having modern and well-equipped facilities, students can have access to the latest technologies 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>527 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and tools that is necessary for their field of study.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FNU  has  undertaken  a  major  upgrade  of  its  digital  infrastructure  which 
<br/>enabled  FNU to  make a speedy transition  to  fully online learning on the onset  of the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic.  The FijiFirst government’s investment in research has also helped to raise the profile of 
<br/>FNU internationally and has attracted research partnerships with institutions and universities from 
<br/>around the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I was a lecturer at FNU back in 2014, only a few lecturers had doctoral 
<br/>degree at that time.  Today, there are many with PhD and thanks to the FijiFirst  Government  for 
<br/>investing in research.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- In the past 13 years, FNU has grown in many aspects and this is through 
<br/>the  efforts  of  the  government,  in  particular  the  Bainimarama-led  FijiFirst  Government,  former 
<br/>education ministers, senior management and staff of FNU, former council members and the FNU 
<br/>community at large.  I have seen FNU progress over the years in terms of material resources, human 
<br/>and non-human resources. I have seen a lot of progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  contribute 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>towards this debate and I fully support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debate on the Fiji National University 2020 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin, Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate my colleague, honourable Seruiratu, for his 
<br/>election today as Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament.  Honourable Seruiratu has done the 
<br/>hard yards.  He sat here for eight years on this side of Parliament and he is going to sit on the other 
<br/>side  of  the  House  for  four  years  and  in  time,  he  would  be  one  of  the  foremost  legislators  in  this 
<br/>country. I congratulate him and I wish him well, going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Fiji National University (FNU) has done what it could do for Fiji but when 
<br/>I contribute to the debate on any Annual Report, I always try to bring it to the situation today.  In the 
<br/>Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, there is a huge need for immediate upskilling and reskilling 
<br/>of our people in tourism and civil aviation industries.  We all know about the braindrain and, indeed, 
<br/>for tourism, it is a concern that all these robust forecasts that we have this year can be derailed by the 
<br/>lack of qualified staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite pronounced, Mr. Speaker, and figures that have been given to me are in the vicinity 
<br/>of 14,000 to 16,000 workers in tourism who have left the industry to go abroad and replacing them 
<br/>is not easy because these are in the production area where you need people to be skilled and to be 
<br/>experienced.  Of course, given the way we are, we can bring in our young people from the villages, 
<br/>give them a couple of weeks of training and they can be good waiters and waitresses. They have it in 
<br/>them, that attitude to serve, so it is very easy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other on what I normally call ‘a heart of the house’ - the production area, there are 
<br/>huge challenges, Mr. Speaker.  Chefs are now very difficult to retain in Fiji, and this is where we 
<br/>would like to see FNU play a bigger role and, in actual fact, I believe they have failed very badly in 
<br/>this area.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In aviation, Mr. Speaker, the same challenge or the same threat exists.  In that, we trained our 
<br/>people  in  CAAF,  in  air  management,  aircraft  engineering  and  they  migrate  and  go  overseas.  
<br/>Replacing them is the real challenge, Mr. Speaker. When we dialogue on this with the players in the 
<br/>industry, we are told that there are certain FNU facilities geared towards this that are underutilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  aviation  facility  in  Nadi  is  not  fully  functioning.  If  it  was  properly  functioning,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, we could be replacing a lot of these aviation people who are leaving the country.  In Food 
<br/>and Beverage, also a similar story, so going forward, we would like to see more focus by FNU to up 
<br/>its act and help replace those whom we lose through brain-drain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  cannot  do  anything  about  labour  mobility,  it  is  part  of  the  new  global 
<br/>economy.  You cannot stop it, even with bus drivers.  We had a meeting with our people – the Society 
<br/>of Fiji Travel Associates.  They are people who operate coaches and the like, and they are losing 
<br/>coach drivers. I think a figure of 60 was given to us.  They have lost 60 coach drivers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what you need is an institution like FNU to identify and relook at what it offers in terms 
<br/>of education and training and meet its challenges.  For some of us, we do not realise the extent of this 
<br/>threat until we see our bus drivers also migrating.  And this is where, Mr. Speaker, I am very happy 
<br/>that  there  is  a  change  in  FNU.    The  new  Councillors  are  people  who  we  see,  who  can  meet  the 
<br/>challenge, who can be focussed on what needs to be done and help deliver the human resources that 
<br/>our country needs at this critical juncture and going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all in all, let me just say that much is expected of FNU and we wish and hope 
<br/>that  the  Councillors,  the  staff  and  Management  will  rise  up  to  the  challenge.  Fiji  needs  it  and 
<br/>especially my Ministry, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute very briefly  to the review of the  
<br/>Fiji  National  University  2020  Annual  Report  which  was  tabled  before  Parliament.    I  wish  to 
<br/>commend the Chairperson and the Committee for their findings and recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  National  University’s  10</span><span>th </span><span>Anniversary  was  in  2020.    It  is  a  young 
<br/>institution.  It is still dealing with some teething issues.  We should give time to FNU to address some 
<br/>of the issues that was raised by the honourable Minister, but we will be talking about those issues 
<br/>individually. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNU is another legacy of the former Prime Minister, Mr. Bainimarama, for establishing 
<br/>Fiji’s own national university. And I will talk about some of the good work they have done which is 
<br/>helping the economy as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  commend  the  Committee  for  presenting  four  recommendations  which  focus  on  the 
<br/>finalisation of land leases, completion of capital projects, working closely with CIU for monitoring 
<br/>and implementation, and solving outstanding grant issues with two Government Ministries that owed 
<br/>money prior to the amalgamation of entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  is  more  than  two years  old  and  I  agree  with  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Education that FNU must have progressed with the implementation of some of these 
<br/></span><span>recommendations.  At least, there are a few that I know they have already delivered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation 1, it must be noted that the University recorded an operating surplus of 
<br/>$7.4 million in 2020, as compared to a $6.1 million deficit in 2019.  It meant that the University had 
<br/>money to continue with the pending projects but because of litigation, FNU could not progress with 
<br/>two capital projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>529 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two capital projects in question are Nayaca Campus, as well as Fiji Maritime Academy 
<br/>(FMA).  The difference between the two projects is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Maritime Academy 
<br/>Project was 80 percent complete when the matter went to Court, and when something is 80 percent 
<br/>complete, it is easier to complete the other 20 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, with Nayaca Campus, only 47 percent of the work was completed - not even 50 
<br/>percent,  and the matter  went  to  Court.  The company became bankrupt and, obviously,  when the 
<br/>matter is before the Court, it takes longer.  Of course, we had COVID-19, which means that the cost 
<br/>of hardware materials has gone up but at no time, when I was the Minister for Education did FNU 
<br/>ever tell me that the cost of the project is now $80 million.  It has come to me as a surprise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total cost of the project was $27.4 million and what I know, only 42 percent was paid to 
<br/>the contractor.  So, they did 47 percent work but only 42 percent work was paid to the contractor.  In 
<br/>terms of the loss from that perspective, it did not happen, but obviously just like any other project, 
<br/>even  if  you  are  building  your  own  home,  if  you  face  challenges  with  your  contractor,  the  cost 
<br/>escalates because you have to look for other people to complete the job.  It is like that, but there are 
<br/>room for improvement as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am sure the Construction Implementation Unit 
<br/>(CIU) is now working with FNU probably, providing advice, I do not know, but by consulting other 
<br/>institutions, they can surely improve on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last eight years, FNU received more than $450 million in operational 
<br/>and capital projects to improve the quality of education which includes infrastructure development.  
<br/>Today, if you visit FNU, you will see new buildings, new lecture theatres, a new cafeteria, a new 
<br/>sports facility equipped with the latest gym equipment, new maritime academy facilities, and the list 
<br/>goes on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years,  FNU  has  achieved  a  lot  under  the  leadership  of  FNU  Council  which  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Education has removed hastily for no rhyme or reason.  They were world-
<br/>renowned Luminaries, Academics and industry leaders from across the fields of academia, business 
<br/>and  science,  including  engineering  and  medicine.    Unfortunately,  they  were  shown  the  door,  and 
<br/>surprisingly, no announcement for investigation was made which has become a trademark for this 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the term of the last Council members, the University grew in leaps and bounds.  For 
<br/>example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU developed the most meaningful strategic plan with a focus, which 
<br/>they are implementing and are focussing on addressing the shortages of skills in the market.  They 
<br/>are producing graduates who can critically think and have an entrepreneurial mind and be responsible 
<br/>members of society.  This is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Continuous improvement of the facilities which led to the development of new infrastructure 
<br/>and renovation of the old structures.  About 12 different projects were completed in 2020, so it is not 
<br/>just painting a bad picture of FNU, they have done quite a bit of work over the years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Let  us  not  forget  that  FNU  always  had  a  legacy  issue  which  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continued over a period of time.  This has been the challenge that any Board or Council will face. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU had set up Naduna Campus for Technical and Vocational Education 
<br/>and Training (TVET) education in the North, saving thousands of dollars which FNU paid in rent - 
<br/>literally thousands of dollars.  The most remarkable was the establishment of Fiji Maritime Academy 
<br/>which was on the verge of closure.  The honourable Minister did not talk about this project because 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this is a positive story.  The programmes were not recognised and were about to be cancelled by 
<br/>International Maritime Organization (IMO). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Academy  is  another  legacy  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  under  the  leadership  of  Mr. 
<br/>Bainimarama.  It is one of the best in the Pacific region.  We have the latest stimulators better than 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand, and the programmes are internationally recognised by IMO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Do not worry, you will  be cutting the ribbon, go in and have a look. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not  only  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  a  certification  system  with  various  shipping 
<br/>companies, such as SEAMACH, providing us access to shipping companies for our students to be 
<br/>trained on those ships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNU has improved the quality of digital infrastructure.  We have heard from honourable 
<br/>Hem Chand, so I will not speak on that.  Now, FNU also launched Call Centre course to address the 
<br/>current  needs  of  the  BPO  sector  in  order  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  market.    This  is  how  FNU 
<br/>ensures TVET programmes are future-focussed for post-pandemic economic recovery and to take 
<br/>advantage or the opportunities of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We often hear from the honourable Minister for Trade that the BPO sector has lot of potential, 
<br/>we recognise that long time ago.  A lot of work has gone into it, but we have also recognised that the 
<br/>workers had to be skilled and that is why this course was specifically designed for the BPO sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  operation  side,  FNU  developed  new  policies  and  SOPs  to  make  the 
<br/>institution  effective  and  efficient,  including  the  use  of  Open  Merit  Recruitment  and  Selection 
<br/>(OMRS) to recruit staff.  Through job evaluation, a new salary structure was introduced based on 
<br/>market rate to attract qualified people because if you look at other institutions that existed on its own 
<br/>and then it was amalgamated into universities, the pay was never that good, it was never based on 
<br/>the market rate and this exercise had to take place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, serious and critical investments were made at FNU to make FNU a hub for 
<br/>higher  education  in  the  Pacific  region.    FNU  is  attracting  not  just  regional  students,  but  also 
<br/>international students.  In 2020, 993 full time foreign students were enrolled at FNU, as compared to 
<br/>735 students in 2016.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU attracted international students from Australia, New 
<br/>Zealand, Canada, Estonia, France, Guyana, Philippines, Seychelles, USA, South Korea, India, Sri 
<br/>Lanka and many more.  In total, there were 55 international students, leaving the regional students 
<br/>aside, from 23 countries and the rest were regional students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, international students can boost Fiji’s economy and every effort should be 
<br/>made to develop policies to attract international  students.  According to the Australian Bureau of 
<br/>Statistics, international students contributed a total of AU$25.5 billion to the Australian economy in 
<br/></span><span>2022.    Similarly,  in  2019,  international  students  contributed  to  $1.2  billion  in  New  Zealand’s 
<br/></span><span>economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU needs to further develop this area to attract more international students.  
<br/>By  doing  that,  FNU  will  be  financially  secure  through  the  fees  they  will  be  collecting,  but  also 
<br/>generating economic activity. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>531 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall full-time student numbers also increased in 2020 with 13,580 when 
<br/>compared to 9, 754 students in 2016.  The FNU needs to develop, as I have said, the attraction of 
<br/>international students to its Campuses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government’s aim was to make FNU one of the best in the 
<br/>region and well-recognised internationally. That was our focus, and that is why we placed people of 
<br/>very high standing in academic world, and we managed to get people from international universities 
<br/>to help FNU grow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  veterinary  science  qualification  which  the  honourable  Minister  spoke  about,  I 
<br/>think this Programme started around 2014 - the discussions and the talks went in, and what I was told 
<br/>that FNU invited Veterinarians from three different universities, they all came, had a meeting with 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture, FNU and other institutions where this course was designed. But there 
<br/>were other complications, and I will leave it to our leader to discuss this in detail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion at hand on 
<br/>Fiji National University. In particular, I refer to the Chairperson’s foreword which states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“FNU is a dual sector university offering technical and vocational education and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>training from Levels 1 to 6 and higher education Levels from 5 to 10.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  raise  in  particular  the  issue  regarding  TVET.    As  already  mentioned  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister, this is an area which is a current concern in terms of the supply of much 
<br/>needed skill people for the much-needed gaps in employment.  This area as stated in the Report is 
<br/>covered by FNU in terms of the coverage they have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, the number of TVET graduates have declined consistently in Fiji during the 
<br/>last five to six years.  It is a concern because the figures indicate a drastic drop in the number of 
<br/>TVET graduates. So just to share that, in 2010 we had 2,935, 2011 we had 3,020, 2012 we had 2,574, 
<br/>2013 we had 3,076 but from 2014, it started to reduce to 1,747, 2016 we had 1,514, 2018 we had 
<br/>996, 2019 we had 1,019 and 2020 we had 1,316.  So there has been a massive decline in the number 
<br/>of technical graduates from around 3,000 to around 1,300 in 2020 which is part of the period covered 
<br/>in this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The figures for 2020 and 2021 have not been included but we can see the decline has been 
<br/>following a trend. This is despite Government grants allocated to FNU since 2013 ranging from $28 
<br/>million in 2013, $42 million in 2016, $84 million in 2018 and 2019 and then in the period of 2021 
<br/>and  2022  is  $44  million  and  $45  million  in  2022  to  2023.  Government  had  also  allocated  5,000 
<br/>scholarships in TVET to FNU. However, the uptake has not been as expected and close to 35 percent.  
<br/>Additional scholarships have been given but again the uptake has not been as expected or targeted 
<br/>which is why we are again raising this concern in terms of TVET training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Fiji has to produce more technically skilled people in the future, then it is 
<br/>vital  that  a  total  reform  of  the  sector  is  undertaken  which  is  what  the  Coalition  Government 
<br/>undertakes to do.  Sir, I have not seen in this Report which also covers the period 2020 any mention 
<br/></span><span>of the technical colleges which was established in 2015 by the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over 15 technical colleges between 2015 and 2019 were established throughout Fiji, over 240 
<br/>staff  were  engaged,  most  of  whom  were  transferred  from  the  civil  service.  In  2019,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government decided to transfer this to FNU.  The FNU did not operate and manage this technical 
<br/>college carefully which resulted in the closure of colleges in December 2020 which is again a surprise 
<br/>that it is not mentioned by the Committee in the report.  There was instant termination of about 240 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>staff and students left without any recourse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that $89.7 million was provided to support the operation and administrative expenses 
<br/>in  relation  to  this.    In  addition,  taxpayer  funded  tools  and  equipment  was  acquired  and  this  cost 
<br/>approximately $6.5 million. These were left without safe custody, so we are not sure what happened 
<br/>and there is reason to believe that some have been removed and there is a need for a thorough audit 
<br/>of this. That is an issue which I thought I would raise but which is not included in the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Again, it is something which we need to learn from as a Government, not only the Opposition 
<br/>but we, as a nation, in how best we can move forward learning from that experience in addressing 
<br/>TVET.  Given the skills shortages we face not only in terms of the current situation in Fiji but also 
<br/>the movement of skilled personnel out of Fiji and the need to incorporate the strategic planning at 
<br/>FNU, I suppose with a national human resource plan which would need to cover, not only in the 
<br/>short-term but the long-term the human resource needs of the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  stand  today  to  make  my  contribution  in  support  of  the 
<br/>review Report on the Fiji National University’s Annual Report 2020.  The Fiji National University 
<br/>is an institution of higher learning that is funded and supported by the Fijian Government since its 
<br/>establishment.  Sir, FNU plays an important role in the education and development of the nation and 
<br/>significance can be seen in several ways, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU was established in 2010 through the merger of six existing tertiary 
<br/>institutions as highlighted by other honourable Members. The aim was to create a single university 
<br/>that  would  provide  quality  education  and  training  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  country’s  growing 
<br/>economy. The Bainimarama Government’s initiative was to invest in a comprehensive organisation 
<br/>that would improve the quality of education and research in Fiji, increase access to higher education, 
<br/>reduce common operational overheads and improve the skills of the country’s workforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government engaged with the development of the Fiji National 
<br/>University shortly after it came to power in 2014. As education is a fundamental right under the 2013 
<br/>Fijian Constitution, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that their citizens have access 
<br/>to quality education. National universities are institutions that provide higher education to a large 
<br/>number of students and funding them ensures that more people have access to education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government’s investment in FNU have resulted in several positive changes, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  One  of  the  most  significant  achievements  is  the  expansion  of  FNU’s  infrastructure.  The 
<br/>Government has invested heavily in the development of new state of the art facilities as you can see 
<br/>that they have been highlighted in the Report by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has heavily invested in the development of the state of art 
<br/>facilities including lecture theatres, laboratories and libraries. These facilities have provided students 
<br/>with better learning environment which have helped to improve the quality of education. Sir, FNU is 
<br/>very instrumental in conducting research and development projects that are beneficial to the nation 
<br/>in  general.  These  projects  can  be  in  various  fields  such  as  technology,  health,  agriculture, 
<br/>environmental  studies  among  others.  Through  these  projects,  the  nation  can  make  significant 
<br/></span><span>progress in solving societal problems and promoting economic growth.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>investing  in  national  universities  improve  our  country’s  global  competitiveness,  high  quality 
<br/>education  in  research  can  attract  international  students,  researchers,  create  global  partnership  and 
<br/>enhance the country’s reputation in the international community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, capital projects such as building new classrooms, libraries, laboratories and 
<br/>other  educational  facilities  can  provide  students  with  a  safe,  comfortable  and  conducive  learning 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>533 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>environment, upgrading existing facilities and technologies can also improve the quality of education 
<br/>and support the delivery of innovative methods.  Capital projects are utmost importance for technical 
<br/>and  vocational  universities  such  as  FNU  as  they  can  greatly  enhance  the  learning  experience  for 
<br/>students,  provide  them  with  modern  facilities  and  equipment  and  support  the  practical  training 
<br/>required for technical and vocational education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  refer  back  to  a  few  things  that  were  highlighted  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister,  and  I  would  also  like  to  advice  this  august  Chamber  that  this  Report  was 
<br/>compiled during 2020 when the time the country was heavily affected by COVID-19 pandemic.  We 
<br/>should note that strictly, that in  2020  Fiji  faced  for the first  a pandemic  that we have never seen 
<br/>before, not 2019, but 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during this COVID-19 pandemic, FNU and our students were affected as 
<br/>well, but this was not highlighted by anyone.  During the pandemic our students also assisted the 
<br/>government  and  the  Ministry  for  Health  during  the  swabbing  period,  when  they  were  swabbing 
<br/>patients or suspected cases.  Our students were on the forefront with the medical professionals helping 
<br/>the swabbing operation.  Sir, COVID-19 has taught us a lot.  Some politicians who are sitting in this 
<br/>august Chamber and some honourable Ministers on the other side used the COVID-19 pandemic and 
<br/>FNU as a political football for their own political mileage during this pandemic period as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Talk about yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is he saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You talk about yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is irrelevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  It is relevant, Madam.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of our students were stranded in hostels because there were lockdowns.  However, the 
<br/>University continued to provide them food and water, yet some politicians, Ministers or Assistant 
<br/>Ministers sitting on the other side used that opportunity for their own mileage.  This was all over the 
<br/>news and this is relevant because this is the FNU Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about FNU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hot air.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you talk about FNU, it is also talking about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>students and when you talk about students, it always comes to TELS and scholarships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them, tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Students are waiting, when will this Government remove TELS?  The 
<br/>same question goes to the honourable Minister.  When you talk about FNU, when we talk about its 
<br/>facilities, we talk about scholarships as well, still no word.  I can only see we are promising on the 
<br/>front page of the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> and </span><span>Fiji Sun,</span><span>that is it, nothing has been done so far, 100 days is about to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be over, students are waiting.  Sir, FNU during the pandemic also provided hostels to our medical 
<br/>professionals who were working in CWM.  There is no interest here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  University  provided  facilities  such  as  hostels  to  our  medical  professionals  who  were 
<br/>working day and night.  Yet, none of the honourable Ministers or Government officials recognised 
<br/>that in today’s motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the pandemic and I note in the verbatim, the Vice Chancellor, Dr. 
<br/>William  May  explained  to  the  Committee  Members  that  during  the  pandemic  they  also  provided 
<br/>payment  plans  to  students.    That  is  how  flexible  FNU  is  and  they  also  provided  online  flexible 
<br/>assessment programmes, online special assessments for students who were not able to complete their 
<br/>assignments on time.  This is the FNU we have.  They think about our students, yet this was not 
<br/>highlighted by the honourable Members from  the other side.   One thing  I also  want  to note, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, one of the honourable Ministers who just spoke a while ago said, “we really do not 
<br/>know.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Name them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K.  LAL.- Honourable Tuisawau said,  “we really do not know.”  They are sitting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there for 95 days or plus, they have all the information, they can find it from the honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  This is relevant, I do not think I have breached the Standing Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Point  of  Order!    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  his  comments  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you quote your order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Because I do not recall saying those words, “Do not know.”  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not recall saying that.  Whom are you referring to or what is the subject you are referring to ?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Misleading, misleading!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The Point of Order is that he is misleading Parliament with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>false information.  Something I did not say – Standing Orders 44 and 60. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we just rewind a little bit, he said the same thing or in 
<br/>a similar context that we are not sure.  They are in Government, and they have every information.  
<br/>They can call up their Minister, they can call up FNU, they have a new Council now.  That Council

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>535 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is politically motivated because some of their former candidates are sitting in that Council, whereby, 
<br/>the previous Council that was there, was removed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they were professionals from the legal fraternity, from 
<br/>the accounting fraternity, from experienced backgrounds who were concerned for our students and 
<br/>their  future.    The  governance  of  the  University  is  very  important,  yet  right  now  the  Council  has 
<br/>politicians sitting in that particular body, I am not sure what is the direction the new Government is 
<br/>heading with that Council.  Before I take my seat, I would also like to highlight that FNU, and its 
<br/>expatriate staff and local staff, have always portrayed professionalism and remained apolitical.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have other university staff like the  VC of 
<br/>the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  who  was  confirmed  by  honourable  Charan  Jeath  Singh  in  a 
<br/>particular video that was viral on social media.  It was …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Point  of  Order!  I  think  the  problem  with  the  honourable 
<br/>Member is he is making allegations.  This is the hallmark of the FijiFirst government and what they 
<br/>do.  He is making an allegation that Professor Pal Ahluwalia was political because he ended up in a 
<br/>function  where  everyone  was  invited  and  he  was  attending  the  Education  Ministers  Meeting  in 
<br/>Auckland, where honourable Aseri Radrodro was also invited.  As Vice Chancellor of the University 
<br/>of the South Pacific…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am speaking, why not just sit down?  I have not finished with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Have some respect for the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You telling me? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Have some respect for the Speaker, Sir.  I am speaking.  You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are a lawyer, you should understand that better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, I rise on a Point of Order on what you are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  you  should  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Member to withdraw that comment because he is making an allegation based on someone attending 
<br/>a function.  .

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  The video is here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The video is here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Therefore, that person has become political.  That is a very 
<br/>childish comment, he should withdraw.  He is casting an aspersion on someone.  He should withdraw 
<br/>that comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Ketan, you rounding off? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I believe that I have not misled Parliament and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is evidence on social media and I think the media also picked it up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I have got it too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  If you want, we can share the video with you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Charan Jeath Singh briefly said that VC was supporting them 
<br/>during the election behind the scene and it is on record.  This is a relevant information because when 
<br/>it comes to FNU, everyone points, but we also have other universities in this country.  This is the 
<br/>same VC who was paid FJ$534,000 where we are not sure.  What could be the reasons why the three-
<br/>legged government continue to pay or release the grants? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No surprise again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister for Immigration is still quiet 
<br/>on the breaches of VC’s work conditions here in Fiji.  When an expatriate comes to work in Fiji, they 
<br/>are given work conditions that they cannot be involved in any political activity, however the Minister 
<br/>confirmed, Mr. Speaker, Sir…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- No, no, you cannot tell me to sit down, the Speaker, is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- The honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic and Sugar confirmed via his video, 
<br/>and he is on record that this particular VC was supporting them behind the scene, now he can come 
<br/>in front and support as well.  There are more questions for the honourable Minister for Sugar coming 
<br/>along the way, not to worry, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  the  FijiFirst  Government’s investment  in  FNU has helped improve the quality  of 
<br/>education and research in Fiji, increase access to higher education and strengthen partnership with 
<br/></span><span>industry and community.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the investment in FNU has been a positive development 
<br/></span><span>for Fiji’s education system and its impact will continue to be felt in years to come because this is the 
<br/>legacy of FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these, I support this Report.

<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>537 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to take the floor, I 
<br/>know that I was not in the batting order but in the name of transparency, I just wanted to clarify the 
<br/>issue about the veterinarian course that was raised by the honourable Aseri Radrodro.  I think there 
<br/>are a few of us here in the Parliament, the Minister for Agriculture and the Assistant Minister would 
<br/>know the background to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just put it into context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is the shortage of skills in the Ministry, not only in the Ministry but of course regionally.    
<br/>The demand from the industry, the sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>We were hit with Brucellosis and Tuberculosis, it started way back to 2005.  By 2009 
<br/>it  had  started  to  have  a  big  impact  on  the  livestock  sector  in  Fiji.  The  honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister knows this very well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was the demand not only from the Ministry but from the sector as well.  One of the key 
<br/>contributing factors to brucellosis and tuberculosis was the fact that we had a shortage of veterinary 
<br/>officers, qualified vets, I mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I recall, when I joined the Ministry in 2012 there 
<br/>were only two, both foreigners.  A retired Scottish and a vet from the Philippines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that we need to take note of as well in Fiji is, we keep losing our people because 
<br/>Fiji is the base for most of the multilateral and regional bodies as well.  We keep losing most of our 
<br/>people to SPC.  We keep losing most of our people to the University of the South Pacific and now 
<br/>we have other universities coming in.  The demand is always there, unfortunately, we invest in the 
<br/>capacity development, but they opt for better working conditions, so they move.  The vets that were 
<br/>left behind were Dr. Ken Cokanasiga, he was at SPC, Dr. Robin Arrow and of course Dr. Niumaia 
<br/>Tabunakawai.  These are the ones that we consult, they helped us well and they are members of the 
<br/>Veterinary Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we were excited about the establishment of FNU and it becoming a university and there 
<br/>were consultations between the Ministry but the problem, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may shorten it as 
<br/>well.  They went ahead with the course but one of the key requirements for veterinary courses is 
<br/>laboratories.  They were running the courses, but they should have established the laboratory first 
<br/>before running the courses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have advertised for applicants and our youths were into it but when it came to validating  
<br/>the course, et cetera then it was noted that there was no laboratory.  Therefore, they cannot be given 
<br/>practicing certificates and be qualified as vets without fulfilling all the requirements of the course, 
<br/>that is the background to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am not even sure now if the laboratory has been 
<br/>constructed and operating but that is the information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the recommendation of the Assistant Minister, we go for para-veterinary courses. It is 
<br/>a level above the normal diploma and degree but not the fully qualified vet, just like paramedics. So, 
<br/>that was one of the options and of course we sent our people to Los Banos University, and a few the 
<br/>universities like Massey University and most of those that we sent then are now qualified local vets 
<br/>in the Ministry and I hope that they still remain with the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because vets, animal breeders and nutritionists were the key skills that were missing in the 
<br/>Ministry then.  We have big plans about agriculture, but you do not have the necessary skills to take 
<br/>it to the next level. So, it is vets, nutritionists and animal breeders because we also have specialised 
<br/>plant breeders and animal breeders. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have talked about losing our people.  The qualified breeder who came back with a doctorate, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is now with USP, Dr. Poasa.  We keep losing people, that is the story behind it, but 
<br/>it was the laboratory.  One of the options too that was discussed but is FNU’s responsibility is the 
<br/>Board and Academic but we, as a key stakeholder, have an interest in that and I know the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister for Agriculture is the one who usually goes to do the negotiations and discussions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I think one of the agreements that was made then was for them to qualify with a degree in 
<br/>animal science so with that qualification, they can find employment in the sector and then when the 
<br/>laboratory is fully operational and meets the required standard, then they can return and do all the 
<br/>requirements that are still left so that they can then qualify with the full vet degree.  That is the story 
<br/>behind it.  Perhaps, the honourable Assistant Minister and the honourable Minister can help in that 
<br/>as well.  But we need to put it in the proper context and Government has to learn from this and take 
<br/>it forward.  We have a university there, we are proud of the university, let us put the investment into 
<br/>it, get good qualified people as well but we have to pay them.  It is important for the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  say  this  at  the  outset  that  the 
<br/>Government fully supports the three universities in the country and on FNU, I can say again at the 
<br/>outset that we appreciate the work that lecturers, administrators and currently those in charge are 
<br/>doing for the university.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of the issues that have been pointed out by the honourable Members, of course, is really 
<br/>not the making of perhaps those who are running the actual university.  I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>they  talked  about  the  new  FNU  Council,  but  they  actually  forget  that  it  was  their  leaders  and  in 
<br/>particular, one who is not in Parliament right now, changed the structure of the Council to suit the 
<br/>Government’s own political agenda.  So, apart from putting some professors and academics who I 
<br/>know were people of repute, who had done their bit and I know some of them were not allowed to 
<br/>do  what  they  were  supposed  to  do  because  the  council  was  run  by  the  cronies  of  the  former 
<br/>government who were either in the influential position or were taking the government’s position.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the history of the FNU, I mean they forget that Dr. Ganesh Chand, who was the 
<br/>director of FIT – Fiji Institute of Technology, who did all the groundwork, got the Act, set up the 
<br/>University …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Under the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and they have never acknowledged that because he fell out 
<br/>of their favour.  One of the reasons why he fell out of their favour, Mr. Speaker, was because he was 
<br/>an academic and he realised that any university’s existence rests fundamentally on the principle of 
<br/>academic freedom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Academic freedom, Mr. Speaker, means that you allow the administrators and the academics 
<br/>to run the institution - divorced from the political interference, so that the students have the freedom, 
<br/>the academics have the freedom, the administrators have the freedom to teach, do critical thinking, 
<br/>innovate because in any university, Mr. Speaker, the fundamental principle and that affects freedom, 
<br/>that affects economic prosperity and that leads to innovation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  in  the  last  15  years  and  this  is  a  fact,  under  the  military  government  and  under  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst Government, they interfered at every step of how the University was operating.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Come on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Shame.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>539 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was based on what they saw.  It was bad for democracy.  It 
<br/>was bad for freedom, it was bad for innovation, it was bad for entrepreneurship and that is why we 
<br/>ended  up  with  the  situation  where  over  the  last  15  years,  there  has  been  hundreds  of  haphazard 
<br/>reforms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  do  not  even  know  right  now,  Mr.  Speaker,  there  has  been  no  expert  evaluation.  
<br/>Governments make mistakes, Mr. Speaker, but governments also learn from their mistakes and the 
<br/>only  way  you  learn  is  by  doing  proper  evaluation  or  proper  study  of  the  impact  of  some  of  the 
<br/>decisions you make and the policies.  They refuse to acknowledge throughout their tenure that they 
<br/>made mistakes and there are many, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last eight years, we have taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, who have forked more than half-a-
<br/>billion dollars funding FNU.  The people who work there, they deserve the freedom, the support and 
<br/>they deserve the environment in which that they can function.  Unfortunately, that environment was 
<br/>not there.  They talk about research …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  I think the honourable Member is misleading 
<br/>Parliament.  The Government has never stopped staff, students or professionals from any of their 
<br/>freedom that is protected under the Fijian Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Evidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- If the honourable Minister has any sort of evidence, he should give it and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think he is not the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Education should answer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Provide evidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Provide evidence that there was never any assessment done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, increasingly, the honourable Member is acting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like a small-minded agitator, abusing his parliamentary privilege.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is irrelevant.  I am not a small child 
<br/>here.  I am an honourable Member of this Parliament and he needs to respect that, Sir.  He should 
<br/>withdraw his statement.  All Members are elected fairly here, therefore, I am protected under the 
<br/>Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Withdraw!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- He should withdraw that statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue. I have made my decision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  am  saying,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  honourable  Member  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>behaving like  a small-minded agitator and attacking people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point of Order.

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number, what number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Standing Order 62(4)(a) and I quote: “offensive words against Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or another member.”  That is offensive, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Withdraw! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  honourable  Member  cannot  understand  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order, I request him to go and read the Standing Orders again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Maybe, he spent too long as a student at FNU, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is your Point of Order?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- That is again offensive, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Anyone can spend any number 
<br/>of years to study.  It does not require age, Sir.  That is very offensive.  You should withdraw that 
<br/>statement.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request you to intervene and ask the honourable Member to respect 
<br/>other honourable Members and withdraw that statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Withdraw!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  That  is  my  personal  life  and  he  cannot  bring  that  here,  Mr.  Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Withdraw!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  You  are  raising  your  Point  of  Order  and  then  all  of  a  sudden,  you  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>making the decision again.  That is why I will allow him to continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, just confine yourself to the content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    All  I  am  saying  is  that  the 
<br/>honourable Member was attacking someone who was not in Parliament to defend to himself and that 
<br/>is an abuse of parliamentary privilege.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. Well, if that is what they want, then it will be free-for-
<br/>all, Mr. Speaker, because the parliamentary standards, we are not attacking people who are not here 
<br/>by  name  or  by  title  and  who  cannot  defend  themselves  and  that  is  exactly  what  the  honourable 
<br/>Member did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  talked  about  research.    They  said  the  Government  has  promoted  research  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Government  has  allowed  people  to  do  research.    They  forgot,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  in  2017  in  this 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and we supported it when we were sitting on the other side.  There was a Fiji National 
<br/>Research  Council  Act  which  was  passed  in  Parliament  and  the  objective  of  that  Act  which  we 
<br/>supported was to raise the standard of research in science, education and create an environment where 
<br/>government would allocate funding.

<div><span>            Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>541 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2017 until they were in government last year, Mr. Speaker, they never appointed the 
<br/>Council  because  after  passing  the  Act,  they  realised,  “hey,  we  are  going  to  put  money  into  this 
<br/>Council and there will be academics, researchers applying for funds and producing research because 
<br/>we have to supply the data which would be critical of the government.”  They were afraid to set up 
<br/>that Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Five years now, Mr. Speaker, almost six years now.  Let me assure the people and all the staff 
<br/>and students of all the three universities that this Government (I know the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education is already working on that)  is going to appoint a Fiji National Research Council and this 
<br/>Government  is  going  to  put  appropriate  amounts  of  research  funds,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  university 
<br/>academics including students to apply for those grants so that we can create research, policy advice 
<br/>that would be useful for the government, for the Parliament and for the whole country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, as I have said, about haphazard reforms, over 
<br/>the last 15 years, so many things had happened.  They changed exams, they changed curriculum, they 
<br/>changed so many things without an evaluation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2014,  when  the  then  Minister  for  Education  came  into  Parliament,  the  first  thing  he 
<br/>announced was that he was going to set up an Education Commission.  It never happened.  And, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, I know and I want to assure the people of this country and those who are concerned about 
<br/>education, those who have raised issues over the years in  terms of reform, again, the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education is looking at the possibility and perhaps, the Education Commission will be 
<br/>set up as soon as possible to look at the overall education system in this country, right from ECE, 
<br/>primary, secondary and tertiary education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One that was talked about as well was technical education.  That, Mr. Speaker has been a 
<br/>disaster. They set up Technical Colleges, we warned them in this Parliament that that was going to 
<br/>fail, and we poured in more than $20 million, but now it is all gone down the drain.  They tried to 
<br/>pass the buck to FNU, they did not give them enough budget, FNU could not sustain the Technical 
<br/>Colleges and they were all left abandoned.  Today, we are looking at the state of technical education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation talked about 
<br/>the lack of skills. This is what all the employers in this country are telling us.  Yes, people are leaving, 
<br/>they are always leaving, the rate at which might be bigger now, but we were always training enough 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  system  was  working.  We  had  Vocational  Training  Sections  in  a  number  of  schools 
<br/>throughout the country and from there, Mr. Speaker, a two-year course put them in a pathway to go 
<br/>to FNTC.  They used to get Stage 3 and 4, then Stage 1 and Stage 2 they would need to go to FNTC 
<br/>and from there, they could also go to FNU and go for a Diploma or Degree as they felt.  There was a 
<br/>system that allowed a constant flow - something that was working very well, but they destroyed that.  
<br/>And so today, Mr. Speaker, this Government has been left to pick up the mess, and we are dealing 
<br/>with that mess.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Prime Minister announced yesterday that we are going to fund the Polytech 
<br/></span><span>to  ensure  that  we  can  start  competency-based  training  as  soon  as  possible  so  that  we  can  train 
<br/></span><span>carpenters, plumbers and painters - we do not have people like that, Mr. Speaker.  That is why this 
<br/>Government is determined to clean that mess that was created by the former Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, Mr. Speaker, they keep harping about is the management of capital grants.  
<br/>It is not the people at FNU, they are competent people, but it is the Government’s direct interference.  
<br/>And I know, Mr. Speaker, the original tender that was about to be given to a construction company 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>based  in  Labasa  was  stopped,  given  to  another  one  at  an  exorbitant  budget  and,  obviously,  that 
<br/>company failed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, Mr. Speaker, let me tell the people and honourable Members of Parliament that 
<br/>we are moving the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) that was part of the former Ministry of 
<br/>Economy and putting it back to the Public Service Commission (PSC). The Unit had started handing 
<br/>over projects to relevant Ministries before the commencement of the new financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say this because this is part of one of the recommendations.  Mr. Speaker, we are finding 
<br/>everyday (this is just one example) of how much wastage and mismanagement took place as a result 
<br/>of the way in which capital projects were managed in this country. And this is why the state of some 
<br/>of the Government properties and assets is in a state of disrepair.  All of them know, those who were 
<br/>in Government, and this is one good example of how this has happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying again, we do not want to labour this point on and on, 
<br/>but we are only doing it because we want the people and this Parliament to understand what we are 
<br/>dealing with - the mess that we are dealing with is just unbelievable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go around the country, Mr. Speaker, and I had been to Vanua Levu.  You start from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bua, and you go right up to Wainikoro, you just look at the Health Centres, you look at the schools….   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking on a motion about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji National University, we are not talking about the motion on the status of infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  have  been  some  comments  made  here  about  how  tenders  are  operated.    Everyone 
<br/>knows that there are tender committees and tender boards to do that.  If the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister can just focus on the motion, it is almost 9 o’clock, and if he continues like this, we will be 
<br/>here till 1.00 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- All I was saying, Mr. Speaker, was in relation to how the FNU 
<br/>Campus construction was managed by CIU and in relation to that, I wanted to inform Parliament that 
<br/>CIU will now move to PSC.  They will work with the relevant Ministries and as an extension, I was 
<br/>explaining what happened with all other capital projects in other Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  want  to  assure  the  three  Universities,  including  FNU,  that  the 
<br/>Government fully supports all three Universities in the country, and we will do everything possible 
<br/>to  create  an  environment,  to  provide  the  resources,  to  provide  the  framework  within  which 
<br/>universities can operate, become more efficient, fragile, research-oriented and be able to produce the 
<br/>skills and manpower that we need in this country.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C BAINIVALU.- I believe we have had a very robust discussion and debate on 
<br/>the 2020 Annual Report for the Fiji National University. I thank all honourable Members who have 
<br/>contributed constructively and destructively this evening.  I have no further comments, thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion is agreed to.
