<div><span>MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
<br/>HONOURABLE MACIU KATAMOTU NALUMISA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliamentary Response - Wednesday, 29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Local  Government  Act  was  reviewed  and  amended  in  2009.    This 
<br/>amendment  put  in  place  the  requirement  for  the  appoint  of  the  Special  Administrators  (SAs)  in 
<br/>accordance with section 9A of the Local Government Act 1972. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  amendment  to  the  Act  allowed  the  SAs  to  be  the  Council  in  the  absence  of  elected 
<br/>Councillors.  The then Government in 2008 decided to rescind the 12 months extension granted to 
<br/>all Municipal Councils, so the life of elected Councillors expired in October 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to October 2008, the remuneration of Mayors and Councillors was 
<br/>published by the Minister through a gazette.  This set the allowance that the Councillors would be 
<br/>entitled to for meetings that they attended.  The Mayors could, according to section 21(5) of the Act, 
<br/>be paid a quarterly allowance as prior approved by the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  2009,  the  SAs  were  appointed  by  the  Minister  as  per  section  9A  by  an  order.    The 
<br/>minimum number of SAs was set at 2.  And as per section 8A(2), the SAs were given the powers to 
<br/>perform and discharge all the rights, privileges, powers, duties and functions vested in or conferred 
<br/>or imposed on the Council, the mayor and any office of the Council.  Hence, the SAs were entitled 
<br/>to remunerations as determined by the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Determining the suitable remuneration for Councillors, SAs and senior executive members 
<br/>of Councils is a challenge.  Prior to the appointment of SAs in 2009, Councillors were paid a sitting 
<br/>allowance ranging from $5 to $35 per ordinary meeting in accordance with the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is sad to note that former Councillors for the two large Councils namely Suva and Lautoka 
<br/>were paid as low as $35 and $25 per meeting respectively.  Councillors for medium Councils were 
<br/>paid  $25  per  ordinary  meeting  and  most  of  the  small  Councils  were  paid  $10  per  meeting.  
<br/>Councillors for Levuka Municipality were only paid $5 per ordinary meeting.  During that time, there 
<br/>was no fixed salary for the Councillors and only few were provided with entitlements.  Since Rakiraki 
<br/>was declared a town in 2010, there were no allowances set for Councillors and Mayor.  Please refer 
<br/>to </span><span>Annex 1 for details Mayors and Councillors allowance and entitlements</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the change in 2009 saw an increase in the remuneration package for the 
<br/>appointed  SAs.    This  is  to  create  an  opportunity  to  modernise  local  government,  improve 
<br/>accountability  and  transparency  and  examine  the  regulatory  system  to  ensure  the  legislative 
<br/>framework is relevant to shape the local government that we want in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>iv. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SAs from 2009 to 2018 were paid salaries with allowances.  In 2019, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this was changed from salaries to annual allowances, which was paid quarterly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Local  Government  from  2009  till  to  date  has  paid  the  salary  and  then 
<br/>allowances  for  the  SAs.    Councils  such  as  Labasa/Savusavu,  Nasinu,  Nadi  and  Rakiraki  paid 
<br/>akkitional  allowances  to  the  SAs.    This  was  a  top-up  to  what  the  Ministry  paid.    For  example, 
<br/>Labasa/Savusavu, the Ministry paid $45,000 and Council paid $8,500. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to the appointment of the new SAs in  2019, the SA for Suva City 
<br/>Council was paid a salary of $45,000 per annum in 2009 and 2010, which was doubled in 2011 until 
<br/>2018.  For Labasa, Savusavu, Rakiraki and Nausori Town Councils, the SAs were paid $45,000 from 
<br/>the Ministry and topped up by the Council, whereas the former SA for Nasinu was receiving $60,000 
<br/>per annum ($45,000 paid by the Ministry and topped-up by the Council).  The Lautoka City and Ba 
<br/>Town Council SAs were paid $13,000 and $25,000 respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Records show that the SA for Levuka Town Council was paid $5,000 from 2009 to 2011.  
<br/>For Lami Town Council, the former SA was on volunteer basis and did not receive any salary from 
<br/>2009  to  2019.    In  addition  to  the  salary,  the  SAs  were  also  provided  with  housing  allowance, 
<br/>telephone phone limit, vehicle and entertainment allowance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In August 2019, the new team of SAs were appointed by the Minister for Local Government.  
<br/>The team consisted of 4 members and a Chairperson appointed for Suva and Lami Town Councils; 
<br/>Nausori  and  Nasinu  Town  Councils;  Lautoka  and  Ba  Town  Councils;  Sigatoka  and  Nadi  Town 
<br/>Councils.  The SA Teams for Rakiraki and Tavua Town Councils, and Labasa and Savusavu Councils 
<br/>consisted of 2 members and 1 Chairperson.  The Levuka SA Team consists of only 2 members, one 
<br/>of whom was the Chair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The remuneration offered to the SAs are paid quarterly on a pro-rata basis at a rate approved 
<br/>by the honourable Prime Minister in accordance with the Higher Salaries Act 2011.  In addition to 
<br/>the quarterly allowance provided, the SAs are also entitled to meal and travel allowance for out of 
<br/>town or city expenses for any meetings such as local government forums, payable by the Council.  
<br/>Salary and allowances for the SAs is attached as </span><span>Annex 2</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 35(2A) of the Act provides that the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) 
<br/>of the Municipalities shall be paid such salary as is determined in accordance with the Higher Salaries 
<br/>Act  2011.    The  salary  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the  approved  Bands  (as  per  </span><span>Annex  3</span><span>) 
<br/>depending on the size of the Councils such as large, medium and small.  In the past, the CEOs were 
<br/>paid low salaries when compared to the responsibilities they had to undertake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over a period of time, several CEOs play a dual role attempting to cover the 
<br/>tasks of SAs, whilst also dispensing the CEO responsibilities.  The initial expectation for this role 
<br/>was for it to provide an overall chair to oversee the work of the Council, actively attending to the 
<br/></span><span>civic engagement and have a strong grasp over the councils’ service deliverables and stakeholder 
<br/></span><span>management  mechanisms  in  an  accountable  and  transparent  manner.    As  such,  the  Ministry  in 
<br/>consultation  with  the  Councils  decided  to  evaluate  and  determine  the  salary  that  is  applicable  to 
<br/>responsibilities of the CEOs.  This is detailed in the CEO Salary as per Annex 3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above response is submitted.  Thank you.
