<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE FIJI RICE LIMITED 2013-2017 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Fiji  Rice  Limited  2013-2017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Opposition and Honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to speak on the Review Report on
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fiji Rice Limited 2013–2017 Annual Report that was tabled on 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin, I wish to warmly congratulate my former school mate, honourable Seruiratu, 
<br/>for  his  accession  to  the  distinguished  position  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament.  Of course, I wish him all the best in his tenure of Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Review Report on 
<br/>the Fiji Rice 2013-2017 Annual Reports during the August 2022 Parliament sitting.  It was done by 
<br/>the former Chairperson, honourable Vijay Nath.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Rice Limited was first established as Rewa Rice Limited in the early 1960s before going 
<br/>through the name change.  Executives of the Fiji Rice Limited were invited to provide submission to 
<br/>the Committee during which key achievements and challenges during the period under review were 
<br/>discussed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommended for Fiji Rice Limited in full consultation with 
<br/>stakeholders. particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, to formulate a comprehensive strategic plan to 
<br/>align with the Ministry’s commodity plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Mr. Speaker, we agree with the Committee that when marketing Fiji grown 
<br/>rice, the industry in collaboration with relevant stakeholders could promote brown rice which is one 
<br/>of the highest selling product by Fiji Rice due to its rich source of dietary fibre which can reduce 
<br/>Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was noted that there is an issue of aging farmers particularly 
<br/>in  the  Northern  Division  as  the  younger  generation  are  not  willing  to  actively  participate  in  rice 
<br/>farming.  There is a need for stakeholders to work together to develop initiatives to ensure that we 
<br/>have replacement farmers being trained so that they can develop the industry more sustainably. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the former 
<br/>members of this Committee, honourable Vijay Nath, Mrs. Veena Bhatnagar, Dr. Sachida Nand, Mr. 
<br/>Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau, who were part of the Committee that produced 
<br/>this Report.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I invite members to speak on the motion, I would like to, once again, 
<br/>inform  Parliament  that  I  have  also  received  a  list  of  speakers.  Since  the  motion  is  from  the 
<br/>Government, I think what has been happening right up until now on the various motions that have 
<br/>been brought before Parliament is we invite the Opposition to do the first batting and then it will be 
<br/>the Government.  So, in that way, the order is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development,  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst on that, I would like to adjourn Parliament for afternoon tea and we will resume once 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the bell is sounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 3.54 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>            Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>509 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.35 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my short contribution to the Motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is before Parliament on the review of the Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Sir,  Fiji  Rice  Limited  was  formally  Rewa  Rice  Limited,  established  in  1960  by  the 
<br/>Government  then  that  was  before  Independence,  but  it  was  rebranded,  Sir,  in  2017  as  Fiji  Rice 
<br/>Limited under the FijiFirst Government, given that the company had also moved into other areas in 
<br/>Vanua Levu, like Dreketi, plus other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Company has  now  a qualified and very innovative  team  with Board of Directors  and 
<br/>Management  and  has  developed  strategic  plans  and  projections  to  turn  the  company  to  self-
<br/>sustainability in the last five-year term from when it started in 2017), through the leadership of its 
<br/>Chairman - Mr. Raj Sharma who is from Vunicuicui in Labasa, plus other Board members, and Mr. 
<br/>Ashrit Pratap the General Manager for Fiji Rice Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the achievements seen from this turnaround is the significant increase in the demand 
<br/>of brown rice and its by-products.  Those are some of the innovative ideas brought in by the new 
<br/>Management of Fiji Rice Limited when they rebranded the company in 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  have  undertaken  maintenance  work;  the  staff  members  have  grown  and  also  other 
<br/>various strategic initiatives.  One of the efforts they have achieved through the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>then was providing the company with competitive market to farmers and at the same time, join hands 
<br/>in the Fijian Grown Campaign and Buy Fiji-Made products that reduce the rice import bill through 
<br/>those initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Company has also  managed to purchase a new Mill that has eventually helped in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase of daily buying of paddies to farmers and provide more employment to the local people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  other  areas  that  the  Company  has  also  ventured  into  with  the  assistance  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture.  In the year 2013 to 2017 through the rice variety research at Koronivia and 
<br/>at the Dreketi Research Station in Macuata, there were about 26 rice varieties that was introduced 
<br/>and tested, and that led to the two new rice varieties that was released in 2019 - </span><span>Sitara</span><span> and </span><span>Cagivou, 
<br/></span><span>in  addition  to  the  other  varieties  that  are  already  produced  and  harvested  in  Fiji.    Probably,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture will talk on the other varieties like </span><span>Nuinui, Totoka</span><span>, </span><span>Deepak, Star, 
<br/></span><span>et cetera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, some of the things that they already have is good price in this industry.  The world 
<br/>price for rice now is about $150 per tonne and Government subsidises another FJ$200.  Fiji Rice is 
<br/>paying about $850 per tonne to farmers and $200 has been subsidised by Government through the 
<br/>Budget. That is some big achievement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there are other issues of improvement.  There are other irrigation projects in Dreketi.  
<br/>We are hopeful that local areas in Macuatu will improve rice farming in the area.  There are other 
<br/>things that we would probably like to hear from the Budget that will be coming up in July, such as 
<br/></span><span>other subsidies in terms of fertilizer and weedicides that can improve more returns to the farmers.  
<br/></span><span>These are some of the things that farmers in Vanua Levu and around Fiji will be looking forward to, 
<br/>to the honourable Minister of Finance - the local Dreketi boy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On things that could improve the industry and also encourage more farmers because what the

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Company is currently facing if you see the recommendation, is the aged farmers.  There is plenty old 
<br/>farmers and their children are not into farming, just like sugarcane.  They have left Vanua Levu and 
<br/>other areas and ventured into other areas to find work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we can do is provide these incentives and other innovative ideas to the industry so that 
<br/>we can encourage those to continue with farming because it is an industry, it has got lucrative prices 
<br/>there, the market  is  there and other  mills are probably  opening  up, as well as paddies are readily 
<br/>available through the Company and are easily bought by the locals now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are few challenges that the company faces in terms of climate change, resilience of 
<br/>varieties  of  seed,  and  the  honourable  Minister  might  talk  on  that.  This  morning,  we  had  a  good 
<br/>discussion with the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  I was talking about meeting the Chinese 
<br/>delegation that is around and how they have shared their production of agriculture and how it has 
<br/>contributed to their economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have shared with me the return to their economy.  It is a great lesson.  My honourable 
<br/>colleague  had  said  that  it  is  a  great  time  to  also  seek  for  co-operation  and  also  other  technical 
<br/>assistance aspects that could help this kind of industry, especially in Fiji because we have got more 
<br/>land available and also through the projects that have benefitted through most of our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our cooperatives  in  Macuata, landowning units,  our youth  have gone into cluster farming 
<br/>through rice farming, especially in Vunivutu.  We are thankful for the budgetary provision of 2021-
<br/>2022 and 2022-2023 that was allocated to assist farmers in mechanisation through tractors whereby 
<br/>these cooperatives provide about one-third of the contribution, and the rest are sometimes provided 
<br/>by the Ministry of Agriculture. I think that provision is still available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  year,  I  had  assisted  one  through  mechanisation  because  one  of  the  main  suppliers  in 
<br/>Labasa supplied machines and we were able to give them out to farmers in Vunivutu, up in Nadogo 
<br/>area in Macuata, to help farmers cultivate their land in the area. This can also continue. There are 
<br/>other projects in Nabua, in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Koroalau, Cakaudrove that were assisted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are still many other potential and I am sure that the honourable Minister for Agriculture, 
<br/>from what we have seen in videos through his visits, he is following those key areas and probably 
<br/>policies will come up in the new Budget that we will hear in July.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More assistance will be given to this industry.  I came to know this industry when we were 
<br/>doing  the  Public  Enterprises  (Amendment)  Bill  back  in  2019  where  most  of  the  Government 
<br/>companies  came  to  present  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  and 
<br/>presented to us the standards of the company and how they are contributing to the Government coffers 
<br/>as Government companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the higher achievers was Fiji Rice Limited.  The Chairman of Fiji Rice Limited, Mr. 
<br/>Raj Sharma, is also managing two other Government companies without getting any allowance (zero 
<br/>allowance) but he gave his best effort, knowing very well that the provisions are very high under the 
<br/>Public Enterprises Act.  If you give yourself to become a Board member, what governs you, what 
<br/></span><span>you cannot do and what you can, so most of the time people are discouraged to come into government 
<br/></span><span>company board because they will be tied up.  But we are thankful to some people who are patriotic 
<br/>Fijians, who are able to give themselves and service for the nation to avail themselves to these boards, 
<br/>and also help steer these boards to achieve its vision and mission statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Raj Sharma is also the Chairperson for Fiji Coconut Millers and Food 
<br/>Processors.  We hope that Government supports the company and other initiatives that come up and

<div><span>511 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>take it to another level where it is right now from 2017 when it was rebranded and the reforms that 
<br/>was done to it, reaching the state that it is now, the other challenges that I have mentioned and other 
<br/>suggestions that I put  forward that the Coalition Government  can take it forward from  where the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government had lifted this particular government company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  due  to  some  late  assistance  of  participation,  the 
<br/>secretariat has re-arranged the speakers once more so as to provide the best response from both sides. 
<br/>In  this  instance,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture  will  be  the  next  speaker,  followed  by 
<br/>honourable Lal, before honourable Assistant Minister Vocea and then the fifth will be the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition before it is rounded off by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Professor 
<br/>Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by the Chairman 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs.  I would like to thank the former Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Economic for the preparation of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Chairman  of  Fiji  Rice  Limited,  Mr.  Raj 
<br/>Sharma and the CEO, Mr. Ashrit Pratap for steering Fiji Rice Limited to be one of the more profitable 
<br/>agro-based government companies.  I also commend the former government, in particular, the former 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture,  honourable  Inia  Seruiratu  who  was  very  passionate  about  agro-based 
<br/>industries growth and I will continue on his path.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, rice has progressively become a staple diet as it is now consumed by every 
<br/>household in Fiji. It has become an essential commodity that requires special attention in terms of 
<br/>production and development in the country.  Fiji imports an average of 40,000 metric tonnes of rice 
<br/>annually, mostly from Asian countries with a self-sufficiency level of 17 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture produces close to 50 tonnes of seeds annually for the distribution 
<br/>to farmers, which is 20 percent of the total seed requirement for production.  Let me touch on the 
<br/>recommendations in the Report and what the Ministry is doing with regards to the recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1, we are grateful that Fiji Rice Limited now works with the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture in terms of the Ministry providing agriculture statistics, which the company now uses as 
<br/>relevant data for their future plans and reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2, the company must be commended for pushing for the production of the 
<br/>brown rice which has become the delicacy, not only for the people of Fiji, but for the Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture as well.  I have been told that Fiji Rice Limited is working with the Ministry of Health 
<br/>in terms of using brown rice as an alternative food, especially in the fight against NCDs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  order for Fiji  to  raise rice self-sufficiency level,  the Government  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>embark on the following priority areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  finalise  and  endorse  the  National  Rice  Development  Strategy  2023-2028  in 
<br/>collaboration with rice stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Conduct  an  inclusive  national  rice  survey  immediately  to  validate  the  National  Rice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development Strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Formation  of  rice  co-operatives.    During  my  maiden  speech  I  had  spoken  about  the 
<br/>advantage of farmers joining co-operatives and the benefits that being a member of the 
<br/>cooperative brings as opposed to being on your own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of adequate infrastructural support to rice farmers.  This include the construction 
<br/>of farm roads, drainage and irrigation schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening  of  the  national  rice  research  and  development  activities.    I  think  the 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu has alluded to this.  The objective of this activity would be to come up 
<br/>with higher yielding varieties, not only in terms of planting large land areas, but looking at 
<br/>the higher yield per hectare. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Continuous capacity building support on rice farming practices.  These, as the honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu had alluded to earlier will include the exchange programmes and the provision of 
<br/>technical expertise in collaboration with our development partners.  This morning I met 
<br/>with the Deputy General Secretary of Guangxi Province in China and this was part of our 
<br/>discussion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Introduction of machines to support mechanised farming needs for different activities. The 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture already has a farm mechanisation programme in its current budget, 
<br/>but we would be seeking an increase from the honourable Minister for Finance, because 
<br/>we feel that the amount given is not enough.  I think the honourable Minister will vouch for 
<br/>that because most of the rice in Fiji is grown in his area in the North. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Promotion of rice cultivation through establishment of local farms, farmer field schools to 
<br/>facilitate  dissemination  of information to new farmers  and  extension office.    This is  an 
<br/>important activity because it provides our farmers with a practical hands-on training on rice 
<br/>production methods and techniques, and it opens up their knowledge and skills to better 
<br/>methods of rice cultivation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has in place a gender in agriculture and youth in agriculture policy and this is 
<br/>one  of  the  issues  raised  in  the  recommendations  of  the  Report.  The  absence  of  young 
<br/>replacement farmers has become a problem, it has become a constraint to production, not 
<br/>only for rice farming but for crop and livestock farming as well in this country.  To that 
<br/>end, the Ministry of Agriculture has put in place these policies to address youth, women in 
<br/>agriculture  and  to  try  and  entice  them  to  get  involved  in  mainstream  production  in  the 
<br/>agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is to increase our monitoring through regular field visits and advisory services.  I must 
<br/>apologise that there has been a lot of complaints on the absence in terms of our presence as 
<br/>a Ministry in certain areas in terms of the provision of sound crop advisory services to other 
<br/>farmers.  There have been complaints in terms of our visibility as a Ministry, and we are 
<br/>currently working on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation 4 in terms of the aging farmers, I have already alluded 
<br/>to  that,  but  we  are  also  working  with  the  institutions  that  provide  training  on  the  same  of  young 
<br/>farmers.  We are glad that Navuso has now opened up also to young women and we must commend 
<br/>those who run the Navuso institution for making that move.  I do not know whether they made that 
<br/>move  to  attract  more  funding  or  whether  it  is  in  the  national  interest.    But  having  said  that,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the Annual Report of Fiji 
<br/>Rice Limited for the year 2013-2017. Before I do that, I would like to make some clarification in 
<br/>regard to my maiden speech on Monday.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>513 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  I  have  delivered  my  maiden  speech  on  Monday,  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General went to the media and gave a statement that my speech was written by someone 
<br/>outside this Parliament.  This is a blatant lie!  I am able enough to do my own speech and not only 
<br/>him, honourable Prof. Biman Prasad also during tea time in the tea room, he said the same to me and 
<br/>he has not done that to me only…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order.  The honourable Member, I can talk about a 
<br/>lot of the conversations he had during tea time, totally irrelevant, unnecessary and actually his Point 
<br/>of Order proves that, that might be correct, what the honourable Attorney-General said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please confine yourself to the content of the Report.

<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just a clarification because honourable Prof. Biman 
<br/>Prasad has not done that to me only, he has also done that to honourable Ketan Lal and honourable 
<br/>Rinesh Sharma too.  We are able Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Stop this game. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Honourable  Attorney-General  has  this  habit  of  charging  people  without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>evidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- All I am asking, honourable Member, please confine yourself to the content 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Report. That is all.  Let us not go back to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Before I do that, Sir, I challenge the two honourable Members to prove that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my speech was written by someone else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same note, Sir, as a former news editor and programmes director, I am saddened to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say that some of our journalists are not following the basic principles of journalism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, after interviewing the Attorney-General…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Point  of  Order.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  honourable 
<br/>Member is not respecting your decision.  The honourable Member should respect the decision of the 
<br/>Speaker.  The Speaker has warned him twice to stick to the Report.  He is actually defying you, Sir.  
<br/>Have some respect for the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  as  I  have  stated,  could  you  please  just  confine 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>yourself to the content of the Report.  I do not want to be forced to be making a drastic decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to make one clarification, I should have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>given the right of reply and Fijivillage decided not to, I do not know why, Sir. I will go back to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue, please.

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just go back to the Report.  The Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Economic  Affairs  has  given  a  number  of  recommendations  as  alluded  to.    One  of  the 
<br/>recommendations here is to formulate a comprehensive strategic plan to align it with the Ministry’s 
<br/>commodity development plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee believes that when marketing Fiji grown rice, the industry 
<br/>in collaboration with relevant stakeholders could promote brown rice as it is known for its rich source 
<br/>of dietary fiber which can reduce risk of non-communicable diseases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was noted that there is an issue of aging farmers as the younger generation 
<br/>are  not  willing  to  take  up  rice  farming.    The  Committee  in  its  recommendation  stated  a  need  for 
<br/>stakeholders to work together to develop initiatives, policies and a conducive environment to make 
<br/>rice farming a more lucrative career.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rice Limited has achieved significant 
<br/>progress despite the challenges they had faced in the recent years.  Some of the key achievements 
<br/>that Fiji Rice Limited has made over the past years is its investment in upgrading their mill has paid 
<br/>off significantly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Rice Limited has set up a new mill in 2017 worth $135,000 and changed from kerosene 
<br/>to  electric  dryers  which  cost  them  a  total  of  $75,000.    Their  mill  building  has  been  repaired  and 
<br/>maintained at  a cost  of $201,000 and they have also  upgraded their silo and elevator at  a cost  of 
<br/>$221,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore they have constructed a new warehouse worth $330,000 and a 
<br/>new office in Dreketi worth $137,000.  These upgrades have improved their efficiency which has 
<br/>been critical in ensuring that they maintain a high level of production output, enhance their storage 
<br/>capabilities and streamline their supply chain management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rice Limited’s effort to increase their market share has been successful.  
<br/>They have secured contracts with all major supermarkets in Fiji and have been supplying rice and 
<br/>sugar to FSC farmers for the past three years. Initially they were supplying to a few sectors in Vanua 
<br/>Levu but now they have expanded their supply to the whole of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  Fiji Rice 
<br/>Ltd has also secured a contract with Fiji Airways to supply rice for their business class.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the expansion efforts have also extended to our new Dreketi office which 
<br/>has been constructed at a cost of $137,000.  This office will enable Fiji Rice Limited to better serve 
<br/>their  customers  and  partners  in  the  Northern  Division.    Fiji  Rice  Limited  has  made  significant 
<br/>progress in expanding its market. They now supply all major supermarkets in Fiji and for the past 
<br/>three years, they have been supplying rice to FSC as I said earlier for its farmers, deducting the cost 
<br/>from their proceeds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we must acknowledge the challenges that Fiji Rice Limited has faced.  The high 
<br/>cost of production mainly due to the mill’s underutilisation has posed a significant challenge.  They 
<br/>must also contend with competition from cheaper imported rice which is preferred by consumers as 
<br/>well as the aging of farmers as the younger generation are not interested in rice farming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change effects such as sea water seeping into rice farmlands have 
<br/></span><span>also impacted their operations.  As we look towards the future, we must address these challenges 
<br/>head-on.  The way forward involves a massive planting campaign, encouraging all farmers especially 
<br/>cane farmers with suitable land to plant at least one acre of rice per year.  Fiji Rice Limited will also 
<br/>introduce strict leasing conditions on land use and channel agriculture subsidies through Fiji Rice 
<br/>Limited where only farmers supplying to them will receive subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>515 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Fiji Rice Ltd will include rice farming in school and university curricular to 
<br/>promote interest and education in the industry.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am optimistic about 
<br/>the future of Fiji Rice Limited.   With the continued support of Government and stakeholders, Fiji 
<br/>Rice Limited will overcome its challenges and continue to grow and expand operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.R.  VOCEA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  before  I  make  my  contribution  to  the  motion 
<br/>before  Parliament,    I  join  the  other  Members  of  Parliament  to  congratulate  the  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition,  honourable  Seruiratu,  for  being  elected  today  into  that  position.    I  have  known 
<br/>honourable Seruiratu for a long time.  We spent six years together in that boarding school in Lodoni,  
<br/>Tailevu North, and he was also my boss when I was Commissioner Northern.  He was the Minister 
<br/>for the Ministry for Rural and Maritime Development and I know he is very passionate about the 
<br/>work that he does every day and as a result he is now the Leader of the Opposition.  Thank you, 
<br/>honourable Seruiratu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just going through, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report that has been tabled in Parliament, I have 
<br/>some observations to contribute to the debate.  It is sad to note, Sir, that Fiji loses close to $44 million 
<br/>yearly on the importation of rice from other countries such as Vietnam, China and India, and I am 
<br/>very optimistic that Fiji has the potential to be self-sufficient in rice production.  It has been noted 
<br/>that the production of rice continues to decline over the years, and I would like to offer some solutions 
<br/>in terms of listening to the Report that has been tabled by the Economic Affairs Committee and some 
<br/>of the previous experiences I had with Rewa Rice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Being the Commissioner Northern we had worked very closely with the board members and 
<br/>one of the issues that I would like to highlight to this august Parliament is if we would like to have 
<br/>sustainability in the production of rice in this country, to expand rice farming to other areas that have 
<br/>interest  in  rice farming  but  have not  been given the opportunity  to  do so in  the past.  I remember 
<br/>whilst I was the Commissioner Northern, there were some farmers from Cakaudrove and Bua, we 
<br/>brought  them  to  the  Dreketi  Agriculture  Training  Centre  to  be  trained  on  rice  farming  and  rice 
<br/>cultivation.  They went back and they were really eager to continue with rice farming, but I do not 
<br/>know what the problem  is.  Nothing eventuated.  They lost what was taught to them during their 
<br/>training and they lost interest in rice production.  I hope that we will continue to train a lot of people 
<br/>especially those who are eager to do rice farming in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is one example of what I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a farmer in Vunivutu in Macuata 
<br/>by the name of Aseri.  He was not a rice farmer (not honourable Radrodro) before, but he had some 
<br/>interest in rice farming and last year, he harvested eight tonnes of rice and is optimistic to increase 
<br/>his production this year.  This group from Vunivutu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Macuata, have gone ahead 
<br/>to form their own co-operative and have contributed towards the purchasing of their own tractor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very optimistic that we can revive the rice industry or rice farming in Fiji if we form co-
<br/>operatives as being alluded to by the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  During lunch today, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I was at the office of the Indian High Commission in Fiji, and I managed to talk to His 
<br/>Excellency, the High Commissioner for India in Fiji and he told me that India with a population of 
<br/>1.4  billion,  one  of  the  fastest  developing  countries  in  the  world,  the  country  has  1.9  million  co-
<br/>operative movements.  So, they thrive on co-operatives, 330 co-operatives on sugar mill operation 
<br/></span><span>and a lot more banking and finance co-operative institutions are spread across the rural and urban 
<br/></span><span>areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was brought up in the copra industry.  We thrived on copra plantations, 
<br/>on co-operatives formed during those years with copra. The funds saved from those co-operatives in 
<br/>the coconut industry, we built our houses, we sent our students to secondary schools and there were 
<br/>a lot of developments in our villages that were the outcome of these co-operatives.  This is a way 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forward  for  the  industry  and  that  is  to  revive  the  co-operatives  movement  so  as  to  address  the 
<br/>declining production for our rice in Fiji.  We need full support from the Government to revive the 
<br/>industry and as was alluded to by the honourable Member from that side, a group from Nabua Village 
<br/>in Koroalau have now received a tractor to try and improve rice cultivation in that area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During my maiden speech in Parliament early this year, I put out some classical examples of 
<br/>some  co-operative  movements  in  Fiji  that  continue  to  thrive  for  example,  the  Nayarabale  Youth 
<br/>Group in Vaturova in Cakaudrove, the Lovia Co-operatives in Gusuisavu, as well as the Nukusolevu 
<br/>Co-operatives in Nasarawaqa in Bua.  This reminds me and I keep on asking questions, the logic 
<br/>behind the review of the co-operative movement in Fiji which was undertaken way back in 2010.  If 
<br/>I  remember  correctly,  Mrs.  Mataikabara  and  Mr.  Are  Wakowako  were  the  ones  involved  in  the 
<br/>reviewing  of  the  co-operative  movement  and  that  resulted  in  the  reduction  of  many  of  the 
<br/>cooperatives that were established in Fiji in those days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I firmly believe, Sir, that rejuvenating the philosophy of Koro Co-operatives will positively 
<br/>contribute to arresting the declining stages of our rice industry, not only for economic survival but 
<br/>for household consumption as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute and I support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the floor to contribute 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the honourable Members who have spoken before, this is a crop that has a 
<br/>lot of potential and particularly being a short-term crop - three months, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hope that 
<br/>with the discussions today and with the commitment that has been made by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Agriculture, we will see some improvement and a new level of energy, particularly to the farmers 
<br/>but, of course, we have to look at the whole value chain as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I got involved with rice, I have no clue about rice farming until I came to the 
<br/>Northern  Division  and  by  virtue  of  the  appointment,  I  was  part  of  the  initial  Dreketi  Rice 
<br/>Revitalisation Taskforce.  I remember Mr. Haripal Singh, the late Mr. Pita Mawi, and all the farmers 
<br/>in  Dreketi,  particularly  in  the  Muanidevo,  my  good  friend,  Mr.  Paras  Nath,  and  the  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister is smiling because he knows him very well.  This is how I got involved with 
<br/>rice. And then I was given chairmanship of the then Rewa Rice and the changes begin to happen, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will not go into the detail recommendations, but I will perhaps, add some key additional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas of specific interest to help the Committee and, of course, the Ministries involved as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  say  that  Rewa  Rice  back  then  was  one  of  the 
<br/>underperforming, perhaps non-performing, or struggling entity for many reasons which I will not go 
<br/>into.  But there is one thing that I wanted to highlight and urge Government as well to consider it 
<br/>seriously.  The honourable Prime Minister is not here but I will urge the three Deputy Prime Ministers 
<br/>and all.  Parliamentarians, particularly honourable Members on the other side - it is about selecting 
<br/></span><span>the right people to do the work, particularly the Boards and Management.  This is one of the key 
<br/></span><span>contributing factors to the non-performing or the underperforming or the struggling that was behind 
<br/>this entity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  names,  but  this  is  one  of  the  struggles  because  they  could  not. 
<br/>Government was not in a position to write-off, and this was the initial challenge that we faced as the 
<br/>Board. We cannot go to lending institutions because of the debt that was there with Rewa Rice.  Most 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>517 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the money was given or taken by the Board members, Senior Management and it is the culture 
<br/>back then in this entity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  urge  Government,  please,  when  it  comes  to  selections  of  Boards  and  the 
<br/>appointment  of  people  into  the  senior  management  of  entities,  particularly  Government  or  State 
<br/>enterprises, please, let us select the right people to do the job so that the entity can deliver.  I would 
<br/>urge Government, please, consider that seriously because this is one of the key contributing factors 
<br/>to the non-performance of this entity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can have the best processes, we can have the best systems, we can have 
<br/>the  best  of  technology  and  we  can  have  all  the  finances,  but  if  we  have  the  wrong  people, 
<br/>unfortunately, the entity will suffer. This is why I am urging, and I am making it a key point in my 
<br/>contribution this afternoon because this is an area that will help to revive the entity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, they are already on the right momentum.  I congratulate, Mr. Raj Sharma and, of 
<br/>course, the late Turaga na Tui Macuata, Ratu Waisea Katonivere, who was heavily involved as well, 
<br/>Mr. Ashok in Savusavu, and who have contributed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture  for  his  commitment. 
<br/>Listening  to  his  contribution,  one  thing  that  caught  my  attention  was  him  mentioning  about  field 
<br/>farmer schools for farmers. That is something that has been missing from the modernisation plan that 
<br/>we initially launched in 2014 - long overdue, and I hope that the honourable Minister will set up 
<br/>these farmer schools to be his legacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  in  Fiji,  take  it  for  granted  that  we  are  from  farming  communities,  but  farming  is  a 
<br/>profession. Farming is a business. We need training. We need capacity development. We need to 
<br/>move with time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, I say that again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, we take for granted that we 
<br/>are from a farming background. It is the same thing in sugar, </span><span>dalo </span><span>farming and </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farming, but 
<br/>technology is here to assist us so that we can come up with the best yield because when the harvest 
<br/>is good, the farmer gets the maximum out of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs  knows  this  very  well.  We  need  the  farmer 
<br/>schools because the model that we adopted in the modernisation plan is based on the Asian and the 
<br/>African  model  of  smallholder  farming  concept.    The  honourable  Assistant  Minister  in  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister’s Office also knows this very well, being a former regional employee of the International 
<br/>Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although some argue that it is a weakness for Fiji, we cannot be like developed States where 
<br/>they have bigger holdings, particularly when it comes to the economy of scale, but there is strength 
<br/>in our smallness through the cooperatives or through the clusters (whatever we want to call them), if 
<br/>we group them together, look at the value chain and particularly, capacity development. Thank you, 
<br/>honourable Minister, for committing to the farmer schools for the next financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister of Finance is listening. All he needs to do is to declare his interest 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because he is from Muanidevo and provide the funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another critical area, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the mill itself.  The egg and the golden goose rule - 
<br/>same thing with sugar, we need to invest in the mill. This is a 1970 mill. The driers, the eight big 
<br/>driers, are still kerosene driers but we have made some investment and I hope that Government will 
<br/>continue with that investment because with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Codex, we need to have the highest standard because the dollar is in the quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mill was neglected, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just like the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), and Fiji 
<br/>Rice  gets  its  money  from  processed  paddy.    Therefore,  the  challenge  as  well  for  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Agriculture is to ensure that more paddy is produced because they will process the paddy 
<br/>and then from the processed paddy, they will then have money from rice.  But for us to produce good 
<br/>quality rice, let us fix the mill first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government has started that process, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are new driers in 
<br/>place because with climate change, the drier is very,very critical now because rice needs about 11 
<br/>percent moisture level (if I am correct) and we need to fix the silos as well because the farmers are 
<br/>producing, but now one of their biggest challenge is that they do not have driers at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The traditional system no longer works now where they keep it in heaps because of climate 
<br/>change, otherwise it will germinate before it gets to the mill.  They need more volume in terms of 
<br/>drying.  That is why, apart from the old processing, you need to fix the driers and the silos as well 
<br/>for storage.  Then it will be good for the farmers because most of the time it demoralises the farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The farmers have planted, they have harvested but when it comes to purchasing, Fiji Rice 
<br/>cannot purchase simply because they do not have storage capacity.  Not only that, because they can 
<br/>only store in the silos when they have reached the 11 percent moisture level.  So, both of these are 
<br/>very important, and I hope that Government can continue and, of course, we have our friends and our 
<br/>partners as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour issue, that is reality.  We just need to bring in mechanisation, but we have to look at 
<br/>each of the farmers groups.  Some prefer the </span><span>vodre, </span><span>that is the work behind type, and some prefer the 
<br/>bigger combined harvester, but the honourable Minister knows this very well and he knows the story 
<br/>about the dozer too.  Maybe he can tell us during tea break. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is mention about new varieties because with climate change, we need 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more resilience, and we have to look at the new varieties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the maximum utilisation of land and the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Sugar  is  listening,  and  he  knows  that  this  is  something  that  we  have  tried  to  start  as  well.    The 
<br/>honourable Minister and honourable Assistant Minister for Rural Development talked about moving 
<br/>rice out of Dreketi, but we need to look at the opportunities, particularly in sugarcane farmers because 
<br/>they are sitting farmers and not all of their land is utilised for cane.  There is a lot of wetland in the 
<br/>sugarcane belts as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back then in the Committee on the Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL), we were looking at 
<br/>the holding for each farmer, the land classification and how can they best utilise the land that they 
<br/>have.  A farmer can have 50 acres of lease for cane, but he is only planting 30 acres.  Perhaps, five 
<br/>acres or 10 acres is too hilly. We have started with pineapple in those areas in Ba and the wet areas, 
<br/>we are considering rice.   You maximise the farmers income, you diversify, at  the same time you 
<br/>spread the farmers’ risks as well.  The more income that the farmer gets, the better it will be for them, 
<br/></span><span>and we have a challenge now about enticing farmers to remain, otherwise they will leave the land, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  I  would  urge  the  honourable  Ministers,  please,  continue  the  dialogue,  continue  with 
<br/>discussions because there are some cross-cutting issues that need to be sorted which includes land 
<br/>leases as well.  Honourable Minister, if you are in Vanua Levu, please, go and look at Korokadi first.  
<br/>There are some serious issues in Korokadi now, and if they can be addressed because there is huge

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potential in Korokadi, apart from the three stages in Muanidevo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, huge potentials, not only in Fiji, if you have been to the Solomon 
<br/>Islands, our Melanesian brothers there are crazy with rice.  I do not know why, but they love rice.  
<br/>Maybe, there are 40 million or 50 million and if we cannot achieve sufficiency level, at least, and if 
<br/>we half that import, that is another 25 million and 30 million into the hands of our farmers.  Let us 
<br/>work gradually, let us do all the right things that are needed, particularly the very chain because of 
<br/>potential in there, we can do it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  begin  by  thanking  the  former 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for preparing this Report.  Let me also 
<br/>join the honourable Members and Ministers who spoke before me in thanking the Chairman, Board 
<br/>members and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Fiji Rice Limited and I am doing this also on behalf 
<br/>of the honourable Prime Minister, who is the Minister responsible for the Fiji Rice Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with  the sentiments and the observation  by all the honourable Members  about  the 
<br/>turnaround  in  the  performance  of  the  Company  and  I  was  quite  pleased  when  Fiji  Rice  Limited 
<br/>acknowledged the fact that, even though the Company has been turned around financially, I know 
<br/>they have made some good investments in the mill itself, they have replaced the kerosene driers with 
<br/>electric  driers  and  there  has  been  some  upgrade  work  in  terms  of  making  sure  that  the  silos  are 
<br/>improved and generally, the milling infrastructure so that they are able to accommodate the increase 
<br/>in production of paddy generally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although over the last several years, I think we have seen some increase between 2021 and 
<br/>2022 but as I have said, the most important aspect of any company based on production of the crop 
<br/>is the crop itself.  If we do not address the farm level efficiency, farm level incentives, farm level 
<br/>production, then no matter what you do with the mill, you are not going to be profitable.  You may 
<br/>be profitable for a while, but if the production does not keep pace with what is required by the mill, 
<br/>then obviously you are not going to do that.  That is what has happened with respect to the sugar 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wanted to, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir, say that the 
<br/>challenges facing the rice industry and, of course, it has a big history, you would remember in the 
<br/>1970s when the irrigation schemes were set up in Nausori, Navua and then in 1970s.  In fact, if you 
<br/>read the planning document and the debate on the setting up of these rice schemes, it was a very, very 
<br/>bipartisan support and initiative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you read the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>at that time, you will see the honourable Prime Minister at that 
<br/>time, the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the late Siddiq Koya, the Leader of the Opposition and the 
<br/>Leader of the National Federation Party at that time, those leaders saw the need for development 
<br/>around those sectors and it has lasted this long, Mr. Speaker, except that over so many years, we have 
<br/>not been able to provide or to put in the kind of investment that was needed to scale up the industry 
<br/>in a way that would have been very, very efficient and also would have served not only our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In  fact,  by  1990,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  were  almost  like  66  percent  self-sufficient  in  the  rice 
<br/></span><span>industry in this country, but over the years that has gone down.  It is important, not only from the 
<br/></span><span>point of view of rural development, supporting income of the rural communities, but also in terms of 
<br/>producing something which is very healthy. The experts and all the research show that brown rice 
<br/>contains most of the vitamins and minerals - rich in dietary fibre. It is good for blood pressure, good 
<br/>for lowering cholesterol as well, I am told.

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As has been pointed out before that there is an increasing awareness about the health benefits 
<br/>of brown rice.  I am hoping that more marketing, I think the FRL recently not only held the Farmers 
<br/>Award in different categories.  His Excellency the President was there to present those awards.  I 
<br/>think those are good initiatives, Mr. Speaker, to bring back the awareness about the need to cultivate 
<br/>more rice which is not only going to serve the interest of the farmers who are involved in it, but also 
<br/>serve the interest of the country as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I could not agree more with the honourable Leader of the Opposition that we need quality 
<br/>people.  He is absolutely right; I agree with him.  You need good Board members, you need good 
<br/>CEOs, you need quality, except that I want to remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition that 
<br/>not everyone who was there under their Government was appointed on merit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, that is history, Mr. Speaker, we are not going to get everything right at all times, 
<br/>but  the  philosophy  behind  the  Coalition  Government  is  that  we  are  going  to  make  sure  that  we 
<br/>consult, we work together, we bring people into the discussion and debate and by doing that, I think 
<br/>we would be able to bring people, incentivise people to come and serve the country, serve the people, 
<br/>not  to  serve their own interest  in  different  Boards and different  institutions.  And there would be 
<br/>numerous examples of that, that we can point out, but I am not going to go into that, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>but  I  agree  with  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  that  this  is  probably  an  example  of  a 
<br/>company which has been turned round and perhaps. with good leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of farmers leaving, Mr. Speaker, I think it is a general problem within the rural 
<br/>areas - the shortage of labour but over the years, I think the economics of some of those crops in 
<br/>terms of how farmers have been able to sustain their income has eroded and largely because the cost 
<br/>of production has been escalating.  That is a very, very difficult proposition.   I know honourable 
<br/>Members talked about subsidies to the farmers.  That is something that the non-sugar crop farmers 
<br/>have articulated, they have been talking about that over the years and obviously, there was no thinking 
<br/>put forward in terms of how to incentivise farmers more, apart from supporting them with acquiring 
<br/>appropriate technology.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  also  incentivising  them  to  reduce  the  cost  of  production.      One  way  you  can  do  that 
<br/>temporarily is to do that by subsidy. But subsidy, Mr. Speaker, can incentivise the other way around.  
<br/>It can incentivise the farmers to remain inefficient because the subsidies allow them to make some 
<br/>profit.  So, I think these are issues that honourable Members would realise that we need to  think 
<br/>through carefully and perhaps, set a target, a time limit within which we encourage farmers to become 
<br/>more efficient.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those points, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister, I want to thank 
<br/>the Committee Members and thank all those who are responsible for turning around their company. 
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing on Economic Affairs to give 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his right of reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  honourable  Members  for  their 
<br/></span><span>contribution.  Those contributions and issues that have been raised have provided further insights 
<br/></span><span>into the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly, I would just like to comment on some of the issues that have 
<br/>been raised.  On subsidy, I totally agree with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  that  perhaps,  we  need  to 
<br/>examine much closely the subsidy that is being provided, particularly when you look at how farmers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Review Report – Fiji Rice Limited 2013-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>521 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are responding to the subsidy. We are subsidising price but for how long we can continue, but we 
<br/>need to assess that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of technical assistance that has been raised also by 
<br/>the honourable Minister on technical assistance in ensuring that farmers are much more efficient. So, 
<br/>it needs quite a lot of research to be done at farmer level.  From experience, there is a lot of technical 
<br/>assistance being provided on rice.  For the last 30 years, there was quite significant research being 
<br/>undertaken, but in terms of the continuity in the staff that are there in the Ministry to ensure that these 
<br/>studies are being disseminated adequately, particularly to farmers in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue on brown rice has been alluded to by most of the speakers and that is one of the 
<br/>major product that has been developed by Fiji Rice and it is one of the products that they are trying 
<br/>to sell.  Of course, last week, I was talking to Mr. Raj Sharma who was in New Zealand, he mentioned 
<br/>that there is a big demand also from our Fijian community in New Zealand for more brown rice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the Government priorities and I hope there 
<br/>will be more synergy with the work that is being done by Fiji Rice in terms of achieving what we 
<br/>expect in the next four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On climate change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly when we are developing an industry that is 
<br/>providing food to our people. Climate change is not only affecting us but affecting the countries that 
<br/>are  supplying  us,  and  this  is  an  issue  that  we  should  be  thinking  about,  particularly  the  major 
<br/>countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As your may have realised, Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, India shut down its exports of rice. 
<br/>When they have an alternative and mandate to feed their own people, they will shut down exports.  
<br/>Of course, climate change is also affecting some of the countries that are supplying us, particularly 
<br/>Vietnam.  If you look at the Mekong Valley in Vietnam, one of the largest producers of rice is also 
<br/>being affected by climate change.  It will affect the distribution of rice to us, but the onus is on us to 
<br/>intensify the cultivation of rice in the rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the issue of co-operatives, perhaps we need to look into this more closely and come 
<br/>up with successful cooperatives and try to upscale it on other areas by involving the people who are 
<br/>involved in co-operatives and those are the ones who can promote it to other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Capacity, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  This has been an issue that we 
<br/>had already discussed over a long period of time when we used to discuss about capacity development 
<br/>in our communities, changing the mindset.  I think we need to go into that also.  This Government 
<br/>will try to look into that, trying to change the mindset and pilot it in some places so that we change 
<br/>the mindset of our people to adapt new technology and try to go into the agriculture production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again,  I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their contribution to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debate, and the former Members for coming up with the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
