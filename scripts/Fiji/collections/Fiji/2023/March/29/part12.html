<div><span>Review Report - Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I am pleased to present the 
<br/>Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the review of the Civil Aviation Authority of 
<br/>Fiji 2020 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, in the last term of Parliament, 
<br/>was referred the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2020 Annual Report. The Committee was tasked by 
<br/>Parliament to review the Annual Report and the same Report was re-introduced and referred to the 
<br/>current Standing Committee on Social Affairs to scrutinise and report back on its findings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee took note of and deliberated on the previous Committee's work.  This Report 
<br/>reiterated the work done by the previous Committee in reviewing and highlighting the contents of 
<br/>the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji  and made recommendations on the observations and findings 
<br/>noted in the Report. It further highlighted the discussions that was held by the Committee with Civil 
<br/>Aviation Authority of Fiji in relation to the issues noted from its Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year 2020 was an unprecedented one in the history of aviation due to the substantial impact 
<br/>of the coronavirus disease or the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. Due to the drop in 
<br/>international passenger traffic, the total aircraft movements both, domestic and international, at Fiji’s 
<br/>two international aerodromes dropped by 50 percent, and within the Nadi Flight Information Region 
<br/>traffic levels also dropped by 61.3 percent compared to the 2019 numbers.  The Government grant 
<br/>of $2.5 million in the 2020-2021 financial year helped sustain CAAF and its operations, as a result 
<br/>of funding constraints due to the reduction in international passenger travel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2020, work commenced for the review of Fiji’s primary legislation – the Civil Aviation 
<br/>Act 1976, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Act 1979 and the Civil Aviation Reform Act 1999.  The 
<br/>objective  of  this  project  was  to  amalgamate  into  one  document  all  of  the  civil  aviation  primary 
<br/>legislation,  except  security,  and  ensure  that  all  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO) 
<br/>protocol questions relating to the primary legislation were adequately addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the Members of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs  during the last term of Parliament for all their hard work and effort 
<br/>which has greatly assisted our Committee in the completion of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social 
<br/>Affairs and I extend my gratitude to the former acting CEO of CAAF, Mr. Rigamoto Aisake, and his 
<br/></span><span>staff for their timely assistance in this review process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all Members of Parliament to take note of the Report.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and  
<br/>Disaster Management 2016-2017 &amp; 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, this morning, I am pleased to present 
<br/>the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Ministry of Rural 
<br/>and Maritime Development and Disaster Management for 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  the  2016-2017  and  2017-2018  reporting  periods,  Fiji  was  still 
<br/>recovering from the widespread damage and destruction brought about by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> which was 
<br/>estimated  at  $2  billion.    The  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management’s  coordination  role  in  restoring  normalcy  to  lives  reflected  its  critical  role  in 
<br/>coordinating Government’s effort during emergencies and at normal times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite </span><span>TC Winston’s</span><span> recovery programmes and many challenges encountered, the Ministry 
<br/>adjusted positively and continued to implement capital programmes assigned for rural and maritime 
<br/>areas.  The  Ministry  made  a  positive  improvement  in  the  2017-2018  performance  period  with  89 
<br/>percent budget utilisation compared to 76 percent in the 2016-2017 performance period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Social Affairs, in the last term of Parliament, was referred the 
<br/>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management’s 2016-2018 Annual Report 
<br/>and was tasked by Parliament to review the Annual Report.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same Report was 
<br/>being reinstated and referred to the current Standing Committee on Social Affairs to scrutinise the 
<br/>Report and report back on its findings.  The Committee took note of and deliberated on the previous 
<br/>Committee's work on the mentioned Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  will  reiterate  the  work  done  by  the  previous  Committee  in 
<br/>reviewing  and highlighting  the contents of the  Ministry of Rural  and  Maritime Development  and 
<br/>Disaster Management Report and made recommendations on the observations and findings noted in 
<br/>the  Report.    It  further  highlighted  the  discussions  held  by  the  Committee  with  the  Ministry  with 
<br/>regards to the issues noted from its Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social  Affairs  in  the  last  term  for  all  their  effort  that  has  greatly  assisted  our  Committee  in  the 
<br/></span><span>formulation and completion of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank the honourable Members of the current Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs and also wish to thank the former Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Rural and 
<br/>Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management,  Mr.  David  Kolitagane  and  his  staff,  for  their 
<br/>timely assistance in this review process.
