<div><span>8th Our Ocean Conference – Panama 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I,  first  of  all,  congratulate  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition on his appointment to that position in this august Parliament.  I am sure we 
<br/>can expect the same degree of diligence in the performance of his duty, as he has shown in his career 
<br/>in various areas this far.  Congratulations!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had promised earlier on, while I briefly responded to the question from 
<br/>the honourable Member on the outcomes of the 8</span><span>th</span><span> Our Ocean Conference held in Panama, I promised 
<br/>to come back with a Ministerial Statement during this Sitting, so after this was cleared in Cabinet 
<br/>yesterday, I have come to deliver this Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ‘Our Ocean Conference’, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition is 
<br/></span><span>very much aware of and well informed in, was inaugurated in 2014 at the United States Department 
<br/></span><span>of State Initiative to draw international attention to the serious threats facing the world oceans and 
<br/>increase in global commitments to support marine conservation and enable sustainable development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The objective of the annual Our Ocean Conference (OOC) is to:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase partnerships and investments to create and enforce Marine Protected Areas

<div><span>(MPAs) as we are familiar with in Fiji and the Pacific); 
<br/>develop sustainable fisheries, which is very important for us also in the Pacific; 
<br/>reduce marine pollution; 
<br/>unlock sustainable financing; and 
<br/>mitigate climate change-induced impacts on our oceans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Conference comprised a series of interactive events attended by ocean 
<br/>champions and activists who strive to inspire the leaders - our leaders, national leaders, international 
<br/>leaders, entrepreneurs, scientists and civil society to identify solutions and commit to actions that 
<br/>protect and conserve our oceans and its resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji first attended the OOC in 2022 as the Pacific Region Political High Level Champion for 
<br/>Ocean and as Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency Chair.   At the year 2022 OOC, Sir, in Palau, 
<br/>Fiji demonstrated, and I congratulate my predecessor and the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s 
<br/>strong commitment to invest in supporting a sustainable blue economy in part through the proposed 
<br/>issuance of a blue bond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reflecting  on  the  8</span><span>th</span><span>  Our  Ocean  Conference,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Republic  of  Panama 
<br/>became  the  first  Central  American  country  to  host  the  OOC  with  the  theme,  “Our  Ocean  Our 
<br/>Connection”, which is very true for us in the Pacific and those bordering the Pacific, as well as other 
<br/>oceans in the world. The Government of Panama highlighted the importance of knowledge as the 
<br/>basis  of  our  actions  and  qualities  to  ensure  protection  of  our  ocean,  responsible  management  of 
<br/>marine resources and sustainable future economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  say  that  Fiji  was  offered  the  opportunity  to  address  the 
<br/>Conference in the official plenary.  Throughout, that opportunity as head of the delegation, I set the 
<br/>stage through a plea to the Leaders present and millions watching around the globe that we must 
<br/>ramp up our effort to protect our oceans, ocean ecosystems and ocean-based livelihoods.  My remarks 
<br/>focussed  on  emphasising  the  importance  of  immediate  conservation  actions  and  illustrated  how 
<br/>Pacific Small Islands Developing States (PSIDs) like Fiji, are facing the brunt of the effects of climate 
<br/>change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I also  underline some of the work that Fiji  is  doing  to contribute to  our 
<br/>achieving our ocean ambitions. We emphasised our work on locally managed marine area network 
<br/>and I thank the various chiefs in Lau, Vanua Levu, Lomaiviti and Yasawa, who have already planning 
<br/>or working on their network.  Sustainable aquaculture and mariculture, green shipping and the targets 
<br/></span><span>of the 30 MPAs and our renewable energy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  delegation  advocated  the  importance  of  working  together  with  partners  to  co-finance 
<br/>crucial investments in the blue economy.  Outcomes asked by the honourable Member yesterday in 
<br/>terms of outcomes of the Panama Conference, a total of 341 new commitments were made.  These 
<br/>commitments represent over US$20 billion of new investments in ocean conservation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 8</span><span>th </span><span>OOC had six focussed areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Sustainable Fisheries received 52 new commitments; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Marine Pollution Plastics received 65 new commitments; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Marine Protected Areas received 52 new commitments; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Climate Change received 102 new commitments; and 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Marine Security received 38 new commitments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable Blue Economies received 52 new commitments; 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The funding is derived from the following sources: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A  sum  of  US$S865  million  was  committed  by  the  European  Union  and  US$6  billion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committed by the United States of America. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Another commitment came from charitable organisations - Bloomberg Philanthropies and 
<br/>Arcadia, which established a fund worth $51 million to help support indigenous peoples 
<br/>and local communities, NGOs and governments to improve and expand marine protection 
<br/>and to help nations protect 30 percent of oceans by 2030.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we hear about the 2030 target, that is what it is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  goal  of  the  coming  Montreal  Global  Biodiversity  Framework,  an  alliance  organisation 
<br/>foundation,  with  private  donors  also  committed  to  a  donation  of  $5  million  to  help  developing 
<br/>countries join the High Seas Treaty that was being negotiated and eventually agreed upon.  That was 
<br/>in New York, at the same time as the Our Ocean Conference. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A coalition of groups known as the Connect to Protect the Eastern Tropical Pacific Coalition 
<br/>also  announced  a  recent  commitment  of  $118.5 million  in  private  and  public  funds  to  strengthen 
<br/>marine protection for the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, an area encompassing more than 
<br/>500,000 square kilometres or 193,000 square miles of highly productive and biodiverse waters of 
<br/>Ecuador,  Columbia,  Panama  and  Costa  Rica.    Previously,  Our  Ocean  Conferences  had  generated 
<br/>more than 1,800 commitments worth approximately US$108 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Fiji, we announced our agreement to work with the Government of the United States of 
<br/>America in partnership to undertake a feasibility study to explore the potential of creating a green 
<br/>shipping corridor in the region. We can work to expand access to new fields and technologies.  Upon 
<br/>its completion, the two Parties will initiate discussions on next steps among key stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji also agreed to join the green shipping challenge which is an initiative 
<br/>that catalyses actions from countries and non-State actors to advance the transition to 1.5 degrees 
<br/>alignment shipping sector.  The United States, in pursuing this technical cooperation under Green 
<br/>Shipping Corridor Initiation Project announced under the Green Shipping Challenge at COP27.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Domestic shipping services are the lifeline for our citizens in outer islands to participate in 
<br/>the life of our nation and our economy.  With over 300 islands and limited resources, aging ships in 
<br/>our  Government  fleet  are  becoming  increasingly  expensive  to  Government  and  by  extension  to 
<br/>taxpayers  to  service  those  areas.    We,  thus,  intend  to  invest  in  new  greener  ships  powered  by 
<br/>renewable energy, to ensure greater financial and environmental sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of our commitment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to create more MPAs, I thank you and other 
<br/>high chiefs of Fiji, who have allowed this programme to be carried out in your </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>areas and just 
<br/>beyond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has committed to designate 30 percent of our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as MPAs 
<br/>by 2030.  However, it is critical to understand how these MPAs function and how they are to be 
<br/></span><span>enforced.  Securing financing to aid the various stakeholders to manage these areas, is crucial to the 
<br/></span><span>survival and conservation of our marine resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Sustainable  Marine  Tourism,  according  to  the  COVID-19  Appraisal  Report  on  ocean 
<br/>economy  and  the  economic  sector  in  Fiji  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
<br/>Development  (OECD),  90  percent  of  tourism  is  based  in  coastal  areas  and  these  activities  create 
<br/>valuable proceeds for conservation activities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>467 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  shed  light  on  the  importance  of  working  with  our  tourism 
<br/>sector to proactively protect our marine resources while ensuring these resources create benefits that 
<br/>can be equitably shared. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Sustainable Ocean Planning, Fiji’s National Ocean Policy is now being implemented and 
<br/>supported  in  part  through  our  partnership  with  US-based  Waitt  Foundation.    I  signed  the 
<br/>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Foundation earlier this year just before I left for 
<br/>Panama.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The challenges our ocean faced is complex and requires stakeholders from different sectors 
<br/>to work together.  Our Government is working closely with like-minded Governments from around 
<br/>the  world  to  share  best  practices,  knowledge  and  identify  opportunities  to  better  ensure  the 
<br/>sustainable management of our marine space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the 8</span><span>th</span><span> OOC which was the last one in Panama, Fiji reconfirmed our deep-
<br/>sea mining moratorium during a bilateral meeting with the President of Palau.  We also supported 
<br/>the United States Special  Envoy on Climate Change, Secretary John Kerry, who called  for green 
<br/>shipping corridors to impart through the articulation of Fiji’s Shipping Emission Reduction Goals 
<br/>and our broader aims to green our domestic shipping sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji also met with the head of delegation for the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  
<br/>In this meeting, discussion focussed on the GCF’s United States $1.695 billion funding committed 
<br/>as part of seven projects including  those at  the national,  regional and global  level  where Fiji  is  a 
<br/>beneficiary, as well as ways to simplify the processes required to utilise those funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  spoke  on  ways  to  assist  PSIDs  to  develop  robust  proposed  projects  and  project 
<br/>proposals.  As mentioned, Sir, our Government is working towards not only accessing finance, but 
<br/>also to ensure that the financing arrangement that we put in place are sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that regard, our Ministry of Finance - thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>responsible, is working towards achieving accreditation with the GCF and the Adaptation Fund, to 
<br/>be able to directly access project financing and develop large scale projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our delegation held bilateral meetings with the Minister of International Co-
<br/>operation of Norway and we spoke about enhancing Fiji’s Ocean Pathway Partnership (OPP), which 
<br/>calls for all urgent  attention to the critical  links between the ocean and climate change.  We also 
<br/>discussed potential assistance for the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership (PBSP) with Norway, given 
<br/>Norway is a world leader in green shipping.  Panama’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable 
<br/>Erika  Mouynes,  we  discussed  what  centred  around  the  sharing  of  experiences  related  to  the 
<br/>development of sustainable tourism, MPAS and other areas of mutual interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the United Kingdom (UK) Secretary of State for the Environment, the Right honourable 
<br/>Therese Coffey, we had discussions focussed on ocean protection and MPAs.  Commitments led by 
<br/>the UK as well as discussions on UK’s contribution towards the second replenishment of GCF, and 
<br/>I noted that the UK also funded the feasibility study and our proposed Blue Bond Insurance carried 
<br/></span><span>out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is incumbent upon us to champion ocean issues and the needs for our 
<br/>region.  We must continue to press for change, not only for our benefit but for our fellow PSIDs and 
<br/>many of which were not able to make it to Panama due to various constraints. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to develop these, I reiterate what I mentioned yesterday about calling on the

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expertise and the experience of now the honourable Leader of the Opposition,  who had been our 
<br/>champion in this area over few years to assist us, as we continue our negotiations and attendances at 
<br/>the various conferences from here on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you allow me, I will table a copy of the statement before you.  Thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  respond  to  the 
<br/>Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister on the recent 8</span><span>th</span><span> Our Oceans Conference 
<br/>(OOC) that was held in Panama during the period - 2</span><span>nd</span><span> March to 3</span><span>rd</span><span> March, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the very outset, let me say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we totally agree with his concluding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remarks that it is incumbent on all of us to champion ocean issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister, the Our Oceans Conference 
<br/>started way back in 2014 and we, as a region, and let me go back to the </span><span>Suva Declaration</span><span> from 2</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/>September to 4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2015, agreed and our Leaders have seen how we have suffered and this 
<br/>is what is stated in the </span><span>Suva Declaration</span><span>, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“See  and  suffer  from  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change,  including  but  not 
<br/>limited  to  increased  intensity  of  tropical  cyclones,  sea  level  rise,  severe  storm  surges, 
<br/>more frequent and more extreme weather events, coral bleaching, saltwater intrusions, 
<br/>high king tides, coastal erosion, changing precipitation patterns, submersion of islands 
<br/>and ocean acidification, with scientific evidence clearly informing us these impacts will 
<br/>further intensify overtime.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So consistent with 2014, in 2015, our Leaders have identified how it affects us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, that is also translated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific 
<br/>Continent.  Again, our Leaders stated that as large oceanic countries and territories, we are custodians 
<br/>of nearly 20 percent of the earth surface and we place great cultural and spiritual value on our oceans 
<br/>and land as our common heritage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is linked to the geopolitics in the region as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This is why we occupy 
<br/>a  vitally  significant  place  in  global  strategic  terms.    As  a  consequence,  heightened  geopolitical 
<br/>competition impacts our member countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further,  there  is  an  increasing  commercial  and  State-sponsored  interest  in  our  region’s 
<br/>ecological and natural resources. This is reflected in the global communities’ special interest in the 
<br/>blue economy and suggest that there will be growing demand for our resources over the years to 
<br/>come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not go into the details, but let me just pick up on something that the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister stated about Green Shipping.  Unfortunately, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Defence is not in the Chamber today but this is in terms of defence as well.  Defence is also green 
<br/></span><span>defence, and one of the key areas that Defence is targeting now is on the Naval fleet to be consistent 
<br/></span><span>with the green shipping initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from our commitment to our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Fiji and 
<br/>the Marshall Islands were the first two island countries and perhaps, the first two among the world, 
<br/>to further strengthen their NDCs - that commitment that was made in 2019, so it is important to us.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>469 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have talked about the regional scene, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but locally, if we go to Part 13 of the 
<br/>Climate  Change  Act  2021,  it  is  the  section  that  deals  with  oceans  and  climate  because  of  the 
<br/>significance of the ocean in our country as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, globally, we have been the advocate not only for Fiji but for the region.  As 
<br/>a small Pacific Island Developing State but big ocean State, it is important, and I am again urging all 
<br/>honourable Members that we need to be consistent in our statements, particularly when it comes to 
<br/>issues as such because we are expected as responsible Parliamentarians because this is a fight that 
<br/>we all need to be involved in and we need to be in solidarity because it affects us.  Our ocean defines 
<br/>and identifies us.   It  is  our life, it is our culture, it is  our very own existence, and we all need to 
<br/>champion ocean issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, with the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), you are very well aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Biodiversity  is  important  for  all  of  us.    It  affects  our  economic  security,  our  food  security,  our 
<br/>livelihood and we need to be working together on this.  Honourable Prime Minister, we are here to 
<br/>support and work together with you on this.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for tea and before 
<br/>doing so, I would like to inform you that there has been a slight change in the order of the Ministerial 
<br/>Statements that has been set.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications has withdrawn from making a statement and 
<br/>as such, when we resume, we will go straight to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and 
<br/>Poverty Alleviation, to make her statement. Thank you.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Country Gender Assessment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, before I commence with my Statement, I just wish all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the women of Fiji a Happy International Women’s month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  away,  Mr.  Speaker,  on  the  International  Women’s  Day,  however,  I  just  want  to 
<br/>congratulate  all  women  around  the  country  who  had  celebrated  this  very  important  day  and  also 
<br/>International  Women’s  month  where  I  am  able  to  speak  on  this  very  important  document.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, I am filled with great pride to share that last night it was launched by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, and I was present to do so for this document - Fiji Country Gender Assessment (FCGA).  
<br/>It is a first of its kind in the Pacific and the first in the Asia Pacific region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCGA  was  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  in 
<br/>partnership  with  the  Fiji  Bureau  of  Statistics,  across  the  whole  of  Government  and  in  close 
<br/>collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including civil society and women’s rights organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, data is  a powerful  tool for achieving gender equality.    It  enables us  to  track 
<br/>progress,  identify  the  barriers  that  women  and  girls  face,  and  create  evidence-based  solutions  to 
<br/>address those barriers.  At its core, data is about counting women and girls in all their diversity. It is 
<br/>about  capturing  their  experiences,  realities,  perspectives  and  contributions,  and  using  that 
<br/>information to ensure accountability, budget investment and drive progress towards gender equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note and with the perform sense of enthusiasm and responsibility, I have the privilege 
<br/>of addressing Parliament today to present and discuss the findings from the FCGA, and to share the 
<br/>collaborative and comprehensive process of its development, signifying a monumental step towards 
<br/>achieving gender equality in our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCGA  is  a  whole  of  Government  and  comprehensive  Report  that  provides  key  and 
<br/>updated statistics, sex disaggregated data and analysis across seven critical sectors and areas such as 
<br/>education,  health,  economy,  ending  violence  against  women  and  girls,  women  in  leadership  and 
<br/>decision making, social norms and environment.  It highlights many of the achievements and progress 
<br/>in Fiji, as well as the remaining challenges in order to deepen collective efforts for achieving gender 
<br/>equality and empowerment of all women and girls in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCGA  further  expected  to  contribute  to  a  whole  of  Government  and  evidence-based 
<br/>policy  dialogue  to  support  integrating  gender  concerns  and  priorities  into  relevant  policies, 
<br/>programmes  and  budget  investments,  while  also  enhances  timely  and  quality  data  and  gender 
<br/>statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, FGCA is the first of its kind in the Pacific and the Asia Pacific region, as it 
<br/>allowed access to existing data across all Government agencies, along in partnership with all relevant 
<br/>stakeholders.  This included the establishment of a Data Steering Working Group and a Peer Review 
<br/>Committee, both of which played a critical role in the development of the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Data Steering Working Group which comprised representatives of Government agencies, 
<br/>facilitated access to relevant data, reviewed and validated analysis, while identifying data issues and 
<br/>gaps to improve the collection, accessibility and use of gender data and statistics.  A comprehensive 
<br/>list  of  gender  indicators  was  developed  in  partnership  with  this  Data  Steering  Working  Group, 
<br/>providing a deep dive into issues across sectors. The indicator list helped in the systematic collection 
<br/>of data and identified gaps also in the whole of Fiji data landscape.

<div><span>The Peer Review Committee, Mr. Speaker, which comprised of Civil Society Organisations, 
<br/>women’s  rights  and  faith-based  organisations,  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community,  the  United 
<br/>Nations, development partners and others, conducted a rigorous review process for each thematical 
<br/>chapter, providing valuable feedback and insights.  Each FCGA chapter is a deep dive into the topic 
<br/>and together, Mr. Speaker, the seven chapters comprise a report of a whopping 500 pages, which I 
<br/>hold here in my hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  make  the  findings  more  accessible  though,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  also  included  seven 
<br/>policy briefs which I also hold here in my hand.  The policy briefs, Sir, on each of the chapters, and 
<br/>they are in more concise format. Additionally, we have a visual report containing infographic sheets, 
<br/>one for each chapter.  These infographics provide a snapshot of the most critical data and analysis, 
<br/>making it easier to engage with the findings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  highlight,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the FCGA  was  a  battle  issue  for  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government.  Most importantly, as for the inclusion of gender data disaggregated by ethnicity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the first month of my tenure, Mr. Speaker, I required the Ministry to review and ensure the 
<br/>inclusion of available disaggregated data as much as possible, if it was available through the FCGA 
<br/>process, and to reinstate any deletions and censorship of contents, evidence-based recommendations, 
<br/>analysis and findings across the chapters based on ethnicity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And as I move on to highlight some of the key findings of the FCGA, I would like to, firstly, 
<br/>emphasise  and  acknowledge  the  role  of  partnership  and  meaningful  collaboration  in  overcoming 
<br/>numerous challenges faced in the process of the development of this document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  grateful  for  the  collective  efforts  of  countless  individuals  and  groups.    I  want  to 
<br/>express my deep appreciation to my predecessors, the former Minister – Ms Mereseini Rakuita and 
<br/>former Minister – Ms. Rosy Akbar, who played a significant role in shaping the initial vision and 
<br/>providing leadership while safeguarding the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  Fiji  Women  Crisis  Centre  and  the  Fiji  Women’s  Rights 
<br/>Movement for their consistent advocacy and public awareness efforts in support of the FCGA. Their 
<br/>dedication has ensured that the FCGA was neither lost nor overlooked.  Furthermore, our gratitude 
<br/>to the Government of New Zealand for generously supporting the FCGA, and to the Government of 
<br/>Australia for provision of additional technical expertise and guidance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members  of  this  august  Parliament,  the  FCGA  findings  reveal  that  despite 
<br/>notable  progress  in  some  areas,  such  as  education,  critical  challenges  continue  to  hold  back  the 
<br/>empowerment of Fijian women and girls in all diversities.  Gender discriminatory, social norms and 
<br/>cultural practices remain a significant obstacle to gender equality in Fiji.  Women’s participation in 
<br/>the formal economy and the labour force is significantly lower than that of men, and most working 
<br/>Fijian women are engaged in informal employment with lack of job security, irregular income and 
<br/>no social protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our women and girls might not be well positioned to secure work in emerging digital and 
<br/></span><span>technical fields, limiting their opportunities for economic empowerment in the context of future jobs.  
<br/></span><span>Cancers of reproductive organs, particularly breast and cervical cancer are the leading causes of death 
<br/>related to Non-Communicable Diseases among Fijian women.  Moreover, violence against women 
<br/>and girls is still pervasive with the appalling high rates of sexual violence and other forms of gender-
<br/>based violence.

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, women in Fiji shoulder three-quarters of unpaid care work at home.  The 
<br/>labour force participation rate for women is 46 percent, compared with 83 percent of men.  Only 40 
<br/>percent of women are employed, compared with 78 percent of men, and women earn on average one-
<br/>third less than men.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People aged 15 years to 24 years who  are not  in education,  employment  or training is  18 
<br/>percent, with the young women mostly affected from that 18 percent - three times the rate for young 
<br/>men.  This rate has not substantially changed in the recent years. It is important to note that these 
<br/>statistics are in the context where women outnumber men - among students in academic programmes 
<br/>in  Fiji’s  universities,  accounting  for  60  percent  to  65  percent  of  students  and  over  50  percent  of 
<br/>graduates.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  21</span><span>st</span><span>  Century  workplace  requires  that  nearly  everyone  have  digital  skills.    The  gender 
<br/>parity ratio of girls to boys enrolled in secondary level home economics courses is 15 or greater.  In 
<br/>contrast,  the gender parity  ratio is  less than one  for digital and other applied technology  courses.  
<br/>There is tendency for some parents and teachers to reinforce cultural beliefs that science, digital and 
<br/>other technologies, engineering and mathematics education is masculine and falsely imply that girls 
<br/>are innately  inferior in these fields.   Yet,  the data confirms  that  Fijian girls in  secondary schools 
<br/>enrolled in computer courses often outnumber and outperform boys. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  men’s  violence  against  women  is  normalised  in  Fiji  and  in  the  family 
<br/>dynamic, recurring from one generation to the next.  Over the course of the lives of ever-partnered 
<br/>Fijian women, nearly two thirds (64 percent) experience intimate partner violence, including physical 
<br/>violence (61 percent) and emotional violence (58 percent).  This is higher than the global average of 
<br/>one  to  every  three  women.    More  than  four  in  ten  women  experience  severe  physical  violence, 
<br/>including  50  percent  of  women  who  are  physically  attacked  during  pregnancy.    In  Fiji,  the  most 
<br/>common form of sexual violence is child sexual abuse involving girls (and some boys) under the age 
<br/>of 18, accounting for 74 percent of all the reported sexual violence cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the year 2020, four in 10 women were not able to make their own informed decisions about 
<br/>their reproductive health rights.  Cervical and breast cancers are the most common forms of cancers 
<br/>among  women.    In  2020,  the  age-specific  incidence  of  breast  cancer  was  65.1  cases  per  100,000 
<br/>Fijian women, while the related mortality rate was 41 cases per 100,000 Fijian women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The age-specific incidence of cervical cancer was 22.5 cases per 100,000 Fijian women, while 
<br/>the mortality rate was nine cases per 100,000 Fijian women.  This means approximately 293 cases 
<br/>of breast cancer and approximately 184 deaths from breast cancer and for cervical cancer, 120 cases 
<br/>and approximately 90 deaths in one year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, note that the above data and statistics were just a brief snapshot of the challenges and 
<br/>issues identified by the FCGA.  I would like to invite and urge all honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/>and  relevant  stakeholders  to  undertake  a  deep  dive  and  study  this  document  findings  and  policy 
<br/>recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  had  stressed  last  night  in  the  launch, 
<br/></span><span>behind these numbers are the stories of real lives - lives that have been impacted by gender inequality 
<br/></span><span>and discrimination, lives that are waiting for us to take action and make a difference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With utmost commitment and dedication, I would like to highlight that moving forward, the 
<br/>FCGA  is  expected  to  serve  as  a  primary  guide  for  all  our  policies,  programmes  and  budgetary 
<br/>allocations.    Specifically,  we  were  focused  on  women’s  economic  empowerment,  prevention  of 
<br/>gender-based violence before it starts, women’s leadership, reproductive health rights and the future

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of work in the context of climate crisis, technology and the digital revolution, as well as inclusive of  
<br/>data and statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to emphasise too that addressing the complex issues and challenges identified by 
<br/>the FCGA requires a collective effort by the whole of Government and Opposition and the whole of 
<br/>the population.  These issues cannot be solved by any single individual, agency or sector alone.  It is 
<br/>essential  to  recognise  the  interrelated  nature  of  these  challenges  and  adopt  a  multi-sectoral, 
<br/>coordinated and transformative inclusive approach that fosters partnership, collaboration and shared 
<br/>responsibility to address gender equality in our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  coming  months,  the  Ministry  will  be  rolling  out  key  Whole  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government initiatives, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the development of the Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan (2023-2028); 
<br/>the  roll  out  of  the  upcoming  Fiji  National  Action  Plan  to  prevent  Violence  against  all 
<br/>Women and Girls (2023-2028); and  
<br/>Phase II of the Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity Development Initiative (ICD) 
<br/>which has so far done a pilot project for nine Ministries, with specifics on gender responsive 
<br/>budgeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we undertake these initiatives, we are looking forward to working with all Government 
<br/>agencies,  with  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  Opposition  Caucus  and,  of  course,  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders  to  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Fiji  Country  Assessment  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations across all settings and sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, that this document is not based on just any modelling of 
<br/>data, it is based on actual data provided by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics and I want to thank the former 
<br/>CEO of the Fiji Bureau of Statistics, who was present last night as part of the Panel because he was 
<br/>Chairman of the Data Steering Committee and was very instrumental in helping for this data to be 
<br/>provided,  despite  the  challenges.  We  must  use  the  power  of  data  to  change  our  lives  through 
<br/>evidence-based policies, programmes and budgetary allocations.  This is the first step to promoting 
<br/>gender equality based on facts and statistics to address gender equalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude as I present this document, when I attended the Commission on the Status of 
<br/>Women in New York, many world leaders did not have this document themselves in their countries.  
<br/>So,  this  is  a  model,  and  I  want  to  give  acknowledgment  to  the  previous  Government  and  my 
<br/></span><span>predecessors where I now have the big task to implement this particular document and ensure that 
<br/></span><span>this is seen across all Ministries, that there is a dedication to gender responsive budgeting and also 
<br/>evidence-based policies that we will take on as a Coalition Government.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker,      
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement 
<br/>made by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation.  From the outset, I 
<br/>would  like  to  say,  good  that  it  has  progressed  to  where  the  data  has  finally  been  established  but 
<br/>Cabinet in 2020 first approved and launched this gender assessment when the former Minister was 
<br/></span><span>there,  Mrs.  Mereseini  Vuniwaqa.  Moving  on,  the  various  policies  that  came  into  place  in  the 
<br/></span><span>framework was already there, plus other budgetary allocations that were targeted to areas of needs 
<br/>only.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  all  agree,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  data  is  there  and  that  is  the  spirit  that  women  need  -
<br/></span><span>assistance.    The  onus  now  will  be  on  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women  in  her  proposal  to  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister of Finance on some of the targeted areas that will be needed to empower those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policies that come out from those evidence-based and research-based policies.  However, there are 
<br/>other issues.  A very important point was raised by the honourable Minister this morning on gender 
<br/>violence but, again, she still fails to acknowledge her previous statement here in Parliament on events 
<br/>that transpired in 1987.  Probably, that could be part of the data or evidence that should come out, 
<br/>especially when she had uttered that but, again, she missed the opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  various  opportunities  that  we  have  as  evidence  of  how  women  are 
<br/>involved in leadership, and I would like to thank the Acting Commissioner for the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service, Mrs. Salote Panapasa.  That is an achievement in a male dominated institution like the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections  Service.    I  think  she  is  the  first  woman  to  rise  to  that  leadership  role  and  that  is  an 
<br/>achievement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other achievement too that we had noted a few days ago is how women are impacting 
<br/>sports and an example of that is Ms. Rusila Nagasau from Cakaudrove, the Captain of the Fiji 7s 
<br/>Team and Fiji’s 2022 Sportswoman of the Year.  The other achievement too is when you look at our 
<br/>Fijiana Team.  They are the defending champions of the Super Rugby Women’s Division. Some of 
<br/>their players are Ms. Vitalina Naikore and Ms. Raijeli Daveau, who were also recruited in the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service Team.  These are achievements based on policies that are there from the previous 
<br/>Government on how women are impacting lives and also setting examples.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  what  we  really  need  to  look  into  is  that  one  of  the  policies  probably  that  was 
<br/>launched  last  year  during  the  term  of  the  former  Minister  for  Women,  Ms.  Rosy  Akbar,  is  the 
<br/>participation of women in agriculture and there is an existing policy. The Ministry of Agriculture and 
<br/>Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry,  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation, plus other stakeholders, can see areas where we can increase women participation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is only 14 percent participation of women in agriculture in Fiji - a very important sector, 
<br/>given that many are women in the rural areas.  That is something that we can focus on because there 
<br/>are existing  policies in  the budget  that are already there that target  our women in  the rural  areas, 
<br/>especially the removal of market fees.  Now, we hear in the Labasa Market a few weeks ago that 
<br/>market  fees  will  be  re-introduced.    That  is  something  that  the  honourable  Minister  can  look  into 
<br/>because these are some of the areas that give more income for women to take back home because 
<br/>they are the ones who look after the livelihood of the families at home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few years ago, when we brought up the Fiji Airways 
<br/>Guarantee, the honourable Minister for Women was in a </span><span>TikTok</span><span> chewing a plane.  That particular 
<br/>guarantee  supported  the  tourism  industry  and  also  supported  the  airline  industry.    That  is  where 
<br/>women also participate…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What about his comment on Indian women? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Standing Order 60, the response should be relevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is relevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Now, he is talking about Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is relevant.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is a personal attack on the honourable Minister for Women.  
<br/>Please, respond to the Ministerial Statement.  And he referred to some data from 1987 which is non-
<br/>existent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is a very fast player.  He is talking about the Fiji Rugby Union and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijiana</span><span> Team. He is a very fast player - thank you honourable Bulitavu, you may continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Women participate in the tourism industry and with the airline. 
<br/>When the borders were opened. most of the women were recruited back as flight attendants and those 
<br/>women who sell at stalls in agriculture, women went back to being employed at the hotels and even 
<br/>ATS where she had once championed the rights of ATS workers.  Women went back to packaging 
<br/>and hospitality, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, again, Sir, the data is there, there is plenty work that the honourable Minister needs to do 
<br/>and I think she needs to work on that, not only the books that she has but practical work and money 
<br/>that she needs to ask from the honourable Minister of Finance.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  have  been  advised  that  there  are  no  Bills  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consideration.
