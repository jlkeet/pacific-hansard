<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE  
<br/>FIJI CORRECTIONS SERVICE 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017-2018 which was tabled on 30th August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament.  As the Member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Report of 
<br/>the Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee on the Review of the Fiji Corrections Service Annual 
<br/>Report 2017-2018.  Before I begin, Sir, I take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable Inia 
<br/>Seruiratu on his election as the Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in the last term of Parliament, and I wish 
<br/>to proceed directly to reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in the Report.  
<br/>To  begin  with,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  a  few  pertinent  issues  identified  by  the  previous 
<br/>Committee, which include:</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service is committed to sustainably retaining its key staff and in doing 
<br/>so, meets the international correction officer-to-inmate ratio standard of one is to five, that 
<br/>is, one Corrections Officer for every five inmates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service continues to work towards its target in reducing the rate of 
<br/>recidivism annually.

<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Annual  Report  has  insufficient  information  on  the  promotion  of  gender  equality, 
<br/>however,  after  clarification,  it  was  noted  that  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  has  invested 
<br/>considerable  efforts  in  implementing  policies  that  promote  gender  equality  and 
<br/>empowerment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Fiji Corrections Service, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will go straight into the few recommendations put forth by the previous Committee 
<br/>for the consideration of the Fiji Corrections Service, which were intended for continued improvement 
<br/>service delivery, and these include – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee appreciated the fact that there was a high number of staff turnover for the 
<br/>Service  but  acknowledged  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  for  trying  to  ensure  to  maintain 
<br/>service delivery which is on par with the international standards.  The Committee, therefore, 
<br/>recommends the FCS does a thorough review of its human resources policies and plan and 
<br/>develop strategies to build capacity of the staff and retain them in the service.  
<br/>In terms of these discrepancies identified in the financial statements of the Service for the 
<br/>reported period, the Committee recommends that more collaboration is needed between the 
<br/>Fiji Corrections Service, the Ministry of Finance and the Office of the Auditor-General to 
<br/>strengthen the financial management system and to ensure that there are minimal serious 
<br/>discrepancies in future reported financial statements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I commend and acknowledge the great work carried out by the Committee of 
<br/>the previous Parliament, and I also want to thank my colleagues of the current Standing Committee 
<br/>on Justice, Law and Human Rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  few  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  the  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament to take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the speakers who are intending to speak on this, 
<br/>may I just remind honourable Members that before me is a list of speakers that have been identified 
<br/>by the honourable Whip from the Opposition and that of the honourable Leader of the Government 
<br/>in Parliament.  We will begin the batting by offering the floor to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj. 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu. 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minise  for  /foreign  Afffairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable I. Naivalurua.  
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I rise in this Chamber today as the former Chairperson 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Committee that compiled this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report covered information on the type 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of work that is actually carried out by Fiji Corrections Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Report  also  highlighted  the  work  that  has  been  undertaken  by  the  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Corrections Service as its mandate given under the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>477 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corrections Service Act 2006 which is to serve the public by keeping in custody those convicted by 
<br/>the  courts  and  providing  effective  corrective  rehabilitation  services,  whilst  applying  the  relevant 
<br/>human rights obligations and standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the review, there were few key issues identified, Mr. Speaker, and one of the key areas 
<br/>of focus for the Fiji Corrections Service is to try to reduce the rate of re-offenders in line with the 
<br/>National Development Plan on achieving the 3 percent threshold.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rate has gone 
<br/>down and provides a positive indication that the strategies put in place by the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>are being implemented effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further  to  that,  the  Committee  acknowledges  the  numerous  rehabilitation  programmes 
<br/>implemented by Fiji Corrections Service which includes the Yellow Ribbon Project.  It would be 
<br/>worth  noting that the implication of these programmes  has impacted the  lives of inmates in  their 
<br/>transition back to community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  the  Yellow  Ribbon  Project,  Fiji  Corrections  Service  took  a  lead  role  in  creating 
<br/>awareness  and  educating  the  public  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  on  taking  ownership  of  ex-
<br/>offenders once they complete their sentence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, another significant issue is the number of staff turnover which occurred within 
<br/>the reported year.  The Committee noted that the Fiji Corrections Service had engaged in substantial 
<br/>number of staff to man what is called </span><span>Operation Musu Dovu</span><span> for a short period.  The length of the 
<br/>contract for these temporary staff were entirely dependent on the harvesting season of sugarcane and 
<br/>once the task is completed, their contracts were terminated at the end of the cutting season.  This, Sir, 
<br/>added to the high turnover rate for the reported year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, also included in the number of staff turnover are the retirement, resignation and 
<br/>dismissals.  We need to keep in mind that the staff of Fiji Corrections Service are not dealing with 
<br/>normal people.  They are criminals and dealing with them is not easy.  The staff go through a lot of 
<br/>pressure and stress which also impacts their psychology.  We need to ensure that proper consideration 
<br/>is given towards the health and wellbeing of Fiji Corrections Service staff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The environment  in  which they work in, Mr. Speaker, is  very different.   With all sorts of 
<br/>inmates around them, it becomes a very tough situation for them to deal with it as these staff are not 
<br/>health professionals and are not aware of how to deal with the mindset of inmates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee also noted that the Fiji Corrections Service has endeavoured not 
<br/>to  let  the  staff  turnover  affect  their  service  delivery  and  its  aim  to  achieving  the  international 
<br/>benchmark of one Corrections Officer per five inmates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted that during the review of the Annual Report, the Fiji Corrections Service had 
<br/>utilised a total of 81 percent of its budget allocated for the fiscal year.  It was noted that unutilised 
<br/>coverage of the expenditure was a result of some pending projects that were yet to be completed in 
<br/>due time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee also undertook the scrutiny of Annual Reports using a gender 
<br/></span><span>lens  and  it  was  encouraging  to  note  that  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  is  committed  to  the 
<br/>implementation  of  gender  neutral  and  non-discriminatory  policies,  including  those  that  relate  to 
<br/>staffing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the leadership of Mr. Francis Kean, the Fiji Corrections Service has achieved so much 
<br/>to improve the life of inmates, not just during their prison term but also once they had served their 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>terms and are out to live a normal life.  Mr. Speaker, we need to continue to provide support to Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service as they are doing a wonderful job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  stand  to  support  the  recommendations  made  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  may  I  congratulate  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Seruiratu,  on  his  appointment  as  the  Leader  of  Opposition.    You  richly  deserve  that 
<br/>position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to also acknowledge the presence of the Acting Commissioner, Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service.  It  is  right  that  she  is  present  today,  given  the  Ministerial  Statement  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation.  Mr. Speaker, she is the first to rise to that 
<br/>prestigious position.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a response to the review of the Fiji Corrections Service Annual 
<br/>Report 2017-2018 submitted by the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights.  I also 
<br/>offer my congratulations for the detailed Report submitted by the Committee, and I have expressed 
<br/>the same to the Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Corrections Service is obligated under the Corrections Service Act 
<br/>2006 to serve the public by keeping in custody those convicted by the courts and providing effective 
<br/>corrective services and applying all human rights, obligations and standards.  This is the message I 
<br/>have outlined in my visit to the Fiji Corrections Service on the necessity and importance of measuring 
<br/>them to the 2013 Constitution, to the minimum standards and to the law of this land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is noted that the review captures the findings and recommendations of the 
<br/>Committee with respect to the pertinent issues noted from the contents of the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>2017-2018 Annual Report. The Report outlines the work conducted in the reported year with  an 
<br/>allocated estimate budget of $38.8million.  The Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report also reflects 
<br/>the operations and administration of the Fiji Corrections Service through the collaborative effort of 
<br/>its staff and stakeholders in achieving its target for the 2017-2018 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the deliberations and findings by the Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recidivist is regarded 
<br/>as a tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend.  In line with the Fiji Corrections Service standard 
<br/>guideline, an inmate is considered recidivist when he or she is admitted within 24 months from his 
<br/>or her initial discharge date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2017-2018 period, the Fiji  Corrections Service had implemented  programmes and 
<br/>strategies  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  reoffending  behavioural  patterns.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  this 
<br/>regard it was noted there was a significant decrease of the recidivists whereby 27 was recorded in the 
<br/>2017-2018 period, as compared to 72 in the 2016-2017 period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was  also  alluded there were  numerous programmes and activities that 
<br/>were  undertaken  in  conjunction  with  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service’s  existing  Rehabilitation 
<br/></span><span>Programmes, one of which has been the Yellow Ribbon Programme which is a programme that aims 
<br/></span><span>to successfully reintegrate inmates back into the society.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contribution made by honourable Naivalurua, who 
<br/>had initiated this project when he was the Commissioner.  I also do acknowledge the presence of the 
<br/>former Commissioner, honourable Vasu, both of which had served the institution distinguishably and 
<br/>made numerous contributions and provided new limelight as to how the rehabilitation programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>479 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be administer effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the Rehabilitation Programmes, the Committee knows that out of 
<br/>the 15 inmates targeted for the 2017-2018 period, the Fiji Corrections Service managed to secure job 
<br/>placement for 12 inmates.  It was also noted that Government had granted a total of $200,000 for the 
<br/>Yellow  Ribbon  Project  to  assist  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  in  raising  community  awareness 
<br/>throughout Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  capital  projects  activities,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  noted  that in  the  2017-2018 
<br/>period,  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  had  engaged  in  works  that  improved  the  infrastructure,  the 
<br/>Corrections enterprises and also improve Corrections services. So, over the years, we have seen a 
<br/>move away from being kept in custody and into other areas where they can be meaningfully utilised, 
<br/>given the special skills that they have before they were admitted, or the skills that they picked up 
<br/>whilst in the services of the Fiji Corrections Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  had  identified  potential  discrepancies  in  the  financial 
<br/>statement provided in the Annual Report. However, as advised by the Fiji Corrections Service, the 
<br/>Annual Report shows the audited annual financial statements whereas the budget estimate shows an 
<br/>unaudited financial budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of staff turnover, this was considered an area of concern, given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the international benchmark ratio of 1:5 Correction Officers per inmate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  clarified  by  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service,  temporary  relieving  custodial  officers  were 
<br/>engaged for three months period during the </span><span>Operation Musu Dovu</span><span>.  The services of these temporary 
<br/>relieving custodial officers were usually terminated after the completion of the works, and this had 
<br/>contributed to the high number of turnover recorded for 2017-2018 period.  The Government will 
<br/>also be looking at a new policy in terms of re-engaging and assisting in the </span><span>Operation Musu Dovu</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  gender-related  policies,  it  was  noted  that  the  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service  was  evidently  a  male-dominated  working  environment  and  rightly  so  at  a  point  in  time. 
<br/>However, the society has evolved, there is also a growing population of female inmates. That is why 
<br/>there is also a shift in terms of the employment of officers to look at the gender imbalance.  It is also 
<br/>notable  that  female  officers  have  progressed  into  prominent  positions  within  the  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service.  A good illustration of that is the Acting Commissioner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service is committed to the implementation of gender neutral and non-
<br/>discriminatory  policies,  including  those  that  relate  to  staffing.      On  that note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I 
<br/>would like to commend the Fiji Corrections Service for striving towards implementing gender neutral 
<br/>policies as we now have a female Acting Commissioner, Mrs. Salote Panapasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the recommendations by the Committee.  The 
<br/>Committee appreciated the fact that they was high turnover of staff for the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>but acknowledge the Fiji Corrections Service for trying to ensure and maintain service delivery which 
<br/>is in par with international standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also recommended that the Fiji Corrections Service does a thorough review 
<br/>of the Human Resource Policies and Plans and develop strategies to build capacity of the staff in the 
<br/>Fiji Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  last  Job  Evaluation  Exercise  (JEE)  for  Fiji  Corrections  Service  was 
<br/>undertaken  in  2003  by  Mercer  Human  Resource  Consultancy  through  the  Public  Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>480 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission. Since then, the Fiji Corrections Service had not undergone any other JEE.  It is hoped 
<br/>that a JEE will be undertaken for the Fiji Corrections Service in the not-too-distant future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned to Correction Officers during my recent tour of the Suva 
<br/>Corrections  Centre,  Correction  Officers  faced  more  difficulties  than  their  counterparts  in  the  Fiji 
<br/>Police Force and the Republic of Military Forces.  The working in the Corrections system can be 
<br/>very challenging and we need to address the trauma associated with this.  The approach now is to try 
<br/>and create an environment in which the welfare of Corrections Officers is also looked after.  Moving 
<br/>forward, this will include the upgrading of Corrections Officers accommodation, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  envisaged  that  there  will  be  a  dialogue  held  with  the  Vice-
<br/>Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific for Correction Officers to further their education, 
<br/>not only at USP but in other regional educational institutions in response to the better discharge of 
<br/>their duties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  discrepancies  identified  in  the  financial  statement  of  the  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service, the Committee recommended that more collaboration is needed between the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service, Ministry of Economy and the Office of the Attorney-General, to strengthen their financial 
<br/>management  and  ensure  that  there  is  minimal  serious  discrepancies  in  future  reported  financial 
<br/>statements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  recommended the Fiji Corrections Service will work closely with the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Finance  and  also  with  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  for  the  preparation  and 
<br/>reporting of financial statements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Attorney-General, for you input.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I give the floor to honourable Naivalurua to share some of his experiences, I would 
<br/>like to share a few experiences when sitting up here and this Report is being brought in.  Having been 
<br/>a  member  or  once  serving  time  as  an  inmate  in  our  day  and  I  am  not  only  the  first  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament to be in that kind of experience - the flatfooted honourable Bulitavu has also experienced 
<br/>that.  So, this Report has come in at a time and just to share with you honourable Members that even 
<br/>though you may be sitting here, you can be joining others by going in for some sort of crime that you 
<br/>have done, so we respect this.  We certainly respect this Report coming in just to shed some light 
<br/>with us, the lawmakers of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Review  of  the  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service Annual Report 2017-2018 that is now tabled before this sitting of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Corrections Service is a place of personal passion and history, and it remains my privilege 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to have served as Commissioner from 2006 to 2010. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we debate this Report, it is worth noting how far this organisation has 
<br/>come and how many lives have been positively impacted and changed.  It is also worth highlighting 
<br/>the essential place the Fiji Corrections Service holds in the security and transformation of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of this august Parliament, the Fiji Corrections Service sits at the backend 
<br/>of  the  judicial  system  and  was  an  organisation  that  previous  Governments  had  neglected  to  the 
<br/>detriment of the whole nation.  Nelson Mandela, a former prisoner and President of South Africa 
<br/>stated: “No one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its prisons.  A nation should not be 
<br/>judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>481 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  into  this  neglect  that  the  FijiFirst  Government,  under  the  former  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>breathed new life and through a number of initiatives, including the Yellow Ribbon Programme, they 
<br/>brought value, dignity and opportunity back to the men and women who had gone astray. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the transformation of the Fiji Corrections Service has been unprecedented 
<br/>in the history of the organisation.  The genesis of these changes first introduced in 2007 to 2008 was 
<br/>a major paradigm shift and how businesses were conducted at the Corrections Service.  The shift was 
<br/>from a contained punitive prison system to a rehabilitative corrective system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may put it plainly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was quite difficult to distinguish between an inmate 
<br/>and a staff of the Corrections Service in those days.  These changes challenged the core values of the 
<br/>serving Prison Officers at the time.  However, with perseverance, commitment and passion the duty, 
<br/>this  shift  gained  traction  and  became  the  new  norm,  resulting  in  commendable  and  remarkable 
<br/>achievements for the organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And it is here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I would like to personally acknowledge the fine men and 
<br/>women who serve as staff and officers within the Fiji Corrections Service, but who remain hidden 
<br/>and nameless in this Report.  As I stand today in this august Parliament, I recall many of their faces 
<br/>and the dedication and passion they brought to the paradigm shift of changing the organisation and 
<br/>changing lives.  Basically, Sir, the Corrections Officers used to be known or are known today as the 
<br/>captains of lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of those, if I may acknowledge, as previous speakers had recognised 
<br/>her this morning,  amongst  us is  the Acting Commissioner for the Fiji  Corrections Services, none 
<br/>other  than  Commissioner  Panapasa.    Commissioner  Panapasa  was  a  woman  who  was  identified 
<br/>earlier in her career life, Sir, as someone who had the potential and huge potential to move into higher 
<br/>positions  in  her  future  career.    So,  her  career  was  shaped  much,  much  earlier  and  that  has  been 
<br/>realised today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  staff,  officers  and  their  families  deserve  every  opportunity  to  be 
<br/>recognised for their fine work and significant sacrifice and contributions.  I also thank the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister for the similar sentiments of recognition and encouragement he shared last Friday at 
<br/>Naboro as the Chief guest of the Pass-out Parade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  tabled  in  Parliament  today,  again,  demonstrates  the  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service’s commitment, perseverance and participation in building a better Fiji.  I want 
<br/>to acknowledge at this point the previous leadership of the honourable member seated in this very 
<br/>Chamber, none other than honourable Vasu, who made significant contribution during his time as 
<br/>Commissioner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This 2017-2018 Annual Report is a record of the leadership of Corrections Commissioner 
<br/>Francis Kean. His strategic vision and purposeful leadership of the Fiji Corrections Service achieved 
<br/>significant gains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  bring  context  for  this  Report  and  share  with  this  august 
<br/></span><span>Parliament an example that will identify how far we have come, and the success identified in this 
<br/></span><span>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Naboro  Maximum  Correctional  Centre  was  built  in  1973.    However,  its  first  overall 
<br/>maintenance  and  renovations  were  carried  out  by  the  FijiFirst  Government.    Neglecting  the 
<br/>maintenance and upgrading of such critical infrastructure for 30-plus years left Fiji Corrections staff 
<br/>and inmates in an unsafe working and living environment.  The commitment and budgetary support

<div><span>Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the infrastructure upgrades undertaken by the FijiFirst Government across all the institutions has 
<br/>led to a safer working environment for Officers and better living conditions for those inside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the commitment to sound, vision and planning, the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service is the only Government organisation I know with a 10 to 20 year capital projects master plan 
<br/>(if I may).  I was unsure myself, but I had to find out whether it was true or not, here is their plan.  
<br/>This master plan is revised every two years to ensure that it meets operational and organisational 
<br/>needs, meets our international best practice and has sound and secure facilities to implement first-
<br/>class rehabilitation so that lives are changed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights some significant gains and important principles that 
<br/>remain critical to our Correctional System’s good order and operations.  Of note is the strategic aim 
<br/>and focus of the Fiji Corrections Service on the reduction of recidivism.  The Report highlights the 
<br/>decrease in recidivism of 38 percent.  This is a commendable achievement with a significant positive 
<br/>social impact on our communities and to the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights the Yellow Ribbon project and its continuing positive 
<br/>impact  and  engagement  with  the  public.    The  Yellow  Ribbon  project  is  the  flagship  of  the 
<br/>rehabilitation  movement.    The  Yellow  Ribbon  project  continues  to  be  a  major  success  with  our 
<br/>recidivism rate achieving its lowest ever recorded data of 1 percent in the financial year of August 
<br/>2020 to July 2021.  This is a major milestone for the Fiji Corrections Service and Fiji.  This is the 
<br/>heart and soul of rehabilitation or changing lives.  With the yellow ribbon as the flagship, there are 
<br/>other significant rehabilitation programmes that deserved to be highlighted in this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Corrections Service introduced the Employment Expo in 2018.  The 
<br/>Employment Expo showcases the vocational skillsets developed by those currently inside.  Selective 
<br/>eligible  inmates  are  given  an  opportunity  for  employment  under  the  Early  Release  Scheme  and 
<br/>connected to the employer through the Expo.  Since 2018, the Employment Expo has been a massive 
<br/>success for Fiji Corrections and the men and women inmates who have engaged in this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Sow a Seed Mentorship Programme.  This is for young 
<br/>offenders at Nasinu Correctional Centre.  The Programme is open to volunteers to offer a fatherly 
<br/>and motherly ear to many of these young offenders who come from broken families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Programme is a restorative one where the end state is a multi-pronged approach towards 
<br/>good behaviour, education, employment, family reunion  and leading  law-abiding  lives upon their 
<br/>discharge from prison. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is also worth commenting on the Solesolevaki</span><span> </span><span>Programme – a rehabilitation 
<br/>initiative specifically for inmates and rural prisoners.  The Programme involves the family, </span><span>Lotu</span><span> and 
<br/>the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> to ensure the success of this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many success stories of this Programme, however, one worth mentioning in this 
<br/>august Parliament this morning is the case of a prisoner who started this programme in 2017.  While 
<br/>serving, his family had split, with the wife remarrying.  To cut a long story short, to highlight the 
<br/></span><span>success of this Programme, the prisoner is now reunited with his wife and children, and he now holds 
<br/></span><span>a  Turaga  ni  Koro  (Village  Headman)  appointment  in  one  of  our  villages  in  Waibuka,  just  above 
<br/>Naitasiri.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary, the Yellow Ribbon Programme or Project is now a national 
<br/>asset of Fiji.  The Fiji Corrections Service has continued to invest, innovate and contextualise the 
<br/>Project to remain fit for purpose and bring benefit to our nation. The FijiFirst Government could see 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the benefits, remained committed and gave ongoing budgetary investment.  The community can see 
<br/>the benefit and came out in force last year with the largest participation ever in the Yellow Ribbon 
<br/>Walk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only has the Yellow Ribbon Project become a national asset, but it now 
<br/>has the potential to become an international value-added project where Fiji can export the project 
<br/>values and infrastructure for the benefit of our Pacific neighbours and their correctional services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Report before this Parliament commends the Fiji Corrections Service for 
<br/>maintaining service delivery, and I add my affirmation to that commendation.  Maintaining service 
<br/>delivery is a rehabilitation-driven approach that requires the development of a strong organisational 
<br/>culture and increasing skillsets from the officers and service providers.  To the credit of the leadership 
<br/>of the Fiji Corrections Service, this was achieved and continues to be achieved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights staff turnover, and it is worth noting the demanding 
<br/>nature of the Corrections environment. Bringing a paradigm shift and embedding that paradigm shift 
<br/>as the new norm requires a clear vision and commitment to capacity building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned, Sir, the demands on Fiji Corrections Officers are significant, as we have heard 
<br/>from the honourable Attorney-General and requires a lot of support at this point.  I thank you, Sir, 
<br/>for the commitment that you have made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a published document here, outlining the remarkable Fiji Corrections 
<br/>COVID-19 story with me. This booklet, outlining how the Fiji Corrections leadership developed a 
<br/>strategic plan that assessed the risk and implemented a response, is a story of national significance.  
<br/>Our Fiji Corrections Officers demonstrated their invaluable contribution to the nation by remaining 
<br/>at the frontline of the response.  Not only did they put themselves at risk, but they saved and protected 
<br/>lives of those under their care.  This is a story that we can be proud of and deserves our attention and 
<br/>applause. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  closing,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Justice, for his visits in recent months to the various Correctional Institutions and his encouragement 
<br/>to the officers and their families.  The best way of the honourable Minister to put real substance to 
<br/>his  words  of  encouragement  is  to  put  his  personal  support  behind,  fully  implementing  the  Job 
<br/>Evaluation Exercise for the Fiji Corrections staff that was approved by the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  those  fine  Fiji  Corrections  Officers  whom  the  honourable  Minister  has  thanked  and 
<br/>encouraged  are  now  waiting  to  see  if  the  Coalition  Government  will  complete  this  exercise  by 
<br/>providing the appropriate funding in the 2023-2024 National Budget. Will Fiji Corrections personnel 
<br/>be renumerated, and their service conditions uplifted in accordance with what we ask of them and 
<br/>for the professionalism and dedication their delivery?  That is the key question that I pose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite the Coalition Government to continue to commit and support the 
<br/>Fiji  Corrections  Service  and  the  Yellow  Ribbon  Programme  or  Project.   Much  good  comes  from 
<br/>investing in those who have gone off-track and need our justice system’s focus and our Corrections 
<br/></span><span>system’s guidance.  As Nelson Mandela has so profoundly stated, “This is nation-building at its best”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my colleagues on the opposite side of this august Parliament, the platform has been built 
<br/>and established, and you will find it strong.  Commit to it, invest in it, prioritise it and it will serve 
<br/>all of us well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in concluding, I affirm the review of the Fiji Corrections Service Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>484 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report 2017-2018 as  tabled and commending  it in  Parliament for endorsement in  this parliament 
<br/>Sitting.  </span><span>Vinaka saka</span><span> (Thank you, Sir). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I add my words of congratulations to the Chairman 
<br/>and the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and also the previous Chairman and 
<br/>Committee that conducted this review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Motion, presenting its review to Parliament, gives us an opportunity to 
<br/>discuss and debate the Report, as well as what we have experienced and seen of the services, activities 
<br/>and actions of the Fiji Corrections Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was honoured to have been invited to the Fiji Corrections Service passing out parade last 
<br/>Friday.    I  was  fortunate  to  have  been  given  time  not  to  inspect  but  to  visit  other  aspects  of  the 
<br/>operations  in  Naboro.    I  was  very,  very  encouraged,  but  I  joked  with  those  who  sat  with  me, 
<br/>particularly those who paraded before me when I visited the farms, and told them, “Do not feel too 
<br/>bad about wearing that uniform.  You are wearing that uniform for crimes you have committed.  You 
<br/>are not wearing that uniform for perhaps, crimes not detected.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate the words of the honourable Naivalurua, a former Commissioner of Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Services, on recidivism. The Acting Commissioner proudly went through those figures when I was 
<br/>visiting with her the establishment.  That is a very good indication of the work the Correction’s efforts 
<br/>of those that serve in our Corrections Service and the institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Naivalurua  mentioned  that  it  was  an  indication  of  the  success  of  the  former 
<br/>Commissioner of Corrections Service.  That could be true an indication of the fear of those who came 
<br/>out of ever going back into that establishment.  I hope it was the effectiveness of the Corrections 
<br/>Service rather than the fear of re-offending and going back into our prisons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendations that came from the Committee, I would like to assure Parliament that 
<br/>we will continue with the corrective actions that were started when the Report was tabled initially 
<br/>and  carried  out  by  the  former  Government.    We  will  continue  to  improve  the  conditions  of  the 
<br/>Service.  There was mention of the pay and emoluments of staff  in various grades of the Service 
<br/>which we intend to look into and perhaps, with the Budget coming up, we might be able to do some 
<br/>more work and build it into their conditions of Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed one thing with the serving officers (men and women), I saw that 
<br/>their morale was very good and that is  a big help to those who are undergoing corrections in the 
<br/>establishment.  I congratulate the Acting Commissioner and all her senior officers, men and women, 
<br/>in the Service.  The world has had many former inmates who rise to be Heads of State, some Heads 
<br/>of Governments and we also have some who narrowly missed being sent in to be under the services 
<br/>of our Corrections Service personnel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having been through the courts a few times, I do not envy you, but I count myself very lucky 
<br/>to have avoided being a member of the brigade in the orange uniform.  I also would like to commend 
<br/>the whole justice system and perhaps, explain why the honourable Naivalurua brought up the issue 
<br/></span><span>of the state of the facilities – he mentioned 35 years.  I am glad that I was in-charge of Government 
<br/></span><span>very early before those buildings needed repair, so do not blame me, it was those other people.  We 
<br/>will continue to improve the conditions of the Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I went there on Friday, I looked for an officer who came to me after my pensions and 
<br/>entitlements were taken away.  He came to me because his father was a member of the Wesley Church 
<br/>in Levuka and asked me if he could join. I said, “Boy, if you take my name there as recommending 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>485 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you, you will be kicked out, you will not even be interviewed.  I am in the bad books of those who 
<br/>are in-charge of recruitment into the Service.  But what you can do is, stay here at home and I will 
<br/>set you your required fitness level test exercises.”  I took him to the seawall and took him for the 
<br/>normal army route for the RFL.  I took him through the sit-ups and chinning bar and all those things, 
<br/>and I was very happy that he did that very well.  And before he was interviewed, he was fit and is 
<br/>now employed in the ranks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of preparatory work, even before they go into the Service and 
<br/>as they serve, they serve the community.  And while we laud the Yellow Ribbon Programme, there 
<br/>were also other very respectable programmes that were applied by past Governments, even before 
<br/>my time where those undergoing their term in prison were given the opportunity to interact with the 
<br/>public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  there  on  Friday,  I  met  an  inmate  who  spends  the  weekend  at  home.    He  is  a  plant 
<br/>operator and is responsible for preparing the field on which a few hundred thousands of </span><span>dalo</span><span>(taro) 
<br/>are being planted.  So, he is allowed to go home and comes back on Sunday evenings and continues 
<br/>the work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also told that they earn money while they are doing productive work while they are there.  
<br/>When they are released, they take with them some money to continue what they do while they are 
<br/>still serving their term.  So, this man will go home and when he gets home, there will be almost a 
<br/>hundred thousand </span><span>dalo</span><span> plants already ready for harvest when he goes home.  That is a very good 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I congratulate the former Commissioner and the Acting Commissioner for that programme 
<br/>which they have incorporated into the corrective work carried out for those who are unfortunate to 
<br/>have been caught and be imprisoned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my short contribution to the debate 
<br/>that is before Parliament and, that is, the Review of the Fiji Corrections Service  2017-2018 Annual 
<br/>Report.    I  think  the  speakers  who  have  spoken  before  me,  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and honourable Naivalurua, have clearly outlined the paradigm shift of 
<br/>the organisation.  I will not venture more into the details of the rehabilitation framework, but will 
<br/>focus more on the second prison, that is, society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  Yellow  Ribbon  Programme,  it  is  on  two  fronts  -  one  is  the  rehabilitation 
<br/>programme  that  happens  in  prison  facilities  and,  secondly,  the  integration  of  those  who  have 
<br/>completed rehabilitation into our society.  The main part that we play as the second prison to unlock 
<br/>through that Yellow Ribbon Programme is giving a second chance that will accept them back into 
<br/>the community.  That is the challenging part because if that is not managed well, then recidivism rate 
<br/>will go up.  If they are not re-integrated well into the society, they will re-offend and go back into the 
<br/>system and that process continues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  needs  to  be  proper  programmes.  I  think  there  are  already  programmes  in  the  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service that the Acting Commissioner and the previous Commissioner are aware.  They 
<br/></span><span>had job placements, plus those who are released are assisted with finance.  The honourable Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister just said, do their farming and other activities, and other skills that they have learnt while in 
<br/>prison.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  that  year  in  2017-2018,  I  was  an  inmate  in  prison  and  that  was  the  year  when  they 
<br/>introduced in the Nasinu Corrections Service, inmates learning music and now they have a band.  
<br/>They are part of a mixture of Corrections Officers and inmates that make-up the Fiji  Corrections 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>486 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Band.  From then, when it started, most of them did not know music, it was a difficult task for the 
<br/>instructor to teach them and after that drills on how to drill at the drill square.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are talented people.  It is the duty of the Corrections Service.  The programmes and 
<br/>skills they have is to unlock those gifts and talents so that they are used positively rather than breaking 
<br/>the law.  That is the role that we need to play as a society and we, as national leaders, to participate 
<br/>more on Yellow Ribbon Programmes, whether it be marches or any other thing that is conducted by 
<br/>the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  that  we  see  and  also  advocate  on  how  society  impacts  that.    We,  as 
<br/>national leaders, should in the programme and that will also assist the Fiji Police Force when they 
<br/>see that our crime rate reduces because of the change and perception in our society, given that we 
<br/>also play a very important part in the integration process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  challenging  issues  that  was  raised  to  the  Committee  while  we  were  doing  our 
<br/>review was the untold incidents and contraband.  I think this continues to be an issue because when 
<br/>rehabilitation programmes are implemented within prison facilities, there are only a few who still 
<br/>want to go back to their previous trend of life.  However, there are enough measures in place, plus 
<br/>other technologies - camera, CCTVs, metal detectors, for those who bring in contraband like mobile 
<br/>phones, </span><span>suki</span><span>, cigarettes and even most of the drugs that are on the streets are also in prison.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in prison, we can find dollar notes.  I do not know what to buy there but they know how 
<br/>to use it, and these are some of the challenges that Corrections Officers face.  However, to stop this 
<br/>system so that they shift to rehabilitation programmes, that is why they need to tighten up on those 
<br/>contraband.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also told incidences where given the stressful task, Corrections Service officers are also 
<br/>being locked up with inmates and sometimes they go through a lot of pressure.  They do not have 
<br/>enough time to go home, the environment, and I think one of the suggestions that the Committee had 
<br/>suggested to the Commissioner then and the delegation that came from the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>is for officers to go through a distress programme and also trauma programme while they are still 
<br/>serving. Sometimes through pressure at work, it does result in some kind of incident beyond them 
<br/>because they are dealing with notorious criminals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the things that could also assist them, not only the path that the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has said for them to go for further studies in universities but things that could help 
<br/>them, given the environment that they work in, in order for them to handle the work pressure and 
<br/>other related things that are associated with the work they do and the environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a big shift, if you see the facilities, the activities that are involved,  I talked about the 
<br/>band,  tailoring,    piggery,  farms,  engineering  and  even  baking  and  other  things  that  you  will  see 
<br/>prisoners or inmates learning so that when they come out, they may use that as part of trying to earn 
<br/>a living from what they have learnt whilst serving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that honourable Naivalurua had suggested, and I saw the reaction from the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General in agreement while talking to the honourable Minister of Finance is 
<br/>the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE).  The last time the Fiji Corrections Service delegation appeared 
<br/></span><span>before the Committee, we had raised it and they said that they have made proposals and a policy to 
<br/></span><span>the former Minister, but they are still reviewing the JEE. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  will  provide  that  incentive  and  a  morale  booster  for  the  officers.    This  will  assist  in 
<br/>eliminating the staff turnover rate that is there where some have opted for other work or opted to 
<br/>work overseas for better rates.  And I urge the Government to look into the JEE and increase in pay 
<br/>for these officers who have worked very hard.

<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>487 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other big achievement in the Corrections Service, not like in other Ministries is that, they 
<br/>have a Trade and Marketing Division.  Not only that they do agriculture, poultry or piggery, they 
<br/>also  do  small  business  investment.    That  was  started  during  that  time  and  also  advanced  by 
<br/>honourable Vasu.  It helps them learn entrepreneurial skills and also, they have markets to sell their 
<br/>products and that comes back to the coffers of Government.  That is a successful model that is there 
<br/>that other Ministries can also learn from, on how they have assisted these inmates, the potential they 
<br/>have to earn income again for the State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my contribution to the motion and, again, just to reiterate that we (society) play a very 
<br/>important  role  in  unlocking  that  second  prison.    That  is  very  important  for  the  successful 
<br/>implementation of the Yellow Ribbon Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be very brief but before I start 
<br/>my contribution, I want to warmly congratulate my friend, honourable Seruiratu, on his election as 
<br/>the Leader of the Opposition.  I know him from his days as the Commissioner Northern and I know 
<br/>we tried to do a number of things when he was there.  He was very passionate about Vanua Levu and 
<br/>I hope that he still remains that passionate, and will support whatever we do for Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- His heart is always there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We used to have very robust debates in Parliament but one 
<br/>thing  I  can  say  to  the  people  of  this  country  today  is  that  honourable  Seruiratu  always  showed 
<br/>humility and understanding and we were able to converse outside of Parliament as well.  So, I think, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  going  to  see  a  new  era  of  humble  leadership  both  on  the  side  of  the 
<br/>Government and perhaps, on the Opposition as well.  So, congratulations my friend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of Parliament, let me just give some information, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The 
<br/>Fiji Corrections Service has established 15 Corrections Centres around Fiji, including two female 
<br/>Centres - one in Suva and one in Lautoka, and two male Remand Centres - one in Suva and one in 
<br/>Lautoka.  The Northern Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is without a male Remand Centre and a Women’s 
<br/>Corrections Centre.  However, with the budget support from the Government, we think that those 
<br/>projects would commence in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Fiji Corrections Service between 2016-
<br/>2017 and 2022-2023, a total of $267 million was allocated as the budget.  I know there are a number 
<br/>of  ongoing  projects  and  programmes  that  support  the  Fiji  Corrections  Office,  and  these  include, 
<br/>ongoing  maintenance  work  to  staff  quarters,  upgrade  of  institutional  buildings  and  infrastructure, 
<br/>CCTV camera upgrade, purchase of inmates ration and stores, upgrade of public cemeteries, purchase 
<br/>of  office  equipment,  creek  boulders,  body  scanners,  replacement  of  chubb  locks  and  razor  wire, 
<br/>rehabilitation programme and the Yellow Ribbon Poverty Alleviation Project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was very pleased with the contribution from honourable Naivalurua.   I 
<br/>think he provided a very good overview of the activities, service and the plans of the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service and after him, the honourable Prime Minister in his very well-articulated elucidation of the 
<br/>experiences that he has had.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was always kind of fascinated and perhaps, supported the 
<br/>rehabilitation of prisoners and particularly, the Yellow Ribbon Programme because many years ago 
<br/>when I was at the University of the South Pacific and I was the Head of the Fiji Centre which was 
<br/>responsible for delivering distance education and extension courses, we had a programme which was 
<br/>initially funded by the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation and we used to go to prisons 
<br/>and enroll students to do courses.

<div><span>Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was so pleased, Mr. Speaker, that over the years, some of them came out, completed their 
<br/>degrees.  One of them actually started in prison, ended up doing a PhD and ended being a lecturer at 
<br/>USP.  So, Mr. Speaker, I fully support the Yellow Ribbon Programme and I think the Programme 
<br/>should really be extended to schools and youth groups as part of the awareness programme because 
<br/>I think our youth which make up a large percentage of the prison population need to understand that 
<br/>life behind bars can be a big waste of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of job evaluation, Mr. Speaker, I know that it is under review, and I agree with 
<br/>honourable Naivalurua that there is a need to look at that.  There is quite a bit of disparity in the 
<br/>salary bands and allowances, but I am actually surprised that the previous Government with their 
<br/>claims  of  unprecedented  growth  for  the  last  10  years  or  15  years  did  not  do  anything.    So,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that is one of the things that we have to do.  That is a fact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- All you need to do is just pass the budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is a fact, you cannot dispute that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, Mr. Speaker, the increase in the number of staff did take place from 2016 to 2022 
<br/>and there is a ratio disparity.  I am told that it is one is to ten (1:10) right now, whereas the UN and 
<br/>international standard is one is to five (1:5), so that is another area that we perhaps, have to look at 
<br/>when we are looking at the budget for next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was just talking to the honourable Attorney-General that perhaps, there has to be a review 
<br/>of the Corrections Service Act 2006 because I am told that it only talks about the inmates.  It does 
<br/>not talk about the officers and those who are involved in the work of the prison itself, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the previous Committee and the current one and I 
<br/>hope that we, as a Government, would be able to address some of these issues and fundamentally, 
<br/>look at more extensively the causes of how and why people actually end up in prison.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For us as a country, there is a huge cost of crime.  The economic cost of crime can be quite 
<br/>debilitating  in  terms  of  our  overall  economic  performance,  not  only  in  terms  of  taking  away  our 
<br/>labour but also maintaining and running prison systems and our justice system.  So, at some point, 
<br/>part  of  our  rehabilitation  would  be  to  look  at  what  we  can  do  and  extend  those  knowledge  and 
<br/>awareness of what can happen in prison and outside of prison so that we can reduce the overall prison 
<br/>population in the long-term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now invite the honourable Chairman for his Right of Reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I commend and thank 
<br/>the  honourable  Members  for  their  contributions  towards  the  motion  before  Parliament  and,  once 
<br/>again, thank the Committee from the previous Government and the Committee that is in charge today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  reiterate  some  of  the  points  that  have  been  raised  by 
<br/>honourable Members especially on the SDG, on gender balance, and I think that the Fiji Corrections 
<br/></span><span>Service is looking into more women being recruited to help out in the Corrections Service duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, with regards to the contributions made by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  the  continuation  of  programmes  such  as  the 
<br/>Yellow Ribbon, it will be considered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Contributions made by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance that

<div><span> Review Report – FCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>489 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through the coming Budget, we are looking to funding some of the Remand Centres and some of the 
<br/>projects and programmes that are pending, we are thankful to the contribution from the honourable 
<br/>Minister that they will be looking into those, and we can see it rolling in the coming months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  take  note  of  the  contributions  from  honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua and honourable Bulitavu on some of the key works that Fiji Corrections Service does, 
<br/>and the master plan as outlined by honourable Naivalurua.  The main idea of the master plan is to 
<br/>change the lives of inmates and how it affects them when they come back into society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Members, once again, for their contributions to the motion 
<br/>on the floor and I also thank the previous Committee and the current Standing Committee on Justice, 
<br/>Law and Human Rights. 
<br/></span></div>
