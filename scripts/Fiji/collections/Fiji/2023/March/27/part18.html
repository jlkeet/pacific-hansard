<div><span> Review Report – FPTCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Public  Trustee  Corporation  Limited  provides  services  in  the  management  and 
<br/>administration of estates and trusts to those beneficiaries who have appointed the trustees.  It offers 
<br/>services  of  a  specialised  nature  which  involved  the  identification  and  collection  of  assets,  the 
<br/>identification of beneficiaries and the management and subsequent transmission of both, movable 
<br/>and immovable properties, either as an estate or a trust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Review  Report  was  compiled  by  the  Members  of  the  Standing Committee  on  Social 
<br/>Affairs in the last term of Parliament, and I wish to convey my utmost appreciation on their efforts 
<br/>in scrutinising and compiling the Report which was tabled to Parliament in August last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish the Members of the current Committee the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very best in their deliberations of the Committee Reports in this new term of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee upon been referred with the Fiji Public Trustee Corporation Limited Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports requested for public hearing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also received written responses from the Corporation where the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was enlightened on the following, that the Corporation: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Prioritised strategies on maintaining stakeholders’ engagement and ensuring that customers 
<br/>are satisfied with the level and various types of services provided to achieve its corporate 
<br/>goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Employs various methods to assess satisfaction levels, such as collecting feedback during 
<br/>community  awareness  sessions  and  outreach  programme  and  establishing  an  MOU 
<br/>Business Partnership Agreement and other mutual working arrangements with the other 
<br/>relevant stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Plans to extend its services to those living in rural and maritime areas, villages and the peri-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urban centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  periods  under  review,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Corporation  noted  significant 
<br/></span><span>achievements on its business performance.  Revenue had increased by 37 percent and in 2019, the 
<br/>Corporation marked milestone achievements in the appointment of the Sub-Committees for Audit, 
<br/>Governance and Risk, Legal, and Human Resources. This has resulted in heightened attention to the 
<br/>audit and oversight functions, which was translated in the engagement of an externally appointed 
<br/>internal audit for the business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has highlighted its findings for the Corporation’s financial 
<br/>and operational performance for 2018-2019 and subsequently made recommendations to improve the 
<br/>Corporation’s service delivery which, I believe, has been implemented by now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also commenced the team of dedicated and motivated individuals who have 
<br/>worked  together  to  bring  the  Public  Trustee  Corporation  Limited  to  new  heights  through  the 
<br/>enhancement  of  service  delivery  which  remains  a  significance  strategy  in  achieving  their  vision, 
<br/>which is to remain competitive and financially viable in the long term.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>            Review Report – FPTCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>433 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. As 
<br/>usual, I have three Members on the list that has been provided by the honourable Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Minister of Finance and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I rise to contribute to the debate on this Report from the Standing 
<br/>Committee  on  Social  Affairs.  I  also  would  like  to  thank  and  congratulate  the  Chairperson  of  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on her appointment and for performing the duties of Chairperson, including the 
<br/>tabling of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the previous Standing Committee for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work in preparing what is now being brought to us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  Minister  for  Public  Enterprises,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Public  Trustee  Corporation 
<br/></span><span>Limited (FPTCL) falls within my responsibility under the Public Enterprises Act - an Act that was 
<br/></span><span>legislated in  my  previous term  and part of the Public Sector Reform  started by the then SVT-led 
<br/>Coalition Government  from  1992 and 1999, just conforming with  what  the rest  of the world  was 
<br/>doing,  going  towards  the  restructuring  of  Government,  going  through  corporatisation  and  even 
<br/>further into privatisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Office of the Public Trustees which was established during 
<br/>the colonial times was corporatised as part of that corporatisation programme in April 2006 by the 
<br/>former SDL Government, led by the late Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Its services to the people have continued and being extended by the former Government as 
<br/>every government does, that we continuously try to improve the services established before our time, 
<br/>improved by those before us and we owe it to the people to continue improving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  Peoples  Coalition  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  continue  in  that  way,  to 
<br/>continue to improve the various developments that we have inherited from the previous Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will address the recommendations by the Standing Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span>The Corporation should pursue existing forums such as the Bose ni Yasana, Bose ni Tikina, 
<br/>Advisory Councils, Youth and Religious Conventions, organised farmer groups, et cetera, to 
<br/>raise awareness on its various products and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to that, I would like to say that the Committee recommendations are noted. They 
<br/>were noted by the previous Government, and the previous Government started taking remedial and 
<br/>corrective measures in the areas that were recommended. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Corporation, over the past years, have been engaged in community awareness through 
<br/>various Government Expo right around the country and joined Government awareness team to the 
<br/>maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Corporation will continue to collaborate with respective Government Ministries, Civil 
<br/>Societies,  Groups  and  Councils,  including  those  identified  by  the  Committee  in  its  community 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Review Report – FPTCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>434 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>awareness.    That  is  part  of  the  FPTCL’s  operation  and  business  plan  and  will  be  monitored 
<br/>accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am encouraging the Board of FPTCL to work to ensure that its services are decentralised.  
<br/>In that  regard, the Corporation will co-operate  and work in  partnership  with  Provincial Councils, 
<br/>District Advisory Council, as well as the newly re-established Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs in 
<br/>encouraging our people to access its services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2</span><span>
<br/>That  the  Corporation  consider  making  its  services  more  accessible  to  persons  living  with 
<br/>disabilities, in partnership with the relevant Disability Organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to that, the work has already started, we will continue.  The Corporation has fully 
<br/>complied with the recommendations through their Suva and Labasa Offices and FPTCL has modified 
<br/>their office spaces to also cater for those with disabilities and they are remodifying the Lautoka office 
<br/>to allow accessibility for people with disabilities.  The FPTCL continued working towards ensuring 
<br/>that their services are more accessible to all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 3</span><span>
<br/></span><span>That the Corporation continues to upgrade and enhance its ICT capabilities for its business 
<br/>enhancement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee’s recommendation is noted and the 
<br/>previous Government during their term, the Corporation began its IT Modernisation Plan in 2019 
<br/>with the digitisation programme which includes digitisation of records and processes, online services 
<br/>and customer relationship management system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is worth noting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that investment formed a major part of the Corporation’s 
<br/>capital expenditure budget with a goal of increasing accessibility of the company’s services or the 
<br/>Corporation’s services and efficiency of its business processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendations 4 
<br/></span><span>That the Corporation explore new business opportunities to increase its income streams in 
<br/>order to remain competitive and financially viable in the long-term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  same  response.  The  Corporation  has  taken  note  of  the  Report  and  the  Committee’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendation and this Government will oversee the continuation of those improvements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all I have for this afternoon in support of this motion that is before 
<br/>us.   I reiterate that every Government owes it to the previous one to continue the improvement and 
<br/>make life better for all the people in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  contribute  to  the  Report  for  debate  on  the 
<br/>Review  of  the  Fiji  Public  Trustee  Corporation  Limited  (FPTCL),  at  the  outset,  I  would  like  to 
<br/>acknowledge the work done by the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in the last 
<br/>term  of  Parliament  -  the  current  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  (honourable  Dr.  Ratu 
<br/>Atonio  Lalabalavu),  honourable  Alipate  Nagata  and  former  Members  of  Parliament  (honourable 
<br/>Salote Radrodro and honourable George Vegnathan) and the Committee I chaired in the effort of 
<br/>putting this Report together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Corporation is a public enterprise, therefore, operate without any cost 
<br/>to Government and it is governed by the Fiji Public Trustee Corporation Act 2006.  Some of the key 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Review Report – FPTCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>435 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlights of the Corporation as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2019 were total value of estates stood at $67.1 
<br/>million.  In 2019, 58 new estates were accepted and valued at $7.8 million, 4,293 wills were registered 
<br/>of which 290 were drafted and 55 executed in 2019.  A total value of trusts stood at $13 million.  In 
<br/>2019, 66 new trusts were accepted and valued at $66,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Corporation had a net value of $17 million, 6,861 trusts were administered.  There were 
<br/>a total of 1,895 deceased estates with over 11,000 beneficiaries.  The Corporation had a total of 30 
<br/>permanent staff of which 65 percent were females and 35 percent were males.  Partnerships were 
<br/>signed with Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL) and Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) and eight 
<br/>charities were assisted with a value of $130,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  Pacific  Regional  Champion  for  Commonwealth  Parliamentarians 
<br/>with Disabilities and former Chairperson of Standing Committee on Social Affairs, we queried the 
<br/>Corporation on how they ensured the inclusion of people living with disabilities through its service 
<br/>provision and programmes.  We noted that it is a work in progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  that  being  said,  I  urge  all  Members  of  Parliament  to  be  champions  in  promoting 
<br/>disability inclusiveness in infrastructures, schools, workplaces, policy making et cetera on the pledge 
<br/></span><span>for living no one behind.  This also can be actioned through the Standing Committee processes via 
<br/></span><span>annual report scrutiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish the management, the Board Members and the staff of 
<br/>Fiji Public Trustee Corporation Limited (FPTCL) well to continue delivering the best service and 
<br/>positive financial results.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  I would speak on the 
<br/>Recommendation 4 which says that the Corporation explore new business opportunities to increase 
<br/>the income streams in order to remain competitive and financially viable in the long term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note the number of new initiatives by FPTCL such as the family trust, 
<br/>the charity trust and the pre-paid funeral trust.  These initiatives do bring a number of benefits.  Just 
<br/>quickly for the information of our people, the family trust legally protects partial or full assets of a 
<br/>family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Families can register various types of assets into their family trust including their home.  The 
<br/>charitable trusts protects partial or full assets specifically for charitable purposes and allows the trust 
<br/></span><span>to  support  causes  and  charities  on  an  ongoing  basis.    Unlike  other  trusts,  the  charitable  trust  is 
<br/></span><span>perpetual and has no vesting day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pre-paid  funeral  trust  allows a person to  set money aside to pay for funeral  expenses 
<br/>when  a  person  passes  away.    We  do  encourage  the  company  to  work  closely  with  similar 
<br/>organisations in other jurisdictions and adopt initiatives that might suit Fiji.  We must also encourage 
<br/>the  company  to  explore  the  possibility  of  diversifying  into  other  services  where  it  is  legally  and 
<br/>financially practical. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for her Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the honourable Members who 
<br/>have contributed to the debate this afternoon and we have certainly taken into consideration all the 
<br/>points that have been raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>436 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  had  stated  earlier  that  the  four  recommendations  of  the  Corporation  have  now  been 
<br/>implemented and we have also taken into consideration some of the important issues raised by the 
<br/>honourable Members when we will deliberate on the 2020 Annual Report of the Fiji Public Trustee 
<br/>Corporation Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
