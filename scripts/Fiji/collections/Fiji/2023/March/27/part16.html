<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND  
<br/>DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  review  of  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Department of Immigration 2018-2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 
<br/>2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Ministers and honourable Members of this august Parliament, I am thankful to be given 
<br/>this opportunity, as the Member moving the motion, to make a small contribution on the Report of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights on the review of the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister and Department of Immigration 2018-2019 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, at the commencement of the new term of Parliament, there was a changeover of 
<br/>the  Standing  Committee  membership  and  the  newly  appointed  Standing  Committee  Members 
<br/>resolved to peruse through the highlights given that the Review Report was formulated and tabled by 
<br/>the Committee of the previous Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in this respect, the Committee had noted some recurring issues highlighted in 
<br/>the  Report  which  we  felt  were  necessary  to  have  further  discussions  on  and  allow  honourable 
<br/>Members to provide a way forward in addressing some of these issues that were within the purview 
<br/>of the OPM.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Committee had identified five key crucial findings: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  OPM  has put in  efforts in  achieving the  nation’s development  plan  and the global 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agenda by supporting gender equality and the development of communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>That the three-decade old Vatukoula Gold Mine dispute is still yet to be resolved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Rotuma has been allotted the largest funding of $240,000 as compared to Rabi, Kioa with 
<br/>a ceiling of $155,000.  During the reporting year, the Rotuma Subvention Fund was not 
<br/>utilised due to non-submission of the audited accounts by the Council of Rotuma.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Difficulties  faced  during  the  transition  to  e-passport  system  from  the  machine-readable 
<br/>Passports  Management  System.    The  sudden  power  fluctuations  and  shutdowns  affect 
<br/>network  system  and  delivery  of  service  within  the  specified  timeline.    Some  of  the 
<br/>challenges include power fluctuations and failures in Fiji, causing network disruption
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report   27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which, in turn, affects the service delivery hours at times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>There  were  weak  internal  controls  that  relate  to  financials  for  the  Fiji  Immigration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Department which have been addressed through measures being put in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee notes the existence of these issues that I have just mentioned 
<br/>and  also  take  note  of  the  recommendations  put  forth  by  the  previous  Committee.    For  the 
<br/>consideration  of  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  the  former  Committee  had  formulated  two 
<br/>recommendations which are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span>In regard to the Vatukoula Gold Mine issue, it was noted that this has been long standing 
<br/>issue, and the efforts put in by all the parties involved is duly recognised, but for the purpose 
<br/>of resolving this issue, it is recommended that discussions be reinitiated as soon as possible 
<br/>whereby a settlement is reached that is agreed upon by all parties involved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span><span>In regard to the non-utilisation of funds from the Rotuma Subvention Fund, the Committee 
<br/></span><span>supports the stance by the Office of the Prime Minister and recommends that adherence to 
<br/>necessary  processes  in  place  for  submission  of  financial  reports  for  audit  should  be 
<br/>maintained, and monitoring of this should be upheld so as not to affect the release of funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  few  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  I,  once  again,  commend  the  work  carried  out  by  the 
<br/>previous Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and I would also want to thank the 
<br/>Members  of  the  current  Committee:  honourable  Iliesa  Vanawalu,  honourable  Mosese  Bulitavu, 
<br/>honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua and honourable Faiyaz Koya.  I urge the honourable Members of 
<br/>this august Parliament to take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report and to show support 
<br/>for the motion that is before this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor, all I would like to state now is that I have also received another list of speakers 
<br/>from the honourable Whips and the speakers would be in this order: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable I.B. Seruiratu. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration.  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj. 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, being aware of the list of speakers, I will try to 
<br/>keep it brief.  But let me acknowledge the work undertaken by the previous Committee and, of course, 
<br/>the current Committee, thank you for this Report.  Of course, it has given Parliament some directions 
<br/>on what needs to be addressed and to acknowledge the work as well that has already been undertaken.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will start with the recommendations and then I will highlight some key 
<br/>aspects of the Report that I strongly feel is worth repeating, given the significance of these issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>415 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  recommendations,  I  totally  agree  with  the  honourable  Chairman,  particularly  on 
<br/>Recommendation 1, on the issue in Vatukoula.  It is sad, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am sure you are also 
<br/>aware.  One of the challenges is just the common understanding between the stakeholders and for 
<br/>them to come into agreement as well on options and solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I know that at one stage with the Assistant Minister for Rural Development, Mr. 
<br/>Joeli Cawaki, he was assisting in facilitating, particularly in terms of housing, for those who have 
<br/>opted  to  return  to  their  respective  communities.    But  I  hope  that  during  this  term  of  Parliament, 
<br/>something can be done so that this can be resolved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Subvention Fund, I remember that towards the end of last 
<br/>year, this allocation has been redirected and restored to the community in Rotuma after they have 
<br/>met all the requirements.  This is all about good governance and the better utilisation of these funds, 
<br/>and I think the same also applied for the Kiribati community, but I need to acknowledge the ongoing 
<br/>efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were some challenges highlighted in the Report.  With new technologies, particularly 
<br/>with  the  new  e-passport,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  always  expected  –  teething  issues  with  new 
<br/></span><span>technology.  Of course, I think by now, that has been fixed.  Of course, some management issues in 
<br/></span><span>terms of their finances as acknowledged in the Report, that has been fixed as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did say that there are a few things highlighted in the Report that I would 
<br/>probably like to highlight because of its significance, and one is on SDGs.  You very well know, Sir, 
<br/>the role that Parliament plays now in terms of oversight on global issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  2015  was  a  very  interesting  year.    We  had  the  SDGs;  we  had  the  Paris 
<br/>Agreement and we had the Sendai Framework as well. And one of the oversight responsibilities of 
<br/>all Parliaments throughout the world is on the implementation of most of these issues and, of course, 
<br/>to track the progresses made as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think I would recommend to all the Committees when it comes to SDGs in all reports, let 
<br/>us open it to other SDG goals rather than restricting it to one.  I will highlight, this is not to point out 
<br/>the weakness of the Committee, but it seems that this Report focuses on SDG5 - Gender Equality.  
<br/>Of course, the Office of the Prime Minister,  I think,  is  one of the  Offices in  Fiji  that has a good 
<br/>balance of gender and I think it is a challenge for the others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  given  the  role  that  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  is  responsible  for  -  SDG1  is  on 
<br/></span><span>Poverty, SDG2 is on Zero Hunger, SDG5 is on Gender Equality and, of course, we have SDG on 
<br/>Education and Health. SDGs 13, 14 and15 are also very, very critical not only for the work of the 
<br/>Committee but for Fiji, given its leading role in some of the issues that are also highlighted in this 
<br/>Report that I will touch on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, SGD13 is on Climate Action.  SDG14 is on Life Below Water and SDG15 is on Life on 
<br/>Land.   I am sure most of the honourable Members of this august Parliament are aware of these issues 
<br/>and I hope in our Parliament work, particularly when it comes to reporting, let us not limit it, let us 
<br/>identify the crosscutting issues because it is good for our Parliament as well, Sir,  
<br/>given our role as legislators and given the significance of these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have highlighted SDG13 on Climate Action. Perhaps, this is why I am highlighting this, as 
<br/>this  is  the  challenge  that  we  all  have  now  -  starting  from  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  all 
<br/>Parliamentarians because of the significance of this issue, particularly to Pacific Islanders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>416 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Pacific  Leaders  Forum,  we  now  have  the  2050  Blue  Strategy  for  the  Pacific.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, why I am highlighting this as well, particularly for us when we go now, our voices need 
<br/>to be heard in these forums and there needs to be consistency. There is consistency, Sir, particularly 
<br/>in the work of climate action in the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It started on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2015 to 4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2015 which was the </span><span>Suva Declaration</span><span>. 
<br/>The wordings of the </span><span>Suva Declaration</span><span> ended up in the </span><span>Paris Agreement</span><span>, particularly on the work on 
<br/>1.5 Degrees target.  It was a compromise, but we ensured that 1.5 Degrees target ended up in the 
<br/>Paris Agreement because it is so important for our survival.  Of course, the Paris Agreement and all 
<br/>the meetings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noticed that  the honourable Prime Minister has recently returned  from  the Panama  - the 
<br/>nexus between oceans and climate.  This is why all these SDGs are relevant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I 
<br/>wish to highlight it for all Committees because that is the way forward and that is something that we 
<br/>all need to address together as Parliamentarians, not only for the globe but, of course, for our citizens 
<br/>and our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy  Prime Minister had wanted some information about New Zealand 
<br/></span><span>and he was not sure about it. Just talk to the honourable Minister for Sugar and Multi-Ethnic Affairs, 
<br/></span><span>who has just returned from New Zealand and he will have some information on that, and honourable 
<br/>Kamikamica and honourable Radrodro as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these  are very important  issues  because there is  high  expectation  on the 
<br/>region, on Fiji, and there is high expectation as well at the global level, given the prominence that we 
<br/>have set in this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that our Presidency on COP23 is highlighted in here and that is something that we 
<br/>need.  We are not blowing our trumpet, but I think it is an achievement not only for us but for the 
<br/>region, for a small vulnerable island State, to become Chair of COP23.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the work of the former Prime Minister, 
<br/>particularly in his leadership in those areas, and I hope that all honourable Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament will continue with that good work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Seruiratu  for  his 
<br/>contribution.  In fact, he has almost stolen my thunder because I was just thinking that we would be 
<br/></span><span>wasting all the data that he has collected as our Champion for climate change if we just leave him 
<br/></span><span>out altogether. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I go back to the thought that I had while I was on the other side of bipartisan approach 
<br/>to universal issues like climate change.  I note that the former Vice-President of the United States of 
<br/>America immediately, after coming out of office, was appointed by the successor government to be 
<br/>the champion for climate change.  Today, I rejected a recommendation for me to go to the next one 
<br/>in December and I was thinking of the honourable Seruiratu.  “You go, that gives one more vote than 
<br/>you have.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No, it does not give us one more, but it just gives us a safety net of one vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are here to debate the Report on the review of the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister and Department of Immigration 2018-2019 Annual Report which was tabled in August last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>417 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As has been mentioned by the honourable Seruiratu, we thank the previous Committee - the 
<br/>very proud young man at the back there who chaired the previous Committee and thank him and the 
<br/>Members of his Committee for this Report that is before us today.  I also thank the current Committee 
<br/>for the work that they have done and they have endorsed the Report of the previous Committee so 
<br/>we thank you, honourable Maharaj.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The motion presents to Parliament discussions on the Office of the Prime Minister and the 
<br/>Department  of  Immigration.  As  we  all  know,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  provides  sound 
<br/>coherent policy advice to the Prime Minister and maintains vigilant oversight of all other national 
<br/>policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Prime Minister also provides high quality services and support to the Head 
<br/>of Government and support rendered is aimed at ensuring that all activities, engagements and policies 
<br/>that the Prime Minister contributes to or is involved in is in line with the Constitution, the laws of 
<br/>Fiji and the betterment of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Immigration is mandated to provide efficient and effective immigration 
<br/></span><span>services through the administration and enforcement of immigration related laws and international 
<br/>conventions.    These  services  are  mainstreamed  to  ensuring  the  integrity  of  Fiji’s  borders  and  the 
<br/>effective management of people in and out of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the points raised in the Report and has been raised by the previous speakers is on the 
<br/>Vatukoula Gold Mine.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very sad episode in our industrial relations history 
<br/>in Fiji. I remember that this was one of the arguments. They thought that I was involved in the initial 
<br/>stages of the Vatukoula Strike and I was even challenged by the two paramount Chiefs who were in 
<br/>office at that time because I spoke up in favour of the workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Geoffrey Reed, you will remember, was in charge of the Vatukoula Gold Mines at that 
<br/>time, was very upset and called his friends in high places in Fiji who labelled me as an ‘angry young 
<br/>man’.  I am no longer an angry young man, I am not even an angry old man. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we all agree that all parties should be involved to resolve that 
<br/>issue.  There was a lot of encouragement for those who were fighting against the owners of the Mine 
<br/>coming in from Ba or when my colleague on the opposite side, honourable Bala was the Mayor and 
<br/></span><span>I put him there, but now he is here, we will work together to resolve that issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  Rotuma  Subvention  Fund,  we  would  like  to  maintain  good 
<br/>relationship with the leadership of Rotuma and they have promised to cooperate and make sure that 
<br/>their  accounts  and  all  these  other  things  are  in  place.    In  the  meantime,  they  have  recommended 
<br/>someone to be the liaison between the Council and the Prime Minister’s Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going back to COP23, there is a question coming up later in the afternoon which I will ask 
<br/>to speak very briefly on because I have a Cabinet paper going to Cabinet tomorrow, on the Report of 
<br/>our Oceans Conference that was held in Panama.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with honourable Seruiratu about our success so far from our elevation to the top table 
<br/>in COP23 - that negotiations and discussions and as I will mention briefly this afternoon, I am very 
<br/>proud that in 1992, we participated in the Earth Summit in Rio when we sent our then Minister for 
<br/>Urban Development, Housing and Environment to attend that very first one.  We thought that was 
<br/>the first, but it was 20 years after the earlier one in 1972 in Sweden - talking about all these things 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>418 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that now we have written them down into Sustainable Development Goals, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the passports, Sir, we had some teething problems, but I believe that we have to march 
<br/>with the rest of the world and this is the way the rest of the world is going, so we sharpen up our 
<br/>activities, actions and our performance as we provide e-passports for all our new passport holders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Small Grant Schemes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been successful but only as successful as the 
<br/>strength of our economy, but they have been very well accepted and very well distributed.  There 
<br/>have been a lot of joy to the recipients who have received this over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have little else, apart from the fact that we are working on the Rabi Council 
<br/>at  the  moment  to  get  their  accounts  audited.    And  there  is  now  a  standing  invitation  from  the 
<br/>Parliament  and  the  President  of  Kiribati  for  us  to  send  them  a  representative  of  our  Banaban 
<br/>Community in Rabi and the only problem before was that, they did not have a Rabi Council because 
<br/>there was no election and no audited accounts.  Hopefully, all those can be corrected so that we can 
<br/>send someone to attend the Parliament of Kiribati.  As we all know, they have a nominated member 
<br/>from Rabi sitting in the Parliament of Kiribati. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also support that we note the Report tabled by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the motion that 
<br/>is before Parliament and, that is, to commend to note the review of the Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/>and the Department of Immigration 2018-2019 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister, I think the overarching role of the Ministry 
<br/>is  to  look  into  the  coordination  of  the  various  Ministries  that  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister 
<br/>monitors.    This  comes  in  line  too  with  the  announcement  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  in 
<br/>February this year, that there is a decision-making machinery that will help in this coordination and 
<br/>also  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  various  projects  and  policies  that  is  in  line  with  the 
<br/>Coalition’s framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the Report that is before us is for the financial year 2018 and 2019.  It is aligned to the 
<br/>People’s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress, plus the 5 Year and 20 Year National Development 
<br/>Plan which has the overarching goal of building a better Fiji for all Fijians.  That particular goal was 
<br/>for  this  particular  financial  year  and  that  was  we  have  seen  through  perusing,  scrutiny  and  also 
<br/></span><span>deliberations on the Report with the staff from the Office of the Prime Minister and their Corporate 
<br/></span><span>Division  and  also  staff  from  their  Projects  Division,  who  had  assisted  the  Committee  in  its 
<br/>deliberations on various clarifications and information that the Committee had sought from the Office 
<br/>of the Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to one of the key roles of the Office of the Prime Minister is to address the socio-
<br/>economic development needs of the people. What we have seen from the last Administration, through 
<br/>the former Prime Minister on the various rural visitations that he had in various Divisions was that, 
<br/>most  of  the  time  he  is  engaging  with  people  on  a  touch-base  timely  manner,  sometimes  making 
<br/>decisions  on  the  spot.    That  is  something  that  I  would  like  to  urge  the  Coalition  Government,  to 
<br/>increase their engagement with the people, moving into the community, especially decision-making 
<br/>at divisional level when they are engaged in various </span><span>talanoa sessions </span><span>with the people during their 
<br/>visits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other projects that the honourable Prime Minister had alluded to in terms of the Small 
<br/>Grant Scheme, there was about $3.2 million that was directed for education projects and $1.3 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Suspension of Standing Orders  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>419 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was for villages - construction of village halls and evacuation centres.  For the education projects, 
<br/>the construction of the Maivalili Teachers Quarters in Cakaudrove and for the village projects, the 
<br/>construction of a hall and evacuation centre at Sawaieke, Gau; a nursing station at Nawaikama in 
<br/>Gau,  and  other  community  projects  that  took  place.    In  Tailevu  North,  there  was  a  bedroom  for 
<br/>teachers quarters and also other renovations to the Suva Methodist Primary School in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  are  achievements  through  the  Small  Grant  Scheme  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister which we hope to see will continue under the Coalition Government because it really helps 
<br/>in assisting our communities - getting our Prime Minister to look at the areas of need from the people 
<br/>who would like to engage directly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other things that were highlighted in this particular financial year was the fact that Fiji has 
<br/>increased its global footprint, not only after the end of the COP23 Presidency.  Fiji in this particular 
<br/>year, was also part of the negotiations of COP24  in Poland where our former Prime Minister co-
<br/>chaired that particular COP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that was raised was the number of complaints that was received by the Office 
<br/>of the Prime Minister then.  They have a system in place that addresses those complaints and go back 
<br/></span><span>to the people to see that the various complaints that they have registered in the Office of the Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister are attended to.  I hope that, that will be continued by the current Administration on how 
<br/>our people can be proper served and the service delivery to the various communities that are there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, again, all shows the achievement that has been done in the previous administration 
<br/>that  is  there  plus  other  engagements  with  the  other  counterparts  in  that  particular  year  where  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister then also met the former Prime Minister of Australia – Mr. Scott Morrison 
<br/>and also discussions on to our Vuvale</span><span> </span><span>Partnership that has enabled the partnership between Fiji, New 
<br/>Zealand and Australia plus other labour schemes and other things that we are benefiting through our 
<br/>engagement with Australia and New Zealand, even  though our rugby team franchise </span><span>Fijian Drua</span><span>
<br/>plus other things we are also engaging with New Zealand and Australian communities in terms of 
<br/>labour schemes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are few things that we have highlighted and we hope that we will continue, the common 
<br/>narrative by the Government and plus others in the social media, “what you have been doing for the 
<br/>last 16 years?” But again, these are achievements that we can build on from the legacy, from the last 
<br/>eight  years  of  parliamentary  democracy,  what  the  benchmark  that  FijiFirst  Government  has  set 
<br/>through the premise of very well structured annual reports that come before the Committee and we 
<br/></span><span>hope that the current structure of annual reports that will come to the Committee will follow these 
<br/></span><span>formats because it clearly outlines the various objectives of various ministries plus key performance 
<br/>indicators plus various targets that are aligned to the SDGs that was alluded to by the honourable Inia 
<br/>Seruiratu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are few things and I commend the Report that is before Parliament and also we move 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forward from whatever that has been done by this particular Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I invite the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, 
<br/>for the purposes of applying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon 
<br/>the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
