<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>420 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Standing Order 6 that so much of Standing Order 23(1) be suspended so as to 
<br/>allow  Parliament  to  sit  beyond  4.30  p.m.  today  to  complete  the  remaining  items  listed  on 
<br/>today’s Order Paper.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we can 
<br/>note from the Order Paper before us, we still have one remaining report to debate, apart from the one 
<br/>that  we  are  currently  debating,  as  well  as  Question  time.    There  are  still  remaining  eight  Oral 
<br/>Questions and two Written Questions.  We still have some business to get through, therefore, I seek 
<br/>the indulgence of Parliament to allow for us to sit beyond 4.30 p.m. to be able to get through the 
<br/>business in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion, if 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing more to add, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for afternoon tea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.04 p.m.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>421 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.36 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will proceed with the speeches on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, please, allow me just to make a short contribution 
<br/>to this debate on the Report of the Standing Committee on Justice,  Law and Human Rights on the 
<br/>2018-2019 Annual Report of the Office of the Prime Minister and the Department of Immigration. 
<br/>You will understand, Mr. Speaker, that after the rearrangements under the Coalition Government, the 
<br/>Department of Immigration is now under the Ministry of Home Affairs looking after the Department 
<br/>of Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Report that is before Parliament today has very little comments about the functions of 
<br/>the Department of Immigration. I believe there was an observation with regards to some accounts 
<br/>that were not quite cleared but at the end of the Report, the Committee acknowledged that that has 
<br/>been cleared.  I am also glad to mention here at this stage that the ensuing accounts of the Department 
<br/>of Immigration after that for the last two years have actually been unqualified audit reports, so that 
<br/>is a remarkable achievement by the Department of Immigration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, you will know that the Department  of Immigration is  responsible for border 
<br/></span><span>security, looking after Fijians, our guests and our friends that come into Fiji and also leave Fiji at the 
<br/>end of their stay.  Part of their work is to ensure the security of our entry points, particularly at the 
<br/>border both in our airports and also in our seaports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department is quite challenged at the moment in terms of the support that it has, that is, 
<br/>in given overtime to be able to provide this work for Fiji, which is very, very important.  Of course, 
<br/>the first line of defence for Fiji is our Department of Immigration.  As people come through Nadi or 
<br/>through Suva or our seaports to make sure that they do not come with the usual shenanigans that 
<br/>people bring from across the other side of the sea to bring into Fiji.  So, it is very important that we 
<br/>have a professional department that is well supported in every aspect to be able to keep Fiji secure 
<br/>and safe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  something  that  the  Department  continues  to  try  and  do  to  be  able  to  perform  its 
<br/>functions despite the limitations of the resources that it has got.  I would just like to say that at the 
<br/>moment  our  Suva  Office  is  being  relocated  because  that  building  is  actually  not  fit  for  human 
<br/>habitation.  I believe the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service owns that building. I am glad that that 
<br/>building has been identified by the Ministry of Finance that the Department is going to move into.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One other issue, in particular that the Department deals with in a big way is the issuance of 
<br/>passports.  We will understand that now in the digital era, the new passports that we have which 
<br/>conforms to international standards of travel, that is, in the report mentioned that there were glitches 
<br/>at the beginning, but I am glad that a lot of that has been cured since the time this Report was written 
<br/>and submitted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But suffice to say, Mr. Speaker, that there is a great demand for passports in Fiji today and it 
<br/>is putting on a lot of strain on our immigration officials to be able to produce for the people of Fiji 
<br/>these passports when they need them. Obviously the conditions are quite clear for the issuance of 
<br/>passports, those that want their passport almost immediately and those that have to pay just enough 
<br/>so that they can get it over a working week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One other aspect that relates to passports and I am sure this is something that I see has been 
<br/>listed in one of the agenda items for the days to come where there has been some concerns about 
<br/>Fijian passports that have been issued to a whole range of people who are now living in Fiji, in terms 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>422 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report   27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of whether they are qualified to have this passport issued to them and become Fiji citizens. I think 
<br/>when we travel around we see a whole range of people who now say that they are citizens and have 
<br/>qualified by time.  We are doing some research into that to find out whether how many of those have 
<br/>been issued and whether they have been issued under the current laws that are in place for people to 
<br/>follow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the concerns now, Mr. Speaker, is that the qualification by naturalisation. There are 
<br/>some  concerns  that  are  being  aired  by  our  people  who  are  formally  Fijian  citizens  and  also  their 
<br/>families who want to get a Fijian Passport and that is the cost of having to get a Fijian Passport and 
<br/>now that other nationalities are allowed to acquire Fijian Passports dual citizenry under the current 
<br/>laws that we have.  So, the cost of acquiring citizenship by naturalisation is a concern by them.  I 
<br/>must assure you, Mr. Speaker, Parliament and the people that the Government is looking at this and 
<br/>hopefully in the future we will have a report on the deliberations of Government with regards to this 
<br/>particular request.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the matter of work permit process, this has always been a concern. Our private sector is 
<br/>always concerned that immigration is not always quick enough, no sense of urgency - words that they 
<br/>say in terms of facilitating investments in Fiji through acquiring permits under the proper process. 
<br/></span><span>But you will understand, Mr. Speaker, as a matter of our border and who we allow to come in is a 
<br/></span><span>matter of our national concern and whilst we want to facilitate to get people to come and work in Fiji 
<br/>by way of work of permit, we must also be conscience that we also have issues that could come with 
<br/>these problems. We are looking at talking to the private sector for now, looking at better ways on 
<br/>how we can be more efficient in granting work permits for those that want to come and work here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last issue perhaps I want to raise, Mr. Speaker, is the issue of one of things that we look 
<br/>at  is  the  granting  of  citizenship.  You  will  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  few  years  ago,  the  laws  were 
<br/>changed from five years to 15 years to qualify and become a Fijian.  This has been a cause of many 
<br/>heartaches for more people because they do not seem to be able to understand why such an extension 
<br/>of time, five years was and then that had to be increased twice before they can qualify.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a matter that needs to be looked at fairly, particularly for genuine people who want to 
<br/>become Fijians and be granted citizenry.  They have to be granted the liberty in all fairness.  So this 
<br/>is a policy that Government wants to look at and hopefully come out with some positive outcome 
<br/>that  is  not  only  good  for  those  who  are  applying,  but  also  benefit  the  Fijian  people  through  the 
<br/>services of those who will acquire the citizenship other than through the grants of naturalisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution and I thank the Committee and all my colleagues 
<br/></span><span>who have spoken on this matter, particularly on the Department of Immigration and I support the 
<br/>motion that is before Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I would like to congratulate Miss 
<br/>Fiji, Miss Gitali Ram, for the wonderful show at the Beauty International Pageant and returning home 
<br/>as First Runner-Up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  While  I  stood  up  this  morning  to  deliver  my  speech  on  the 
<br/>Municipal Councils, honourable Minister for Finance labelled my speech as sensible, so I consider 
<br/>myself now to be following the path of honourable Bala rather than actually trying to talk some sense 
<br/>to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>423 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the Office of the Prime Minister, I believe it is a very important one and I, as 
<br/>the previous Chairperson, we did scrutinise this and this is my Report that is being actually debated 
<br/>today in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Prime Minister is primarily responsible for providing sound 
<br/>policy  advice  and  support  to  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  his  Cabinet.    The  Department  of 
<br/>Immigration  is  mandated  in  providing  efficient  and  effective  immigration  services  through  the 
<br/>administration enforcement of immigration related laws and international conventions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, year 2018 and 2019, through the very strong  and decisive leadership of 
<br/>honourable  Bainimarama  at  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office,  the  Office  and  the  Department  of 
<br/>Immigration  engaged  with  international  and  regional  development  partners,  civil  society 
<br/>organisations and the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2018 was a very proud moment for the Fijians and Fiji as a whole as the 
<br/>former Prime Minister was the President of COP23.  It was through the engagement at international 
<br/>level that we saw development partners funding projects in Fiji to build resilience against climate 
<br/>change.  There were so  many projects funded that our former Prime Minister negotiated that saw 
<br/></span><span>many villages around Fiji relocated to higher grounds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This relocation was not just building new houses, but moving the entire livelihood from one 
<br/>location to another; sea walls were built and so many other projects were funded through the effort 
<br/>of our former Prime Minister, a true gentleman who flew the Fiji’s flag high in the sky and ensured 
<br/>his Ministers also flew the Fiji flag high and maintained the professionalism and dignity when they 
<br/>appeared on the international arena. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  I also salute our current honourable Prime Minister for doing the 
<br/>same, unlike what we have seen for some honourable Ministers from the Government side visiting 
<br/>overseas, being drunk and appearing to be a total nuisance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Point of Order, honourable Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What the honourable Member is talking about... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- … is irrelevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Maybe if you listened, you will hear it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Under what Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Under what Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You rise on what Point of Order, Madam? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>424 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the honourable Member is talking about is 
<br/>irrelevant to the Report that is before Parliament.  He should stick to the Report, even if it is a subject 
<br/>matter, still it does not connect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- He comes from the Prime Minister’s Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is a cheap shot against the Government.  He should withdraw 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those comments.  Withdraw it!  Stop imputing the character…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not my cheap comments with regards to the 
<br/>Government, it is one of the honourable Minister’s cheap comments and it is shown on media as well 
<br/>about health issues, </span><span>Walesi</span><span> and Cabinet decisions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is secret information, it 
<br/>should not be out in the public space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He did not reveal any secret information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- When we are out of the county, we all represent Fiji and that is the 
<br/>level of professionalism we should maintain.  One does not need to be told how they should behave 
<br/></span><span>at international forums.  Shame on honourable Charan Jeath Singh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Point of Order again, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member again is being irrelevant and outside of the 
<br/>Report.    He  needs  to  withdraw  those  comments.    Standing  Order  60,  you  just  used  it,  have  you 
<br/>forgotten? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- No.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Right.  Standing Order 60 - Relevance.  Stick to the subject.  Stop 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attacking MPs in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, could you confine yourself to the Report?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Sir.   I ask the honourable Minister to resign as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, during September that year, the Department of 
<br/>Immigration successfully embarked on e-passports.  As we all are aware that e-passport is one of the 
<br/>major requirements for visa on arrival for most of the countries.  Having fulfilled the preliminaries, 
<br/>the Department and this Government can now negotiate for visa on arrival with other countries as 
<br/>well.  I will now go into details of some of the key highlights and issues that were identified from the 
<br/>review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, it was identified that Vatukoula Gold Mine dispute has been long outstanding, which 
<br/>is over three decades old, that there were numerous attempts along the way to resolve the issue.  The 
<br/>legal opinion on the cause of the issue had been sought from the Office of the Solicitor-General and 
<br/>it is sad to say that led to a stalemate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  noted  that  the  Gold  Mine  Company  did  not  breach  the  contract 
<br/>agreement between them and individuals who had been affected.  The government then stepped in to 
<br/>try  to  bring  about  an  amicable  solution  and  there  was  even  an  </span><span>ex  gratia</span><span>  payment  to  the  affected 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>425 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people.    These sorts of payments are considered as reward given and not necessarily something that 
<br/>one is obliged to pay but does so as a way of recognition and appreciation of their work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> However,  there  were  individuals  who  felt  that  that  was  not  enough,  thus  wanted 
<br/>compensation for the 30 years of dispute and a substantial amount of money for this; $2 million per 
<br/>person to be exact.  This motion by this individual is contrary to the legal opinion and should be kept 
<br/>in mind that the Government,  not the Gold Mine Company had any obligation to offer compensation 
<br/>thus this issue remains unresolved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last term of Parliament, the Opposition raised this concern that we, 
<br/>as the then government needed to resolve the issue, and now with them in Government, let us see if 
<br/>they can get this issue resolved.  Interesting days are ahead, and people are waiting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You left a mess, that is what we are going to fix.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, we will see when, $2 million per person.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You left a mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Moving on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the $9 million budget allocation 
<br/>to the Office of the Prime Minister for the Small Grant Scheme Programme, $5.2 million was utilised 
<br/>with a total of 70 projects funded during the financial year in the education sector, village settlements 
<br/>and  other  integrated  sectors.    For  the  donor  aid  projects,  only  one  project  was  undertaken  and 
<br/>compiled while 10 projects are still on feasibility study.  The fund is there, the project is there as well, 
<br/>so you can now complete the project, wear the </span><span>salusalu </span><span>and cut ribbons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Do not worry, you can thank us later for those programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  noted  that  the  Rotuma  Subvention  Fund  were  not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>released due to the non-submission of the audited accounts by the Council of Rotuma.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Immigration Department undertook a joint venture agreement with 
<br/>Muhlbauer  High  Tech  International  for  the  introduction  of  e-passport.    The  total  cost  of  the 
<br/>investment is approximately FJ$7.8 million to FJ$8 million.  This covered the cost of hardware and 
<br/></span><span>software installation, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The e-passport system is enclosed by a secure firewall and uses access control as part of its 
<br/>security measures. This, together with the Department’s security regulation of Standard Operating 
<br/>Procedures  (SOPs)  safeguards  the  integrated  e-passports  issuance  system.  The  Fiji  Immigration 
<br/>Department has also reviewed and developed numerous SOPs to boost efficiency of the service it 
<br/>provides such as faster turnaround time for application outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen lately that people who were barred to enter Fiji are coming 
<br/>back to Fiji.  Was there any due diligence done?  Is there any committee to review the status before 
<br/>allowing these people to enter Fiji, or just because they supported one of the Coalition Parties, they 
<br/>are allowed to come back? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They are citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- There is a need for a system to be in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023             OPM &amp; Immigration Department 2018-2019 Annual Review Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>426 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note, does the Immigration Act allows a foreign national who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is here on work permit to be politically involved with a political party?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  This  was,  again,  Mr.  Speaker,  confirmed  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  that  one  of  the  foreign  nationals  is  actively 
<br/>involved in politics in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- He is on record and now he has been told that he can openly show 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support for the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The Office of the Prime Minister’s Development Cooperation and 
<br/>Facilitation Division is responsible for Small Grants Scheme, which is  also provided to  rural  and 
<br/></span><span>outer island communities.  It is worth noting that this Scheme is aimed at addressing the needs of 
<br/></span><span>these communities in terms of village and settlement improvement, education and climate-resilient 
<br/>projects.  These were done through </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session initiated by the former Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Projects were identified through these sessions, and it was not based on locations, province, 
<br/>ethnicity  or  religion.    There  was  a  simple  criterion  -  if  you  are  a  Fijian  and  you  need  assistance, 
<br/>assistance will be provided, unlike what we hear from the current Government that they need ethnic 
<br/>data to develop policies to assist Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we totally agree that the Office of the Prime Minister should have this kind 
<br/>of funds available to support Small Grant Schemes because it helps each and every Fijian, but the 
<br/>support should be given without any strings attached.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was also noted that both the Offices had given much effort in empowering their female staff 
<br/>by encouraging attendance to training and development programmes.  In the Report, for the third 
<br/>year,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  had  37  percent  male  and  62.8  percent  female  who  were 
<br/>provided  and  supported  through  capacity  building  and  development  programmes.    For  the  Fiji 
<br/>Immigration Department, gender mainstreaming ratio stood at 53 percent female to 47 percent male, 
<br/></span><span>whereby 68 trainings were conducted through overseas and local courses and a total of 131 officers 
<br/></span><span>attended.  Thank, you Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by saying that the Office of the 
<br/>Prime Minister was provided with a budget of $24.1 million in the 2018-2019 Budget.  In 2022-2023 
<br/>financial year, a substantial decrease is notable by about 30 percent with only $16.9 million allocated 
<br/>and the major decrease in the Small Grants Scheme was from $9 million in 2018-2019 to $1 million 
<br/>in the 2022-2023 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the history of Small Grant Projects is from 2005 and it is administered by 
<br/>the Office of the Prime Minister.  Prior to 2005, the Scheme was funded through an annual grant by 
<br/>the Taiwanese Government and was facilitated by the Office of the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Scheme, Mr. Speaker, was used to fund community-based projects that are requested by 
<br/>the communities and organisations directly to the honourable Prime Minister and they covered a wide 
<br/>range of areas like education assistance, water, electricity, village settlement development projects, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>427 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>women’s projects, sanitation and income generating projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, since the inception of the Small Grants Scheme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2005, Government 
<br/>spent around $44.8 million to fund 656 Small Grant Projects.  Obviously, the sum allocated in the 
<br/>2022-2023 Budget was just $1 million and as a Government, Mr. Speaker, we believe that this Grant 
<br/>is important, and we will be looking at restoring better allocations to the honourable Prime Minister’s 
<br/>Office for Small Grant Projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just respond to some of the moralising that was coming from the other side but before 
<br/>that  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  agree  with  the  honourable  Seruiratu.    I  think  the  leadership  of  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister of any country, including ours, is absolutely vital, not only in the country, regionally but 
<br/>also internationally.  Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after 16 years, we now have a Prime Minister 
<br/>who can stand on his feet, who can be respected and who shows the humility, understanding, not 
<br/>only of regional international politics but what he is doing right now in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a philosophy, we believe in inclusive consultative and 
<br/>leadership with humility and our honourable Prime Minister has provided that.  The last 16 years and 
<br/>in  the  last  four  years  or  five  years,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  seen,  not  only  the  lack  of  leadership 
<br/></span><span>internationally, but a total disregard and failure of leadership in the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  regional  unity  was  fractured  under  their  Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those who are sitting on that side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And it took our Prime Minister… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- My Point of Order is under Standing Order 62(4), for your information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  it  is  quite  offensive  -  absolutely  offensive,  for  the  honourable 
<br/>Member to be talking about the former Prime Minister of this country, who took this country to one 
<br/>of the fasters growing countries in the world.  This gentleman needs to keep in check with what he 
<br/>says.  Stop going on about the past!  Stop being a whinging pom!  Concentrate on what you are trying 
<br/>to do because I can tell you, Sir, right now, he is actually being offensive to a Prime Minister who 
<br/>led this country for 16 years and he has done no wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, through the exchanges that I have been hearing right 
<br/>throughout the day, I think all of you should be developing a very, very thick skin here.  If you can

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>give it, you should take it as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not recommended, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They will get used to being in 
<br/>the  Opposition  after  a  while.    They  are  under  this  illusion  and  maybe  some  of  them  are  still 
<br/>hallucinating.  It seems to me that they are still hallucinating that they are actually in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me say this, that our regional solidarity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>was fractured.  The region has suffered the disunity.  It took our honourable Prime Minister to make 
<br/>a trip to Kiribati, a one-day trip to bring Kiribati back into the Forum.  We hosted a very successful 
<br/>Pacific Leaders Summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say this and they will not like it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There is too much finger pointing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  There  is    a  sense  of  exuberance,  optimism  and  confidence 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amongst the international community…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  Must be having it for yourself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … amongst the international community, amongst the people 
<br/>in this country and there is a sense of freedom that has come under the leadership of our honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  also  talk  about  immigration.    The  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and 
<br/></span><span>Immigration  provided  a  good  summary  of  some  of  the  issues,  and  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Immigration 
<br/>Department was used by those sitting on the other side and the leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, tell them!  Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Immigration Department was used, Mr. Speaker … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- In your area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  … to punish people who they did not like.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Foreigners who meant well for this country, who had invested 
<br/>in this country, who wanted to look good for this country, were victimised by these people because 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>429 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they felt that they were not supportive of them and they were critical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me also say this, Mr. Speaker, they should stop moralising.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Stop preaching!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Maharaj stands up and talks about the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- But they forgot, Mr. Speaker,  that their Leader assaulted an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aah! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Your Minister was suspended. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, after assaulting him, he comes into Parliament 
<br/>with the support of those honourable Members sitting there, gets into the Privileges Committee and 
<br/>suspends the honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I will tell you the Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, he does not like to hear this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Can’t take the heat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not about taking the heat, Sir, it is about raising what was raised to 
<br/>us, to say about relevance by the honourable Tabuya, we are now raising the same thing - relevance, 
<br/>Sir.  Stop talking about nonsense, get on with what is actually before you!  Relevance, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, again, raise Standing Order 60 in terms of the Standing Orders, on relevance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, I have not finished.  You raised it to us, so we are raising it back to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you.  Relevance!  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>430 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  It  is  completely  relevant,  Mr.  Speaker,  because  I  am  very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clearly responding to what came from the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  people  have  short  memories,  Mr.  Speaker,  about  their  own  embarrassment  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supporting a Leader…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …  who they now want to praise, for assaulting an honourable 
<br/>Member  of  Parliament  and  then  getting  their  support  to  actually  suspend  him  and  remain  in  this 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Shame on you!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Now, shame on them, Mr. Speaker.  Shame on them!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Immigration, in fact, Mr. Speaker, I realised when I was in Opposition, that there was a 
<br/>standing instruction from their leaders who are not in Parliament but outside, that they should all 
<br/>make noise when I speak.  So, maybe that is the instruction they are getting now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A.A. Maharaj interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Then why have you not shut up? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, let me come back to the Immigration.  It was 
<br/></span><span>such a stupid decision to change the immigration laws to require people to come and live here for 15 
<br/>years before they got citizenship.  No one, behind investors and behind the funding that we want 
<br/>people to bring into the country, are people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are people who want to come and invest, who want to live in this country, but we now 
<br/>have an immigration policy which is completely contrary to what we are trying to do to create an 
<br/>investment  climate,  to  improve  the  ease  of  doing  business  and  to  have  an  efficient  immigration 
<br/>system, but all was destroyed because they were busy using the Immigration Department to victimise 
<br/>people.  And I am glad that the honourable Minister for Home Affairs pointed all those out and I 
<br/>think he is dealing with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But let me conclude by saying once again, Mr. Speaker, that the honourable Members who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were part of the previous Government will be better off just jogging their memories about what they 
<br/>used to do when they were in Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>431 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we, as a Government, are going to be different.  Our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>has  pointed  that  out,  I  have  said  that,  that  we  are  going  to  provide  inclusive  consultative  and 
<br/>leadership with humility.  The honourable Prime Minister just said that he wants the Opposition to 
<br/>be involved in his leadership of taking Fiji on the international stage, getting all the benefits that Fiji 
<br/>can get through that process of dialogue and consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I hope that after a while, they will learn that we have a Leader now, we have 
<br/>people on this side who can show humility and understanding and who can work with them because 
<br/>they are now struggling to remain relevant because the ones who are at the top have all abandoned 
<br/>them.  They are now struggling to remain relevant by still praising them.  My advice to them is, forget 
<br/>about them move on, let us make this Parliament very workable and let us work for the country.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, on my right of reply,  I thank the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members for a robust debate and contributions.  Thank you very much for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome the point from the honourable Seruiratu, that the Committee should sit and look at 
<br/>the  SDGs.    Thank  you  very  much  for  that  point,  honourable  Member.    We  will  look  at  the 
<br/>recommendations and as the honourable Prime Minister has noted and stated that, firstly, with regards 
<br/></span><span>to Vatukoula, this is a collective effort, and we need to work on this. As the honourable Member 
<br/></span><span>from  the  other  side  said,  it  has  been  30  years  or  so  and  we  are  still  just  making  more  and  more 
<br/>recommendations.  I invite the other side of Parliament to join this side and make a collective effort 
<br/>and sort this issue out with regards to the Vatukoula Gold Mines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to Recommendation 2, I thank the honourable Prime Minister in notifying this 
<br/>august Parliament on the work with the Rotuma Subvention Fund, as well as the Rabi Island Council.  
<br/>However, we are still waiting for their financial report, and we will be sending someone to Kiribati.  
<br/>On that note, Mr. Speaker, there is also the Melanesian Fund in the Office of the Prime Minister and 
<br/>I thank the Office as a whole, the Corporate Services Division Team for their Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Immigration Department and their contribution, and to take note from some of the 
<br/>points  from  the  Immigration  Department  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Minister  that  they  are 
<br/>relocating to a new building which is a good turnout for the Immigration Department, and new and 
<br/>more changes are coming with regards to the Department.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I thank the Office of the Prime Minister for their Report.  I thank 
<br/>the  previous  Standing  Committee  on  compiling  this  Report  and  the  current  Committee  for  this 
<br/></span><span>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
