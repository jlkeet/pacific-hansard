<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Police Force August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Review Report of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the annual review of the Fiji Police Force 
<br/>August  2018  –  July  2019  Annual  Report.    This  Report  was  reinstated  from  the  previous  term  of 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee is established under Section 109(2)(e) of the Standing 
<br/>Orders  of  Parliament  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji.    The  purpose  of  the  review  was  to  scrutinise  the 
<br/>performance of the Fiji Police Force (FPF) for the fiscal year August 2018 to July 2019, in tandem 
<br/>with its operations and administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The strategic theme ‘Synchronising Institutional Effectiveness’, undertaken by the institution 
<br/>looked at the annual operational plan for the above fiscal year, measured against the activities and 
<br/></span><span>strategies through five core Outputs and 10 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), that will align and 
<br/></span><span>contribute towards the national outcome of maintaining law and order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recognises the previous Government’s intent of progressively resourcing the 
<br/>FPF as a modern police organisation through budgetary allocations with the key emphasis on safety 
<br/>and security at the national level.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Committee,  after  reviewing  the  Report, 
<br/>identified pertinent issues confronting the FPF institution today.  Some of the issues identified and

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>379 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>observed are that the Committee:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Noted that the use of the latest satellite geospatial drone and communication technologies 
<br/>would assist the FPF and partner agencies to address the chronic traffic congestion on Fiji 
<br/>roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Noted  that  there  were  not  enough  senior  positions  held  by  women,  despite  the  FPF’s 
<br/>attempt that there is still space to increase the number of women in senior positions within 
<br/>the Force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Noted that there is an increasing prevalence of crimes against women and children and 
<br/>suicide  in  Fiji’s  society,  as  reflected  in  the  reporting  period  and  will  warrant  positive 
<br/>intervention measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Noted that in recent times, next of kin have not been able to process or procure legal claims 
<br/>or ownership to death and insurance benefits due to the cases of the seven years’ absence 
<br/>clause  where  no  statute  applies.    Therefore,  there  are  merits  to  recommending  for  the 
<br/>changes to the law, where it be amended to the existing framework of the Inquest Act 1967, 
<br/></span><span>or creating a new piece of legislation as in the case of the United Kingdom where they have 
<br/></span><span>introduced the Presumption of Death Act 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Noted that the FPF is continuing with its five-year reform and restructure project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Noted the initial development of KPIs in the FPF, emanated from the initiative of the then 
<br/>Strategic Framework for Change Coordinating Office (SFCCO) in 2009.  The fiscal year 
<br/>under review warrants an evaluation of the KPIs aligned to the 20-Year Development Plan 
<br/>2017 – 2036 Goals of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Noted that the Annual Report does not provide gender desegregated data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends the good work of the organisation in progressing 
<br/>this Annual Report.  While applauding the achievements of the FPF as an institution, the Committee 
<br/>had identified some opportunities for improvement.  These are outlined in the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner and all staff, including officers on mission 
<br/>areas abroad and their families for a job well done and their dedication to securing the nation for all 
<br/></span><span>Fijians and visitors to our shores. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge  and  thank  the  Members  of  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for the work that they had undertaken towards compiling this bipartisan Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
