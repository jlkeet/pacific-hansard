<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE   
<br/>ACCIDENT COMPENSATION COMMISSION FIJI 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  2018  Annual  Report  of  the  Accident  Compensation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission Fiji which was tabled on 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  honourable 
<br/>Members  of  this  august  Parliament,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Review  Report  of  the  Accident 
<br/>Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) 2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Report,  as  I have said  earlier, in 
<br/>2022.  The Report was tabled by the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Vijay Nath.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  discussed  the  no  fault  compensation  scheme  which  was 
<br/>introduced by the previous Government through the Accident Compensation Act 2017 to address the
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>various challenges and delays that were formerly faced by individuals who are involved in motor 
<br/>vehicle accidents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  commended  the  ACCF  for  the  services  that  they  have 
<br/>provided in particular, the no fault basis of the compensation paid to families of accident victims for 
<br/>the period under review and, of course, Sir, most of the families have substantially benefitted from 
<br/>the funds that were provided through ACCF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee at that time was made aware that ACCF has to collaborate 
<br/>with  key  organisations,  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Employment,  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education, Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Fiji Police Force and the Legal Aid Commission, 
<br/>to deliver their services efficiently and, of course, we commend such collaborations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, it was noted during the submission that majority of the motor 
<br/>vehicle accidents were due to careless and dangerous driving.  It is urged that all drivers use caution 
<br/>and be mindful of the various risks careless drivers pose, not only to themselves, but to other road 
<br/>users also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a personal note, while I noted that the Government is paying a substantial 
<br/></span><span>amount of money into paying, where the families of those who have lost loved ones during motor 
<br/>vehicle accidents, I noted that there is a lack of emphasis on national road safety, particularly the 
<br/>initiatives to empower people so that they are aware of road safety and this was supposed to be one 
<br/>of the responsibilities of LTA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I have noted, Sir, that this has not been vigorously enforced by this agency and, of course, 
<br/>we might be looking into trying to strengthen road safety laws and also ensuring that the public are 
<br/>aware  of  their  roles  and  their  responsibilities  and  particularly,  the  need  to  educate,  enforce  more 
<br/>education and awareness amongst our school children in schools, particularly primary schools so that 
<br/>they are aware of what they need to do when they are on the road, know their responsibilities when 
<br/>on the roads and also on motor vehicles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the former Members 
<br/>of the Committee – honourable Vijay Nath, honourable Veena Bhatnagar, honourable Sachida Nand, 
<br/>honourable Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau, who were part of this team, and they 
<br/>produced this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span><span>have a list of speakers before me sent by the honourable Whips, and the order of speakers are as 
<br/>follows:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  some  time,  we  will  continue  to  be  debating 
<br/>Committee Reports that are brought to us by Committees that we have selected and Members of this 
<br/>august Parliament, reviewing matters that were administered before we were elected.  So, we will be 
<br/>drawn into a debate on the pros and cons of the Report, as well as how they reflect the activities of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>405 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those that were involved in the various bodies that are reported on in the Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  presented  to  us  today  is  on  the  Accident  Compensation 
<br/>Commission Fiji (ACCF) 2018 Annual Report that comes under the ambit and portfolio administered 
<br/>by the Prime Minister.  It is a very straightforward function, but we have had some discussions and 
<br/>debates on the functioning of this area of our administration.  Before the honourable Mover moved 
<br/>this motion, I had asked that I share the time allocated to Government with the Minister of Finance, 
<br/>and I was talking to him when you called out my name. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had to go into a Compensation Commission arrangement under the previous Government.  
<br/>Before that, there were other areas that accidents were covered in, third party insurance, et cetera, 
<br/>and the honourable Member who was responsible for Land Transport Authority (LTA) is fully aware 
<br/>of the reason why, at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were some very disappointed insurance companies that were involved up to that time 
<br/>and this is an ongoing discussion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether we should really bring it into this as 
<br/>under the purview of Government or we should allow the private sector to continue.  The pros and 
<br/>cons from the Government point of view, financial point of view and economic point of view, I will 
<br/></span><span>let the honourable Minister of Economy, or in our case we call him the Minister of Finance, to deal 
<br/></span><span>with that, as well as the concerns from our Minister responsible for LTA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I would like to say that the Report of the Committee is very detailed, and I would like to 
<br/>commend the honourable Members of Committee, who are mostly sitting on the other side – those 
<br/>with the leadership of that Committee, in the thorough work that they had done to bring the Report 
<br/>for our consideration this time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the other contributors from the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government side who will go into the details of the observations of the Committee on ACCF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the motion.  The introduction of 
<br/>the  Accident  Compensation  Act  2017  and  Regulations  brought  about  the  most  significant 
<br/>transformation  in  the  history  of  Fiji  in  terms  of  this  accident  compensation,  as  mentioned  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, from that process and what used to be the practice many, many years 
<br/>ago, and the change that came under this transformation through the Accident Compensation Act 
<br/>2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our accident compensation history has not been a good one.  If most honourable Members 
<br/></span><span>can recall stories behind some of the events of the past - what people have been waiting for, for longer 
<br/>years to try and just get through the process of obtaining proper compensation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  go  back  to  the  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  findings,  it  says  that  the 
<br/>Committee commends the ACCF for the service they provided, in particular with the no fault basis - 
<br/>the compensation paid to families of accident victims for the period under review.  It is much easier 
<br/>and faster for victims now and families of victims to receive compensation without protracted legal 
<br/>battles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other finding that was also mentioned in the Report, it says that ACCF is to continue 
<br/>working with various media outlets and stakeholders to promote, educate and raise awareness about 
<br/>the services provided, especially the importance of paying the levy in relation to compensation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  ACCF  continues  to  receive  positive  feedback  from  satisfied  applicants.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>feedback consistently referred to expression of gratitude and appreciation for the teams’ customer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>406 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>service, timeliness, empathy and the professionalism and simplicity of the process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once compensation is available under the no fault scheme, there are certain exclusions which 
<br/>apply to such areas such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and refusing to permit a 
<br/>breath test which is something that is called by the law enforcement to conduct when checking on 
<br/>those involved in accidents; withholding of proper driving licence and failure to comply with all the 
<br/>conditions of the driving licence, be convicted for causing the accident and also failing to pay the 
<br/>motor vehicle accident levy, the motor vehicle accident levy, amongst others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, approximately 80 percent of the $44 million has already been paid out would 
<br/>have not been paid if the application for the compensation were made prior to the introduction of the 
<br/>Accident Compensation Scheme.  We can see that this is a big thing for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji now, under this Scheme, is operating just like the way they are doing in New Zealand or 
<br/>Australia in terms of our benchmark.  Family members no longer have to establish the fault or pursue 
<br/>the costly and protracted legal claims for compensation.  So, the Scheme also removes a number of 
<br/>unreasonable exclusions that existed under the old law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is far much more easier now to receive compensation for motor vehicle, employment and 
<br/></span><span>school accidents of which there is no application fee to be paid.  So the ACCF collaborates with key 
<br/>stakeholders  to  ensure  that  victims  and  families  of  victims  receive  the  best  service  to  obtain 
<br/>compensation  under  the  No-Fault  Scheme.    A  proactive  approach  that  is  taken  with  the  view  to 
<br/>prevent serious injuries and deaths on our roads, workplaces and school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ACCF has undertaken a number of roadside campaigns as well, and I know that that has 
<br/>been  done,  as  alluded  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  on  the  importance  of  carrying  out  the 
<br/>education and also awareness for members of the public on how this ACCF system works, and also 
<br/>for members of the public in taking precautions in regards to the safety which covers the members 
<br/>of the general public whether you are a driver or a passenger in a driven motor vehicle.  Now, the 
<br/>team delivered numerous presentations to the stakeholders and also to the members of the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  continuous  improvement  and  the  implementation  of  the  Standard 
<br/>Operating  Procedures  (SOPs)  has  assisted  ACCF  to  successfully  carry  out  its  operation  during 
<br/>restrictions  placed  to  manage  COVID-19  during  that  period,  so  the  development  of  ACCF  Team 
<br/>empowered them to serve the public effectively and efficiently, despite lockdown challenges, and the 
<br/>Team managed to process a significant number of applications.  The Team takes supportive approach 
<br/></span><span>with applicants, and this is evident from the positive customer feedback.  So, there is a great focus, 
<br/></span><span>Sir,  on  customer  service  and  the  need  to  remain  respectful  and  to  give  compensation  claim  to 
<br/>applicants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  mentioned  by  the  ACCF,  extensive  awareness  campaigns  have  been 
<br/>undertaken through the use of various medium, such as billboards, LED screens, the media releases 
<br/>and the social media postings to ensure the Scheme is visible and the public are aware of their right 
<br/>to apply for compensation.  So, the compensation paid to applicants provided relief and assisted them 
<br/>at  a  time  when  they  needed  it  most,  which  would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  No  Fault 
<br/>Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2021-2022 Budget, there was an announcement of the complete 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exemption of the Annual Motor Vehicle Accident Levy for the period commencing on and from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August, 2021 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022.  This was in recognition of the severe impacts of COVID-19 on 
<br/>Fiji’s economy and on the families of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>407 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The announcement provided relief to motor vehicle owners for a period of one year, as the 
<br/>nation  coped  with  significant  impacts  of  COVID-19.    So,  the  owner  of  a  motor  vehicle  in  that 
<br/>assistance  was  upon  the  registration  or  renewal  of  registration  of  motor  vehicle  with  LTA  were 
<br/>exempted from paying the Annual Motor Vehicle Accident levy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of $44.8 million in compensation has been paid under that No Fault Scheme since 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>January, 2018, of which $30.3 million was for motor vehicle accidents, $13.5 million for employment 
<br/>accidents and $500,000 for school accidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in speaking on this motion, again, I would like to say that the importance of this 
<br/>new Scheme and this system continues operating in our beloved country to assist people, especially 
<br/>those  accident  members  of  families  and  those  victims  in  getting  compensation  in  the  areas  of 
<br/>accidents whether it is motor vehicle accidents, workplace accidents or even school accidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That was a well articulated input from our former boss of LTA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion at hand on 
<br/>accident compensation.  With regard to the Report itself, we had looked at this Report as a Committee 
<br/></span><span>last year and there were some issues in terms of the period covered and if you look at page 13, it is 
<br/></span><span>as at 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2020, but the Report is 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We have now resolved it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not here to argue with you, just to assist with the debate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the figures there, the Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation is $10.9 million, 
<br/>Employment Accidents is $1.4 million, School Accidents is $55,500.  Motor vehicle accidents make 
<br/>up  the  highest  number  or  percentage  of  compensation  and  this  is  an  area,  as  mentioned  by  the 
<br/>Chairman, that we, as a nation, need to look at.  We normally tell our children, “Take care” or “come 
<br/>back home soon”, and those are some of the messages which we tell them in terms of road safety.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a rise in the number of vehicle accidents and fatalities.  If we go by the number of 
<br/>road fatalities in the last five years – 17 in 2018, 63 in 2019, 45 in 2020, 25 in 2021, 44 in 2022 and 
<br/>18 so far, which we have not even reached the end of March.  With that rate, we might even be the 
<br/>same as 2018, or even surpass that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  out  of  those  fatalities,  the  majority  have  been  due  to  speeding  which  is 
<br/>around  42  percent  and  drunk  driving  is  29  fatalities  which  is  around  10  percent.    So,  the  Land 
<br/>Transport Authority (LTA) has taken proactive measures in terms of awareness and defensive driving 
<br/>as part of its functions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just some of the figures to share with you - 225 school visits regarding road safety, 143 
<br/>awareness activities, 1,058 defensive driving trainings in 2018 and this increased to 768 school visits 
<br/>in 2019, 700 awareness activities and 861 defensive driving.  Again, in 2020, this number is about 
<br/>the same in 2021 and 2022.  So, this is an activity which LTA as an entity under my Ministry will be 
<br/>intensifying in the next few years given the concerns (if you look at those figures) such as motor 
<br/>vehicle accidents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Traffic Infringement Notices have also been issued, 2018 to 2022 a total of 528,960 (quite a 
<br/>huge number).  We need to reduce this, and I commend the efforts of the law enforcement officers 
<br/>in terms of the duties they are undertaking proactively and reactively through the use of technology 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>408 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>innovation and strict enforcement. I implore members of the public to please adhere to road rules in 
<br/>terms of discipline in driving.  We need to think of our children and ask whether the 10 minutes safe 
<br/>through speeding is worth the possibility of endangering lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Transport Authority is  quite a complex organisation,  there are various levels  of 
<br/>legislation and regulations.  Some are cumbersome, some are inconsistent; that is an exercise we are 
<br/>going through right now in terms of the review of the organisation, the legislation and regulation to 
<br/>ensure  some  of  the  impediments  in  terms  of  our  transport  industry  is  removed  and  made  more 
<br/>efficient and effective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  There  is  a  slight  change,  the  honourable  Usamate’s  name  has  been  put 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forward by the Whip and after that it will be the honourable Premila Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to talk to 
<br/>this motion.  I think on this side of Parliament we totally endorse the recommendations to take note 
<br/>of the Report.  I thought it will be important just to point out a number of things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The very fact that we have this organisation in place is a reflection of a phenomenal change 
<br/></span><span>in this country. It is a huge change.  I have had the honour and the privilege of having served as the 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Employment (I think two times now) and we have seen the pain and the heartache that 
<br/>comes  when  people  have  injuries  to  the  only  person  working  in  their  family  trying  to  get  that 
<br/>compensation from Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- For people who have served as Ministers for Employment, we know 
<br/>how heartbreaking it is, the difficulty of getting that compensation and the fact that we have got this 
<br/>coming in with no blame, it is a huge change.  I have seen over the years when you have the statute 
<br/>of limitations.  The statute of limitations (if I am not mistaken), if you are not able to claim the money 
<br/>within seven years, it is gone.  So even though you might be right that the injury did take place and 
<br/>there is argument of who is to blame, that money is gone.  This has been a huge a change and I think 
<br/>this is indicative of some of the things that the former Government was doing, trying to do things 
<br/>better for the people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One big change that I will never forget, in the past, if you are a member of the security forces, 
<br/>the  military  forces  and  you  got  injured  in  Lebanon  or  wherever,  you  never  got  workmen’s 
<br/></span><span>compensation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You did not get it. It was under the Prime Minister Bainimarama that 
<br/>that finally happened.  So that if you are in the security force, you got the worker’s compensation, 
<br/>but then you had this whole thing about who is to blame?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular legislation that brought about the Accident Compensation took that away. It 
<br/>just says, “if something happens to you, you get the compensation.”  I think that was the phenomenal 
<br/>change in this country.  For people who have been waiting for a long time for something like that to 
<br/>happen, you all have family members that have been able to get the benefits out of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only that, school accidents, the importance of children.  Children can be 
<br/>playing at a school and someone pokes eye with a pencil and their sight has gone.  That means their 
<br/>whole future can be hampered, can be damaged by school yard accidents, et cetera.  This particular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>409 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compensation, this particular organisation now makes sure that that compensation is there.  I think it 
<br/>drives  home  for  us  the  importance  of  children,  the  importance  of  looking  after  our  children  and 
<br/>making sure that we put in place laws and regulations that look after them to make sure that they can 
<br/>have a better future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important things that I believe and all of us talk about this, justice delayed is 
<br/>justice  denied.    Sometimes  when  you  have  someone  who  is  the  only  breadwinner  and  the 
<br/>compensation does not come quickly to that family, they can then begin this downward spiral into 
<br/>poverty, et cetera.  It is very important that, that money or compensation, it is not going to completely 
<br/>take away the pain of losing someone or the injury that accrued to the breadwinner in that particular 
<br/>family, but this allows for the speed of that compensation.  It allows us to be able to do things for the 
<br/>family to make sure that they continue to survive, that they can get through the hard times, especially 
<br/>for some families, if the breadwinner does not have a lot of FNPF then they rely of these funds.  If 
<br/>there is a blame game that is going on between the insurance company and the employer then it just 
<br/>leads to this delayed justice which leads to all kinds of problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just looking at this one, this has been a phenomenal change in this country. 
<br/>Phenomenal for families in which these things have occurred, the no fault and I think if you look 
<br/></span><span>back at the history of the FijiFirst Government when it was in place, it also brought about for the first 
<br/></span><span>time, the first National Minimum Wage. Once again trying to protect the interest of workers that are 
<br/>at the very bottom rungs in terms of earning income.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had the nine years of economic growth, low taxation rates, taxation thresholds were 
<br/>brought  up  to  $30,000.  I  am  just  trying  to  point  out  some  of  the  things  that  we  did,  it  is  all 
<br/>encompassing, you going to look at it holistically, all of these things working out well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  former  Minister  for 
<br/>Transport (sitting behind me), he was one of the chiefs architects of this, trying to put through to 
<br/>make sure that we have the compensation out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing that I was saying, very important now for us, I think the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Transport (my good friend there) has talked about the importance of road safety.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I think the statistics for this year has not been good in terms of people getting injured and hurt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that we had a decade target of halving, if I am not mistaken, the number of fatalities 
<br/></span><span>that we have on our roads, we have more vehicles, more heavier vehicles, we have speed limits that 
<br/>sometimes a lot of government drivers do not abide by those speed limits of 50 kilometres per hour 
<br/>or 60 kilometres per hour, but I think this is a great challenge for us to make sure that we reduce 
<br/>fatalities and accidents on our roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving the opportunity to speak on 
<br/>the motion.  Sir, ACCF is a statutory body established in 2018, so this Report that we are discussing 
<br/>today is the first report from ACCF.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ACCF is one of the legacies of the FijiFirst Government which benefited 
<br/>many families and ended the unfair Accident Compensation Scheme that existed previously and what 
<br/>we know as Third Party Insurance.  People were denied justice under the old system and as alluded 
<br/>to by honourable Usamate, one had to look for fault, you had to prove the fault before compensation 
<br/>can be given out.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>410 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many accident victims were running from pillar to post trying to get that compensation and I 
<br/>recall the campaign the Consumer Council of Fiji started just because of the complaints they were 
<br/>receiving from the victims who were not compensated under the Third Party Insurance.  Third Party 
<br/>Insurance, while it is compulsory, it is mandatory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you own a vehicle, before you put that vehicle on the road, you must pay this compulsory 
<br/>insurance.  Unfortunately, with this insurance came a number of exclusion clauses that denied the 
<br/>compensation.  One of the exclusion clauses, it is hard to believe that it existed just few years ago.  
<br/>If a driver is drunk or did not carry a valid  licence and if you are walking down the street and this 
<br/>vehicle hits you, you will not be compensated.  You have no link to the driver, you do not know when 
<br/>you are walking on the street whether the driver is drunk or is under the influence of drugs or he or 
<br/>she is not carrying a driving licence, and that is when the bigger battle started because, firstly, the 
<br/>victim had to fork out money for medical treatment; secondly, the victim had to fork out money to 
<br/>pay for the lawyers, and obviously the third one is wasting your time just going to the court to prove 
<br/>the point.  So, it was during that time that the Council decided that there has to be some form of 
<br/>change  in  the  policy  so  that  victims  are  taken  care  of.    So  with  ACCF,  as  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister mentioned, the Government received lots of criticisms from those who were directly linked 
<br/>to the insurance sector.  But today, we can see the benefits of reforming accident compensation laws 
<br/></span><span>and the funding model which is sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Accident Compensation Act and the establishment of ACCF, the accident victims 
<br/>now have a simple redressal mechanism.  It is not adversarial, it is a very efficient system.   You 
<br/>simply go to ACCF, fill in your form, log your claims and then it also talks about the compensation 
<br/>in three parts.  For example, if there is a death, the family is compensated $75,000 immediately, and 
<br/>if it is a total injury where the permanent injury is such where he or she is not able to work and look 
<br/>after themselves then the compensation is around $150,000.  So it is a very clear system, it is such 
<br/>that if you do not wish to take that compensation and if you feel that loss of a life is not worth $75,000, 
<br/>you are free to take the matter to court, and then you can take up your case.  Another good component 
<br/>of this Accident Compensation Act is particularly on exclusion.  Exclusion is there, but it is penalising 
<br/>the offender, which is the driver, if the driver is drunk or is not carrying a valid licence, whatever the 
<br/>reason is, they will not be given compensation, but the victim will.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2018, ACCF has grown into a trusted organisation that not only deals 
<br/>with  road  accidents,  as  we  heard  that  it  also  deals  with  employment  related  accidents  or  school 
<br/>accidents.  I would like to comment on Recommendations 4 and 5.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 suggests the inclusion of sports injuries and what I am saying, this can be 
<br/></span><span>tricky and a costly affair.   The ACCF needs to undertake a thorough research to set the boundary for 
<br/>sports injury and to understand the total cost of compensation and how it will be funded.  Currently, 
<br/>as I said, the model is such that it is sustainable and works within.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unless  and  until  ACCF  is  able  to  reduce  the  injuries  or  accidents  whether  at  school, 
<br/>employment or road, that is where the savings can be seen.  But at the rate the compensation is being 
<br/>paid out, I hope we do not see the day where there is not enough money to compensate.  So, that is 
<br/>something the ACCF needs to work hand in hand with road safety, schools, and I know they have 
<br/>been doing it.  They have been running many awareness campaigns with various organisations and 
<br/>they should continue doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 5, which honourable Tuisawau has just talked about in detail, is how do we 
<br/>create a financial surplus and not create a system where there is financial constraint for ACCF to do 
<br/>the payment, and it all boils down to the point that we need to reduce the accidents.  We can only do 
<br/>that if we make the rules very clear, if the rules are enforced by the road authority, LTA or the rules 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>411 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are enforced by the schools or the rules are enforced at a workplace then only we can see reduction 
<br/>in the number of incidents or accidents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we often hear, just a while ago in the morning session, honourable Prasad 
<br/>talked about Government’s legacy, so this is our legacy that we leave behind and we look forward to 
<br/>seeing how you are going to take this institution to another level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the past and present staff of Consumer Council 
<br/>of Fiji.  It was their success and hard work that saw this particular legislation come into force and the 
<br/>establishment of ACCF.  I also would like to thank the staff of ACCF for the good job they have 
<br/>been doing so far, and I wish them best of luck in ensuring that they are able to reduce the number 
<br/>of accidents.  I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  very  briefly  as  has  been  stated,  the 
<br/>Accident  Compensation  Commission  Fiji  was  established  in  2017  and  since  then  honourable 
<br/>Tuinaceva gave some interesting statistics which I also have.  I think he has got the latest statistics, 
<br/>which is good.  The Opposition is able to get the information, unlike, when we were in Opposition, 
<br/>it was very difficult to get information from any of the statutory organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is a former boss. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that the turnaround time for 
<br/>payments under this scheme is much faster, because it is a No Fault Scheme, which means victims 
<br/>do not have to prove fault or negligence.  So, it does make it more efficient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that I want to make, and I think honourable Premila Kumar actually hit the nail on 
<br/>the head, and that is the most important thing that I wanted to say and it is true that while some of 
<br/>the things that the previous Government did, they brought in some changes to the legislation, some 
<br/>we supported as the Opposition in Parliament, and I hope they will remember that.  We used to point 
<br/>out often from the Opposition that the information they were providing was always like a bit hard, 
<br/>not every detail was being given.  So, I want to just point some of those out, because it is important, 
<br/>and as I said, the honourable Premila Kumar made a very important point about the sustainability of 
<br/>these kinds of schemes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talked about New Zealand, New Zealand was actually having a lot of difficulties about 
<br/>the sustainability, I am not sure what the situation is at the moment but that is what I was told.  So, it 
<br/></span><span>is very important for us to put in place, I think the first thing that honourable Members talked about 
<br/></span><span>is how to reduce the motor vehicle accidents.  As of today, $29 million was just paid for accident 
<br/>compensation and as being pointed out about $11.5 million for employment accidents and about a 
<br/>million dollars for school accidents.   So, the effort of the organisation will have to focus on reducing 
<br/>the motor vehicle accidents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that no one from the other side pointed out is how this scheme is funded.  As 
<br/>I have said, honourable Premila Kumar is now here, I said she made a very good point and a very 
<br/>important one about the sustainability of this scheme because right now.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is funded 
<br/>from what we call the Accident Compensation Levy. I know the rate has been reduced by 50 percent 
<br/>as part of the COVID-19 support, so with a 100 percent of that Accident Compensation Levy… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Vehicle levy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Vehicle levy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>412 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With 100 percent, if we go back to 100 percent, we would collect only $12 million and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FNU Levy will give us about $8 million which is the total inflow of income for the ACCF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the other point that we need to point out and this has already been raised by employers 
<br/>because there was no discussion with the employers about the training levy.  The total inflow is based 
<br/>on the motor vehicle accident levy and the 40 percent of the 1 percent of FNU levy.  So, out of the 
<br/>100  percent  of  the  FNU  Levy,  40  percent  goes  to  the  ACCF,  50  percent  goes  to  private  GP 
<br/>outsourcing and 10 percent goes to training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think honourable Premila Kumar was correct that if the trend for motor vehicle accident 
<br/>compensation continues and we continue to use the FNU training levy, which again is another debate 
<br/>because over the years and if you look at some of the difficulties that we are having today with respect 
<br/>to the shortage of skills in that category where the former FNTC was providing those skills, it is not 
<br/>there.  If we are not careful, if the government does not get into action very quickly and we will Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, as part of our strategy to ensure that we continue to provide the skills, we are going to 
<br/>have to think very carefully how to address that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This information is very important, and I am sure the honourable Minister for Employment, 
<br/></span><span>Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations  is  already  getting  feedbacks  from  the  employers  as  to  what 
<br/></span><span>needs to be done.  So, the question that I want to put and I think this is the work that the ACCF will 
<br/>have to do is to look at the financial model because if we remove the 40 percent of the 1 percent FNU 
<br/>levy because we want to train more people, we want employers to use that to get training then out of 
<br/>the $20 million that goes to the ACCF, $12 million will be taken away.  If you take the $12 million 
<br/>away, it is not going to be sustainable with the rate of payout that we are experiencing.  This is why 
<br/>these financial models are very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want the people to understand that all motor vehicle owners whether they 
<br/>are  private,  whether  they  are  public  are  paying  for  this  as  well  as  by  the  employers  who  were 
<br/>contributing to the FNU levy.  So, having said that, I want to thank the Members of the Committee 
<br/>and I am sure the Chairman of the Committee will response to any other issues that might be there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/>their contributions and the issues that they have raised.  Of course, now we realise this substantial 
<br/>benefit being provided to families that are being compensated, at the same time we should also be 
<br/>aware of the costs involved.  I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for raising that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, as alluded to by most of the honourable Members who have contributed, this is a 
<br/></span><span>system  that  has  been  working  well  and  has  addressed  some  of  the  issues  that  relates  to  accident 
<br/>victims when they are looking around and seeking assistance from the various organisations and of 
<br/>course from the various agencies in government. We noted from the issue that was brought up also 
<br/>and  part  of  the  recommendation  was  on  sports  and  injury.    It  needs  to  be  also  addressed  and 
<br/>researched given the enormity of the cost that will be involved in compensating those who will be 
<br/>affected by sports injury. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally agree with the issue that has also been raised by honourable Prof. 
<br/>Biman Prasad, the sustainability and how can we adequately ensure that we have a business model 
<br/>that works.  Perhaps maybe that is an area the Government needs to look into, particularly now when 
<br/>we are looking at inadequate workmen in this country - the skills that are being required to ensure 
<br/>that we have people who can service the various industries that are requiring skilled tradesmen and 
<br/>manpower.    I  think  that  needs  to  be  also  adequately  looked  into  when  we  are  looking  into  a 
<br/>sustainable model to finance ACCF, particularly, when you are looking into the future of how we are 
<br/>going to sustainably develop.
