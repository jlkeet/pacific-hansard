<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE 
<br/> MUNICIPAL COUNCILS’ 2018-2019 AND 2019-2020 AUDIT REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to rise on a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, in the interest of transparency, accountability 
<br/>and to take away the conflict of interest, I am asking Government to review the Chairmanship of the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This has no personal question on the integrity of the honourable Member.  It is just the basic 
<br/>fact that he is the honourable Assistant Minister of Finance, holding the position as Chairman of the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance knows 
<br/>this very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  to  chase  the  funds  to  every 
<br/></span><span>institution that  have  been  funded  by  the  Government  coffers.    I  think  it  is  a  bit  unfair  to  ask  the 
<br/>honourable Assistant Minister of Finance to actually sit and Chair the very Committee that has been 
<br/>tasked to look at the transparency of actually following the dollar in every institution that has been 
<br/>funded by Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you.    I  will  allow  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister of Finance to take the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually quite interesting and I am happy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the honourable Member has raised this issue because this is a very important issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to take him back, Mr. Speaker, and we have had a lot of debate on the Chairmanship 
<br/>of the Public Accounts Committee, as you know.  It was always a convention for the Opposition to 
<br/>Chair the Public Accounts Committee and some of them, sitting on that side… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Can I just elaborate on that?  I think the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is coming from a different angle.  All we are asking from the Government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I have not finished, but he will get his chance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please, take your seat.  The honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister is replying to the very Order that you have raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, it is essentially to help you, Sir, and help this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to take him back, and he should jog his memory a little bit.  The Chairman of 
<br/>the Public Accounts Committee. by convention in most countries and here in Fiji in particular, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, was always Chaired by a Member of the Opposition.  I was appointed the Chairman of the

<div><span>Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Accounts Committee, some of those honourable Members sitting on the other side today, were 
<br/>part of the brigade which brought a motion and changed the Standing Order to give themselves the 
<br/>Chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …to review the reports that they had produced since 2006 and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not presented to Parliament.  Here, this honourable Member has the audacity… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- To see the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C .PRASAD.- … to talk about conflict of interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I will tell you, why there is no conflict of interest.  He has the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>audacity to talk about conflict of interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I haven’t finished. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order?  Quote the Standing Order, what   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Koya, resume your seat and I will ask the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  to  round  off  his  reply  to  the  Standing  Order  that  was  raised  by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau.  That reminds me as well, being a Member of the Public Accounts Committee, of the 
<br/>happenings that occurred that led to the amendment of the Standing Orders. So I am well-versed with 
<br/>that, honourable Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, let me finish what I was saying, that here is a 
<br/>Member who was part of that brigade to change the Standing Order, has the audacity to come into 
<br/>this Parliament today… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …sitting in the Opposition and saying there is a conflict of 
<br/>interest.  I will tell why there is no conflict of interest.  At least until such time, Mr. Speaker, that we 
<br/>finish… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …looking at all the Annual Reports, the audited accounts that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened under their Government…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>383 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …and  it  is  absolutely  right  for  us  to  have  an  Opposition 
<br/>Member  as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, even though honourable Immanuel  is 
<br/>the Assistant Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- What is the problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …he is looking at the Annual Reports, the audited accounts 
<br/>of what happened during their time when they were in Government.  They should have a little bit of 
<br/>shame, Mr. Speaker, to bring this kind of issues because…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …we are setting the standards by saying that we will have an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistant Minister… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What, did you want it?  Say it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … chairing the Public Accounts Committee until such time 
<br/>when we review it, if this Government want to review it, it will do so but right now, the Government 
<br/>Member, the honourable Assistant Minister of Finance will Chair the Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>and there is no conflict of interest, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Assistant Minister, you have the floor to move your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Audit Reports on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal Councils, which was tabled on 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Mr. Chairman, you are given a time of 20 minutes to elaborate on your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Members of  Parliament, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee and Mover of the motion, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion 
<br/>to review the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 Audit Reports on Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  background,  Sir,  the  review  of  the  accounts  was  carried  out  by  the  previous  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee.  The Committee collectively reviewed 10 municipal audits from 2018 to 2019 
<br/>Audit Report and five municipal audits from 2019 to 2020 Audit Report.  The years of audit, coverage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>384 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ranges from 2010, 2012 to 2016, 2018 and 2019.  This shows that majority of the municipal council 
<br/>audits are in backlog.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 57(1) and (3) of the Local Government Act 1972 establishes the 
<br/>financial accountability and legislative timeframe for Municipal Councils to complete and publish 
<br/>its audited financial reports. The legislative timeframe for the preparation of the financial statement 
<br/>is 31</span><span>st</span><span> May and the legislative timeframe to publish the audited financial statement is the 31</span><span>st</span><span> August 
<br/>of every year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  findings  from  the  reports  at  the  outset,  I  will  highlight  some  of  the 
<br/>common  findings  identified  in  the  two  reports  that  were  examined  by  the  then  Committee.    It  is 
<br/>important to note that the audit backlog is primarily due to the significant delay in the submission of 
<br/>the  draft  financial  statements  to  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  -  lack  of  compliance  with  the 
<br/>financial reporting framework, lack of compliance with the International Accounting Standards and 
<br/>the lack of compliance with the Local Government Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this lack of compliance is reflected in the audit opinion issued by the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General.  In the 2018 to 2019 Audit Report, the Office of the Auditor-General issued 
<br/></span><span>modified  or  qualified  audit  opinions  on  six  financial  statements  that  were  audited,  while  eight 
<br/></span><span>financial statements were issued with disclaimer of opinion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2019 to 2020 Audit Report, the Office of the Auditor-General issued one qualified or 
<br/>modified audit opinion on five and five modified or disclaimer of opinion on the financial statements 
<br/>of six Municipal Councils that were audited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  identified  the  following  issues  as  common  across 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>municipalities and necessary action is required to address the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The quality and timeliness of completion and submission of financial statements for audit. 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Internal control issues, and these are recurring issues across all the municipal councils. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Human resources are in need for those Municipal Councils. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The need for internal auditors as well as sharing of resources across the Municipal Councils. 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and relevant policies need to be developed by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all councils with the assistance of the Ministry of Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Needs to be an improvement in record management. 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Reconciliation and bookkeeping knowledge and training is a must. 
<br/></span><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Problem with rubbish dump sites. 
<br/></span><span>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Mismanagement of funds, an example is the capital grant being used for operational and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Tender processes not followed.  
<br/>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Need to strengthen the monitoring the capital projects implementations and timeframe of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completion by all municipal heads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(12)</span><span> </span><span>Lack of monitoring from the Ministry of Local Government on Municipal Councils. 
<br/>(13)</span><span> </span><span>Absence of municipal council’s centralised IT system - they were trying to use their own. 
<br/>(14)</span><span> </span><span>Absence of Standard Accounting Software that can be used by all municipalities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has some recommendations, which are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry of Local Government should strictly monitor the progress of capital projects 
<br/>implementation to provide better control for future grant disbursement to municipalities for 
<br/>capital  projects.    There  are  two  capital  projects  that  were  discussed  during  that  the 
<br/>Committee’s deliberation - Ba Stadium and Sigatoka River-Wall Protection.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>385 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry of Local Government should place priority in getting all the municipalities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>audited to be updated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry should include in the Special Administrator or the Chief Executive Officer’s 
<br/>terms of engagement KPIs that includes, bring the audited accounts up to-date during their 
<br/>tenure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>All municipalities should explore with the Ministry of Local Government on the use of a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>standard accounting software for uniformity of purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The  Committee  concurs  with  the  Auditor-General’s  recommendations  and  further 
<br/>recommends  that  the  Municipal  Councils  should  use  Government  grants  only  for  the 
<br/>intended purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>All municipalities should liaise with the Ministry of Local Government to provide staff 
<br/>training in the areas of bookkeeping, application of accounting software, receipting rates 
<br/>recording, reconciliations et cetera.  There is a dire need in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Municipalities  should  also  implement  stringent  disciplinary  measures  against  staff  who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to disregard the due process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee noted the current status of those qualification issues for all municipalities 
<br/>and  further  recommends  that  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  conducts  regular 
<br/>monitoring so that discrepancies identified are addressed in a timely manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that the previous administration have been informed 
<br/>through the Committee report and Audit Reports on the issues identified, and actions taken were not 
<br/>enough to address those recurring issues.  In this regard, the Committee strongly recommends that 
<br/>immediate action is required by the respective municipalities in working closely with the Ministry of 
<br/>Local Government to improve financial accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, the Committee will continue to highlight issues in this august Parliament until 
<br/>these municipalities improve their audit status and strengthen their systems and processes for public 
<br/>funds accountability purposes.  With those few words, as the Member moving the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we proceed to the debate by opening the floor, I only wish to remind 
<br/>honourable Members that I have received the list from both, the Opposition Whip and that of the 
<br/>Leader of the Government in Parliament and that three speakers from each side will be speaking.  I 
<br/>would like us to agree if they could alternate, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; and.   
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable E.Y. Immanuel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time and opportunity to speak on the 
<br/>Report. Basically, this Report was tabled with I, being the Chairperson in the past term, and this was 
<br/>a bipartisan one to which you were also a signatory, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any country the reflection of the country is how beautiful and stunning 
<br/>their towns and cities are and Fiji being a tourist destination is very important to have towns and 
<br/>cities up to par and expectation of tourists coming to visit Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, turning to the Audit Report, it is important to note that few councils that are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covered in both reports, majority of these municipalities are still in backlog.  One of the main and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>386 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>key issues that we identified during our public consultation and consultation with municipalities was 
<br/>that the current appointed CEOs are too involved in dealing with the backlogs and in the process of 
<br/>doing  so,  what  is  basically  happening  is,  they  are  forgoing  the  responsibilities  that  are  on  their 
<br/>shoulders to provide this year’s audit report on time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing we discussed, and the Committee decided, is to allow the CEOs and the Special 
<br/>Administrators  to  come  out  of  these  backlogs  and  start  presenting  reports  on  time  so  that  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee does not waste time dealing with the reports when the management is not there 
<br/>to  present  before  the  Public  Accounts  Committee.    As  far  as  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  is 
<br/>concerned, it would be rather efficient for the Public Accounts Committee to scrutinize the current 
<br/>report rather than looking at the backlogs that have been there for a number of years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The delay in audit is also due to no-submission of the draft financials as elaborated by the 
<br/>current  Chairperson  as  legislated  that  by  31</span><span>st</span><span>  May  annually  all  financial  statements  should  be 
<br/>submitted to the Auditor-General for scrutiny.  There are various reasons which is fully understood 
<br/>by  Public  Accounts  Committee  such  as  records  not  available  or  staff  have  moved  on  to  other 
<br/>organisations, Municipal Councils still using ancient ways of record-keeping in files, now in such a 
<br/>situation is putting immense pressure on the current management to be dealing with audit queries and 
<br/></span><span>getting their annual and audit reports up to date.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be more realistic and of sense for the Public Accounts Committee to be dealing with 
<br/>the  current  issues  rather  than  the  backlogs.    With  all  efforts  made  by  the  Council,  Office  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General and previous Public Accounts Committees, it is great to see that some Municipal 
<br/>Councils have submitted their accounts for audit to the Office of the Auditor-General for the financial 
<br/>year ending 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to name one, Savusavu Municipal Council has submitted their financials to 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General for scrutiny.  In view of the audit finding, the Committee noted 
<br/>that  majority  of  the  issues  identified  herewith  have  been  taken  into  consideration  with  necessary 
<br/>implementations undertaken by municipalities and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Municipalities were liaising  with  the Ministry of Local  Government  to  provide staff 
<br/>training in areas of bookkeeping, application of accounting software, receipting rates, 
<br/>recording  and  reconciliations  so  that  variances  in  the  financial  statements  can  be 
<br/>minimised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>A very thorough interview process is being conducted to select the best candidate who 
<br/></span><span>is specialised and have knowledge in bookkeeping application of accounting software, 
<br/>receipting rates, recording and reconciliation as this will ensure efficiency and accuracy 
<br/>in accounts and reports.  It is, therefore, desirable to adapt to OMRS system to ensure 
<br/>transparency and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Standard Operation Procedures were developed and will be readily available as it 
<br/>provides policies, processes and standard needed for the organisation to succeed.  It can 
<br/>benefit  the  municipalities  in  reducing  errors,  increase  efficiencies  and  profitability, 
<br/>creating a safer work environment thus producing guidelines on how to resolve issues 
<br/>and overcome obstacles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Suva  City  Council  has  always  been  rated  as  one  of  the  efficient 
<br/>municipalities.  For instance, it is always seen that the council is investing in parks, building and is 
<br/>more focused in generating revenue through rentals as the council has engaged in a lot of investments 
<br/>and not just relying on rate collection as revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>387 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  Suva  City  Council has  ventured  into  Free  Planting  Initiative  that  is  being  undertaken 
<br/>which is climate and environmental-friendly. The Council continues to provide a place for micro-
<br/>business  which  is  thriving  within  the  city  and  creates  a  bustling  center.    The  Council’s  ability  in 
<br/>maintaining cleanliness through effective solid waste management system and sanitation control is 
<br/>welcoming  which  has  seen  the  council  now  managing  solid  waste  for  Nasinu  Town  Council.  
<br/>Therefore,  the  work  done  by  the  council  is  commended  and  other  municipalities  that  are  not 
<br/>performing  up  to  par  should  use  the  performing  councils  such  as  the  Suva  City  Council  as  a 
<br/>benchmark.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has seen that Municipal Councils are well adopting to OMRS and it can be 
<br/>seen in terms of improved service delivery.  If councils are run like a corporate organisation and right 
<br/>people  are  selected  for  the  right  job,  the  Committee  believes  that  Municipal  Councils  can  obtain 
<br/>substantial growth and there is a huge potential for growth for these councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is evident that after few rounds of consultations with the Committee, improvements can be 
<br/>seen  with  the  councils  and  at  the  Ministry  level.    While  the  Committee  realises  that  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government’s  vision  was  to  give  full  autonomy  to  the  council  and  the  board  on  its  day  to  day 
<br/>operations, the Ministry needs to continue to provide an oversight and monitor the functions of the 
<br/></span><span>council, at least until such time the Council starts to operate independently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Public  Accounts  Committee  will  continue  to  encourage  this  council  to  update  their 
<br/>audited accounts and put forward strategies and measures to address the pertinent issues that continue 
<br/>to appear in the audit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate that 
<br/>is before Parliament.  The Ministry of Local Government acknowledges the recommendations by the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Public Accounts with respect to the Review of Municipal Councils Annual 
<br/>Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise that the issues highlighted in the Report are legacy 
<br/>issues  and  the  Municipal  Councils  have  designed  some  practical  strategies  to  help  improve  and 
<br/>address issues that are highlighted by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is focused on making Municipal Councils more 
<br/>accountable, transparent and responsible to the ratepayers.  This has been missing for the past 15-
<br/>odd years.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is focused on making Municipal Councils more 
<br/>accountable, transparent and responsible to the ratepayers.  This has been missing for the past 15-
<br/>odd years.  We want the ratepayers to be able to feel that the councils are for them and to address 
<br/>their concerns and needs.  These issues or mess have been created by the past government’s wrong 
<br/>decisions and one to undermine the Municipal Councils’ independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the recommendations on the Audit Report on 
<br/>Municipal Councils, as follows – one is on the Ministry of Local Government Special Administrators 
<br/>and Chief Executive Officers, and management  as a matter of priority to  urgently address  all the 
<br/>issues that gave rise to the modified audit opinions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  been  collaborating  with  the  Municipal  Councils  to  ensure  the  issues 
<br/>highlighted by the OAG over the years had been implemented to avoid recurrence of matters in the 
<br/>future audit reports and that CEOs for all the councils have been tasked to have appropriate internal 
<br/>control measures to keep checks and balances on the deficiencies identified.

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>388 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to assist the Municipal Councils to enhance efficiency in their operations, 
<br/>the Ministry has carried out fundamental institutional reforms in the councils.  These reforms are 
<br/>carried out through the review of council policies, manuals and implementing strategies and plans 
<br/>and the recruitment of competent personnel to effectively carry out the functions of the councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of improving the quality and timeliness of financial statements to be given utmost 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>priority, Mr. Speaker, Sir … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Maciu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  …  the  Ministry  acknowledges  the  need  for  the  right-skilled 
<br/>personnel to assist the councils in complying with the legislative provisions as far as the finances of 
<br/>the councils are concerned.  As such, most councils have recruited a manager of finance and filled in 
<br/>the positions in accounts department.  Even some councils are still in their recruitment process of 
<br/>hiring accountants and finance officers with the right qualification and extensive experience which 
<br/>could ensure timely preparation of financial statements and having their accounts audited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  has  modernised  the 
<br/></span><span>organisations structure of the Municipal Councils to be in accordance with the services provided by 
<br/></span><span>the small, medium and large councils.  The Ministry comprehends that the “one size fits all” concept 
<br/>will  not  be  practical  in  this  situation  considering  the  sizes  of  the  Municipal  Councils,  hence  the 
<br/>councils have developed new organisational structures according to services provided by them and 
<br/>position titles at their respective councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new organisation structure and new positions, and the role descriptions will be modified 
<br/>in accordance with the position titles.  As we speak, the new positions have already been advertised 
<br/>by some councils that have amended their organisational structures.  This process will certainly allow 
<br/>the councils to recruit the best candidates for the job.  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the councils 
<br/>have switched to International Financial Reporting Standards or IFRS.  The reports are statements 
<br/>prepared by these councils and aligned to the required international accounting standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the Ministry to consider establishment of robust and capital audit risk and to 
<br/>specifically  look  at  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  financial  reporting  by  Municipal  Councils,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  a  finance  team  that  has  been  carrying  out  internal  audits  of  the 
<br/>Municipal Councils, considering the audit issues  highlighted by the OAG.  All reports have been 
<br/>highlighted and compiled highlighting the issues at the Municipal Councils and the recommendations 
<br/></span><span>to rectify the issues.  These audits by the Ministry of Local Government will enable the councils to 
<br/></span><span>resolve the issues surrounding financial reporting and governance, and internal control deficiencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is proposing to have a full complement of 
<br/>internal auditors that will be tasked to carry out timely audits of the council accounts.  I am hopeful 
<br/>that with this team, the Ministry will be able to resolve almost all the deficiencies and audit findings 
<br/>by the OAG.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, the Ministry is setting an internal audit and customer service unit that will 
<br/>undertake periodical and random audits of Municipal Councils for compliance with processes and 
<br/>procedures.  This  audit  will  also  establish  whether 
<br/>the 
<br/>recommendations from OAG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  councils  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the Ministry to consider employing a pool of qualified accountants who could 
<br/>assist small to medium-sized Municipal Councils, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned earlier, Municipal 
<br/>Councils  have  recruited  qualified  accountants  during  its  recruitments  process.    Furthermore,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Local Government intends to have a team of internal auditors that will assist the councils 
<br/>to  perform  the  accounting  functions  better.    Needless  to  say,  the  councils  are  facing  financial 
<br/>constraints to recruit suitably qualified accountants by virtue of the Local Government Act of 1972.  
<br/>These  councils  could  share  human  resources  services  of  other  financially  stable  councils.    The 
<br/>legislation allows for shared services between two or more councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Formulation of strategic plans and all additional plans including risk management framework 
<br/>and plans for the councils to be given due consideration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Municipal Councils 
<br/>have developed their strategic plans and annual workplans that are aligned to the five-year, 20-year 
<br/>National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  councils  are  prompted  to  adhere  to  the  strategic  plans  and  annual  workplans  which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>certainly determines the efficiency of the councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Maciu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been holding training for the 
<br/></span><span>CEOs, finance teams and HR teams of the Municipal Councils on the manuals.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>consultations have been held with the Municipal Councils, Office of the Solicitor-General and the 
<br/>OAG on the relevant policies.  This process was fundamental to have documents that could contribute 
<br/>towards good governance and efficiency in councils’ services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the Local  Government  and the  management of the  Municipal Councils to 
<br/>ensure that the plans, policies, standards and guidelines are available to all staff and that all municipal 
<br/>staff  are  aware  of  them.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  together  with  the  development  of  the  policies  and 
<br/>guidelines, the Ministry of Local Government has developed a staff policy declaration that needs to 
<br/>be  endorsed  after  officers  of  the  councils  have  read  and  understood  the  various  policies  and 
<br/>guidelines.    The  CEOs  of  the  Municipal  Councils  are  mandated  to  ensure  that  officers  sign  the 
<br/>declaration for record purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry conducts trainings and workshops for the officers 
<br/>of  the  councils  on  the  governance  and  policy  guidelines.  The  discussions  at  the  training  and 
<br/>workshops also evolve around the legislative provisions that are applicable to the operations of the 
<br/>Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  also  working  on  new  policies,  standard 
<br/>operating procedures and guidelines in preparation for the election of new councillors and mayors.  
<br/>This will set the foundation for all Municipal Councils.  In this regard, the Ministry will partner with 
<br/>development  partners, such as the Commonwealth Local  Government  Forum,  to  develop  training 
<br/>programmes for staff and councillors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of maintaining accurate and complete fixed assets records which is vital to ensure 
<br/>the effectiveness of management of property, plant and equipment and accurate financial reporting, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  Municipal  Councils  have  fixed  asset  registers  that  are  updated  in  a  timely 
<br/>manner.  The Councils acknowledge the importance of such registers for accurate financial reporting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the Councils to maintain accurate and updated records and information, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I would like to reiterate that Municipal Councils have strengthened their areas of record 
<br/>management through the implementation of a records register and have ensured that all accounting 
<br/>records are filed in a sequential order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>390 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the monitoring role of the Ministry of Local Government on the operations of 
<br/>Municipal Councils to be strengthened, as alluded to earlier, the Ministry of Local Government has 
<br/>been  coordinating  with  teams  of  Special  Administrators  and  Chief  Executive  Officers  (CEOs) 
<br/>towards strengthening financial accountability.  Regular monitoring of the overall financial services 
<br/>is carried out.  Special Administrators and all CEOs have specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
<br/>to ensure efficiency and accountability in the Municipal Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, also allow me to respond to the general recommendations by the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Public Accounts.  Firstly, on the recommendation for the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government  to  strictly  monitor  the  progress  of  capital  projects  implementation  to  provide  better 
<br/>control  for  future  grant  disbursement  to  municipalities  capital  projects,  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government  has  developed specific KPIs of the  Special Administrators and CEOs to  oversee the 
<br/>implementation of capital projects.  In accordance with budgetary allocation timelines, Councils are 
<br/>also required to comply with the financial policy and grant agreements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government, in ensuring that Municipal Councils adhere to the grant 
<br/>agreement  purposes,  outlines  and  does  thorough  checking  of  grant  expenditures  incurred  by  the 
<br/>Councils. The Councils are also required to submit monthly signed financial reports to the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this financial year, the Ministry is establishing a capital project monitoring team to ensure 
<br/>better control over capital  projects  implementation.   In  addition,  a capital  project  implementation 
<br/>policy will be developed to guide the Councils on the implementation phases of the development 
<br/>projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  from  the  coming  financial  year,  the  Ministry  will  have  an  inhouse  project 
<br/>management expert.  This officer will assess and review all capital projects of Municipal Councils - 
<br/>those that are funded by Councils and the ones funded by Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Committee’s  recommendation  for  the  Ministry  to  place  priority  in  getting  all 
<br/>municipalities audited accounts up to date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government, on 
<br/>a regular basis, monitors financial updates of Municipal Councils.  It is worth noting that the Councils 
<br/>have  been  quite  behind  with  their  financial  statements  previously,  however,  the  Ministry  has 
<br/>collaborated with Councils to ensure that their accounts are updated and submitted to the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General in a timely manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Councils were behind in the compilation of their financial statements for some years and 
<br/></span><span>the  reason  being,  the  requirement  to  upgrade  their  financial  reporting  to  International  Financial 
<br/></span><span>Reporting Standard (IFRS).  This has seen a major shift required in recording and reporting to which 
<br/>the Councils had to adjust.  However, Municipal Councils have improved in the preparation of their 
<br/>financial accounts and working towards improving audit opinions, as well as recruiting officers with 
<br/>the right skills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority of the Councils have updated their financial accounts and submitted a copy to the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General for auditing, thus leaving the Council with the recent updated financial 
<br/>accounts for 2022 is the paradise town of Fiji, the Savusavu Town Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  issue  of  municipalities  to  include  Special  Administrators  and  CEOs  in  terms  of 
<br/>engagement of contracts special criteria or KPIs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned earlier, the 
<br/>Ministry  has  specific  KPIs  for  the  Special  Administrators  where  they  are  required  to  bring  their 
<br/>audited accounts up to date.  Teams of Special Administrators are tasked to set the KPIs for their 
<br/>respective CEOs.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>391 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of municipalities to explore with the Ministry the issue of a standard accounting 
<br/>software for uniformity purposes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government understands 
<br/>the need for a standard accounting software. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nearly  all  the  Councils  have  different  accounting  systems  to  manage  their  books  so  the 
<br/>Ministry is exploring a compatible software that will be suitable for all their Municipal Councils. 
<br/>Having a standard accounting software would mean that officers of the Councils are trained on the 
<br/>use of the software. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  recommendation  by  the  Committee  that  all  Municipal  Councils  should  use 
<br/>Government  grants  only  for  their  intended  purposes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  all  grant  funding,  the 
<br/>Municipal Councils agreement clearly outlines the purpose on  which the  funding to  the Councils 
<br/>should be utilised. Acquittals submitted to the Councils are thoroughly scrutinised by the Finance 
<br/>Team  prior to  releasing  future grants.   The Financial Manual  build by the Ministry also  provides 
<br/>proper guidance to the Councils as to how the Government grants need to be utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  further  implemented  the  grant  checklist  that  provides  the  grant  funding 
<br/>requirements.  The checklist has been circulated to all the Councils on the supporting documents to 
<br/></span><span>be  attached  to  the  payment  vouchers  and  order  for  the  supporting  documents  to  ensure  proper 
<br/></span><span>referencing. These are monitored by the Ministry of Local Government team through the checking 
<br/>of  grant  acquittals,  ensuring  that  all  proper  supporting  documents  are  attached  to  the  payment 
<br/>vouchers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  has  also  implemented  the  financial 
<br/>policy.    It  also  identifies  and  provides  trainings  to  the  Council  staff  on  policies  and  proceeds  to 
<br/>enhance the knowledge and skills for better service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the municipalities to implement stringent disciplinary matters against staff 
<br/>who continue to disregard the due processes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we concede with the recommendation 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.  The Ministry of Local Government has developed 
<br/>a Human Resource Policy that provides the disciplinary processes that need to be followed in such 
<br/>cases.  The Council officers are, time and again, reminded on the due processes in their dealings.  
<br/>Municipal Councils are further guided by the Employment Relations Act 2007 and their collective 
<br/>agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  remind  this  Parliament  that  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/></span><span>Government  conducts  audits  of  Municipal  Councils’  accounts,  taking  into  consideration  their 
<br/></span><span>financial  issues.    A  matrix  of  serious  issues  is  compiled  by  the  Ministry  and  sent  to  Municipal 
<br/>Councils to address those issues and the Councils are required to ensure that there are no recurring 
<br/>matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reiterate that Municipal Councils agree with 
<br/>the  importance  of  institutional  reforms  to  ensure  efficient  service  delivery  -  reforms  in  each 
<br/>institution  and  reforms  in  the  operations  of  the  Councils  to  further  bring  about  transparency  and 
<br/>accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Councils  are  regularly  prompted  to  ensure  that  accountability, 
<br/>transparency and good governance are always maintained in matters pertaining to the administration 
<br/>and operation and the work programme implementation of the Councils.  Sir, I thank you for the 
<br/>opportunity to contribute to the motion.

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>392 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it looks like you have changed the order of the speakers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who were named earlier on, but that is alright. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I speak on the Annual Report, I would like to pay tribute to a citizen 
<br/>of this country, or should I say, an extraordinary citizen of this country, who did much more for the 
<br/>rights  of  disabled  persons  in  this  country.  Sir,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  late  Joshko 
<br/>Wakaniyasi, for his tireless works in the fight for the rights of disabled persons in this country.  Rest 
<br/>in peace, Josh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have gone through this Report, and I have been told that most of the issues 
<br/>have been rectified.  There are some matters that is before the Court and there are some matters that 
<br/>is  before  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption  (FICAC),  which  I  do  not  want  to 
<br/>touch on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would now like to make few opening remarks in relation to Municipal 
<br/>Councils.  The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, in the Review of the 2018-2019 and 2019-
<br/>2020 Audit Reports on Municipal Councils, was presented in Parliament as Parliamentary Paper No. 
<br/>41 of 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts has presented its findings on 
<br/>Municipal Councils on the issues that were raised and also as set in the relevant accepted legislative 
<br/>and legal procedures and requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will let the Report, its findings and outcomes stand on its own.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I would like to make a few relevant comments on the role of the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General  in  relation  to  Municipal  Councils  operations  and  here,  on  my  experience  as  the  former 
<br/>Municipal Administrator with the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was since shared among many Municipal Administrators at that point 
<br/>in  time,  on  the  delays  in  their  work  in  auditing.    This  is  not  due  to  their  reluctance,  but  in  my 
<br/>experience, as I have said earlier on, because of the lack of staffing and especially, since the 1990s, 
<br/>the last turnover in their staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General, according to its legislative mandate is required under the 
<br/>2013 Constitution now to inspect, audit and report to Parliament on all public accounts of the State.  
<br/>Understandably, this is a huge task but one of the results of their inability to spread their service in 
<br/></span><span>their work in regards to the Municipal Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during our time, there were delays from the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>as  well.    They  were  not  auditing  the  Council  books  as  requested  by  Municipal  Councils.    So, 
<br/>definitely, there will be backlog.  We have been hearing about this backlog, but have we found out 
<br/>what were the reasons? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I bring this to the attention of Parliament because of the commentary on the 
<br/>lack of timely reporting of Municipal Councils on their accounts and activities.  This is an important 
<br/>consideration, and I hope the Commission of Inquiry appointed in December 2022 and their findings 
<br/>will lead to a better position for the Office of the Auditor-General to provide timely, accurate and 
<br/>impartial reporting as we move forward. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>393 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Well,  you  can  do  anything  you  want,  I  am  just  trying  to  remind 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament what was done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to extend my remarks on this matter in relation to the recent 
<br/>commentary by the honourable Minister of Finance in relation to funding of Municipal Councils.  
<br/>His assumption that such funding was not available, especially for smaller towns, Sir, I want to put 
<br/>it on record, once again, that the FijiFirst Government between 2014 and 2022 provided record levels 
<br/>of funding to all Councils in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a known fact that the smaller Councils needed that type of support, and it appeared in the 
<br/>Budget  book,  year  in  and  year  out.    Despite  that,  there  was  a  comment  made  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance that now, they have to look for funds to assist the Councils as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these funding levels were designed to ensure that Councils were able to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide all services for ratepayers without resorting to an increase in rates and fees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  extended to  rate waivers, as  well as waivers of fees, such as for all 
<br/>stallholders in our Municipal markets.  The larger capital spending is reflected in the record number 
<br/></span><span>of  improvements  and  public  amenities  provided  across  Fiji.    There  is  a  comment  made  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General in the Report about the Rakiraki Municipal Market, that the tender was given to the 
<br/>same contractor who was supposed to construct the market.  That is not the truth.  That is why I am 
<br/>saying that I do not agree with all that has been said in the Report.  Someone has to go and do the 
<br/>research. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The former Chairman behind you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Now, it is you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The larger capital spending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is reflected, as I have stated earlier on, in the 
<br/>record number of improvements and public amenities provided across Fiji.  It includes large projects, 
<br/>such as the redevelopment of the Churchill Park into a sports complex that now holds international 
<br/>sports, this Albert Park in front of our Parliament complex, and many more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The swimming pool? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The matter is before Court, once it is resolved, then you are supposed to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do it because you are in Government now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the honourable Minister of Finance is such a great waiver of things, 
<br/>currently  deciding  on  the  waiver  of  over  $600  million  of  public  funds  in  TELS  that  benefitted 
<br/>thousands of Fijians and was designed as a sustainable model for ongoing funding in an inclusive 
<br/>and a fair system for future students, I will request the honourable Minister to waive the town areas 
<br/>of all municipalities in this country.  Not only that, but also the stall fees, Sir, so that the poor can be 
<br/>assisted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are just seven days away from the 100 days, and 
<br/>I hope the Honourable Minister of Finance has ample seven days’ time to decide on that so that the 
<br/>poor of this country can be assisted, which they have been preaching…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- You had 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know where the honourable Minister for Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources comes from every time.  We had 16 years, of course, we had eight not 16, I 
<br/>will correct you on that.  But the waiver of stall fees is all there by FijiFirst.  What else do you want 
<br/>to know?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Please, go and do some research.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have stated that 
<br/>I will be very brief, I just want to say that it is not that simple to run Municipal Councils.  Take my 
<br/>word! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They should have elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Whether you have elections or not, it does not matter because during 
<br/>election time, even the Councils get dissolved, honourable Tabuya.  You do not know.  Go and do 
<br/>some research, please.  I am telling you.  Ask your colleague next to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Councils were dissolved, I am telling you, but that is another matter for another day on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why I am saying that it is not that simple because the Municipal 
<br/>Councils, the Administrators and staff, meet all sorts of people everyday in and out, they have to deal 
<br/>with all sorts of problems and for people to come and present this type of reports is not fair on the 
<br/>staff of Municipal Councils.  Today, I want to take this opportunity to thank all… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Tell your Chair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … those hardworking staff of municipalities throughout the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They can come up with reports, but we are here to defend them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Stupid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, as I have started with by saying, “seven days away from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>100 days”, I thank you for this opportunity.

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>395 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  just  want  to  make  a  short  contribution  on  the 
<br/>motion before Parliament.  As a former Member of the Public Accounts Committee, I would like to 
<br/>state  and  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  taking  a  step  forward  in  making 
<br/>commitment to the recommendation that has been made by the Public Accounts Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a first for such a Minister to be making a recommendation, to be stating proactive actions 
<br/>that  relates  to  issues  that  have  been  highlighted,  discussed  and  placed  in  the  report  of  the  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee of which you, Mr. Speaker, was also a Member at one time.   I see that two 
<br/>Members of the Opposition who were Members of the Public Accounts Committee, and they were 
<br/>part of this report, would fully agree that the discrepancies that were noted during the discussions of 
<br/>the  Public  Accounts  Committee  reflects  to  the  lack  of  support  that  was  given  by  the  previous 
<br/>Ministers for Local Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I thank the current Minister, who has even stated that this cause 
<br/></span><span>of actions by stating that his Ministry has prepared a matrix to address the discrepancies that has been 
<br/></span><span>noted in the Report, and I thank him for that, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, just on the short commentaries on the issues that have been raised from the other side 
<br/>regarding the backlog, it is unfortunate that the former Minister continues to blame the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Your record? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It has been corrected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have always highlighted that the responsibility of the Auditor-General is not to prepare 
<br/>the accounts of municipalities, it is the personnel that have been hired - from the Chief Executive 
<br/>Officer to the Finance Manager and every other officer within the municipalities who are responsible 
<br/>for the preparation of the accounts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Auditor-General has been blamed and the Auditor-
<br/>General, as you would have been aware that in some of the discussions, they have been put under 
<br/></span><span>unnecessary pressure … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- … because the accounts that have been submitted to their officers 
<br/>for auditing are not according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  That is why 
<br/>they  have  always  been  sent  back  to  municipalities  to  prepare.    They  are  trying  to  tell  the 
<br/>municipalities to prepare financial statements fully in compliance with the IFRS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the record, the decision for municipalities to adopt IFRS is not 
<br/>something that was discussed at the municipal level, I think the former Minister would also agree to 
<br/>it, that this has also placed unnecessary costs … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Don’t force me, Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>396 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- … to the municipalities to try and adopt to the changes at their 
<br/>own cost.  This has also led to the delay because of the policies that were implemented at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I commend the current Minister for the work he has done in terms of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trying to address the anomalies that have been highlighted in the Auditor-General’s Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  issues  regarding  the  performance  of  CEOs  as  has  been 
<br/>recommended,  their  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPIs),  the  submission  of  up-to-date  financial 
<br/>statements, and not only that, the intention was to ensure that the Annual Report of the Municipalities 
<br/>be submitted on time as part of the KPIs for the CEOs and staff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank the honourable Minister for adhering to  institutional  reform  and re-organisation 
<br/>structure that has been alluded to, to ensure that the operations of the municipalities are brought up 
<br/>to  par and up to  standard, so that they can confirm to  the Coalition Government’s intentions and 
<br/>objectives of accountability, Mr. Speaker. Sir. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament and I would like to thank other speakers who have spoken on this motion.  I would also 
<br/></span><span>like to thank the Public Accounts Committee Members for their thorough work in capturing the list 
<br/></span><span>of issues arising from the Municipal Council Report that turn into recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  noted  that  there  are  eight  recommendations  made  by  the  Public 
<br/>Accounts  Committee.  Some  of  these  recommendations  have  been  implemented,  considering  the 
<br/>Annual Reports are rather old.  One has to read the Verbatim Report to understand the progress made 
<br/>on the recommendation which is attached as Appendix.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  lied  by  giving  credit  to  the  new 
<br/>Minister.  In fact, if you read the Verbatim Report prepared in 2022, it talks about all the work that 
<br/>was done prior.  So, at least, the honourable Minister for Local Government acknowledged the work 
<br/>that was done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Unfortunately, the honourable Minister for Education is in the habit 
<br/>of lying, so he tried to lie in this Parliament but he is caught out.  One has to read the verbatim report, 
<br/>you will see it all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Very bad, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the former Minister for Local Government, I can 
<br/>assure Parliament that these recommendations are taken very seriously by Municipal Council and the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government. They take genuine steps to rectify these issues so that these matters 
<br/>are not raised again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, as we have also heard from the honourable Minister for Local Government, size do 
<br/>matter.  Large municipalities can afford to have qualified people to provide that level of assistance, 
<br/>but then they are very small municipalities with barely 200 ratepayers, and with 200 ratepayers, with 
<br/>no other source of income, it becomes extremely hard for them to have qualified people to assist 
<br/>them.  So, in that case, we had introduced shared services which the honourable Minister has spoken 
<br/>on, where HR services, financial services and project management services can be used by smaller 
<br/>municipalities by just talking to the larger municipalities.  So shared services are already in the plan.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to highlight that the staff of the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/>and the Permanent Secretary have worked extremely hard to come up with Financial Manual, HR 
<br/>Manual and SOPs just to help Municipal Councils, because they did not have the skills, and a lot of 
<br/>trainings  went  into  it.    For  example,  CEOs  Forum  is  being  held  regularly  where  all  CEOs  come 
<br/>together and discuss the good things they have done, the difficulties they are facing, the challenges 
<br/>they can see ahead of them and how they can collectively handle the situation.  Again, trainings are 
<br/>also provided by CIU to the Project Implementation Unit within the municipalities so that they can 
<br/>learn how projects can be managed and reported, et cetera.  So, they have been doing all these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to mention that, yes, there has been a backlog of financial statements 
<br/>as well as annual reports, but now the Ministry of Local Government has set in place the monitoring 
<br/>system.  They have even created a data book, I do not know whether the honourable Minister has 
<br/>seen that or not.  We have created a data book just to see how different fees and charges are being 
<br/>charged by different municipalities, so you can track at the same time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along with that monitoring system that we had introduced, they also monitor annual reports 
<br/>and  financials.  So,  the  monitoring  team  on  a  regular  basis  communicate  with  the  Special 
<br/>Administrators and CEOs asking them to submit those reports.  Even the team at the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Local Government go out to municipalities assisting them in financial aspects of things when they 
<br/></span><span>are stuck.  I recall the Ministry of Local Government also prepared Charts of Account for consistency 
<br/>so that reporting can be consistent.  All these work has taken place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for uniformity in the preparation of financial statements across 13 Municipal 
<br/>Councils, the councils were recommended to use Zero Accounting Software and the trainings were 
<br/>also provided to the financial management team in each municipality.  A lot of work has gone into 
<br/>municipalities.  Cases related to mismanagement of funds or abuse of office were reported to FICAC 
<br/>for investigation.  Also, independent investigations were carried out on matters highlighted by the 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Report in the case of the Rakiraki Municipal Market.  So, all that have taken place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  has  put  in  a  lot  of  governance  structure, 
<br/>starting from the Special Administrators, right down to the teams that deliver.  This is being done to 
<br/>ensure that accountability, transparency and ratepayers’ money and the money that is given by the 
<br/>Government is used appropriately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I would like to thank the staff of Ministry of Local Government, CEOs and Special 
<br/>Administrators for the work they had done over a period of time, and I will encourage them to give 
<br/></span><span>their full support to the new honourable Minister who will take it to the next level, so I look forward 
<br/></span><span>to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the motion  that was raised by honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau, I think when he was speaking, he did not mean to say that Chairman of the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee should be from the Opposition side, he simply meant was that the chairmanship 
<br/>could be any Member from the Government side, not the honourable Minister for Finance; that is all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/>for the Report and also thank all the honourable Members who have spoken before me.  It would not 
<br/>be too off the rail if I start by saying that the management of the towns and city councils in the last 
<br/>15 to 16 years has resulted in another mess that we are dealing with as a new Government, amongst 
<br/>the many that they have left us to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, there are a number of things that we have to deal with.  One is the rate arears.  
<br/>Rate and rental collection, I understand is a historical issue, but I think over the last so many years, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>398 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and also exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rental arears is huge now.  It is almost $62.2 
<br/>million including, if you add interest portion of $2.4 million as at December 2022, and majority of 
<br/>the default ratepayers are residential owners.  These are people who could afford to pay.  The capacity 
<br/>of the Municipal Councils to deliver on their mandated roles and responsibilities has become a major 
<br/>concern due to the current financial state of the city and town councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I may not also be off the mark to say that the Municipal Councils over the 
<br/>years have not managed their funds well, nor have they implemented successful rate collection and 
<br/>strategies.  That is very clear from the arears that we see.  What the new Government is obviously 
<br/>looking at and the honourable Minister alluded to that is  that we will be putting in strategies and 
<br/>controls so that there is sustainability in terms of the financial situation of local Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is kind of hilarious listening to the two former Ministers.  A bit of sensible contribution that 
<br/>came from the other side was from honourable Maharaj, and he rightfully talked about the legacy of 
<br/>annual reports.  No matter how much they justify, when they were in government, they had one of 
<br/>the worst records of getting annual reports on time and the backlog was just huge.  This is one of the 
<br/>reasons precisely that we are dealing with their mess and backlog in PAC and we have to deal with 
<br/>it for maybe another few years, before we come to deal with this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  point,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  talked  about  and  it  is  very  important,  this 
<br/>Government led by the honourable Prime Minister has already made that decision that we are going 
<br/>to restore elected councils.  All the justification, Sir, after the 2006 </span><span>coup</span><span> and I know honourable Bala 
<br/>was  saying  he  was  eight  years  but  actually  he  was  there  for  16  years.    He  continued  as  an 
<br/>Administrator appointed by the Military Government.  So, he was there for 16 years running.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I was not in Government for 16 years.  I want to make it very clear, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want this to be on record that I was in government for the last eight years; as simple as that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Quote the Standing Order, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A point of clarification, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What I am asking is, you quote the Standing Order.  What Standing Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have you.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a clarification that I am putting, like what used to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happen in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, all I was saying that he was involved in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>management of Municipal Councils for the last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Where is the proof? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last municipal election was held, as you 
<br/>know, in 2005 and for 16 years one of the reasons why we have had such problems from the financial 
<br/>side and the management of councils was direct interference by those who were in government for 
<br/>the last 16 years.  I do not blame the workers; I blame those who were running the affairs of town 
<br/>and city councils.   I remember, and he needs to be reminded and you will recall as well, Sir, in 2014  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when he became Minister, I think he was sitting somewhere there as Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And you were sitting there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He promised the whole country that he was going to hold local 
<br/>government  elections  then  he  continued  with  the  review  for  four  years  and  then  comes  another 
<br/>Minister who also said we are reviewing the Act.  So, for eight years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they reviewed 
<br/>the Act because they never had the intension of holding an election because they were enjoying the 
<br/>interference, enjoying appointing Administrators, enjoying CEOs, politicising and there were many 
<br/>examples of corrupt practices and nepotism that occurred in that system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So many lies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They need to reflect in this a little bit, now that they are sitting 
<br/>in the Opposition and I see and hear the honourable Member who got sworn in today still bragging 
<br/>about it the fact is that they are sitting in Opposition.  They should reflect on some of the actions that 
<br/></span><span>they took when they were in government and that relates to the town and city councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  heavy  reliance  on  Government  funding,  basically  what  has  happened  is  because  they 
<br/>were interfering, because they wanted to control everything, because they wanted to please everyone 
<br/>and because they wanted to win the two elections they went on a rampage and made sure… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Standing Order 60(1) and that reads, “When speaking, members must 
<br/>confine their observations to the subject under consideration.”  Please, ask the honourable Member 
<br/>to confine himself to the subject matter in consideration.  Stop making comparisons about before, get 
<br/>on with the job, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all we are asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Again,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is  hilarious coming from  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Member.  I am still talking about the Municipal Council elections because we are looking 
<br/></span><span>at the Report which was done as part of what they did before and we are talking about elections and 
<br/>I am also responding to what they have been saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are not talking about the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The other point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about the delay in getting 
<br/>the  Annual  Reports  and  Financial  Statements,  again  they  are  blaming  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-
<br/>General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When they were in government, they did everything, let alone 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General. They tried to interfere in every independent institution, and he has

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>400 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the audacity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to come again and blame OAG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Just like what you are doing now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  They  attacked  the  Auditor-General  in  Parliament,  they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attacked the OAG and  they appointed a Commission of Inquiry in November 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- For his own good.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- One year, they did not produce a report, so stop talking about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Auditor-General’s Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Hey, not to me! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is coming from Members who were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Government. They attacked and they were all sitting here like ducks and cheering the man.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in your own words a little bit of leeway every now and 
<br/></span><span>then is fine, but I have raised it and I will raise it again.  In accordance with the Standing Orders, 
<br/></span><span>please ask the honourable Member to stay relevant.  Absolutely as irrelevant as irrelevant can be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honestly I cannot understand what the Point 
<br/>of Order was for.    I am talking about the municipal council elections, I am talking about the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report and the honourable Member talked about it.  I am responding to him.  I do not know 
<br/>what he is talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also respond to honourable Bala.  He said that he wants to thank 
<br/>all the hardworking staff of the town and city council but let me just remind him, from 2016, the 
<br/>workers in the Suva City Council did not manage to negotiate anything, nor any pay rise or any of 
<br/>the conditions that was deteriorating.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.- Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this Government the unions are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now having a good negotiation led by, he knows who, Mr. Attar Singh…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Tell them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So you will give them a pay rise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which has decided 
<br/>that the unions, the employers and government will work together to ensure that the workers in this 
<br/>country receive justice and we are reversing all the injustices that was done under their government; 
<br/>we are doing that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, announced that the retirement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>age of the municipal workers, once the appropriate legislation is put in place, will be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and again they are responsible.  You look 
<br/>at some of the capital projects and honourable Bala and honourable Kumar knows.  Either you talk 
<br/>about  Lautoka  Swimming  Pool,  whether  you  talk  about  Ba  Stadium,  whether  you  talk  about  the 
<br/>completion of Govind Park, whether you talk about markets, it is all blocked and locked by them.  
<br/>We, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have landed with the responsibility of clearing that mess and, Sir, I will let 
<br/>them laugh a little bit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he knows.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know why 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Member is getting agitated, because he knows what happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What happened? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And he was involved in it.  He has a lot to explain, and we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will come to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I know why the honourable Member is getting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agitated because he knows what happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What happened?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- $5 lamb chops.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He was involved in it and he, Mr. Speaker, has a lot to explain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am going to.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023                Review Report – Municipal Councils 2018-2020 Audit Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>402 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He has a lot to explain and we will come to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, come.  Most welcome. I am here to face you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the important thing for us to understand out of 
<br/>this  Report  and  the  legacy  that  they  left  us  is  that  we  need  to  streamline  all  the  processes  –  the 
<br/>financial processes … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … funding to the town and city councils and only when we 
<br/>are  able  to  do  that  properly,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  will  bring  the  services  back,  that  the  people,  the 
<br/>ratepayers need in this country in the town and city councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  been  talking  about  ease  of  doing  business,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  one  of  the  biggest 
<br/>bottlenecks is the efficiency within the Municipal Councils, apart from many others.  So again, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, that is another mess that we have to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  going  forward  as  the  honourable  Minister  pointed  out  very  clearly  that  the 
<br/>Government has announced that we will hold municipal elections and the honourable Minister also 
<br/>pointed out that the work is being done to review the appropriate laws, the appropriate processes and 
<br/>procedures and once that is in place and that is the commitment that the Government has made and 
<br/>that will happen.   I want to tell the people of this country, all the ratepayers, all those people living 
<br/>towns and cities that as soon as the Government is ready, they will have an opportunity … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Waive the rates!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … to hold the elections.  We are going to give back elected 
<br/>councils to the people of this country and that is when we expect accountability and responsibility to 
<br/>return and services in the way that people deserve in towns and city councils will be restored.  Once 
<br/>again, I want to thank the Chairman and honourable Members of the Committee for the Report before 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch and 
<br/></span><span>we will continue with the debate and the right of reply when we resume, and that is when the bell is 
<br/></span><span>sounded.  Parliament is adjourned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.33 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – ACCF 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>403 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.31 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I wish to advise the Opposition not to 
<br/>worry so much about the chairing of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), even though I am in the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance.  In fact, it should be better, as I will not only chair a Parliamentary Committee 
<br/>which looks after checks and balances, but also ensure that finance responsibility and accountability 
<br/>processes and systems across all Ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, is improved as the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance is the one that will consolidate all the Ministries’ financial affairs, accounts and 
<br/>even budget at the end of the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were a lot of issues that were raised today and I wish to thank the 
<br/>current Minister for Local Government for being proactive with his reply, even though the reports 
<br/>were  two  to  three  years  old  and  were  under  two  different  Ministers  before  him.  But  one  thing  is 
<br/>certain, Sir, we all agree that there is a need for a major improvement at all Municipal Councils and 
<br/>at Ministry level, and how they keep, operate and report their financial affairs, and also how they 
<br/>keep their books.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all honourable Members who have contributed to the debate 
<br/></span><span>and am looking forward to those Municipal Councils to improve their overall performance and, most 
<br/></span><span>importantly, in the implementation of the recommendations by the OAG and the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are few outstanding issues that were raised  - Some are in the courts and some with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FICAC and they will be looked into deeply by the Committee in the next report to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those final comments, on my right of reply, I wish to thank you, Sir, for giving me this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
