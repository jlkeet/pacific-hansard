<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<div><span>BACKGROUND 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the last Parliamentary Sitting on Monday 27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 the Assistant Minister for Housing 
<br/>and  Local  Government  Hon  Lenora  Qereqeretabua  asked  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and 
<br/>Immigration, Hon Pio TIKODUADUA for </span><span>the rate of return of RFMF Annual Reports for the period 
<br/>January  2005  to  16  September  2021  as  per  legal  requirementjs  then  and now,  for  tabling  in 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reasons for brief. </span><span>This brief is written to provide Honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua a response to 
<br/>her question in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has noted the past request for the tabling of the RFMF's Annual Report in Parliament 
<br/>and as the Minister responsible for the Forces, I wish to highlight in this August House that I will 
<br/>endeavour to have the RFMF reports table during my term of office. I acknowledge that the delay in 
<br/>the  submission  of  the  reports  was  change  in  leadership  and  staff  rotation  within  the  headquarters 
<br/>attributed in the hold up in the compilation  of the reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently my Ministry has received the Annual Report for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 which will be 
<br/>tabled to Cabinet. The RFMF is in the process of retrieving and collating the annual reports from 
<br/>2005 to 2018. Given the massive task to compile the reports from this period, I have been given the 
<br/>assurance by the Commander of the RFMF that these Annual reports will be submitted and tabled to 
<br/>a later date.
