<div><span>ADMINISTRATION OF OATH/AFFIRMATION OF ALLEGIANCE 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Virendra Lal subscribed to the Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance  
<br/>and took his seat in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Congratulations, honourable Member.  Welcome once again to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I wish you well in this new term of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Honourable Members, I now invite honourable Lal to deliver his Maiden Speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. V. Lal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  colleagues,  those 
<br/>present in the gallery and viewers; it is, indeed, an honour for me to be sitting in this Parliament and 
<br/>delivering my Maiden Speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I would like to thank the Almighty for blessing and allowing me to reach this far.  
<br/>I would also like to thank my family, especially my wife - Veeneta, my father - Mr. Jawahir Lal and 
<br/>my late mother who must be smiling from above.  My children were always there for me when I 
<br/>needed them, thank you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How can I forget my friends, neighbours and relatives for their support during my campaign.  
<br/>Thank you very much to all those who voted for me.  Without your votes, I would not have been 
<br/>here.  I also thank each and everyone of you within Fiji and abroad from the bottom of my heart for 
<br/>supporting me during my campaign, and I look forward for your continued support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to assure all those listening that I will 
<br/>do my level best to serve all Fijians.  As a Member of the Opposition, I know that our job is to see 
<br/>that things are done in the correct way with dignity and respect for the betterment of our people and 
<br/>the  beloved  nation  by  keeping  Government  in  check.    We  are  committed  to  ensuring  that  the 
<br/>Constitution is adhered to, that the rule of law prevails and that there is no discrimination against any

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any Fijian, because we all deserve equal opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst holds a significant number of seats in this Parliament.  In fact, it 
<br/>has the largest number of seats, and it says a lot about the expectation of FijiFirst supporters.  The 
<br/>former Prime Minister and the Leader of FijiFirst, Frank Bainimarama, single-handedly registered 
<br/>136,829 votes.  That showed the popularity of our Party Leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  despite  receiving  the  largest  number  of  votes,  he  has  been  suspended  from 
<br/>Parliament under controversial circumstances.  He still is the Leader of our Party and now, in fact, 
<br/>he has become more popular, and so has the FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have heard a number of times in the news media that 57.45 percent of 
<br/>those  who  voted,  voted  against  FijiFirst.    This  is  true,  but  people  seem  to  forget  that  the  largest 
<br/>percentage of people voted for us, 42.55 percent.  Three other Parties in Parliament had to combine 
<br/>together to form a government, whereas FijiFirst has formed that past two governments on its own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2022 General Elections, 35.82 percent people voted for People’s Alliance, the second 
<br/>largest party in Parliament and 64.18 percent voted against them.  Only 8.89 percent of voters voted 
<br/></span><span>for NFP, and 91.11 percent voted against them, and SODELPA received only 5.14 percent of the 
<br/></span><span>votes,  whereas  94.86  percent  of  the  voters  voted  against  them.    Out  of  all  the  political  parties  in 
<br/>Parliament, FijiFirst received the highest percentage of votes and the lowest percentage of people 
<br/>voted against it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason I am giving out these figures is for the people to see the full picture rather than 
<br/>receiving selected and incomplete information.  Some politicians are giving only selected information 
<br/>to  suite  their  agenda.    We  were  receiving  similar  sort  of  misinformation  almost  throughout  the 
<br/>duration of the last Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although this is my second term in Parliament, I would like to give a brief 
<br/>introduction of myself.  I am originally from Madhvani, Rakiraki.  I am a son of a sugarcane farmer. 
<br/>My father is 83 years old and stays with me in Valelevu.  I attended Madhvani Indian School and 
<br/>Penang Sangam High School in Rakiraki.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After tertiary education, I taught at Penang Sangam High School for five years before moving 
<br/>to Nasinu in 1993.  For more than two decades, I worked in the mainstream media as a reporter, news 
<br/>editor and programmes director.  I also operated a shop in Valelevu for 10 years before being sworn 
<br/></span><span>in as a Member of Parliament in the last Government, and I worked as a Senior Information Officer 
<br/></span><span>at the Department of Information in the Ministry of Communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per my community service, I served as the National Secretary of Shree Sanatan Dharam 
<br/>Pratindhi  Sabha  of  Fiji,  the  largest  organisation  of  Hindus  in  Fiji.    I  also  served  as  the  National 
<br/>Secretary of the Hindi Parishad Fiji, which consists of all the major Hindu faith-based organisations 
<br/>in Fiji.  I am also the pioneer secretary of the Vatuwaqa Funeral Rites Facility that was built by the 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am married to Veneeta and we have three daughters, two of whom are married.  I am also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>blessed with a grandson - Raghav.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a staunch Hindu, a Sanatan follower but I also believe in the religion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of humanity.  Bhagwaan Shree Satya Sai Baba once said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>373 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If you are a Hindu - become a good Hindu.  If you are a Muslim - become a good 
<br/>Muslim and if you are a Christian - become a good Christian but become a good human 
<br/>being and follow the religion of humanity.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after all, we are all God’s children.  His Excellency the President in  his 
<br/>Address spoke about uniting the people of Fiji however, here we have a government whose supporters 
<br/>are making indecent gestures in front of the FijiFirst office and taking pictures and many are now 
<br/>resorting to making racist and discriminatory comments on almost a daily basis on social media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what examples are we setting for our future generations?  Is this the change 
<br/>people wanted?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was emotionally disturbed when it was said that Fiji is being 
<br/>changed to a secular state since 2013 and thus has been the cause of morale deterioration among our 
<br/>children over the years.   This  is a lie!  In fact,  a secular state allows its citizens to  carry out  their 
<br/>prayers and religious activities in their own ways without any interference from the Government and 
<br/>I have no idea how this has caused the morale deterioration among our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  who  seek  to  divide  us,  those  who  seek  political  gain  from  this  discord  and 
<br/>disagreement, those who make false promises are not leaders.  Leaders bring us together, leaders put 
<br/></span><span>the interest of the nation before their own and speak the truth. We need decisive leadership that brings 
<br/></span><span>us together, that has a plan and that does not risk our future and that is the legacy of FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  supreme  law  dictates  that  no  religion  should  be  given  preference  in 
<br/>official proceedings in Fiji in any way, shape or form. Yet, right from the start of his Maiden Speech, 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General took it upon himself to pepper his comments with references to 
<br/>Christianity and Jesus Christ. His first words in Parliament should have been directed at the Speaker, 
<br/>that is what is laid down as the proper conduct of any Member of Parliament  but the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General started off with a quote from the Bible before he proceeded to the formal start of 
<br/>his speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was a clear breach of parliamentary procedure and the fact that it came from the chief legal 
<br/>officer  of  the  State  is  extremely  disturbing.  There  are  laws  that  a  great  many  people  do  not  like, 
<br/>whether it is the laws on the use of </span><span>marijuana</span><span> or the Public Order Act that prevents spontaneous 
<br/>demonstrations, but the law is the law and until any law is altered by the proper process, every citizen 
<br/>is obliged to comply with it including honourable Siromi Turaga on the constitutional requirement 
<br/>of a secular state.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  people  have  a  right  to  expect  that  our  politicians  conduct  themselves  in 
<br/></span><span>Parliament in measured tones and with measured decorum, keeping emotional outburst to a minimum 
<br/>and setting an example for the rest of the nation of moderation and judgment. But to the astonishment 
<br/>of  much  of  the  watching  public,  honourable  Siromi  Turaga  adopted  the  pose  of  a  fundamentalist 
<br/>preacher.  It came across as a sermon, not a maiden speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, a lot has been said in Parliament about government debt and His Excellency 
<br/>also raised this in his Address. Sir, Fiji’s debt is at sustainable levels. This has been confirmed by 
<br/>credible international institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian 
<br/>Development Bank (ADB), ANZ Bank and other international credit rating agencies. Fiji’s debt to 
<br/>GDP ratio was on a declining trend since 2009 and reached around 43 percent pre-</span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The large reconstruction spending after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> increased the debt ratio, however, it was 
<br/>still below 50 percent  of GDP.  After the COVID-19 crisis,  the increase in  borrowings and large 
<br/>contraction of GDP led the debt to GDP ratio increasing over 80 percent. Every single country in the 
<br/>world  has  increased  its  debt  post-COVID.  Had  the  FijiFirst  Government  not  borrowed  during 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19,  the  economy  would  have  collapsed,  we  would  have  had  a  large  devaluation,  social 
<br/>challenges  would  have  increased  as  price  levels  would  have  skyrocketed.  Through  our  decisive 
<br/>leadership and the various hard measures, we came out of the COVID-19 crisis successfully. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it has also been said in Parliament that a lot of people are living below the 
<br/>poverty  line.  Extreme  poverty  is  almost  non-existent  in  Fiji.  The  World  Bank  defines  “extreme 
<br/>poverty” as a person living on less than $1.90 per day.  Poverty rate stood at 24.1 percent as per the 
<br/>2019-2020 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). This is one of the lowest levels of 
<br/>poverty ever registered in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2002-2003 Fiji’s poverty rate was 35 percent, 2008-2009 it was 31 percent, 2013-2014 it 
<br/>was 28 percent and 2019-2020 poverty rate was 24.1 percent. Based on current population estimates, 
<br/>it is clear that under the FijiFirst Government, almost 100,000 Fijians have been lifted out of poverty.  
<br/>For nearly a decade, FijiFirst has created jobs, supported our tourism sector, kept our families safe, 
<br/>expanded our roads, continued to bring telecommunications, electricity and drinkable water to more 
<br/>neighbourhoods and homes, improved our schools and hospitals, upgraded our roads and built new 
<br/>ones, protected our natural resources and took steps to make us more resilient against climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, on education, FijiFirst believes education is not a privilege for a few, but a 
<br/></span><span>right for the many. Our party spurred an education revolution based on merit that has empowered 
<br/>people of all backgrounds, from all ethnicities, from all provinces and from all walks of life including 
<br/>young  women  and  men  alike.  We  believed  that  our  government  had  an  obligation  to  create 
<br/>opportunities to make sure that young children benefit from early childhood to primary to secondary 
<br/>education  and  that  young  adults  can  build  their  skills  and  chase  their  dreams  through  advanced 
<br/>education at universities and technical schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  looking  at  the  current  government’s  indecision  in  regards  to  TELS,  a  lot  of  tertiary 
<br/>students  are  uncertain  about  their  future.  We  know  that  in  order  to  fulfil  its  unrealistic  election 
<br/>promise,  the  uneven  three-legged  Government  is  planning  to  write  off  TELS  and  replace  it  with 
<br/>scholarships but at what cost?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  here  are  the  hard  facts.    Under  FijiFirst,  almost  9,000  tertiary  students 
<br/>annually benefitted from TELS and Toppers schemes. This delusional Government says it will write-
<br/>off  all  past  TELS  loans  and  going  forward  will  replace  it  with  scholarships.  However,  this 
<br/>Government is deliberately not telling the Fijian public if the entire almost 9,000 tertiary students 
<br/>will all be given scholarships or not. Surely after writing off TELS worth around $800 million, this 
<br/></span><span>Government will not have enough money to pay for 800 scholarships every year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Do not worry about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Maybe they will print some money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reality  is  that,  only  some  of  the  800  annual  tertiary  students  will  be 
<br/>eligible for scholarships. The question also arises as to how these handful of scholarships be awarded. 
<br/>Will the scholarships be based on ethnic lines, religious lines, provincial lines or based on who you 
<br/>know?  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>375 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The most important question, Mr. Speaker is, what will happen to the thousands of tertiary 
<br/>students every year who will miss out on the scholarships? Where will they get the money to educate 
<br/>themselves? Which bank will give them a loan? How many of their parents will dig into their FNPF 
<br/>funds, if they have any?  The bitter truth is that because of this Government's silly and unrealistic 
<br/>promises, thousands of Fijian students will lose out on getting tertiary qualifications for as long as 
<br/>this Government is in power.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, Fiji is a young, vibrant and an educationally-motivated nation.  More than 65 percent of 
<br/>Fijians are under the age of 35.  As our young people pursue advanced higher educational studies, 
<br/>we need realistic promises and not promises that mislead our future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Who wrote your speech?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  give  some  facts  about  the  Fijian 
<br/>economy.  Fiji recorded its strongest period of post-independence economic growth in the decade 
<br/>leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Fijian economy registered its nine years of consecutive 
<br/>economic growth … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- … from 2010 to 2018 underpinned by rising productivity, increased public 
<br/>sector investment in infrastructure development, growing private sector activity supported by high 
<br/>business confidence and overall political and economic stability.  This was one of the longest periods 
<br/>of sustained economic growth in Fiji which led to major improvements in job creations, infrastructure 
<br/>development,  improved  access  to  better  public  services,  more  income  generating  opportunities, 
<br/>increased asset and wealth accumulation by Fijians and significant advancement in the overall living 
<br/>standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this period, our GDP doubled from $6 billion to almost $12 billion at the end of 2019.  
<br/>Sir, GDP per capita or income per person on average increased from around $6,600 to over $13,000 
<br/></span><span>per person.  Foreign reserves increased to over $3.6 billion compared to just around $500 million in 
<br/></span><span>2006.  This is the highest level of reserves in our history and reflects the strong balance of payment 
<br/>position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquidity levels in the financial sector increased to over $2.5 billion.  However, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, following this period of economic boom, Fiji had three years of consecutive economic decline 
<br/>induced by the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following the marginal contraction of 0.9 percent in 2019 underpinned by the slowing global 
<br/>economy, the Fijian economy recorded its largest contraction of 17 percent in 2020 and 5.1 percent 
<br/>in 2021.  This was completely beyond our control, but we did everything possible to minimise the 
<br/>impact  on  our  people  by  paying  close  to  $500  million  in  unemployment  support  and  other  relief 
<br/>measures.  We also ensured that other initiatives designed prior to the pandemic to support Fijians 
<br/>continued, despite the large decline in tax revenues.  This included continuation of all social welfare 
<br/>payments, free education, water and electricity subsidies, transportation assistance, tertiary education 
<br/>support, civil service salaries and provision of all other public services.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minutes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government stood firm to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic and 
<br/>laid the foundation for a fast and strong economic rebound with a focus to get people back to work.  
<br/>We managed to access the vaccines on time and rolled out one of the world’s fastest vaccination 
<br/>drives.  We supported our national airline - Fiji Airways with a government guarantee to keep it afloat 
<br/>as we recognised the vital role the airline plays in getting tourists to our shores.  We worked with 
<br/>development partners to access large budget support grants and concessional loans to beef up foreign 
<br/>exchange reserves to avoid a devaluation and drying up of liquidity in the banking sector that would 
<br/>have induced a sharp increase in interest rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  then,  the  economy  has  been  recovering  much  faster  than  expected.    Whether  it  has 
<br/>continued to recover or not, it will be revealed in the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s Quarterly Report that 
<br/>will be due next month.  There were forecasts that the 2022 economic growth would be around 15.6 
<br/>percent and Fiji was one of the fastest recovering economies in the world.  The tourism industry is 
<br/>again booming, economic prospects have improved and there is a lot of optimism.  However, all this 
<br/>is only possible with decisive and visionary leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  a  leadership  that  guarantees  stability,  equality, 
<br/>security  and  equal  opportunities  for  all  Fijians.    As  the  former  Prime  Minister  and  the  leader  of 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst Frank Bainimarama has always said, “no one should be left behind”.  Some Government 
<br/></span><span>Members in their Maiden Speeches have said change is here.  We, on this side of Parliament, believe 
<br/>that we were the change that made Fiji stronger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Real change means believing in each other, working together and helping 
<br/>each other.  Real change means real plans for our future.  Real change guarantees stability, certainty 
<br/>and equality, and this is what FijiFirst gave.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly thank you for the opportunity and look 
<br/>forward to your guidance.  I once again would like to thank each and every one of you listening in 
<br/>and all those who supported me.  May God guide us and bless us all, and may God bless our beloved 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Member.    At  the  same  time,  I  would  like  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>apologise to you in not readily having the lectern prepared since you made your speech.
