<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 
<br/>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament and the people of Fiji.  In my last assignment as a Minister of the government, I called upon 
<br/>the two Permanent Secretaries that I had the honour to work with to always be fearless in giving me 
<br/>advice, even if they knew I might not like it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fearless advice is needed to progress anything.  Fearless advice that tells it as it is and I am 
<br/></span><span>glad that they did that for me.  I will continue to serve in Parliament by offering my expertise, my 
<br/></span><span>collaboration, bipartisanship where this is warranted but also by providing that necessary fearless 
<br/>advice and highlighting opportunities for improvement. That is what I am here for and that is what I 
<br/>intend to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Monday, the honourable Prime Minister moved his motion to thank His Excellency for 
<br/>his most gracious Address.  Implicit in that motion is the notion that Government will carry out the 
<br/>things  that His  Excellency said  would be done or should be done.  Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir in  his 
<br/>Address last year, His Excellency called for a number of things to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  will  be  a  Special  Parliamentary  Committee  on  the  Sugar  Sector.  This  never 
<br/>happened.  The  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  showed  his  utmost  disrespect  for  His 
<br/>Excellency by not making sure that that Committee sat; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The role of District Advisory Councillors would be elected.  What happened?

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The Government decided to appoint the District Advisory Councillors 
<br/>and  most    of  them,  if  not  all,  were  supporters  of  one  party.  This  is  absolute  disrespect  for  His 
<br/>Excellency the President, the Head of State of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- His Excellency called upon the Government to ensure consultation in 
<br/>all  legislative  matters  and  to  take  such  matters  to  the  Standing  Committees.    Once  again,  the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  blatantly  disrespected  the  words  of  His  Excellency.  In  your  face 
<br/>disrespect, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In relation to imputing improper motives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of that, Sir,…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Which Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- These are facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Standing Order 62(1). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, let me look into that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  Standing  Order  62(1),  the  honourable  Usamate  as  I  listened  is  just 
<br/></span><span>quoting from what was said in this august Parliament by the honourable Minister for Sugar and a few 
<br/></span><span>others. So, he is just quoting from what was being said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further to that he is also highlighting that nothing has been done. Maybe in reply to that then 
<br/>we provide an opportunity to go into that or probably the honourable Prime Minister in his Right of 
<br/>Reply.    So,  I  will  allow  him  to  continue,  honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau.    The  floor  is  yours, 
<br/>honourable Usamate and could you just keep the tone of your voice down? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Who are you fighting with? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  As  I  was  saying,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  have  lost  my  page,  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General showed complete disrespect for His Excellency the President.  Only 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>307 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>once,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  a  matter  taken  to  the  Committee  after  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  asked  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  change  the  stance  on  the  Heritage  Bill.  Only 
<br/>once, not at his instigation on our request with the honourable Prime Minister’s intervention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, advised us that the Cooperatives Act will be reviewed and 
<br/>improved;  not  done.  The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Kamikamica  who  is  responsible  for 
<br/>Cooperatives and always love shouting at the top of his voice, “16 years, 16, years, 16 years” has 
<br/>shown that he has … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, it is a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- …shown that he has completely ignored His Excellency’s Address for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the last 15 months; complete disrespect for His Excellency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Vocea, he called for Members of Parliaments to 
<br/>be displined for not going to the invitation by His Excellency at the Opening of Parliament. That was 
<br/>an invitation!  What this Government has done is to draft the Speech for His Excellency the President, 
<br/>get  him  to  read  it,  then  completely  ignored  it.  That  is  the  height  of  disrespect,  they  are  utterly 
<br/>shameful. You took his words and threw it away into the gutter, you did that to our Head of State.
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA. – Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Point of Order, Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.  -  Honourable  Usamate,  as  usual,  is  quite  entertaining.  
<br/>Standing Order 60 - Relevance. The object of our debate is to debate His Excellency’s Speech this 
<br/>year.  I urge him to look forward.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Thank you, my Ruling on that is, honourable Usamate, once more, is just 
<br/>quoting from what was said in this august Parliament.  Therefore, I ask that you continue, honourable 
<br/>Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. - Good try, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.  –  That  was  a good one, the honourable Member who keeps talking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the last 16 years is telling me to look forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My request to the Government, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, do not 
<br/>treat his Speech this year with disrespect, do not do that. Repent of that.  Shed that cloak of hypocrisy 
<br/>that has become such a fundamental part of your everyday dress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- His Excellency has called upon us to represent the diverse voices and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aspirations of our people.  I absolutely endorse that, we must treat all Fijians equally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.–  We  must  eliminate  elitism,  favouritism  and  bias,  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compartmentalization.  that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what FijiFirst stands for.  Precisely what we stand 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>308 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I want to tell the Government and the people of Fiji, five ways that 
<br/>you  can  do  this.    First  one,  everyone  in  this  country  aspires  to  be  treated  equally.    We  aspire  to 
<br/>recognition; we aspire to belonginess.  How do we do this?  We call everyone a Fijian to give them 
<br/>that sense of belonging. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Will this Government do that?  Will it meet that aspiration through a 
<br/>simple  step  of  love,  grace  and  togetherness?    This  does  not  take  away  anything  from  any  of  the 
<br/>communities in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Yes,  Point  of  Order.    Can  we  have  that  Point  of  Order,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Usamate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker  ,Sir,  Standing  Order  62(4)(d).    For  some 
<br/>reason, Sir, the other side of Parliament seems to be suggesting that this side of Parliament is trying 
<br/>to divide the country.  That is what his suggestion is implying.  I absolutely condemn that suggestion, 
<br/>Sir.  It is absolutely hogwash for him to suggest that this side of Parliament is trying to split up the 
<br/>people of Fiji.  It is absolutely nonsense!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have heard what honourable Vosarogo said yesterday about land and the need to unify 
<br/>this country.  please, to the Opposition grow up and stop trying to suggest that we are trying to bring 
<br/>disunity into this country. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- The truth hurts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me rule on that, honourable Usamate, may I caution you, please, focus on what you are 
<br/></span><span>supposed to be delivering based on His Excellency’s Address or the honourable Prime Minister’s 
<br/>motion.    That  is  all  I  ask.    So,  we  confine  ourselves  to  that  and  that  will  not  attract  any  kind  of 
<br/>criticism that we are trying to go into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are very good at that, honourable Usamate, being an experienced debater.  But, again, 
<br/>you are very quick on your feet to jump back when you know you are verging into certain areas that 
<br/>you should not be going into.  I implore upon you, let us focus on the Speech made by His Excellency 
<br/>the President or to that effect the motion by the honourable Prime Minister based on that Speech.  
<br/></span><span>You may continue, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second suggestion that I would have in terms of His Excellency’s calling 
<br/>us to represent the diverse voices and aspirations of our people, is to note that all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners 
<br/>are equally </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, they own land communally. They have an equal right to the land, they should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>share that lease money equally.  Why should we give more lease money to those who already have 
<br/>more?  That is a way that you meet the aspirations of all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners equally.  Why should 
<br/>those  who  have  more  stature,  more  resources,  to  those  who  are  fitted  by  the  people  be  treated 
<br/>differently?  They should be treated equally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third way that we can meet what His Excellency has talked about is look after our young 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners, who also have their own aspirations.  Keep the lease money that is in trust for 
<br/>them, for them, not for anyone else, not for </span><span>Tutu </span><span>or </span><span>Momo </span><span>or of </span><span>Ratu, </span><span>but for them because the young 
<br/>also have their own aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth way that I would suggest that we can meet the call by His Excellency to meet the 
<br/>diverse  voices  and  aspirations  of  our  people  is  that  ordinary  people  aspire  to  eat,  drink  and  have 
<br/>shelter everyday, to have some respect from the challenges of everyday living.  But this Government, 
<br/>in its policies, have driven the cost of living to astronomical heights, to brutal heights even, Sir.  Not 
<br/>only that, but the Government has also increased company taxation rates for our struggling domestic 
<br/>companies.  Instead of paying 20 percent, now they are paying 25 percent.  They are now struggling 
<br/>even more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  poorest  in  our  society  also  have  their  aspirations,  our  small  local 
<br/>companies also have their aspirations, so do not strangle them, honourable Deputy Prime Minister!  
<br/>Do not shackle them!  Let them breath, let them live, let them loose to fly and to soar and to meet 
<br/>their dreams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know what made it worse.  As this Government made life tough for ordinary Fijians and 
<br/>struggling businesses, Government gave a tax rebate to one of the richest multi-national companies 
<br/>operating in Fiji, while also cutting the taxation rates for those earning the highest salaries in this 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point Of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Allow me, Sir, to look at the Standing Order.  Sir, apart from 
<br/>Standing Order 60 which is Relevance, I also cite Standing Order 74(1)(a) which talks about breaches 
<br/></span><span>of Standing Orders and practices of Parliament, and I am focusing on practices of Parliament here 
<br/></span><span>with regard to misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have on two occasions explained to that side of Parliament that the tax 
<br/>incentives that were issued by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance last 
<br/>year, there was nothing evil about it. It was a restructure of taxation, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- That is your opinion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is not my opinion, it is the opinion of the Fiji Revenue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Customs Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we explained here very simply, and this is what we always worry about - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they talk about things they do not know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>310 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, let me explain once more and hopefully, this will be the last time I stand to discuss this.  
<br/>There was a restructure of the taxation for the water industry.  All companies and even companies 
<br/>that come into the water industry after this will be tax free.  But in order to sort of allow that, what 
<br/>we have done is adjust the water tax so that the water tax covers for any differential.  We are getting 
<br/>more revenue now than before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe they need a calculator so that we can explain very simply of what is 
<br/>happening.  First, under Standing Order 74(1)(a) - misleading Parliament, because we have one clash 
<br/>now on two occasions already and I have advised them professionally of what has been happening.  
<br/>Second  is  relevance  because  the  point  that  he  is  making  is  irrelevant  because  we  have  already 
<br/>explained its relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I urge  honourable Usamate, stick to  things that he knows and secondly, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please let us be factual. We can take your fire here, no problem, but let us be factual. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is a fact, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Koroilavesau. I have not ruled on that yet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to stand on Standing Order 
<br/>60. Sir, the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister is just interfering with  the flow or the delivery of 
<br/>honourable Usamate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Please, I have already stated to the honourable Speaker. He 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the Speaker, not you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Koroilavesau.  Honourable  Members,  this  is 
<br/>political debate that is ongoing in this august Parliament and that is the politics of it. They will try 
<br/>and take the wind out of your sails to derail your train of thought. So, now, honourable Usamate, who 
<br/>is on the floor has been sitting for a couple of minutes now. The wind of sail probably has missed the 
<br/>boat that honourable Usamate is the captain of, so that is pure debate.  It is for and against.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We used to do this during our time in the Opposition, trying to derail the train of thought but, 
<br/>again, honourable Usamate, may I, once again, humbly ask you to, please, focus on what you have 
<br/></span><span>prepared for your response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> affairs, if you want to highlight issues there, maybe you just go and visit the 
<br/>honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs because sitting here as a traditional leader as well, it is hard 
<br/>for me to comprehend all that has been said. Otherwise, I will have to take it within my stride, just 
<br/>have a very thick skin to let it go by and then we can talk it over again when the time is right. So, 
<br/>honourable Usamate, I kindly ask you just concentrate on your speech proper and that is all. Thank 
<br/>you. I have ruled on that one honourable Tuisawau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a Point of Order on a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>serious matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  On Standing Order 62(4)(d), provoking ill feelings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>311 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, he had mentioned the distribution of leases and mentioned the words, “why 
<br/>should the Ratu benefit more than other members and the young members”, to the effect, provoking 
<br/>the revolution of the non-Ratus against the Ratus. That is basically what he is trying to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUIWASAU.- Provoking ill feelings between the heads of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> and 
<br/>the </span><span>yavusa </span><span>and their members. That is basically the effect of those words, and he should withdraw 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  was  what  has  been  happening  in  the  FijiFirst  rule  for  the  last  16  years  -  instigating 
<br/>members of </span><span>mataqali</span><span> and </span><span>yavusa</span><span> against their heads.  That is basically what they are doing, and that 
<br/>is basically communism. They better take that back. Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Tuisawau. My ruling on your Point of Order, is that 
<br/>I have never heard honourable Usamate mentioned “Ratu” and the “non-Ratu”. He was just speaking 
<br/>in general, and that is how we address things here. You only have to highlight issues in such a way, 
<br/>now you have got wind of what he was intending to say, but he never uttered those words. Honourable 
<br/>Usamate, please, continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  I  am  not  surprised  that  the  honorable  Member  tried  to  put  up  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular spill on my very clear words and what I was saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance tells us that inflation 
<br/>has been decreasing, but he knows that the basket of goods that are used to calculate inflation is out 
<br/>of date, so the measure that they use are out of date.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are reviewing it now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, but it is currently out of date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2022, the World Bank reported that the poverty rate in Fiji was 24.1 percent, this was when 
<br/>COVID-19 was at its peak. The current Deputy Prime Minister then questioned that report.  He said, 
<br/>“Oh, it is 50 percent.”  He questioned the report of the World Bank, and he always love to pull figures 
<br/>out of thin air. Nowadays, he happily quotes the figures and reports from the the World Bank,  IFC, 
<br/>and the like. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given  what  he has done to  the brutal  cost  of living,  there is  a very high 
<br/>probability that the poverty rate is now approaching the 50 percent that he was talking about at that 
<br/>particular point in time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker.  Sir,  His  Excellency  called  us  to  embrace  with  resolve  the  principles  of 
<br/>democracy and humanity.  To embrace means to take it upon yourself, to cherish it and to keep it 
<br/>close.  Resolve means to never give it up.  What are those principles of democracy?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The principle is that we rule by the people, for the people, for all the people, not just some of 
<br/></span><span>the people – that we do not rule for self-interest, that we do not just rule just to satisfy the whims of 
<br/>our political cronies, that we do not give them positions to keep them happy, as has been endemic in

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cronies of those in power.  An utter disgrace!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Humanity is about caring for people.  On Monday the honorable Kirpal expressed his concern 
<br/>about something that might be happening, that might impact on some people that are using land for 
<br/>generations. I thank the honorable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts.  Thank 
<br/>you, Sir, for your explanation on the process that is being undertaken and his assurance that both, the 
<br/>tenants’ issues and those of traditional landowners would be looked into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, what was shocking to me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was that honourable Kiran tried to tell 
<br/>honourable Kirpal off because he was concerned for humanity. Does she and this Government not 
<br/>have a concern for farmers who fear losing the land that they have lived on for generations? Who 
<br/>have the fear of losing their livelihoods? They need to be able to focus on the issue at hand and not 
<br/>to put a spin on it, like what honorable Tuisawau just tried to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency called for investment into infrastructure, and I totally agree. 
<br/>This zero-infrastructure Government needs to take heed of those words. All they have done this year 
<br/>is to commission ongoing FijiFirst projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  FijiFirst  investment  in  infrastructure  is  unmatched  in  the  annals  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>history of this country… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- …unmatched schools, bridges, roads, hospitals, jetties, airports, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did it all!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- One of the reasons that Fiji is recovering so quickly now is because of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the investment we put in, and you are reaping the benefits of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Tuisawau mentioned a  few things he 
<br/></span><span>made some accusations about.  He said, “unheard governance issues, lack of accountability, lack of 
<br/></span><span>transparency” - if he has evidence of that, he needs to put it on the table, he needs to show the evidence 
<br/>of what he is talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He had talked about the audit report, we have not seen it.  Let us see it.  Let us see what issues 
<br/>are in that report, and I am suspicious of the validity of that report because the CEO’s contract was 
<br/>terminated even before the audit had commenced and that questions the creditability of that report 
<br/>because the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) had their own credibility for not questioning issues 
<br/>that had been raised in audits before that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuisawau has questioned Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) prior to his taking over.  
<br/>He needs to remember that all the bridge openings that have been taking place were things that had 
<br/>been done for the past 15 months and was from the NDP that we had initiated by Fiji First. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>313 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- All those projects are listed there.  So, as you go commissioning those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>projects, remember those are all FijiFirst projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The Pothole Reduction Programme is in that NDP, there is nothing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is the Government’s job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  In  the  last  two  years  of  the  FijiFirst  Government,  more  than  800 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kilometres of sealed roads were rehabilitated in just two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This was in addition to the full (not partial) routine maintenance of the 
<br/>entire Fiji FRA Road Network.  In your 15 months in office, you have only 15 months, 24 months, 
<br/>24 months is 800 kilometres.  Your 15 months, 300 kilometres.  The 800 kilometres: 300 kilometres, 
<br/>big difference - </span><span>tamani duidui rau</span><span>, big </span><span>duidui</span><span> there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> You  have  talked  about  feasibility  studies  not  being  carried  out  under  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, the FRA was delivering projects on the basis of the NDP. When you have the people 
<br/>in FRA that have the capacity, you do not always need to do feasibility studies because you can do it 
<br/>during the design phase of projects because there are people there who can do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I could go on and on, on all the things that he said.  He talked about the 
<br/>Queen Elizabeth Drive, he said that this Drive should have been done at $10 million per kilometre.  
<br/>He said that we did it at $15 million, that it should be done at $10 million. If you do it at $10 million, 
<br/>you  will  not  be  able  to  build  that  bridge.  Have  you  seen  that  new  bridge?    Have  you  seen  the 
<br/>realignment of the road?  Have you seen the lifting of the elevation of the road to bring resilience 
<br/>into the infrastructure because if you want to do it at $10 million, you will just have a small gravel 
<br/>road, following the contours of the bridge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have to be realistic with what you talk about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He said the Toga Bridge was delayed because the people of Toga did not support FijiFirst.  
<br/>Absolute hogwash!  Their tender has been given years ago to a local company of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> engineers.  
<br/>They were given the tender for Naseyani Bridge in Ra and this one, but they could not complete the 
<br/>job.  Then FRA had to retender the job.  So, do not come into Parliament and tell lies to the people.  
<br/>Tell the truth!  People expect the truth in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor, very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Minister says that water from Viria is flowing now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will refer honourable Usamate to Standing Order 74(1)(a).

<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I know he is flying rather well but I ask the question why he used “</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> company” when he 
<br/>spoke just now.  He said “</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> company”, what is the relevance of an i</span><span>Taukei</span><span> company?  He could 
<br/>have just said, “company”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, again, I really urge the other side to stop creating ill-
<br/>will in this country.  The people of Fiji are watching what they are doing, Sir. Please, focus on issues, 
<br/>just say, “company”.  Why identify the company? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, I urge the other side of Parliament to grow up, let us 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talk about issues and not label things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You stop gagging us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are all Fijians. If they want to know, from this side of 
<br/>Parliament, we are all Fijians.  We are all here to stay and work together.  So, please, make that 
<br/>certain remark is not acceptable.  I urge honourable Usamate to withdraw his statement.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we have been debating for quite some time now.  
<br/>When there is an instant reaction on either side to what has been said, you are slowly falling into the 
<br/>trap  that  has  been  set  by  you  divulging  your  views  altogether  without  allowing  the  other  side  to 
<br/>continue so that you can get a full picture of what they have stated.  They just kind of picking on 
<br/>issues now, and I think we are above that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us continue to play that role.  For Government, there is always a never-ending criticism 
<br/>from the Opposition, honourable Members, never ending.  For the Opposition, you just have to state 
<br/>your facts quite clean.  Everything should be based on facts, not so much on hearsay.  That is all I 
<br/>ask.  Honourable Usamate, please, continue and take the request from the Government side, they are 
<br/>urging you to just continue and stop heavily criticising the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is the way I see it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- They can’t take it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- They can take it, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  But they either take 
<br/>it  sitting  down  or  otherwise  there  will  be  stop  starting  stop  starting  our  debate  with  this  kind  of 
<br/>attitude.  It will be a never ending one from this side as well.  Point of Order, Point of Order!  Please, 
<br/>continue, honourable Usamate.  Where are we in terms of time, Madam Secretary-General?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of 
<br/>the Prime Minister stated that they were bringing water into Mataniborosisi on the outskirts on Suva, 
<br/>and I thank them for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who said that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>315 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Assistant Minister Tubuna.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The suggestion was that we did not do anything about it, but he needs to look at what actually 
<br/>happened there.  I actually went there myself.  I walked there, and I talked to the people there, it was 
<br/>the landowners who put the stop to it.  I think because they wanted to use that land for something 
<br/>else.  So sometimes when you say something in this Parliament, I hope it was not selective reporting 
<br/>or intentional amnesia; I hope not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is a landowner too for your information, honourable Usamate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the comments have been made about honourable Minister Tuisawau on the Queen 
<br/>Elizabeth Drive, for me it shows a bit of the minuteness of the vision of this Government’s vision.  
<br/>National leadership must be about State building.  It is about building a modern nation.  The Queen 
<br/>Elizabeth Drive is something about doing that.  If you look outside this building, you will see Albert 
<br/>Park, you will see that the grandstand has been moved from this side to that side, you will see the 
<br/>quality of the turf that we had put in that park, and the GPH has been done.  When we did that, the 
<br/>whole phase of Suva changed.  People who come into this country see a new, modern Fiji. When 
<br/>people go along Queen Elizabeth Drive, they will see the modern Fiji.  You must have the kind of 
<br/>vision that projects a modern growing Fiji, and I remind honourable Tuisawau to think like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Members  of  this  Government  used  to  allege  all  kinds  of  conspiracies.    Waqavuka 
<br/>conspiracy,  honourable  Tuisawau  was  right  at  the  forefront  of  that.    What  happened  to  that 
<br/>conspiracy?    Just  nothing,  nada,  there  was  nothing  there.        There  was  conspiracy  about  Walesi; 
<br/>nothing has happened. Honourable Tuisawau recently said that the FijiFirst Government had done 
<br/>nothing  about  converting  Schedule  A  land  and  Schedule  B  land  to  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.    He  said  that  in  his 
<br/></span><span>Facebook</span><span> post.  A complete lie!  By 2019, 93 percent of Schedule A land that was to be converted 
<br/>to  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land  had  already  been  done.    Schedule  B  land  by  2019,  87  percent  had  already  been 
<br/>converted.  So, we see here a history of saying things that are not based on truth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Figments of one’s imagination, shaken out, taken out to be the absolute 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>truth in all the things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President advised that this Coalition Government has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>restored the confidence of our development partners in Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I apologise to His Excellency, but I disagree with his statement.  Under 
<br/>FijiFirst, Fiji’s reputation was established globally.  We took on climate change leadership role, we 
<br/>took  on  the  co-presidency  with  Sweden  of  the  first  World  Ocean  Conference,  we  took  General 
<br/>Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA), COP-23 Presidency and Presidency of the G77+ China, 
<br/></span><span>we established a global reputation of how we handled COVID-19. Countries came here to learn and 
<br/></span><span>asked us what we did so that they could go and replicate it themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  During  our  watch,  the  </span><span>Vuvale</span><span>  partnership  was  established  with 
<br/>Australia, and the </span><span>Duavata</span><span> with New Zealand.  Under the firm leadership of Mr. Bainimarama, we

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moved away from subservience to our development partners, we worked with them on our own terms.  
<br/>We did not kowtow or bend backwards for anyone.  We put our own needs as a priority, whatever 
<br/>they be.  We put Fijians first and they came to us on our terms because we had backbone.  Learn that 
<br/>word.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  shared  his  views  on  the 
<br/>Prime  Minister’s  proposed  Ocean  of  Peace  approach.  I,  however,  find  it  rather  strange  if  not 
<br/>bemusing that the honourable Prime Minister calls for Ocean of Peace and then the Government of 
<br/>Fiji then takes the side of one party in a conflict halfway round the world in the Gaza Strip. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there had been more than 30,000 deaths in Gaza and 
<br/>1,200 of course died in that Hamas incursion into Israel.  The killing and death in Gaza is continuing 
<br/>as I speak right now. Most of those killed in Gaza are women and children.  Women like our wives 
<br/>and our daughters, children like our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, round off, honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister  calls  for  Ocean  of  Peace  and  then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supports thousands of deaths in Gaza. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Brutal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the golden rule is to do unto others as you would 
<br/>have them do to you. Would this Government want some other country to march into Fiji and kill 
<br/>30,000 of our people?  To kill our women and children in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Where  is  Christ  in  this  stance?  Is  this  Government  advocating  for 
<br/>Ocean of Peace and deaths in the sands, buildings, hospitals and refugee camps in Gaza?  That is the 
<br/>question I pose.  There must be congruence in our national policies.  If we support peace, then we 
<br/>support peace at all times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Civil Service Day.  His Excellency has advised us that Civil Service Day 
<br/>will  return  this  year  to  celebrate  the  contribution  of  civil  servants;  very  good.    We  listen  to  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  talking  about  that  fantastic  nurse  on  Cicia 
<br/>Island who delivered the twins, those are the kind of people that we have in the Civil Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember as Minister for Health during </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, there was one nurse who could not get 
<br/>to her home in time, I think she spent the night in the forest and the next day she started delivering 
<br/>service to the people around Tailevu North.  I will never forget that.  And we have lots of people like 
<br/></span><span>that  in  the  civil  service.    The  civil  service  is  replete  with  people  such  as  this,  people  worthy  of 
<br/></span><span>celebration.  However, this Government is one that has abused the civil service. It got rid of career 
<br/>professionals  and  put  in  place  party  lackeys  and  cronies  in  their  place.    It  has  undermined  the 
<br/>independence of the civil service as a body that is apolitical.  It has politicized the civil service.  It is 
<br/>tearing the civil service to shreds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I humbly ask you to resume your seat since you ran

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, I acknowledge the presence of our school children here with us this morning 
<br/>and I hope they do not believe that adults talk like this normally or debate like this normally.  This is 
<br/>Parliament where we are allowed to exchange our views under the chairmanship and the rulership of 
<br/>the honourable Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise this morning to give my right of reply as the mover of this motion 
<br/>before  Parliament.    Once  again,  I  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  on  behalf  of  this  august 
<br/>assembly for His Address in Opening Parliament on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  Regardless of what 
<br/>and  how  we  said  it,  we  all  agreed  with  His  Excellency  that  honourable  Members  must  exercise 
<br/>national leadership that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>instils confidence; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>advances unity, equality and harmony; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>embraces diversity; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>promotes prosperity in all our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No matter how we said it, how loud we said it, that was all we agree we should be trying to do in 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency emphasised the importance of representing the voters of this land, the voices 
<br/>of all the people even those who had not attained the voting age. We are representing their voices, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We must respect their views and debate sensibly and promote advocacy and uphold 
<br/>the principles of democracy.  It is pleasing to note that the majority of the honourable Members have 
<br/>expressed their support and embraced His Excellency the President’s advice.  I assure our honourable 
<br/>colleagues  in  the  Opposition  that  their  constructive  suggestions  and  recommendations  will  be 
<br/>considered by Government as we move forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate’s point about the sugar industry and the elections, may 
<br/>I remind him that the Opposition at that time had proposed that, and we will get to it. I got word from 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Sugar this morning, he might have read your speech before he came to 
<br/>me this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His point about all Fijians, yes, we agree but I also remind us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that some 
<br/></span><span>Fijians are original landowners, freehold landowners, lessees and lessors, some people live in rural 
<br/>areas and maritime islands and the Government had made a commitment to look after all our citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- However, it was sad to note that some honourable Members continue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to deliver political rhetoric and statements, perhaps somewhat short of facts, logic and substance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliamentary debates, Sir, should be evidence-based, supported by facts  and figures from 
<br/></span><span>credible sources rather than the social media or rumours.  I am sure there are many sources available 
<br/>to us. We just have to exercise more caution to find out which really is the credible source.  I am 
<br/>confident that as we move forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can build bridges and address challenges 
<br/>facing the nation in the spirit of promoting national unity and communal harmony.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I saw the students sitting here this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reminded to just say 
<br/>some words of encouragement to the parents of those. These beautiful looking children, during the 
<br/>debate we heard mentioned of the ills of society of today. We heard about the woes still felt in the 
<br/>rural areas that have no roads or not good roads, shipping and all those other facilities that we now 
<br/>complain about.  If I was to ask the honourable Members, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put their hand up if 
<br/>they grew up in a maritime island and went to school where there was no road.  I am sure many of 
<br/>us would put our hands up.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we mentioned these areas to encourage those in those areas 
<br/>to continue to look after their children.  I walked almost one whole day to get to the road when I was 
<br/>going to Bucalevu and if we were fortunate when we got to the road, we could catch a ride from one 
<br/>of those PWD trucks that were building the Savusavu to Buca Bay Road at that time.  There were no 
<br/>proper jetties to get across to Taveuni from the Vanua Levu side.  We had to go by </span><span>velovelo </span><span>or those 
<br/>little punts to take us to the boats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to encourage all of us to encourage those who are coming through those difficult 
<br/>areas and times to soldier on, look after our children so that we do not have the problems that we 
<br/>have raised during this debate about street dwellers, poverty and school dropouts.  I remember, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that you were talking about school dropouts during the </span><span>Soqosoqo Vakavulewa ni Taukei 
<br/></span><span>(SVT) time and the Minister for Education and Assistant Minister were talking about what to do with 
<br/>school dropouts? After about an hour of talks, they realized that I had not said anything.  They said, 
<br/>“Prime Minister, you have not said anything.”  I asked them, “who is a school dropouts?”  They said, 
<br/>“those that do not complete the school system.”  “What is the complete school system?”  I asked.  
<br/>“Go  on  to  university  or  what  do  you  think?”    I  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  “we  make  them  prime 
<br/>ministers.”  It is not how far you go in the school, your parents support and your own determination, 
<br/>that determines your destiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On governance, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I reiterate and  believe that faith, mutual  respect  for one 
<br/>another and diversity are what makes our nation strong.  If we respect and appreciate each other’s 
<br/>different views, we will surely find a common ground towards achieving our common goals for the 
<br/>betterment of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  owe  it  to  the  future  generations  to  do  that  collectively.    This  is  the  essence  of  our 
<br/>democracy, and this is the essence of parliamentary debate - the battle of ideas from which out of 
<br/>which comes the best solution to our challenges.  The formulation of policies through consultations 
<br/>with all stakeholders will create an environment of inclusiveness, ownership and confidence which I 
<br/></span><span>will continue to champion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  People’s  Coalition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  not  afraid  to  admit  our  weaknesses  and  we 
<br/>acknowledge the mistakes that we have made. We are willing to take on board the views expressed 
<br/>by any member of the society and all honourable Members of Parliament, and we will take those on 
<br/>and act accordingly.  The Government will continue to encourage the free exchange of ideas and 
<br/>criticisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, only this week we received a request from an honourable Member of the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition about the plight of a lady teacher in  the West.  I am glad that the honourable Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister and Minister for Education came back the following day to say that her problem had 
<br/>been solved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we must all recognise that freedom of speech also as we express ourselves, comes 
<br/>with responsibility. Concerns have been raised by some honourable Members on the propensity of 
<br/>racial vilification on social media – very good solution to that is do not read social media, but I have

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a page.  I can challenge anyone to challenge me on any vilification that appears on my page. Let me 
<br/>assure  the  honourable  Members  and  the  public  that  the  Government  takes  very  seriously  those 
<br/>allegations and there are laws on cyber bullying and ongoing investigations by relevant authorities 
<br/>on a number of cases also are ongoing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  individuals  we  must  all  exercise  restraint  and  maturity  becoming  of  a  Member  of  the 
<br/>Parliament of Fiji.  We must also recognise that the standard of debates in Parliament sets the tone 
<br/>of debates across the nation, among the people in their interaction in person and online.  That is why 
<br/>I caution the young students to take this and use it in their own classrooms or in their villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Authorities must continue to monitor online communications that may incite communal or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>religious antagonism and enforce the relevant law accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Issues relating  to  the Constitution,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir, I  wish  to  reassure the nation that the 
<br/>Coalition Government will continue to abide by the Constitution and the rule of law.  Responding to 
<br/>calls  for  review  of  the  Constitution  does  not  mean  that  the  Government  disrespects  the  process 
<br/>required for the amendment of our Constitution as laid out in the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the Constitution empowers Cabinet to refer a question of law to the Supreme Court 
<br/>under section 91(5) for clarification of a particular section of the Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>Government has come under fire on some of the issues raised by Government from the appointment 
<br/>and we have asked that the Supreme Court will rule on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Finance has ably responded to the debate on the economy, I wish to highlight a number of key 
<br/>points which I believe the Opposition may need to take onboard.  There has been some discussion 
<br/>on the increasing price of goods and services due to inflation, but we must all appreciate that most of 
<br/>the inflation is actually imported, as a former learned Attorney-General had stated many times during 
<br/>his term as the Minister for Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He added to inflation by increasing VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I will the check the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily Hansard</span><span> to find out about this.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  the  Government’s  effort  to  cushion  the  impacts  of  information  is  through 
<br/>budgetary measures to support the most vulnerable in our society through the removal of VAT on 
<br/></span><span>basic food items and medicines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also increased social protection allowances and directed resources to the agriculture 
<br/>sector to ensure food security. Only this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a member of the Government 
<br/>Caucus raised the issue of Kava Bars remaining open longer than the alcohol bars and urging us to 
<br/>speak to our electorates and encourage people to plant more because a lot are not going back because 
<br/>they have been at the bar until the morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Leader of the Opposition in 2020, I recall urging the former Minister for Economy that 
<br/></span><span>it is important to appreciate that Fiji will continue to face certain challenges and constraints due to 
<br/></span><span>our vulnerability and narrow-based economy.  Despite claims of growth, prosperity and boom in the 
<br/>past decade, our average annual economic growth rate barely exceeded 3 percent, well below the 
<br/>average growth rate of 4.3 percent during the Alliance and the SVT days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the so-called boom failed to substantially improve income levels and the quality of 
<br/>life for the majority of our people.  Figures provided by the Bureau of Statistics and our development

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partners  confirm  that  Fiji’s  economic  performance  was  dismal.  Despite  the  favourable  trading 
<br/>environment since 2017, economic growth was stagnant because the economy continued to be driven 
<br/>by consumption with low levels on investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on this premise, development partners, including the IMF, continuously reminded the 
<br/>then Minister of Economy to consolidate Government finances because of economic headwinds.  If 
<br/>you check the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, you will know that I said all these words when I was on that side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  that  advice,  the  previous  Government  continued  to  take  an 
<br/>expansionary approach, focusing on consumption rather than investment.  Government borrowing 
<br/>was directed to consumption rather than investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we have inherited high national debt and limited fiscal space, we will continue the past 
<br/>practices  of  inconsistent  policies  which  provide  low  or  no  return  on  investment.    Honourable 
<br/>Opposition Members did not consider these facts when pointing fingers at Government in terms of 
<br/>how the economy has fared in our first year in office.  They must understand that there is always a 
<br/>lag period before an impact is felt in the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the claim by honourable Koya (who is on the phone) that FijiFirst left us a 
<br/>booming economy, is not true.  What they left us is a debt burden of almost 100 percent of GDP, 
<br/>despite the fact of high liquidity in the market, which was around $600 million annually.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, investors were reluctant to borrow and played the 
<br/>wait and see game.  The lack of confidence due to the inconsistency of policies, poor law and order 
<br/>situation, human rights violations and our low ratings on the ease of doing business ranking are what 
<br/>the Coalition Government has inherited.  This resulted in the lack of employment opportunities and 
<br/>the hardships faced by our citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Why are you lying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am optimistic that the $3 billion investment in the 
<br/></span><span>pipeline  will  be  realised  because  there  is  a  renewed  confidence  in  the  economy  with  more 
<br/>transparency, certainty and consistency of policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Foreign  Affairs,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  detailed  response  by  honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua regarding our Foreign Policy and the reasons for our travels abroad, the Opposition 
<br/>continues to imply that overseas travel is a waste of Government resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to clarify that as Head of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs, travel was 
<br/></span><span>necessary to restore trust and respect in the region and internationally.  For us in the Pacific, humility 
<br/></span><span>is the key to the art of diplomacy.  The previous practice of boasting about punching above our weight 
<br/>and leapfrogging, did not reflect the Pacific way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Ocean of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I respect the views expressed by the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and by honourable Usamate.  But the rules-based international order that 
<br/>provided stability for so long is now under threat, so we need to promote peace.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposal is consistent with the UN Charter and the UN Secretary-General’s New Agenda 
<br/>for Peace.  Regionally, the concept is consistent with the </span><span>Boe Declaration on Regional Security</span><span> and 
<br/>the </span><span>2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent</span><span> which the honourable Leader of the Opposition was 
<br/>instrumental  in.  This  proposal  aims  to  restore  the  strategic  equilibrium.  It  also  provides  an 
<br/>opportunity for our partners to engage with the peaceful norms of the Pacific as an Ocean of Peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On ICJ, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there continues to be wilful misunderstanding of the Government’s 
<br/>submission to the International Court of Justice, on the occupied territories in the West Bank and 
<br/>Gaza Strip.  We have heard mention of the security of our own peacekeepers in the Middle East.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Alliance  Government  committed  Fiji  to  peacekeeping,  they 
<br/>realised we were going to a very risky situation, and we continue to do that, regardless of what we 
<br/>do at this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reassure this august Parliament that we stand for sovereignty of nation 
<br/>States, the principles of non-aggression and non-interference in the domestic affairs of States and the 
<br/>resolution of conflict by peaceful means according to Chapter VI of the UN Charter. We will continue 
<br/>to uphold the integrity of multilateral institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On climate change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must respond collectively to this great challenge. 
<br/>And I call on us all to reach across, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition had done by going 
<br/>with us to COP28.  We will continue to reach across the floor for bipartisan discussions and also 
<br/>participation in the international forum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  reiterate  that  merit  is  the  underlying  requirement  for  all 
<br/>appointments to the Foreign Service, Municipal Councils and Boards of State-Owned Entities. A lot 
<br/>of those appointments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were not made by the Ministers. They were made by various 
<br/>machinery in the Civil Service, also with the boards and councils, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  assure  Parliament  that  all  Heads  of 
<br/>Missions  appointed  met  the  requirements  for  the  positions  and  the  selections  were  made  by 
<br/>appropriate authorities and boards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the honourable lady Member of the Opposition that 
<br/>Government  does  not  interfere  in  the  appointment  of  CEOs  of  public  enterprises,  and  these  are 
<br/>decisions left to the respective Boards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Order, order!. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I wish to reiterate His Excellency 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the President’s reminder that we focus on our commonalities, rather than our differences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA. – </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.– And to end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call on all honourable Members to 
<br/>take that message to heart, as we work together to build a stronger nation, with social cohesion and 
<br/>unity of purpose for this generation that is coming up.  May God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on the motion.
