<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s final sitting for the week.  I understand it has 
<br/>been a hectic one.  We had some very healthy exchanges, I hope you will utilise all the time available 
<br/>to  you  when  given  these  two  opportunities  to  speak;  one  is  the  Opening  of  Parliament  by  His 
<br/>Excellency the President and the second one is on the Budget, which is coming up in the horizon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  welcome  those  joining  us  in  the  gallery  and  those  watching  the  proceedings  on 
<br/>television and the internet.  Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament.
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Students - Nasinu Gospel Primary School 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been given to understand that there is a school - Years 7 and 8 students from Nasinu 
<br/>Gospel Primary School.  The students are being led by the Head of School, Ms. Sereima Waqalevu.  
<br/>I noticed two faces sitting amongst the students, one is Mr. Nata and then there is another one right 
<br/>at  the  back,  maybe  they  are  part-time  teachers  in  this  school.    You  are  most  welcome  to  your 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every time I pass students, like yourself, I wonder what we have been doing in Parliament to 
<br/>ensure that there will be job opportunities available for you in the not too distant future.  That is the 
<br/></span><span>role of your Parliament, students - to make laws, change the laws and even repeal the laws, that is 
<br/></span><span>our core function.  We wish you well in this year’s school work.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/>notice to preside over the election of the Chairperson accordingly at their next meeting in this second

<div><span>Honourable Members, the Business Committee has also unanimously agreed that all pending 
<br/>parliamentary business  from the last session of Parliament will be reinstated so that the Standing 
<br/>Committees can continue from where they left off before Prorogation.  For the further information 
<br/>of honourable Members, there are 103 Annual Reports with respective six Standing Committees and 
<br/>12 Committee Reports pending debate in Parliament.
