<div><span>REINSTATEMENT OF BILL – ORDER PAPER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pursuant to Standing Order 97, I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Heritage Bill be restored to the Order Paper.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing 
<br/>Order 97 primarily focuses on the procedure with respect to the reinstatement of  Bills to the Order 
<br/>Paper.   As honourable Members are aware, the Parliament had prorogued on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> December, 
<br/>2023.  During the Prorogation period, all Bills had passed which meant that all processes paused or 
<br/></span><span>come to a halt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 97(1) further provides that those Bills which had lapsed 
<br/>may proceed in the new session of Parliament at the stage they had reached in the previous session 
<br/>by  resolution  of  Parliament  in  restoring  the  Bills  to  the  Order  Paper.    Therefore,  this  is  purely  a 
<br/>procedural motion which is necessary so as to allow Parliament to undertake or continue with its 
<br/>mandate to legislate, to make and pass laws; a core Parliamentary function which is entrenched under

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 46 of the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the time of Prorogation, there was only one Bill that had lapsed and this 
<br/>was the Heritage Bill (Bill No. 25 of 2023). With the reinstatement of the Heritage Bill, Parliament 
<br/>and the respective Standing Committee would be able to proceed immediately where they left off.   
<br/>This would further mean that Parliament and the Standing Committees should be able to continue to 
<br/>undertake their legislative, representative and oversight functions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  reiterate  that  this  is  merely  a  procedural  motion,  which  is 
<br/>necessary to allow the lapsed Bill to be reinstated and restored to the Order Paper.   I do commend this 
<br/>motion to Parliament and, I hereby seek the full support from all honourable Members to approve the 
<br/>motion before this august Parliament as it is imperative for Parliament and its Standing Committees to 
<br/>fulfil their legislative, representative and oversight functions.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion.  There being none, and now I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>further comments to add.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
