<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE  
<br/>HOUSING AUTHORITY 2016 AND 2017 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Housing Authority 2016 and 2017 Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports which was tabled on 31st August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V. B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as a Member moving the motion, 
<br/>I would like to make brief contribution to the review on the Housing Authority 2016 and 2017 Annual 
<br/>Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, firstly I wish to convey my appreciation to the honourable Members 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament and all their efforts in 
<br/>scrutinising and compiling the Report which was tabled in August of last year.  I also wish the current 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  the  Committee  the  very  best  in  their  deliberations  in  the  new  term  of 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the year 2017 has been another progressive year for the Authority 
<br/>recording a surplus of $1.7 million in comparison to $1.5 million recorded in 2016.  The financial 
<br/>performance drivers were revenue from sale of lots and interest income for mortgage loan portfolio.  
<br/>A total of 107 lots in 2017 compared to 381 lots were sold in 2016, 19 customers were assisted under 
<br/>the  Social  Housing  Policy  Scheme  during  the  year.  This  scheme  is  directed  to  assist  qualifying 
<br/>customers who are in financial distress and finding difficulty in maintaining their repayments over 
<br/>the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  total  customer  debt  forgiven  in  2017  was  $0.6  million.    The 
<br/>Committee  had  noted  that  the  major  challenges  facing  the  Housing  Authority  is  the  provision  of 
<br/>housing for the low-income families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Authority  had  strengthened  its  land  and  housing  development  division  and  going 
<br/>forward, it intends to pursue design and building initiatives. This initiative aims to save customers 
<br/>time and effort in constructing their homes after they have purchased lots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Housing Authority strives to ensure that Fijians have access to 
<br/>affordable and quality housing for their families.  It has set a new platform and strategic direction 
<br/>that will guide it towards achieving its vision of providing affordable homes for all Fijians.  The 
<br/>Committee has highlighted its findings for the Authority’s financial and operational performance for 
<br/>2016 and 2017 and subsequently made recommendations to improve the overall performance and 
<br/>delivery of the Housing Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion. I have a list that has four names;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Review Report-HA 2016 &amp; 2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>603 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to contribute briefly to the motion 
<br/>before Parliament for debate on the review of the Housing Authority 2016 and 2017 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the work done by the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament; the Minister for Health and 
<br/>Medical  Services  (honourable  Dr.  Ratu  Atonio  Lalabalavu);  honourable  Alipate  Nagata,  former 
<br/>Members of Parliament – Mrs. Salote Radrodro and Mr. George Vegnathan and the Committee was 
<br/>chaired by myself in the effort of putting this Report together and tabled it to Parliament in August 
<br/>2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Housing Authority strives to ensure that Fijians have access to 
<br/>decent, affordable and quality housing for their families as provided under Section 35 of the 2013 
<br/>Fijian Constitution. The major challenges facing the Housing Authority is to provide housing that 
<br/>low-income  families  can  afford.    As  such  the  Authority  has  strengthened  its  land  and  housing 
<br/>development  division  and  going  forward  it  intends  to  pursue  design  and  build  initiatives.  This 
<br/>initiative aims to save customers time and effort in constructing their homes after they have purchased 
<br/>lots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Housing Authority operated in a very competitive home loan 
<br/>market with other financial institutions offering Home Loan Packages at affordable rates.  With the 
<br/>initial  vision  to  provide  affordable  housing  for  low-income  earners  in  urban  centres  who  could 
<br/>otherwise be unable to ensure to secure our permanent residence for themselves, and the Authority 
<br/>has in recent years expanded itself to include mortgage financing for middle to high income earners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Committee  had  identified  key  findings  and  therefore  made 
<br/>recommendations that would assist the Authority for further improvement of its work.   I wish the 
<br/>management, Board Members and the staff of Housing Authority well to continue fulfilling its role 
<br/>and provide better services to all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there has just been a little bit of a 
<br/>reshuffle, I beg your indulgence.  The honourable Minister will be speaking next followed by the 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar and then honourable Mosese Bulitavu and the final speaker will be the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the review of the 
<br/>Housing Authority 2016 and 2017 Annual Reports which was tabled on 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022.  Before I 
<br/>proceed, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to join my fellow honourable parliamentarians to express 
<br/>my wishes to our fellow Hindu brothers and sisters – happy </span><span>Ram</span><span> </span><span>Navami</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the previous and current honourable 
<br/>Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  on  their  review  and  recommendations 
<br/>pertaining  to  the  2016  and  2017  Housing  Authority  Annual  Reports.  Also,  I  would  like  to 
<br/>acknowledge the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, management and staff of Housing of Authority 
<br/>on their commitment for their service in Fiji’s longest serving housing institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, from the outset, I would like to ask a very, very important question, 
<br/></span><span>that is, has the Housing Authority delivered its mandate as stipulated in the Housing Act of 1955?  
<br/>Despite lots of success stories of families and individuals who have benefitted on all the housing 
<br/>initiatives that were provided by Housing Authority, there are a lot of improvements that are required 
<br/>in terms of supply of affordable housing to meet the increasing demand for people residing in the 
<br/>urban areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>604 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Review Report-HA 2016 &amp; 2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  urban  drift,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  is  a  real  issue  in  our  country.    The  demand  for 
<br/>housing in urban areas has been increasing and based on estimates provided by Housing Authority is 
<br/>around close to 6,000.  So that is indeed a big demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, for the past eight years, even though Housing Authority has done 
<br/>its best to produce and delivered some new developments, there still is a lot of work needed to be 
<br/>done.  Further to that, as we speak, there are five housing projects around the country with a total 
<br/>cost of around $74 million that are currently put on hold from 2019. These are projects that have 
<br/>been assigned to  the  International  Financial Corporation of the World Bank who has been  a lead 
<br/>adviser for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects from 2019. If you look at the cost involved, 
<br/>Housing  Authority  to  maintain  this  cost  them  close  to  $1  million  annually  to  maintain  all  these 
<br/>projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics have been meeting with International Financial Corporation this 
<br/>year to try and move their process forward and we are hoping that it is going to positively impact the 
<br/>need to provide affordable housing to all the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also note, Madam Deputy Speaker, on a very important issue, a recommendation that was 
<br/>put forward in this Report which states the legislation of the merger between Public Rental Board 
<br/>and Housing Authority. This is something that was not done by the last Government.  The Public 
<br/>Rental Board has changed office – moved from Raiwaqa to the Head Office of Housing Authority in 
<br/>2019  (that  is  good)  but  there  was  no  amendment  to  the  legislation  to  try  and  merge  these  two 
<br/>institutions.  It is good but there was no review of the legislation, there was no decision to try and 
<br/>merge these two institutions. The Coalition Government is currently in the process of attempting to 
<br/>review the merger of the two institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue that was raised is for the Authority to revisit the Village Housing Loan Scheme 
<br/>that was suspended by the Authority in  2016.  There are a lot of  success stories behind  this loan 
<br/>product, Madam Deputy Speaker.  A lot of villages around the country, in the Northern and mostly 
<br/>from the Western Division that have benefitted from this Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been liaising with Housing Authority to try and revisit the whole package again, 
<br/>even though some of these Schemes have been classified as non-performing loans under the Housing 
<br/>Authority Lending Portfolio, but we still feel that there is a need to revisit or maybe repackage the 
<br/>products that are going to benefit those Village Housing Schemes that have the servicing capability 
<br/>to service the loans that they have borrowed from Housing Authority.  Some of these villagers have 
<br/>been  assisted  with  the  construction  of  their  homes,  the  construction  of  the  village  halls,  even  the 
<br/>construction of their Church.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  will  continue  to  work  with  Housing  Authority  to 
<br/>deliver its mandatory role and serve effectively in the housing sector so that we are able to move and 
<br/>will be able to provide more affordable housing to the people of Fiji.  Thank you, Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, and I fully endorse the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Report and particularly on the recommendations that are made within the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee made four recommendations and I will comment on all four.  Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, we all agree that Housing Authority’s work is cut-out to provide affordable housing to low- 
<br/>income earners.  A new thinking was needed to change the way Housing Authority was delivering 
<br/>its mandate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Review Report-HA 2016 &amp; 2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>605 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Authority relied on the borrowing portfolio through interest to generate some money 
<br/>so that they can manage the Office.  And if you look at the borrowing loan portfolio, in 2017, it was 
<br/>around $100 million. So, that means the money is locked up. So, where is the money for them to go 
<br/>ahead and develop new sites? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some changes were required in the thinking and during my term, we had discussions with a 
<br/>number of banks that were willing to give loan at the same interest rate, so it was a matter of just 
<br/>transferring those loans to those banks so that we free up the money and they can use that money for 
<br/>development work.  So that was something that we had discussed and still pending because at the 
<br/>end of the day, it is the Board that makes the decision, and not the Ministry or the Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Recommendations 1 and 2 are interconnected, as I have said, setting 
<br/>the direction for Housing Authority to use PPP model, to provide affordable housing at six sites. As 
<br/>I have heard from the honourable Minister that these projects were on hold, it was never on hold.  
<br/>The work continued behind the scenes.  The IFC was providing those documentation, contacting the 
<br/>players because they are the ones who will be advertising, et cetera, and not the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, because of COVID-19 there was further delay, the experts were not able to come over 
<br/>and I have done this explanation previously in Parliament as well. That was the main reason, but I 
<br/>am very happy that the honourable Prime Minister has gone ahead and signed the agreement with 
<br/>IFC to progress the work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is to be noted that the work with IFC started around 2018-2019 and IFC, as the advisor had 
<br/>to  provide  that  information  to  Housing  Authority  and  assist    them  in  that  way  because  Housing 
<br/>Authority has never ever done strata apartments. What they had done was just developed the land, 
<br/>divide it into pieces and sell it off.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we had to go into another direction because once you give those land away, you do not 
<br/>know what kind of houses will come up, or the other issue is that land is scarce and we do not want 
<br/>to just give away land, particularly in valuable areas. So, the idea was to build up strata apartments 
<br/>where people can own a unit and they can sell that unit whenever they like.  So, that was the intention 
<br/>of this particular project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it took a while for Housing Authority, as I have said, to think outside 
<br/>the box, particularly when the discussions were going on because this is what they did best  - just 
<br/>divide the land and sell it off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But when we started talking about strata apartments and shifting the borrowing portfolio to 
<br/>some extent to the banks so that the money can be freed up for the development work, it was very 
<br/>difficult for them to accept because change is always difficult. It was very difficult but over a period 
<br/>of time with IFC involved, that shift did take place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Recommendation  3,  we  must  look  at  the  history  to  understand  why  PRB  was  made  a 
<br/>standalone entity and why PRB needs to merge with Housing Authority. The operational merger of 
<br/>the Housing Authority and PRB brings in many advantages. We are talking about saving money and 
<br/></span><span>that is one way of saving money. We can not only save the costs but also provide access to funds and 
<br/></span><span>new technology.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PRB is in the rental area, Housing Authority is in the development area.  It is no point 
<br/>when you have a set of people with PRB who will be going out, building structures so that they can 
<br/>rent it out whereas Housing Authority can build those structures -  they have access to consultants, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>606 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Review Report-HA 2016 &amp; 2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contractors, so it is better utilised that way.  If the structures are made by Housing Authority and just 
<br/>given to PRB and they look after the tenancy aspect of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there are other services carried out by both organisations that can 
<br/>be consolidated. For example, IT services and finance services can be consolidated.  So, Housing 
<br/>Authority  can  provide  additional  services,  for  example,  Legal,  Internal  Audit,  Risk,  Land  and 
<br/>Housing Development, to PRB.  So, it is not prudent for PRB to engage in the construction of rental 
<br/>flats, as I had mentioned earlier on, because that expertise actually lies with Housing Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on economies of scale, the cost of construction can come down if Housing Authority 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>builds homes and rental flats that can be managed by PRB, so that was the whole idea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, history will tell you that PRB was always part of Housing Authority.  
<br/>However, in 1989, Fiji saw the biggest corruption in the Housing Authority which resulted in the 
<br/>separation of PRB from Housing Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PRB was also mandated to sell its rental properties to assist the servicing of inherited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debt of around $19 million, transferred from Housing Authority to PRB. So, what did PRB do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, from 1993, PRB had sold 226 flats in high-demand areas, such as 
<br/>Grantham Road, Kia Street, Vatuwaqa, Nadera, Newtown and Makoi Estate, for a mere $3.2 million. 
<br/>Can you imagine if you build these structures now, how much it is going to cost us? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  basis  for  the  merger  of  PRB  and  Housing  Authority  is  the 
<br/>recommendation  made  in  the  2011  National  Housing  Policy  Framework.  So,  it  was  just  the 
<br/>implementation of a policy document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  another  legacy  of  the  Bainimarama  Government  was  the 
<br/>introduction and implementation of the Social Housing Policy in 2011, to assist Fijians who had paid 
<br/>more than the </span><span>principal</span><span> loan amount but faced genuine hardship.  This Policy assisted 405 households 
<br/>at a cost of $6.9 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016-2017, 39 Fijians were assisted under this particular Policy.  During 2016, Housing 
<br/>Authority completed 263 fully serviced lots in Wainibuku with 17 lots reserved for strata units, and 
<br/>the strata unit here is for the rental apartments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of Matavolivoli,  Nepani  was  under  development.    A total  of 771 loans  were 
<br/>approved at the value of $32 million. So, 2016-2017 were very good two years where a lot of work 
<br/>took place at Housing Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  2017,  groundbreaking  ceremony  was  held  at  Tavakubu  Subdivision  which  is  now 
<br/>complete and Davuilevu Subdivision, and for the first time, a reduced interest rate of 3.95 percent 
<br/>was introduced in 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, the owners had to pay an interest of about 11.5 percent and then there was a slight 
<br/></span><span>reduction to 7, 9, then 7 then 5, and finally we were able to achieve a lower interest rate.  And how 
<br/></span><span>we were able to achieve that was Housing Authority borrowing the money at 1 percent from Reserve 
<br/>Bank of Fiji and passing it on to the consumers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my contribution this afternoon will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very short, and I will be focusing only on landowners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Review Report-HA 2016 &amp; 2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>607 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all I would like to thank Housing Authority in the last few years for partnering with 
<br/>the First Home Buyers Scheme and that was a FijiFirst programme that has allowed the landowners 
<br/>to offer their land for development and also in the overall goal of helping Fijians own affordable 
<br/>homes and the landowners play a very important role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  failed  to  acknowledge  the  landowners  that  worked  closely  with 
<br/>Housing  Authority  -  the  iTLTB,  Methodist  Church  of  Fiji  and  the  State.    These  are  the  biggest 
<br/>landowners that offer land to Housing Authority in their various roles.  Without the land, you cannot 
<br/>build the house and that is very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we look at the benefits that come down to iTLTB to the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, it is very important. 
<br/>They also move out into other ventures, businesses and other investments when they give their land. 
<br/>Some of the landowners in Nasekula, Labasa, </span><span>Mataqali  Navurevure</span><span>, they are the landowners for the 
<br/>Tuatua Housing and Covata Housing.  I think they have just opened a groundbreaking project in June 
<br/>2022 but, again, we urge landowners all around Fiji to continue offer Crown land that is available for 
<br/>housing and also help into solving housing problems in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I have a problem with Recommendation 4 and that is the Village Housing Scheme.  
<br/>From what transpired in the Committee Verbatim, a question that was asked by honourable Salote 
<br/>Radrodro and answered by Mr. Peni Verevakabau, in the context that they work as a group through 
<br/>iTLTB, the concept is from iTLTB, but what I am trying to understand here whether this particular 
<br/>house block was in the village or is in a lease outside of the village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  problem  that  some  will  probably  find  out  and  that  could  arise  because  most  village 
<br/>reserve are village reserve and how do you recover if some do have mortgages.  It is different from 
<br/>when you have an independent title and the title is for the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> and the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> is the owner of 
<br/>that joint partner in development, that would be different.  How can you recover if say the title owner 
<br/>decides to sell the lot without building the house, the concept with iTLTB, whatever the sale price is, 
<br/>25 percent is chargeable by iTLTB and that is the same concept that Housing Authority is trying to 
<br/>adopt as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, again, for the landowners, thank you very much and also the FijiFirst Government for 
<br/>opening up this particular programme that has enabled landowners to benefit.  Most of the time, we 
<br/>talk about the FijiFirst Government leaving the landowners behind, but we see that even Housing 
<br/>Authority  and  other  housing  schemes  and  development,  the  landowners  have  benefited  through 
<br/>housing  schemes,  also  lucrative  money  from  the  land  leases,  as  well  as  land  rental.    That  has 
<br/>empowered the landowners, moving forward, to venture into other business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Thank  you  very  much,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  all  those 
<br/>contributors to the debate and also the Members of the Committee and the previous Members of the 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Housing Authority stories of success and we must continue.  All 
<br/>Governments are mandated by the Constitution that we now have, and the Constitution succeeds to 
<br/>ensure the provision of affordable housing for all Fijians, particularly those living in the peri-urban 
<br/></span><span>areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as I looked around the Chamber here, I see that some of us have 
<br/>grown up in those semi-informal, some informal and even in housing areas around the major urban 
<br/>centres.    The  honourable  Bia,  sitting  at  the  back  there,  in  Newtown;  the  honourable  Tabuya; 
<br/>honourable Usamate in Laqere area, those of us that grow up in the </span><span>Na i ka Tolu </span><span>area with honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tuinaceva; so, it is a success  story.  Some of us moved into informal or semi-informal, and then 
<br/>ended up owning our own lots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  remember  when  my  father  and  I  bought  the  land,  I  mentioned  this  when  I  was  last  in 
<br/>Parliament on the Opposition side, and we had to rush to buy the house before I got commissioned 
<br/>because once I was commissioned, we would have been over the Housing Authority threshold and 
<br/>would not qualify then for Housing Authority loan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then I looked at the threshold and try to relate it to the $50,000 that we now have, as one of 
<br/>the  thresholds  in  the  Public  Private  Partnership  Programme  (PPP)  that  Government  had  recently 
<br/>approved and noted the $50,000 income for the household, and I tried to relate that to my father’s 
<br/>income when we got the loan.  Then I looked up what the current salary for Head Teachers in schools 
<br/>is right now - the average is $51,000.  My father was then a Head Teacher of a primary school, so if 
<br/>he had been promoted or if I had gotten my commission, we would not have qualified.  We bought 
<br/>that house from a Mr. Dug Bajan Sharma who were then the living in Canada.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  was  a  programme  or  project  developed  by  Housing  Authority  at  that  time,  it  was  a 
<br/>Borrow and Build Scheme. So, we have to borrow the money and build our own house, according to 
<br/>the specifications given out by Housing Authority so that they conform with the requirements of the 
<br/>City Council.  We mixed our concrete and build our own building blocks and we built it according 
<br/>to the City Council specifications.  We bought it for $5,400.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I came back from Lebanon in 1981, the outstanding amount was $5,460.  A few months 
<br/>of  repayment  were  late  so  the  loan  went  up  by $60.  I  do  not  know  whether  the  programme  then 
<br/>ensured perpetual loan, whether you would be paying off your loan right through your whole life.  If 
<br/>that was the programme, then I hope we are not doing it this time.  I hope people will be able to pay 
<br/>off their loan quickly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, that difficult or the hard story, that house was built with a loan of $5,400 is now 
<br/>worth $430,000.  Let us hope that as we move from the rural area to the urban areas, there is a need 
<br/>for this, and we will continue to improve on what our predecessors had done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  our  discussion  on  the  PPP,  I  had  asked  whether  we  can  develop  something  similar  for 
<br/>villages close to the cities and the towns where we can do the buildings in the villages rather than 
<br/>wait for those living in villages to move into the cities and towns and live in semi-formal or informal 
<br/>settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that way, we stem the rural-urban flow of the population.  We can do that, and I am asking 
<br/>the honourable Minister responsible, “Let us look at that”.  With improved houses in the villages so 
<br/>that those of you near the cities and towns do not move into towns and stay in better houses in the 
<br/>villages with better facilities, better amenities, so that we prevent the need for people to move into 
<br/>informal settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There used to be a stigma.  When we went to Church on Sunday, “</span><span>Qori, qori, o iratou na 
<br/>gone ni Raiwasa.” </span><span>The people were expecting us to start a fight after Church.  That is the sort of 
<br/></span><span>stigma that developed with us living in informal settlements at the time.  I hope we can do this and 
<br/></span><span>continue to improve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  moving  towards  this  and  yesterday  I  went  to  have  my  glasses  fixed.    Honourable 
<br/>Tabuya realised that I had read a sentence twice and said, “Oh, you are tired, Sir.  You better go and 
<br/>rest.”  Instead of going to rest, I went to fix my glasses. The young doctor there is from Kerala in 
<br/>India.  I asked him, “Where are you from?”   He said, “I am from Kerala.”  I said, “Oh, I know your

<div><span>city, it is a big city.”  There are a lot of fishermen there with fishing settlements and also a lot of 
<br/>informal settlements.   But  almost  everyone who lives around and travel  around those areas  came 
<br/>from a village.  So, everyone who are in informal settlements had a house in the village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same applies here for us in Fiji.  I have a modest house in the village, and I also have a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>house here in Suva, but we started with a Housing Authority loan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we continue to develop this Programme, I am sure we are looking after the new generation 
<br/>of  politicians.    When  I  looked  at  the  honourable  Speaker  before  the  break  and  now  replaced  by 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, he also grew up in a housing estate.  I think there are some more of us.  The 
<br/>stigma is no longer there, in fact, we are proud that we have come through that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of the furnace of informal settlements, have grown champions for the nation like all of 
<br/>us here and we must continue to develop the breathing ground for future champions and future leaders 
<br/>and make it better so that when we look back, “Ah, we did that for them”.
