<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE  
<br/>PUBLIC RENTAL BOARD 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of the Public Rental Board 2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was tabled on 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as a Member moving the motion, I 
<br/>would like to make a brief contribution on the review of the 2018 Public Rental Board Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would, firstly, convey my appreciation to the former Members of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for their scrutiny and compilation of this Report which 
<br/></span><span>was tabled in August last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, as part of the scrutiny process,  the Committee had requested for 
<br/>public hearing and also received written responses on the issues identified by the Committee, which 
<br/>were then clarified by the Public Rental Board.

<div><span> Review Report - PRB 2018 Annual Report           
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  year  2018  marked  Public  Rental  Board’s  29  years  of  operation.    The  year  in  review 
<br/>mainly  focused  on  planning  and  re-strategising  to  deliver  on  Government’s  vision  of  providing 
<br/>affordable, quality and appropriate rental housing for all Fijians.  As such, the Board focussed its 
<br/>efforts on developments to deliver one of the most basic needs to low and middle income families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, despite the challenges, the Board recorded a total comprehensive 
<br/>income of $764,772 in 2018, as compared to $851,207 in 2017.  The Board also implemented the 
<br/>Job  Evaluation  recommendation  for  its  staff  members,  which  was  undertaken  in  2017  by 
<br/>PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Board  continue  to  promote  and  sustain  community 
<br/>developments  through  estate  meetings,  community  awareness  and  estate  beautifications.    The 
<br/>Committee has highlighted its findings  for the Board’s financial  and operational  performance  for 
<br/>2018, and subsequently made recommendations to improve the overall performance and the service 
<br/>delivery of the Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Committee  commends  the  team  of  dedicated  and  motivated 
<br/>individuals who have worked together to enhance service delivery for the Public Rental Board which 
<br/>remains a significant strategy in achieving the Board’s vision to be the leading provider of affordable, 
<br/>quality and appropriate rental housing for its tenants. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion.  I have a list of four speakers and they are in this order: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Premila Kumar; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs concerning the review of the Public Rental Board 2018 
<br/>Annual Report.  I would like to commend the Committee and the Chairperson for a very thorough 
<br/>and delightful analysis of the Report including the former Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I noticed some issues that were commonly found in all our Public 
<br/>Rental  Board  flats  around  Fiji  which  included  overcrowding,  rise  in  criminal  activities  involving 
<br/>youth and other sorts of crime such as drug trafficking which is prevalent in our society nowadays.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also noted the recommendations of the Committee particularly </span><span>Recommendation 2,</span><span> and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That  the  Public  Rental  Board  work  closely  with  Land  Owning  Units  and  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders to identify available land on which to construct rental properties.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister as well for the very welcoming move 
<br/></span><span>that he had explained in Parliament this afternoon particularly in relation to overcrowding especially 
<br/>in our Public Rental Board’s premises. It is mostly because of the rural to urban drift; I really like the 
<br/>comments made the honourable Prime Minister as to the move that will be made by the Government.   
<br/>On that same note, Madam Deputy Speaker, I also like this recommendation because it will assist 
<br/>landowners especially for those who are close to our cities and towns. An example of this is the recent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Review Report - PRB 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>611 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development which has been done in Tavua by the Housing Authority in consultation with iTLTB in 
<br/>consultation with the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  also  noted  from  the  findings  of  the  Report  and  I  ask  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Housing as well, if we can encourage our unused land to be used by Housing Authority which will 
<br/>in  turn assist the landowners too.  As we all know, a major problem  in  our  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>community is 
<br/>funding to start capital projects.  With that being discussed by the honourable Prime Minister and 
<br/>also the move that the previous Government made to landowners such as in Vuda and Tavua, this 
<br/>will assist landowners in a big way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the strata titles and strata units which the former honourable Minister of Housing 
<br/>had already elaborated and also the honourable Minister for Housing, this is also a good move in 
<br/>relation to addressing issues which comes up in the Committee analysis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  relation  to  the  crime  rates  arising  from  Public  Rental  Board 
<br/>estates and properties around Fiji.  Since this is a 2018 Annual Report, I believe by now there have 
<br/>been  some  solutions  already  undertaken  in  those  areas.    I  am  quite  delighted  to  see  that  the 
<br/>stakeholders such as the religious organisations and councillors, I have noted from the findings, it is 
<br/>an  ongoing  counselling.  I  believe  that  will  reduce  these  issues  along  this  line,  Madam  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker.  On that note, I commend the motion before Parliament and I fully support it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the review of the 
<br/>Public  Rental  Board  2018  Annual  Report  which  was  tabled  on  31</span><span>st</span><span>  August,  2022  and  commend 
<br/>recommendations by the previous Committee and the current Standing Committee on Social Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  Board,  General  Manager, 
<br/>management and staff of the Public Rental Board for their commitment and service to Fiji’s longest 
<br/>serving Public Rental housing institution. There are six recommendations that were recommended 
<br/>and it is  pleasing  to  note that most of these recommendations  have been addressed by the Public 
<br/>Rental Board.  I also welcome the proposal by honourable Niudamu on Recommendation 6 which is 
<br/>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That the Public Rental Board consider partnering with relevant stakeholders in addressing 
<br/>social issues of unemployment and crime rates in PRB properties.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think until recently there were few cases involving some of the youths that reside in these 
<br/>estates and the PRB had also gone to the extent or even installing CCTV cameras on some of the 
<br/>estates and some PRB institutions especially in the Suva area. I was there about four months ago just 
<br/>to go and visit and see for myself what were some of the improvements that have been done on these 
<br/>estates.  I went to Mead Road in Nabua and I could see a change in the atmosphere, even I could see 
<br/>that the youths have taken the initiative to clear the area.  Even some of the residents the youth have 
<br/>come to me and request my assistance how they could be assisted, for the youth to be involved in 
<br/>activities like sports. I think for Mead Road there is a rugby league team and the PRB officials have 
<br/>also officers that serve all the residents around those areas and they also have Committees that look 
<br/>out for the interest of those blocks around those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  1989  Government  enacted  the  Decree  to  amend  Housing  Act 
<br/>[Cap 267] allowing the establishment of the Public Rental Board to take over the Rental Housing 
<br/>Programmes in Fiji.  In addition to that, Government made a commitment of providing annual rental 
<br/>subsidies to the Public Rental Board to assist the low-income earning families.  To this date, PRB is 
<br/>managing 1,674 rental flats in 21 estates, out of which 11 is from the Central Division, six from the 
<br/>Western Division and four from the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>612 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - PRB 2018 Annual Report           
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, something should be recommended by the Committee, the provision 
<br/>of more rental accommodation to low-income families.  Pleasing to note that PRB has been working 
<br/>with the iTaukei Land Trust Board and the Ministry of Lands in securing more land to construct more 
<br/>rental housing units.  Since February 2023, 30 acres of land was offered by iTLTB in three different 
<br/>locations – 10 acres in Navua, 10 acres in Waila in Nausori and 10 acres in Korovou, Tailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, another key challenge for PRB is the lack of incentives for sitting 
<br/>tenants to graduate to home ownership.  In the last five years, only 40 out of 1,674 have migrated to 
<br/>home ownership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry will be closely working with the Public Rental Board 
<br/>in exploring incentives for more sitting tenants to graduate to home ownership. One of the options 
<br/>that we have asked the Public Rental Board to explore is for them graduate into something like a rent 
<br/>to own scheme - while you are renting, you can also own the flats.  For some, families have been 
<br/>there for more than 20 years to 30 years. This is something new that we are trying to explore with 
<br/>the Public Rental Board. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry will continue to work with the Public 
<br/>Rental Board with the provision of public rental housing and simultaneously encourage graduation 
<br/>to home ownership for its sitting tenants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have been told that dinner is ready 
<br/>in the Big Committee Room, however in the interest of getting the debate or keeping with the flow, 
<br/>I am going to ask that we continue and debate to the end of this motion.  With that in mind, I would 
<br/>like to ask the honourable Premila Kumar to make her interventions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the recommendations and I also 
<br/>thank  the  Standing Committee  on  the Review  of  the  Public  Rental  Board’s  2018  Annual  Report. 
<br/>These are all valid recommendations made by the Committee to strengthen Public Rental Board so 
<br/>that it can serve its mandate better and address the challenges faced by this institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Public Rental Board is legislated mandate is to provide public rental 
<br/>housing to low-income earners and estate services. We all know with tenants comes tenancy issues 
<br/>which the Public Rental Board has to manage for the sake of other tenants who are residing in that 
<br/>area,  and  often  you  get  complaints  from  elderly  citizens,  children  and  parents.  Parents  are 
<br/>complaining children cannot study in that environment, elderlies are complaining they cannot sleep 
<br/>at night because of very high noise pollution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1</span><span>
<br/>That  the  Public  Rental  Board  strengthen  its  profiling  and  monitoring  of  customers  to 
<br/>effectively enforce tenancy terms and conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Public Rental Board faces a mammoth task in enforcing tenancy conditions. I must say 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this because of political and societal pressure, we have to admit this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Often housing issues have become so political that we see politicians taking pictures with 
<br/>those who are legally evicted. For example, we saw honourable Tabuya doing that to increase hope 
<br/></span><span>amongst  those  that  were  legally  evicted  by  the  rightful  owner.  Photo  opportunity  and  political 
<br/></span><span>mileage should never be used.  The example is Veiraisi in Nasinu where the landlord was willing to 
<br/>relocate the tenants. They found a place, they were willing to relocate, the tenants did not move, they 
<br/>had the Court Order and therefore the tenants had to go but what do we see?  Political mileage out of 
<br/>someone’s sorrow.  Similarly, public sentiments are so high when people do not know the full story.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  That is what you want. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>

<div><span>          Review Report - PRB 2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>613 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you for telling us  that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ask an employee of Public Rental Board they will tell you, Deputy Madam Speaker, how 
<br/>difficult it is to enforced rules in those flats.  Then there are those who have a house in the village or 
<br/>elsewhere, but they rent. Some have actually lived in Public Rental Board flats, but they have a house 
<br/>elsewhere and there house is rented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other cases, tenants do not meet the criteria because the income level is higher but they still 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>live in those flats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, that is Public Rental Board and the board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Engage in criminal activities and we normally see that, the Mead Road Public Rental Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>flats are known for even murder, drug, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not hear such issues with Koroipita Housing Estate; that is what I wanted to tell you. 
<br/>They  also  provide  social  housing  to  low-income  earners.  The  answer  is  strict  monitoring  and 
<br/>enforcement.  Tenants know the rules and they are involved in enforcement. This is what happened 
<br/>at Koroipita.  Tenants are actually enforcing the rules. They are all involved in that and there is no 
<br/>political or societal interference. Those were big tenants, but we do not make a big story out of it. 
<br/>Koroipita Housing does its job based on fair system and trust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, whilst Public Rental Board assist the needy Fijians, we also have to 
<br/>encourage  them  to  progress.  We  have  to  learn  from  the  models  of  Koroipita  where  only  one 
<br/>generation is assisted, and the second generation has to progress and move out in time.  It is for this 
<br/>reason,  Ms.  Susan  Naidu,  Manager  of  Koroipita  Homes  in  Lautoka  was  appointed  as  a  Board 
<br/>Member so that she could work with PRB and make those changes within the organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span><span>The FijiFirst Government had offered numerous tax and duty concessions to encourage the 
<br/>private  sector  to  invest  in  the  housing  sector.    Incentives  were  announced  and  approved  during 
<br/>national budgets to encourage local private sector investment. For example, income tax exemption 
<br/>on profits of the entire project for multi-storey residential developments.  A 15 percent of the units 
<br/>in each of the first five floors are sold at a price of $300,000 or less.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Duty exemption on importation of capital equipment, plant and machinery for such projects. 
<br/>Income tax holiday on profits from the rental of private sector multi-unit rental housing developments 
<br/>for the duration of the entire PPP agreement with Government and tax exemption on entire developer 
<br/>profit and duty exemption on importation of materials, plant and machinery for business engaged in 
<br/>sub-division of lots for residential and commercial purposes.  Madam Deputy Speaker, a lot has been 
<br/>done in that area to entice the private sector to provide affordable rental units.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  congratulations  for  being  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chair. Last time when you got there, I was not here, so good to see you there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me begin by saying, the other day I was listening to the honourable Prime Minister very 
<br/>carefully when he related his own story and the messages that came out of it was very important and 
<br/>moving as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>614 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - PRB 2018 Annual Report           
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was also talking to him the other day, the honourable Minister talked about Hernando de 
<br/>Soto,  a  Peruvian  economist.  He  was  very  well  known  for  the  Economics  of  Informal  Sector  and 
<br/>Property Rights.  I was actually taken aback when the honourable Prime Minister said, “I have just 
<br/>finished reading his book.”  And one of the things that Hernando de Soto kind of innovated is, he 
<br/>was looking at all these informal sectors and for a long period of time people were living there and 
<br/>we have similar informal settlements here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at Sakoca and others where people are still not sure what they will do but over a 
<br/>period of time, Madam Deputy Speaker, they have built good houses. What he did was, the idea of 
<br/>property rights, the idea of owning a house is a very important confidence building.  This idea of 
<br/>ownership  of  homes  gives  people  that  exuberance  and  optimism  to  improve  their  own  living 
<br/>conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they gave them titles, wherever they were, big, small, it may sound a little bit unusual 
<br/>but the result of that was that over a period of time and suddenly the quality of housing, the quality 
<br/>of living in those informal settlements improved remarkably and that was considered to be a very, 
<br/>very  good  model  and  the  understanding  that  property  rights,  ownership,  title  can  create  a  lot  of 
<br/>entrepreneurship and good feelings amongst our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think honourable Premila Kumar is going away, but I will nonetheless say this, I think it is 
<br/>exactly quite cheap for her to say that honourable Tabuya was identified with the people who have 
<br/>been  evicted.  Whether  they  are  evicted  legally  or  illegally,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  does  not 
<br/>matter. compassion is still required.  If she was there, she was showing that compassion.  It is like 
<br/>saying to someone who has been evicted because he or she is not able to pay rent and you go and 
<br/>sympathize with the person, you are politicizing; that is a cheap shot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  let  me  come  back  to  the  Public  Rental  Board  and  listening  to  her,  she  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>complaining about what was happening in the Public Rental Board and what was happening there.   
<br/>They were there for the last 15 years, and she has been there for the last four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- She was the Minister! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The late Father Kevin Barr, may his soul rest in peace.  Father 
<br/>Kevin  Bar  did  so  much  for  this  country.    He  was  at  the  forefront,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  of 
<br/>addressing issues of poverty, housing because he understood how those who live in the low-income 
<br/>category feel about not being able to come out of poverty and live in a house in which they can call 
<br/>theirs.  The Lagilagi project was a good example of the failure of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular, honourable Bala is not here but Father Barr, Madam Deputy Speaker, related 
<br/>stories about how he was not only treated by the former Prime Minister but also by that Minister and 
<br/>the  Minister  himself  who  did  not  approve  the  timely  release  of  funds  and  that  project  is  still  not 
<br/>complete.  There are currently ongoing discussions with the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>and the Ministry of Housing to complete the Lagilagi State Project for the development of Jittu Estate. 
<br/>After Election in 2014, they were going around the country saying, “we will give you the blocks”.  
<br/>Honourable Bala actually went and numbered the houses in Lautoka before the elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Say it loud. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They went to Sakoca in 2018, did the same.  They went to 
<br/>Cunningham, they did the same and when the guy who was involved in it came out in our public 
<br/>meeting, he was not our supporter.  He did a video, he was reported to the Election office for raising 
<br/>an issue, so this is what they were doing. They were playing politics…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …and not dealing with the real issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  Government  and  our  honourable  Prime  Minister,  under  his 
<br/>leadership, we are committed to resolving the informal settlements and squatter settlements in the 
<br/>next 10 years because that is something that we believe was not…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- A Point of Order from honourable Premila Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, we already know our Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he just goes off the tangent, he has been misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  That  gentleman  was  reported  to  Elections  Office,  in  fact  that 
<br/>gentleman was making fun of the gay community and I think that was the reason why the matter was 
<br/>reported.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Misleading, thank you Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I was just saying, Madam Deputy Speaker, that he raised the 
<br/>issue publicly in three meetings where he accused the Minister, the former Prime Minister and the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government for lying during election campaign.  Madam Deputy Speaker, this is what they 
<br/>were doing during both the elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Stop lying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are not going to do that, Madam Deputy Speaker.  We are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not going to parade ourselves; we are not going to lie to the people in the informal settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You are lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Lagilagi project, again… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That was under a committee. Did you know that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Minister refused to release the grant on time, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the Opposition, I know that. Father Kevin Bar would not lie about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Investigate, they were doing deals outside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Point of Order. 
<br/>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Premila Kumar, your Point of Order.

<div><span> Review Report - PRB 2018 Annual Report           
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam  Deputy  Speaker, our Deputy  Prime Minister, he should be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honest with what he is saying in this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am still on a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He does not realise that whatever he is saying will be documented in the </span><span>Hansard Report</span><span>, 
<br/>again he is lying. He is just misleading Parliament by saying that the money was not released.  He 
<br/>does not know the full story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know the full story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You do not know the full story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have all the documentation 
<br/>from Father Kevin Bar, and I had raised it so it is not a lie.  It is the truth.  They know, Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, that they have really handled it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are complaining about what is happening in the Public Rental Board.  The subsidies that 
<br/>are there to help, we will have to probably review this.  At the moment, the rental subsidy is allocated 
<br/>to,  according to  the subsidy  criteria, based on the tenant’s weekly  gross  income, while the social 
<br/>subsidy is the difference between the market rent and the PRB maximum rent of $50.  If rent is more 
<br/>than $50, then the tenant is qualified to receiving that social subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last five years, $5.5 million was allocated for subsidy in the Public Rental Board and 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Housing  provided  very  good  details.    I  think he  is  on  top  of  what  is 
<br/>happening and some of the issues that are recurring within the Public Rental Board can be resolved 
<br/>through this careful revaluation of what the criteria is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Premila Kumar was saying  that we  cannot  do anything, there are people who 
<br/>should not there, the people who are not graduating, that is the issue I am trying to point out.  What 
<br/>were they doing all these years? That is something that our Government is going to tackle head on 
<br/>and I am confident that the honourable Minister for Housing will deal with that effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, thank you honourable Members for 
<br/>contributing to the debate.  I am going to ask the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/>Affairs to have her Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the 
<br/>honourable Members who contributed to  the debate and the our discussion this evening.    I thank 
<br/>those who spoke on the recommendations and also on issues regarding the Public Rental Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Madam Deputy Speaker, their comments is noted by the Committee and I have no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>further comments.
